right<00:01:59.909> from<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.180> unit<00:02:01.369> we<00:02:02.369> change<00:02:02.670> our<00:02:02.850> source

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
right from the unit we change our source

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.050 
right from the unit we change our source
we<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.750> go<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> tuner<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:05.070> pioneer<00:02:05.700> uses

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we can go to the tuner now pioneer uses

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.109 
we can go to the tuner now pioneer uses
a<00:02:06.090> super<00:02:06.420> tune<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.799> 3-2<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.190> tune<00:02:08.429> into<00:02:08.580> AM<00:02:08.910> and

a super tune or 3-2 to tune into AM and
FM<00:02:09.390> frequencies<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.709> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.860> get

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
FM frequencies so you're going to get

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
FM frequencies so you're going to get
higher<00:02:11.250> quality<00:02:11.310> sound<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.390> better

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
higher quality sound and better

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.020 
higher quality sound and better
reception

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
going to show us that we're looking at

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.180 
going to show us that we're looking at
the<00:03:22.220> albums<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.030> artist<00:03:23.360> has<00:03:23.769> and<00:03:24.769> then

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the albums that the artist has and then

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.470 
the albums that the artist has and then
further<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.060> show<00:03:26.209> us<00:03:26.329> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
further in is going to show us the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.170 
further in is going to show us the
tracks<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.739> choose<00:03:28.040> whichever<00:03:28.790> track

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
tracks so we can choose whichever track

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.960 
tracks so we can choose whichever track
that<00:03:29.750> we<00:03:29.870> would<00:03:30.049> like<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.730> we're<00:03:31.820> going<00:03:31.910> to

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
that we would like so we're going to

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.580 
that we would like so we're going to
change<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.570> one<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:33.049> hopefully

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
change it to this one and hopefully

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.530 
change it to this one and hopefully
we're<00:03:33.709> going<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.860> be<00:03:33.920> able<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.220> let<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.180> hear

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
we're going to be able to let you hear

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.030 
we're going to be able to let you hear
what<00:03:35.870> that<00:03:35.900> advanced<00:03:36.350> sound<00:03:36.560> achievable

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
what that advanced sound achievable

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.180 
what that advanced sound achievable
sounds<00:03:37.850> like<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.500> we're<00:03:39.620> going<00:03:39.739> to<00:03:39.829> turn<00:03:40.010> this

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
sounds like so we're going to turn this

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.490 
sounds like so we're going to turn this
up<00:03:40.370> and<00:03:40.640> I'm<00:03:41.450> going<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.660> hope<00:03:41.930> that<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
up and I'm going to hope that the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.979 
up and I'm going to hope that the
microphone<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.040> able<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> pick<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.579> up<00:03:43.989> so

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
microphone is able to pick this up so

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.630 
microphone is able to pick this up so
right<00:03:45.200> now<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.769> advanced<00:03:46.070> sound<00:03:46.340> retrieval

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
right now the advanced sound retrieval

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.780 
right now the advanced sound retrieval
is<00:03:46.880> off

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.640 

you<00:03:51.790> can<00:03:51.939> kind<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.269> hear<00:03:52.510> what<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.230> sounds<00:03:53.530> like

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:07.170 

and<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.769> is<00:03:59.829> step<00:04:00.700> one<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:06.489> then<00:04:06.909> we<00:04:07.030> go<00:04:07.120> to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
and this is step one and then we go to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.440 
and this is step one and then we go to
step<00:04:07.420> two<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.849> you're<00:04:09.849> able<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.239> big

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
step two and you're able to see a big

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.009 
step two and you're able to see a big
difference

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
difference

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.740 
difference
maybe<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.709> Northam<00:04:12.189> step<00:04:12.430> by<00:04:12.579> step<00:04:12.939> but

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
maybe not Northam step by step but

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.849 
maybe not Northam step by step but
you'll<00:04:13.900> definitely<00:04:14.049> be<00:04:14.379> able<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.620> hear<00:04:14.829> a

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
you'll definitely be able to hear a

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.490 
you'll definitely be able to hear a
difference<00:04:14.980> when<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.609> go<00:04:15.760> from<00:04:16.180> Step<00:04:16.959> two<00:04:16.989> of

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
difference when you go from Step two of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.300 
difference when you go from Step two of
the<00:04:17.739> ASR<00:04:18.220> down<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.959> step<00:04:20.169> 4<00:04:20.229> just<00:04:20.949> to<00:04:20.979> turn<00:04:21.160> it

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
the ASR down to step 4 just to turn it

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:29.820 
the ASR down to step 4 just to turn it
off

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.870 

so<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.860> hope<00:04:31.010> you're<00:04:31.220> able<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.370> pick<00:04:31.520> that<00:04:31.640> up<00:04:31.700> on

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
so I hope you're able to pick that up on

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.570 
so I hope you're able to pick that up on
microphone<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.740> yeah<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.070> difference<00:04:34.220> on

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
microphone but yeah the difference on

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.600 
microphone but yeah the difference on
the<00:04:35.090> sound<00:04:35.420> is<00:04:35.630> very<00:04:36.020> clear<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.620> it's<00:04:37.310> really

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
the sound is very clear and it's really

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.950 
the sound is very clear and it's really
able<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.910> restore<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> lot<00:04:38.450> of<00:04:38.570> those<00:04:38.690> lost

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
able to restore a lot of those lost

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.600 
able to restore a lot of those lost
frequencies<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.860> that's<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.340> technology

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
frequencies and that's the technology

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.880 
frequencies and that's the technology
behind<00:04:40.970> pioneers<00:04:41.480> advanced<00:04:42.320> sound<00:04:42.500> retrieval

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
behind pioneers advanced sound retrieval

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.950 
behind pioneers advanced sound retrieval
basically<00:04:43.640> when<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.820> compress<00:04:44.270> music<00:04:44.750> down

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
basically when you compress music down

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.500 
basically when you compress music down
it<00:04:45.200> loses<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.740> lot<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.100> frequencies<00:04:46.700> and

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
it loses a lot of the frequencies and

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.930 
it loses a lot of the frequencies and
the<00:04:47.600> higher<00:04:47.840> ends<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.350> so<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.280> quality<00:04:49.580> is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the higher ends and so the quality is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.410 
the higher ends and so the quality is
his<00:04:50.600> lost<00:04:50.900> hence<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.530> smaller<00:04:52.040> file<00:04:52.340> size<00:04:52.670> but

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
his lost hence a smaller file size but

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.510 
his lost hence a smaller file size but
what<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.690> ASR<00:04:54.110> does<00:04:54.320> is<00:04:54.530> going<00:04:54.860> to<00:04:54.980> restore

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
what the ASR does is going to restore

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280 
what the ASR does is going to restore
those<00:04:56.030> frequencies<00:04:56.630> that's<00:04:56.840> lost<00:04:57.050> in

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
those frequencies that's lost in

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.650 
those frequencies that's lost in
compression<00:04:57.680> when<00:04:58.370> it's<00:04:58.550> played<00:04:58.880> so<00:04:59.510> you're

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
compression when it's played so you're

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.870 
compression when it's played so you're
going<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.840> get<00:05:00.020> higher<00:05:00.890> quality<00:05:00.920> sound<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:01.790> a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
going to get higher quality sound in a

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.180 
going to get higher quality sound in a
higher<00:05:02.090> range<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.510> frequencies<00:05:03.020> basically<00:05:03.980> a

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
higher range of frequencies basically a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.940 
higher range of frequencies basically a
much<00:05:04.910> better<00:05:05.090> sound<00:05:05.480> when<00:05:06.170> you<00:05:06.440> enable<00:05:06.830> the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
much better sound when you enable the

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.010 
much better sound when you enable the
