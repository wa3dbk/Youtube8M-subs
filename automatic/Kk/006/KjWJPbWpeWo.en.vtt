00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.290
 Talk to you guys, Bruninho, your seven back. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 everything beauty good 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 in today's video we will give 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.660
 sequence to our transit series there. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
 This time to show you how. 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 buy that did not bind with the galvão 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.510
 banks do not know exactly how to 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.300
 finally pronounce that English punch 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.400
 electric I already showed you there 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.840
 the farm map at the time I made the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 first survivor video 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.610
 he was replacing the weather here in the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.300
 3d mode had not yet bumped into 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.649
 he even because he is well hidden 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.420
 but it is not difficult to conquer 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.610
 getting it is not hard to buy not 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 I took time to find out because I said 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 I hid my shack from my hiding place 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 the doorway to it is good 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 let's cut to the chase'll show 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.079
 how do you get the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 first thing we have to do 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 is to set up this little turbine here that the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 people here in the back room to the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.270
 turbine that generates power and once 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.039
 that we have this turbine 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 mounted, we'll start looking for 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.070
 a terrible one of the people that we use 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 in the bus 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.640
 So we'll open your doors. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 lines there that need this turbine 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 luckily I found first that 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.580
 in the first room sometimes come here at 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.979
 Sometimes you have to walk to the city. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.689
 to find this terrible and this 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.880
 little piece it that we use here in the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.630
 ceiling of the bus there to make a ceiling 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.400
 solar 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 here in this little piece that I'm going to show 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.770
 You now I'm going to start to 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 build here to show you that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 it is here that this piece in cash really 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.110
 It's from here that she is part of us. 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 will not build here but people 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.400
 lose the part and we'll need it 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 to buy the vote is not like I said 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.310
 Okay, I'm going to accelerate a 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 cut in the video to show exactly 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 where we got that good was a local 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.880
 that we will use this little piece is that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.220
 at the gas station is at the stop 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.460
 following soon then I'll open here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.610
 port where you have here the speedy glue has mp5 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.649
 I'm going on the other side of this case. 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.200
 room and up here and went to see a 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.020
 passage looks like a breathe 12 Indians 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.000
 I know how to exemplify it there 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 but anyway it's a little bit square there in the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.790
 ceiling and then we go up the terrace and gives 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.730
 face the bottle in chaos like you 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.590
 are you seeing something? 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.090
 A thousand points I 'm not against the moment 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.040
 still to buy 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.790
 I'll take you for a walk on the terrace 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.140
 but finally I'll add a little dot here already 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.790
 I'm going to show you how it's that. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.590
 it works 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.030
 Good guys are now at the end of the day. 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.190
 fourth round are seeing that I play a 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.230
 bit more than 6 thousand points 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.569
 I'll do it now in a last scrub 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.760
 a pet he and I go running there 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.799
 buy the bottle cores this is over 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.989
 that it will replace our good and 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.090
 naif is to replace in case our knife and 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.400
 stole and in the end if you want 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.310
 buy a better machete we will 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.980
 buy six thousand points and as I said 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.470
 this is this new equipment this 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.629
 new weapon and will make us 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.299
 kill a zombie invitation will settle in 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.640
 here ua until about a round 13 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.400
 face if I'm not mistaken round 13 in 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 Survival here in the snippet I did not test 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.569
 I confess I should have been tested for 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.420
 give you certainty but I believe 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.459
 that it is not different not because 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.400
 much like the way to survive and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.380
 from survival mode to 3d mode itself 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.720
 the difference is that the larger map all 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.660
 questions like I already explained to you 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.250
 see you there what is the hit one uncle in 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 featured in all clubs 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.139
 I'm going to play this neighbor round there. 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.739
 play some rounds there only with the 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:33.940
 friends only killing there with miller etec 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.709
 what they call né? 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.650
 Hey, man, I'll tell you, I recommend it. 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.169
 how much you use gao anoto is for 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.359
 replace your knife even uses 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.669
 he in the place of the ox naify this let 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.069
 buy steer ship to buy the ring that 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:51.099
 it is much better for some reasons 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.200
 the main one of them face is that it kills 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.880
 here is the snapshot and there is no time 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.769
 of reaction by a zombie 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.900
 so you do not take any hits when you 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.480
 approaching to disappear when doing what 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.090
 sometimes in the knife you still arrive took 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.049
 A slap all alone when you're killing 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.760
 a zombie 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.530
 It's not that it's too dangerous to take 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.599
 step further depending on how you 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.699
 you had you're already on fire 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.160
 had taken a few hits before 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.810
 and the other reason is that he 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.269
 A little more time doing this 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 that which is abominable to the 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.330
 ninth round on the tenth 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.860
 he already requires 2 21 horses and until the 13th 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.539
 but hey guys just wanted to show 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.849
 You know what we used to do to 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.229
 get this line that is very good and 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.030
 that had not yet discovered the way 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.759
 I'm going to end the video here. 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.650
 I'll ask you to rate the video and 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.780
