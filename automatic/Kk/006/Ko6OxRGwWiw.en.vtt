00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.139 
unrelated to him eventually winning for
much<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.770> i<00:01:01.800> think<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.460> i<00:01:02.789> said<00:01:03.030> i<00:01:03.059> think

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
much so i think that like i said i think

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.570 
much so i think that like i said i think
that<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> chance<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> way<00:01:05.189> bout<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
that there's a chance of way bout it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
that there's a chance of way bout it
possible<00:01:06.030> i<00:01:06.060> keeping<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.810> title<00:01:07.080> just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
possible i keeping all of a title just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.350 
possible i keeping all of a title just
because<00:01:07.890> they<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.030> where<00:01:09.240> they

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
because they do that you know where they

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
because they do that you know where they
I've<00:01:09.570> been<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.770> know<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.400> leave<00:01:11.850> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
I've been you know what we leave the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.850 
I've been you know what we leave the
knocked<00:01:12.210> over<00:01:12.479> March<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.590> did

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
knocked over March and then did

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.730 
knocked over March and then did
eventually<00:01:14.490> win<00:01:15.180> for<00:01:15.450> match<00:01:15.630> anyway<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
eventually win for match anyway so I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
eventually win for match anyway so I
think<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.460> don't<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
think that if they don't to do that and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230 
think that if they don't to do that and
so<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.500> does<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> big<00:01:20.100> fan<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.610> ways

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
so be it does have a big fan of ways

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.840 
so be it does have a big fan of ways

paper<00:02:44.700> feel<00:02:45.030> as<00:02:45.150> much<00:02:45.359> so<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.290> pretty

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
paper feel as much so that this pretty

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.180 
paper feel as much so that this pretty
much<00:02:46.709> goes<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.159> show<00:02:47.430> yet<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.629> really<00:02:49.260> they

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
much goes to show yet I really they

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.890 
much goes to show yet I really they
don't<00:02:50.220> hit<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.150> don't<00:02:51.329> really<00:02:51.540> have<00:02:51.659> faith

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
don't hit they don't really have faith

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.690 
don't hit they don't really have faith
in<00:02:52.079> him<00:02:52.170> for<00:02:52.290> paper<00:02:52.500> few<00:02:52.799> matches<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.459> some<00:02:53.670> of

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
in him for paper few matches or some of

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
in him for paper few matches or some of
the<00:02:53.790> line<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:53.970> don't<00:02:54.510> know<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.139> think<00:02:55.620> that's

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
the line I don't know but I think that's

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.039 
the line I don't know but I think that's
a<00:02:56.129> pretty<00:02:56.370> big<00:02:56.609> chance<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.480> winning<00:02:57.930> it

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
a pretty big chance of in winning it

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.890 
a pretty big chance of in winning it
because<00:02:58.799> they<00:02:59.040> seem<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.120> lot<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.359> faith

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
because they seem to have a lot of faith

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.710 
because they seem to have a lot of faith
in<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.230> massive<00:03:01.560> wrestler<00:03:02.129> so<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.569> know

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
know I think that that's a big chance

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.230 
know I think that that's a big chance
that<00:06:27.590> on<00:06:27.920> your<00:06:28.040> brain<00:06:28.280> could<00:06:28.580> win<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:28.970> title

that on your brain could win this title
yeah<00:06:29.540> I<00:06:29.750> think<00:06:30.140> that<00:06:30.380> they're<00:06:30.560> going<00:06:30.740> to

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.860 
yeah I think that they're going to

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.760 
yeah I think that they're going to
possibly<00:06:31.820> give<00:06:32.330> it<00:06:32.450> to<00:06:32.570> him<00:06:32.720> to<00:06:33.200> join<00:06:33.410> bring

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
possibly give it to him to join bring

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.290 
possibly give it to him to join bring
prestige<00:06:34.070> but<00:06:34.910> for<00:06:35.240> instance

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
prestige but for instance

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.290 
prestige but for instance
you<00:06:36.419> do<00:06:37.229> that<00:06:37.470> and<00:06:37.860> I'd<00:06:38.190> be<00:06:38.610> all<00:06:38.759> for<00:06:38.789> it<00:06:39.030> to<00:06:39.210> be

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
you do that and I'd be all for it to be

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.379 
you do that and I'd be all for it to be
honest<00:06:39.539> but<00:06:40.020> my<00:06:40.169> prediction<00:06:40.710> someday<00:06:41.190> I<00:06:41.400> put
