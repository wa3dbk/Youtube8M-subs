00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
one you know once you've done a few

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.509 
one you know once you've done a few
times<00:02:46.879> I'm<00:02:47.120> sure<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.390> get<00:02:47.480> used<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.519> no

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
times I'm sure you get used to it but no

00:02:49.519 --> 00:03:04.199 
times I'm sure you get used to it but no
I<00:02:49.549> wasn't

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.119 

the<00:03:05.209> last<00:03:05.480> bit<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.109> ride<00:03:06.349> back<00:03:06.709> down<00:03:06.920> into

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
the last bit of this ride back down into

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.530 
the last bit of this ride back down into
the<00:03:07.249> river<00:03:07.459> again<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.790> probably<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.150> steepest

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the river again is probably the steepest

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.149 
the river again is probably the steepest
bit<00:03:08.749> and<00:03:08.959> it's<00:03:09.109> pretty<00:03:09.439> rudder<00:03:09.739> than<00:03:10.010> its

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
bit and it's pretty rudder than its

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.220 
bit and it's pretty rudder than its
technical<00:03:11.060> say<00:03:11.450> he's<00:03:11.599> sort<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> trying<00:03:12.170> to

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
technical say he's sort of trying to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.319 
technical say he's sort of trying to
hold<00:03:12.469> the<00:03:12.620> speed<00:03:12.889> back<00:03:13.129> as<00:03:13.310> much<00:03:13.760> as<00:03:13.969> you<00:03:14.090> can

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
hold the speed back as much as you can

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.929 
hold the speed back as much as you can
and<00:03:14.659> then<00:03:14.810> eventually<00:03:15.439> the<00:03:15.590> thing<00:03:15.909> kind<00:03:16.909> of

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
and then eventually the thing kind of

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.940 
and then eventually the thing kind of
takes<00:03:17.209> off<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:17.510> itself<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.439> you're<00:03:18.620> doing<00:03:18.829> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
takes off on itself and you're doing it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
takes off on itself and you're doing it
right<00:03:19.129> here<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.549> a<00:03:19.670> bit<00:03:19.879> of<00:03:19.909> a<00:03:20.000> Bronco<00:03:20.450> down

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
right here like a bit of a Bronco down

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.199 
right here like a bit of a Bronco down
down<00:03:21.469> back<00:03:21.799> into<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.250> river<00:03:22.430> area<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
down back into the river area and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.229 
down back into the river area and
there's<00:03:23.750> lucky<00:03:24.019> again<00:03:24.230> waiting<00:03:24.709> for<00:03:24.950> you

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.569 

once<00:03:29.239> we<00:03:29.389> get<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.569> along<00:03:30.439> again<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.010> also

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
once we get going along again and also

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.759 
once we get going along again and also
earlier<00:03:32.150> on<00:03:32.299> quickly<00:03:32.750> realizes<00:03:33.319> different

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
earlier on quickly realizes different

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.009 
earlier on quickly realizes different
bits<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.340> gold<00:03:34.939> mining<00:03:35.299> equipment<00:03:35.450> here<00:03:35.870> and

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
bits of gold mining equipment here and

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.360 
bits of gold mining equipment here and
there<00:03:36.199> and<00:03:36.349> sort<00:03:36.739> of<00:03:36.859> adds<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.280> whole

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
there and sort of adds to the whole

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.509 
there and sort of adds to the whole
fascination<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.480> times<00:03:39.409> back<00:03:39.980> then<00:03:40.010> when

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
fascination of the times back then when

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.640 
fascination of the times back then when
people<00:03:41.060> used<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:41.510> actually<00:03:41.659> travel<00:03:42.260> up<00:03:42.409> this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
people used to actually travel up this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.039 
people used to actually travel up this
through<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.579> area<00:03:43.909> trying<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.689> find<00:03:44.930> the

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
through this area trying to find the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.839 
through this area trying to find the
gold

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.099 

we<00:03:49.849> continued<00:03:50.299> along<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.599> river<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:51.049> a

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
we continued along this river for a

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.959 
we continued along this river for a
little<00:03:51.379> bit<00:03:51.469> longer<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.010> till<00:03:52.579> it<00:03:52.669> got<00:03:52.790> very

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
very technical and we passed the bikes

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.069 
very technical and we passed the bikes
up<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:55.310> then<00:03:55.519> walked<00:03:55.819> in<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.269> rocky<00:03:56.780> showed

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
camp of the gold mining and there's a

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.460 
camp of the gold mining and there's a
lot<00:04:01.699> of<00:04:01.730> ruins<00:04:02.090> in<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.359> area<00:04:02.689> was<00:04:02.840> just
