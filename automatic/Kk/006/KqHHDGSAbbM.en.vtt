00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:12.940
 and hello people I am again the 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.410
 sat hd and finally very warm 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.349
 welcome to a new preview 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.330
 this is the first player review i have 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.580
 on the channel of bipa gaming here 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.890
 do not bring me for the people yet 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.380
 know again the explanation what here 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.300
 so i will be the first one in you 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.429
 games test by Ronaldo in the team of the 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.860
 Show season and then we will 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.120
 few highlights from him then from the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.190
 see a game and I will have a few 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.750
 to say things as he likes me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.970
 what the benefits of the demand 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.800
 are approaching and close 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.020
 Let's get back to a little conclusion from yes we 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.030
 here have the teams pull ronaldo as 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.300
 left striker played that is when 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.640
 I the best variant around him best 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.400
 yes to be able to savor his stats in the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.250
 normal on the map are 95 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.080
 tempo 96 lap bequeathed example 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.740
 I did 95 291 for him 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.460
 one million 791 1000 and the rest 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.619
 church look here played 28 48 goals 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.079
 I think that pretty much already 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.130
 many cool things you close with 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.109
 this player can experience 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.060
 We will asame it to the ingame 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.859
 look at town now we are at the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.929
 games by cristiano ronaldo 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.640
 I'll just read the outstanding ones 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.460
 things as it were in front of him 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.520
 Of course he has 99 examinations 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.369
 also 99 head depression 93 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.689
 Of course, 99 shots were still going on 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.119
 times you see dangerous always 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.639
 in reallife either 94 got me one 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.700
 little surprised 89 90 meter shot 

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:47.030
 power he also has 99 and volleys 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.770
 he had 94 here , he knows 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.520
 special movement 44 star weak foot 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.549
 exactly four star is right foot and yes it 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.650
 also quite large actually a 86 84 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.830
 kilo is so fine 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.940
 then here starts 93 agility 98 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.069
 bounce 99 99 sprint speed 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.470
 98 So that's really like a bow 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.390
 next the mental absolutely this 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.730
 not so pronounced positional 88 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.560
 Survey 80 and yes that was already 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.390
 his ingame stats we will be 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.220
 look what he highlights so then 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.670
 scenes in the play shows how easy walking 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.190
 take a look 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.680
 Now I want a little something 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.540
 team obsessive cristiano ronaldo so too 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.430
 a superior player than 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.590
 first as already seen here 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.940
 its pace is really incredible 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.100
 what the endeavor rips he has, too 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.890
 a mega tempo on the map 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.780
 The best way to use his team is if you 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580
 this with the right stick on one 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.410
 exists because then he jumps the two 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.420
 days after the war no one left 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.769
 he often gets a little ball 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.030
 bored because he is just as strong 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.150
 team means that he leads the ball 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.980
 very close to the foot then the next thing I did 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.260
 already mentioned halfway 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.070
 of course, its dribbling 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.440
 surprise that the player 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.320
 with the best dribbling of my 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.840
 from pine 3 10 ultimate 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.360
 team so I have no better 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.799
 dribbler it were played since added 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.329
 Of course , his skill comes through it 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.100
 that he has such a good dribbling like that 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.620
 he can also do a tight ball control 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.890
 The SG has to be very precise very fast 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.350
 and do what you 1000 again 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.660
 times dangerous then makes yes than this 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.950
 are the long shot or the shots too 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.209
 outside the penalty area 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.519
 they are just incredible in the 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.890
 99 shots and he has as well 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.720
 shot power 99 you can see that too 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.540
 clearly in the game so what sometimes 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.840
 rausholt also with his fiesta will be 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.220
 is really incredible he makes them 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.510
 I'll just say it all in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.459
 real life though he is in real life 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.350
 I've eased a bit 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.540
 just outside things 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.079
 Penalty space is 1000 times better than that 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.060
 graduation 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.150
 although the graduation is not a thousand times 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.890
 better but the conclusion because it hapert 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.959
 sometimes that's a bit like that again 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.370
 is such a wee one so though 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.569
 I have to see the conclusion is synonymous 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.900
 still perfectly clear 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.180
 It does not like it so much I do 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.650
 next dolphin it with him because of this 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.689
 really not so the bringer 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.730
 but such a tight shot in the 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.989
 right or left lower corner that was 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.819
 very effective 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.290
 the next one is the passing game which affects me 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.539
 was very surprised is a few game 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.160
 I often have a few dribblings 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.840
 have set, and then not easy 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.759
 painted on it but then have the ball 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.960
 something thoughtfully played there and me 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:29.060
 my passport values ​​are yes 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.620
 okay, but he really plays 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.449
 also really cool passes while we 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.650
 Here is one of the most beautiful gates 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.870
 have seen what i did with him 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.610
 I love these users but be it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.099
 Drum as I said the pass also 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.590
 really cool then the next 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.120
 thing that is very outstanding is the very 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.030
 Of course, his body stands out 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.860
 yes strength his body strength in 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.729
 connection with his pace is easy 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.530
 incredible 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.330
 it falls to the defenders and 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.220
 general people in the opponent team very much 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.320
 difficult to separate in yes so 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.669
 possible really very difficult and he 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.259
 I agree with almost everyone 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.310
 run duell by even if he ever so 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.530
 a bit slower when you arrive 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.789
 a bit of fitness lost that and that 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.599
 are connected with his speed 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:11.050
 So how should I have had teamwork 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.199
 this time like sony in a seaworld 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.729
 stop 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.970
 seaworld is maybe a bit 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.830
 faster but he is physically 0 strong 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.210
 He is always upside down and somehow 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.909
 bounced back so you have to do that 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.680
 imagine yes that's it really 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.630
 with all the stuff I think he finds 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.789
 is a really great player what a 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.259
 small manko is his header 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:32.000
 I think he has only one 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:33.650
 Kaufbeurer two head-gates for me 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.720
 which was very disappointing 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.729
 somehow he's pretty good, too 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.770
 head-on data is not that small either 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.000
 but cooks at play as can be on 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.039
 definitely something maybe better 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.780
 his team, whether they are here variant therefore 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.060
 still perhaps a bit better 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.770
 Overall, Ronaldo is the best 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.479
 player with me ever much 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.509
 trust and event have played them 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:54.949
 at least the best offensive player 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.539
 of course, can not do it now 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.949
 We compare defenders 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.620
 probably 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.789
 yes lose weight or something she asks 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.530
 how to express it 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.960
 honestly either are by the way 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.130
 also very good and he has easy 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.229
 also give in the interest of everyone 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.850
 he thinks he has a total of five 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.310
 or six meters shot 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.500
 and yes as I said best player for that 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.470
 Maybe not worth the money if you have it 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.940
 have loose money then pick it up but you 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.780
 you have to play it at least once 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.630
 I think I have 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.400
 and yes, but if you say I would if 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.919
 then only save on him and so what 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.840
 I would definitely do it because it is for 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.150
 You can get the money right 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.800
 All in all, he is cool 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.800
 now first to conclude conclusion 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.870
 yes people here you can see that again 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.060
 Final conclusion pro and contra I have times 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.699
 so a bit listed where clearly 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.280
 His tempo was long short sting 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:52.379
 Body is dribbling included 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.550
 Of course I have his skill 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.650
 now a bit at dribbling with 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.810
 calculated and are surprising 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.060
 strong matching on the contra side 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.479
 then we have the header and the 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.580
 completion of my opinion, though 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.840
 but it's still a bit off 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.970
 that's why I have it all 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.400
 also a stapled so the conclusion 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.530
 in the end it's as bad as it is 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.409
 not outstanding now that was 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.150
 time preview of cristiano ronaldo team 

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.110
 of the season you can go to the 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.759
 Write comments 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.340
 as he found it i hope i could 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:25.379
 Look well so I hope 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.539
 i was able to give you a few a little bit 

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:29.330
 reveal how this player is like that 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.550
 seems to me the comments you have more 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.169
 previews and yes me 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.039
 I would say I'm out until
