00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.140
 today we are going to make these candlesticks 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.370
 cupcakes in our super channel 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.340
 madrasa 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.990
 to do it alone we're going to need a 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.540
 boat foam used to 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.299
 fill holes and cupcakes capsules 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.220
 we put according to indications the foam 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.770
 in the center of our capsule and 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 we tighten so that it comes out the most 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.169
 continuous possible we fill up halfway 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.380
 because they go up like 50% it took in 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.989
 go up like an hour or two but it's better 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.239
 leave them one day once they have already 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.219
 gone up one day has passed what we do 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.859
 is to paint we are going to paint them with 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.269
 gold color spray paint we could 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.250
 paint it also with a brush and with 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.100
 any painting in us 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.350
 it is more convenient to use spray 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.329
 we use spray paint 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.370
 and before it dries we throw it 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.800
 also some glitter always 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.750
 for Christmas much shine well 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.850
 now to make the candle cupcake 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.140
 long what we do is cut back a bit 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.750
 you see this foam can be cut 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 pretty easy and we put the candle that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.619
 let's put squeeze carefully 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.479
 inwards if we want instead of 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.670
 the candle we can use something else that does not 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.360
 make it easier to finish as if it were 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.980
 blade with some red plasticine 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.320
 we do we put a little red plasticine 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.100
 in the middle of the candle wrapping the candle 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.980
 to imitate our cherry the other the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.690
 that is going to be with embedded veil what 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.630
 what we do is take the measure and 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.790
 mark it once marked cut with 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.730
 Care is cut very easy and we remove 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.940
 this piece proving that we can fit in it 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.950
 our beauty so that it fits well 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.530
 well now we have put some tail 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.090
 white around beige with a pincelito 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 we have put white glue and now we paste 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 little little bombs we can paste 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.240
 any other confetti that we 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.320
 we have used these little bombs that come 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.060
 in packets of 500 it is worth it now only 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.890
 we have to put some white glue 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.080
 around the red plasticine so that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
 look like the brightness of the cute one there 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.500
 be careful when turning it on because the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.490
 foam is flammable that never crashes 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.490
 to the flame with the foam
