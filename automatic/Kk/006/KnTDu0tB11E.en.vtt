what<00:00:04.210> the<00:00:04.420> virus<00:00:04.840> chips<00:00:05.140> are<00:00:05.410> so<00:00:05.980> I<00:00:06.399> guess<00:00:06.640> this

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:06.790 
what the virus chips are so I guess this

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.570 
what the virus chips are so I guess this
is<00:00:06.939> the<00:00:06.970> CPU<00:00:07.650> and<00:00:08.650> this<00:00:09.100> looks<00:00:09.340> like<00:00:09.460> the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:09.580 
is the CPU and this looks like the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.379 
is the CPU and this looks like the
companionship<00:00:10.090> and<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:12.490> might<00:00:12.879> be<00:00:13.090> the

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
companionship and this might be the

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.370 
companionship and this might be the
memory<00:00:13.719> yeah<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.720> this<00:00:16.720> looks<00:00:16.930> like<00:00:17.110> name

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
memory yeah and this looks like name

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.040 
memory yeah and this looks like name
that<00:00:18.070> flash<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.820> could<00:00:22.060> be<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.480> bios<00:00:22.840> flash

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
that flash this could be the bios flash

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.160 
that flash this could be the bios flash

bernina SETI taking apart the new XL 1.5
he's<00:00:32.619> had<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.039> machine<00:00:33.340> in<00:00:33.460> his<00:00:33.579> hands<00:00:34.000> for

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
he's had the machine in his hands for

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.479 
he's had the machine in his hands for
maybe<00:00:34.390> 20<00:00:34.899> minutes<00:00:35.050> he's<00:00:35.800> already<00:00:36.040> taken<00:00:36.250> it

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
maybe 20 minutes he's already taken it

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.190 
maybe 20 minutes he's already taken it
apart<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.739> can<00:00:39.730> we<00:00:39.850> describe<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.810> parts<00:00:41.079> for

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
apart so can we describe the parts for

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.319 
apart so can we describe the parts for
the<00:00:41.260> camera<00:00:41.560> sorry<00:00:41.950> so<00:00:42.300> microprocessor<00:00:43.300> and

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
the camera sorry so microprocessor and

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.210 
the camera sorry so microprocessor and
this<00:00:43.570> is<00:00:43.690> probably<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.170> companionship<00:00:45.010> that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
this is probably the companionship that

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.670 
this is probably the companionship that
does<00:00:45.579> like<00:00:45.970> looks<00:00:46.780> very<00:00:47.020> much<00:00:47.200> like<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.410> South

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
does like looks very much like a South

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.970 
does like looks very much like a South
Bridge<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:49.420> should<00:00:49.690> be<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:50.170> flash

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
Bridge and this should be the flash

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.650 
Bridge and this should be the flash
drive<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.350> should<00:00:53.649> be<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:54.130> memory<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
drive and this should be the memory this

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.569 
drive and this should be the memory this
looks<00:00:55.930> very<00:00:56.020> much<00:00:56.350> like<00:00:56.380> they<00:00:56.860> could<00:00:57.340> be<00:00:57.460> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
looks very much like they could be the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.160 
looks very much like they could be the
cafe<00:00:57.940> and<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.090> can't<00:01:01.360> recognize<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:01.989> names

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
cafe and but I can't recognize the names

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.510 
cafe and but I can't recognize the names
here<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:05.379> guy<00:01:05.619> here<00:01:05.950> could<00:01:06.280> be<00:01:06.399> the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
here so this guy here could be the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.050 
here so this guy here could be the
display<00:01:06.820> controller<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.520> still<00:01:09.789> don't

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
display controller but I still don't

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:19.109 
display controller but I still don't
recognize<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.719> brand<00:01:12.450> cheapo<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.100> oh<00:01:18.549> here's

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
recognize the brand cheapo so oh here's

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.849 
recognize the brand cheapo so oh here's
the<00:01:19.389> embedded<00:01:19.779> controller<00:01:20.079> so<00:01:20.350> we<00:01:20.469> still<00:01:20.679> have

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
the embedded controller so we still have

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.859 
the embedded controller so we still have
it<00:01:20.889> this<00:01:21.520> little<00:01:21.729> guy<00:01:21.969> here<00:01:22.359> is<00:01:22.600> responsible

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
it this little guy here is responsible

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.559 
it this little guy here is responsible
for<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.740> power<00:01:23.920> management<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.639> all<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.909> the

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
for the power management and all the the

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.739 
for the power management and all the the
I<00:01:26.409> mean<00:01:26.709> like<00:01:26.859> so<00:01:27.429> making<00:01:27.729> us<00:01:27.909> dinner<00:01:28.209> I<00:01:28.479> think

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
I mean like so making us dinner I think

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.870 
I mean like so making us dinner I think
come<00:01:28.959> up<00:01:29.079> their<00:01:29.679> wireless<00:01:29.859> LAN<00:01:30.340> card<00:01:30.369> on<00:01:30.789> the

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
come up their wireless LAN card on the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.919 
come up their wireless LAN card on the
other<00:01:31.060> side<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.060> one<00:01:34.270> another<00:01:34.479> city<00:01:34.749> shape

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
other side so the one another city shape

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.859 
other side so the one another city shape
big<00:01:35.499> difference<00:01:35.829> they're<00:01:36.009> burning<00:01:36.310> oh<00:01:36.869> well

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
big difference they're burning oh well

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.179 
big difference they're burning oh well
it's<00:01:38.049> quite<00:01:38.439> different<00:01:38.679> this<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:39.159> a

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
it's quite different this is a

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
it's quite different this is a
completely<00:01:39.579> different<00:01:39.880> processor

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
completely different processor

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.440 
completely different processor
configuration<00:01:41.619> yeah<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.159> whole<00:01:42.520> thing<00:01:42.819> is<00:01:42.999> I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
configuration yeah the whole thing is I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.050 
configuration yeah the whole thing is I
should<00:01:43.569> I<00:01:44.020> should<00:01:44.590> be<00:01:44.950> showing<00:01:45.459> them<00:01:45.609> next<00:01:45.999> to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
should I should be showing them next to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.419 
should I should be showing them next to
each<00:01:46.090> other<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.659> thought<00:01:47.469> that<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.859> board<00:01:48.099> was

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
each other I thought that the board was

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.999 
each other I thought that the board was
kind<00:01:49.090> of<00:01:49.209> smaller<00:01:49.810> than<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.409> old<00:01:50.499> one<00:01:50.740> but<00:01:50.950> I

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
kind of smaller than the old one but I

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.499 
kind of smaller than the old one but I
don't<00:01:51.279> see<00:01:51.459> any<00:01:51.609> difference<00:01:51.909> in<00:01:52.060> theoretical

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
don't see any difference in theoretical

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.300 
don't see any difference in theoretical
II<00:01:52.779> the<00:01:52.899> exact<00:01:53.200> same<00:01:53.380> size<00:01:53.679> so<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.039> could

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
II the exact same size so you could

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.059 
II the exact same size so you could
actually<00:01:54.490> take<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:54.939> XO<00:01:55.539> 1.5<00:01:56.319> motherboard<00:01:56.950> and

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
actually take a XO 1.5 motherboard and

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.210 
actually take a XO 1.5 motherboard and
put<00:01:57.249> it<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:57.429> an<00:01:57.549> X<00:01:57.759> 0<00:01:57.909> 1<00:01:58.149> point<00:01:58.419> 0<00:01:58.539> computer

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
put it in an X 0 1 point 0 computer

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.270 
put it in an X 0 1 point 0 computer
okay<00:01:59.900> that's<00:02:00.900> what<00:02:01.050> this<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.350> yeah

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
okay that's what this is yeah

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.890 
okay that's what this is yeah
essentially<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.300> it<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
essentially this is what it is it's a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.670 
essentially this is what it is it's a
1.5<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.130> din<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.600> 1.1<00:02:06.600> computer<00:02:07.490> will<00:02:08.490> need

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
1.5 for din a 1.1 computer will need

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.810 
1.5 for din a 1.1 computer will need
scrubbing<00:02:10.680> the<00:02:10.890> water<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.370> you'll<00:02:11.520> need<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> new

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
scrubbing the water so you'll need a new

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.930 
scrubbing the water so you'll need a new
charger<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.860> peak<00:02:14.040> power<00:02:14.250> usage<00:02:14.460> is<00:02:14.760> higher

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
charger the peak power usage is higher

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.670 
charger the peak power usage is higher
oh<00:02:15.180> my<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:17.310> y'all<00:02:18.210> fish<00:02:18.630> kzn<00:02:19.670> yeah
