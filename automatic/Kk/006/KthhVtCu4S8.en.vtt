00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:09.509
 Yes very much Hello 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:15.900
 Layer is sudden This time too quick review 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 I think that I would like to link the video and blog in conjunction with the 9 reviews for short . 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.349
 The second was released from Steam on April 30, 2014 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.590
 An unusual roguelike on the higher difficulty level incorporating rhythmic elements 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:34.920
 Crypto of the Necro Dancer 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:40.730
 The fixed price is 1,480 yen for personal computer software and the support language is only English. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.730
 It has been released as the best board of the snow board 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.460
 It corresponds to a genre called crypt part note pro dancer roguelike but this word is 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.489
 I feel like the gamer terms 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.540
 Simply put, there is an element in the form of some sort of element that starts over when you die 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.100
 Is a game 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.560
 Great adventures of the windy Shiren and Toruneko when raising the masterpiece 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.070
 After free software there is one way hero 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.330
 In the one that I live in, so is the magic site 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.910
 Don and the star are also incorporating elements of the roguelike 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.910
 If it dies too, everything will be from the beginning 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:29.110
 Such enemies also move according to bgm's rhythm to the genre of such a roguelike 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:31.950
 Innovative work that incorporates a sound game elements that say this 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 I am a crypto Uekane dancer 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:44.340
 Judgment of the moment is very important because we act according to the rhythm 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.490
 Furthermore, if you lose the rhythm, you can not move from the spot and the enemy once 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:54.080
 It is in the form of moving one minute 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.080
 I think it will be understood that it is important to get on the rhythm with this alone 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.270
 In spite of incorporating such innovative system 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.920
 As a roguelike is a balanced game that keeps you entertained 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.020
 Just because it incorporates the sound game 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.790
 I feel bgm is pretty good 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.230
 Options around be tightly development was to have been displayed in order to engrave the rhythm 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 Heart and vertical bars 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 Shining floor can be display switch 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 Items and equipment that will be unlocked gradually as you go through the game 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.159
 You excited 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.159
 Because the time it takes for one play is short, convenience also has a certain degree 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:45.080
 Just wondering if it's accomplished or not 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:50.570
 I think it will be quite difficult if I think that people who have never played Loglyo will do it 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.260
 For example, items appearing in this game will only show their name, not their effect 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.880
 The 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.010
 You be naturally ready for roguelike classic is those things 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.049
 I think that I do not understand a little well for beginners 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:10.659
 Of course if you play with patience you will always be able to open the way 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:16.000
 But also support for those who are interested as such sound game eg 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:19.620
 It will be a better game if you say it by enriching the low difficulty dungeon, etc. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.620
 I thought I might not be 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.400
 Crypt of the eye to a professional dancer roguelike 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.469
 Not just an unprecedented system that combines 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.760
 Balanced difficulty levels for quality musician Roglike May have been prepared 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:41.909
 It is a good work 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.680
 Most take Nai' just rhythm listen people after music like me roguelike beginners 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:49.100
 The person who is 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.380
 I think I will struggle to play Well that's bad I 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.640
 Yes 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:00.930
 This quality in the group and of the Necro dancer early access version 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:07.090
 The old school is 7.9 per 10.0, taking into consideration that 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:11.940
 If you have a hard time talking about a little more than a video, please go to the video's description section. 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.940
 Then again it was 9 reviews next time
