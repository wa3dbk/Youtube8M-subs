video about phase one of the getting a
shredded<00:00:09.050> program<00:00:10.219> so<00:00:11.420> in<00:00:12.420> that<00:00:12.630> phase<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.469> i

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
you watch that video before this one I

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.590 
you watch that video before this one I
talked<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.949> brief<00:00:20.369> period<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> time<00:00:21.029> when

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
talked about a brief period of time when

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.220 
talked about a brief period of time when
you<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.439> consuming<00:00:22.880> fruit<00:00:24.080> lots<00:00:25.080> of

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you are consuming fruit lots of

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.769 
you are consuming fruit lots of
carbohydrates<00:00:25.949> fats<00:00:26.580> things<00:00:27.090> like<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.480> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
carbohydrates fats things like that and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.169 
carbohydrates fats things like that and
I<00:00:28.349> suggested<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.429> macronutrient

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I suggested that your macronutrient

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.400 
I suggested that your macronutrient
breakdown<00:00:30.210> should<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.019> forty<00:00:31.380> percent

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
breakdown should be about forty percent

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.340 
breakdown should be about forty percent
protein<00:00:32.309> forty<00:00:32.820> percent<00:00:33.059> carbs<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.630> twenty

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
protein forty percent carbs and twenty

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.569 
protein forty percent carbs and twenty
percent<00:00:34.680> fat<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.370> begin<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.910> as<00:00:37.250> we<00:00:38.250> move

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
percent fat to begin with as we move

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
percent fat to begin with as we move
forward<00:00:40.670> what<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.790> looking<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> do<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.020> if

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
forward what are we looking to do so if

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.680 
forward what are we looking to do so if
you've<00:00:44.250> been<00:00:44.370> doing<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.030> ten

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you've been doing that for about ten

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.520 
you've been doing that for about ten
days<00:00:46.489> what<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.610> need<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.629> start<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
days what we need to do now is start to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.549 
days what we need to do now is start to
figure<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:54.260> become<00:00:55.260> more

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
figure out a way for you to become more

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.389 
figure out a way for you to become more
and<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:55.800> insulin<00:00:56.460> sensitive<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:58.399> release

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and more insulin sensitive to release

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.630 
and more insulin sensitive to release
more<00:00:59.760> fat<00:01:00.120> burning<00:01:00.629> hormones<00:01:00.660> into<00:01:01.590> your<00:01:02.399> body

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
more fat burning hormones into your body

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.509 
more fat burning hormones into your body
so<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.870> leverage<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.979> natural

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so that you can leverage your natural

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.630 
so that you can leverage your natural
processes<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.780> order<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.340> past<00:01:08.340> any

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
processes in order to get past any

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.160 
processes in order to get past any
plateaus<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.320> passed<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.170> more

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
plateaus and passed to get that more

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.750 
plateaus and passed to get that more
that<00:01:13.350> muscle<00:01:13.740> definition<00:01:13.920> you're<00:01:14.400> looking

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that muscle definition you're looking

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.420 
that muscle definition you're looking
for<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.409> mentioned<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:17.790> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:19.430> over

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
for I mentioned that if you are over

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.499 
for I mentioned that if you are over
fifteen<00:01:20.850> percent<00:01:21.180> body<00:01:21.390> fat<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
fifteen percent body fat that you are

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
fifteen percent body fat that you are
probably<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:25.110> insulin<00:01:25.710> sensitive<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.520> were

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
probably not insulin sensitive you were

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.600 
probably not insulin sensitive you were
probably<00:01:26.939> having<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.200> mild<00:01:28.530> form<00:01:28.920> insulin

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
probably having a mild form insulin

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.140 
probably having a mild form insulin
resistance<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> talk

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
resistance so what I'm going to talk

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.080 
resistance so what I'm going to talk
about<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.810> how<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.229> start<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.909> your

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
about now is how we start to get your

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.230 
about now is how we start to get your
body's<00:01:36.450> natural<00:01:36.659> processes<00:01:37.610> working<00:01:38.610> for<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
body's natural processes working for you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.510 
body's natural processes working for you
rather<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:39.630> against<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> helping<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
rather than against you and helping you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.749 
rather than against you and helping you
to<00:01:41.850> get<00:01:41.970> lean<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.189> you've<00:01:44.189> done<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.430> for

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to get lean so you've done this for

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
to get lean so you've done this for
about<00:01:44.850> ten<00:01:45.149> days<00:01:45.299> you're<00:01:45.570> eating<00:01:45.810> fruit<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
about ten days you're eating fruit you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.510 
about ten days you're eating fruit you
are<00:01:48.680> taking<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.799> forty<00:01:50.040> percent<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.399> your

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
are taking in forty percent of your

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
are taking in forty percent of your
calories<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:50.970> fat<00:01:51.060> forward<00:01:51.869> percent<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259

from<00:01:59.130> carbohydrates<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:00.840> do<00:02:00.960> now

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
from carbohydrates what do we do now

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.920 
from carbohydrates what do we do now
well<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.520> need<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> move<00:02:03.210> on<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.630> phase<00:02:03.899> two<00:02:04.399> now

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
well we need to move on to phase two now

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.889 
well we need to move on to phase two now
phase<00:02:06.930> two<00:02:07.429> involves<00:02:08.599> manipulating<00:02:09.599> your

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
phase two involves manipulating your

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.490 
phase two involves manipulating your
body's<00:02:10.349> hormones<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:11.959> reducing<00:02:12.959> carbon

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
body's hormones by reducing carbon

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.600 
body's hormones by reducing carbon
it's<00:02:13.850> okay<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.980> am<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.130> talking<00:02:17.190> about

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's okay so what am I talking about

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.970 
it's okay so what am I talking about
well<00:02:18.620> when<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.650> produce<00:02:20.010> insulin<00:02:21.680> your<00:02:22.680> body

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
well when you produce insulin your body

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.600 
well when you produce insulin your body
blocks<00:02:24.260> some<00:02:25.260> other<00:02:25.410> hormonal<00:02:25.830> processes

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
blocks some other hormonal processes

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.240 
blocks some other hormonal processes
that<00:02:27.420> are<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:27.960> important<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> burn

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that are very important for you to burn

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.720 
that are very important for you to burn
fat<00:02:30.320> when<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.440> produce<00:02:31.620> too<00:02:32.130> much<00:02:32.160> insulin

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
fat when you produce too much insulin

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.400 
fat when you produce too much insulin
you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.150> produce<00:02:33.300> stress<00:02:33.750> hormones<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you can produce stress hormones that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.630 
you can produce stress hormones that
will<00:02:34.800> keep<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.459> from<00:02:35.700> burning<00:02:36.390> fat<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:38.130> so

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
will keep you from burning fat and so

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.940 
will keep you from burning fat and so
what<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.330> need<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.630> do<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.959> decrease<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
what we need to do is decrease the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.730 
what we need to do is decrease the
amount<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.310> insulin<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:41.880> body's<00:02:42.180> producing

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
amount of insulin your body's producing

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.990 
amount of insulin your body's producing
so<00:02:43.740> my<00:02:44.010> suggestion<00:02:44.930> after<00:02:45.930> about<00:02:46.110> 10<00:02:46.380> days<00:02:46.560> of

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
so my suggestion after about 10 days of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000 
so my suggestion after about 10 days of
doing<00:02:48.000> feeding<00:02:48.630> your<00:02:48.720> body<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.650> need<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
doing feeding your body you need to

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
doing feeding your body you need to
start<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.640> gradually<00:02:51.000> reduce<00:02:51.750> your

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
start to gradually reduce your

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.430 
start to gradually reduce your
carbohydrates<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.850> good<00:02:54.239> start<00:02:54.570> is<00:02:54.810> cutting

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
carbohydrates so a good start is cutting

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.010 
carbohydrates so a good start is cutting
your<00:02:55.530> carbohydrates<00:02:56.190> by<00:02:56.370> one-third<00:02:57.020> what

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
your carbohydrates by one-third what

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.870 
your carbohydrates by one-third what
that's<00:02:58.230> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.370> going<00:02:59.760> to

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
that's going to do is it's going to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.760 
that's going to do is it's going to
decrease<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.870> amount<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.290> insulin<00:03:01.620> your

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
decrease the amount of insulin your

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680 
decrease the amount of insulin your
body's<00:03:02.040> producing<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
body's producing and it's going to

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.530 
body's producing and it's going to
increase<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.950> amount<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.430> growth<00:03:05.940> hormone

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
increase the amount of growth hormone

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.040 
increase the amount of growth hormone
that<00:03:07.230> your<00:03:07.500> body's<00:03:07.800> producing<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:09.959> is

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
that your body's producing so what is

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.840 
that your body's producing so what is
growth<00:03:10.260> hormone<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.800> well<00:03:11.040> growth<00:03:11.370> hormone

rate you see a lot of pro bodybuilders
injecting<00:03:34.489> growth<00:03:35.489> hormone<00:03:35.940> into<00:03:36.150> their

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
injecting growth hormone into their

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.229 
injecting growth hormone into their
bodies<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.080> get<00:03:37.950> more<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.459> this<00:03:38.580> benefit<00:03:39.090> but

bodies to get more of this benefit but

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.570 
bodies to get more of this benefit but
what<00:03:39.390> I'm<00:03:39.480> talking<00:03:39.870> about<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.580> increasing

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
what I'm talking about is increasing

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.979 
what I'm talking about is increasing
your<00:03:41.700> natural<00:03:42.239> production<00:03:42.269> of<00:03:42.780> growth

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
your natural production of growth

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.370 
your natural production of growth
hormone<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.459> we<00:03:45.299> want<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.660> start<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.230> reduce

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
hormone so we want to start to reduce

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.819 
hormone so we want to start to reduce
your<00:03:46.950> carbohydrates<00:03:47.640> now<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.209> suggest<00:03:48.829> one

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
your carbohydrates now I suggest one

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.009 
your carbohydrates now I suggest one
getting<00:03:50.400> rid<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.549> all<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.880> fruit<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.420> to

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
getting rid of all the fruit and to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.259 
getting rid of all the fruit and to
making<00:03:52.799> sure<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.579> you're<00:03:53.790> cutting<00:03:54.090> down

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
making sure that you're cutting down

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.780 
making sure that you're cutting down
your<00:03:54.720> overall<00:03:55.290> production<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.980> carbohydrates

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
your overall production of carbohydrates

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.449 
your overall production of carbohydrates
by<00:03:57.360> about<00:03:57.630> one-third<00:03:58.350> that's<00:03:59.190> going<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
by about one-third that's going to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.420 
by about one-third that's going to
increase<00:04:00.170> those<00:04:01.170> hormonal<00:04:01.620> processes<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.370> I

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
increase those hormonal processes that I

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.220 
increase those hormonal processes that I
was<00:04:02.640> talking<00:04:03.000> about<00:04:03.060> it's<00:04:03.840> also<00:04:03.959> going<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
was talking about it's also going to

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
was talking about it's also going to
reduce<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.950> amount<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.310> calories<00:04:05.760> you're
