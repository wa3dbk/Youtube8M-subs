00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.990
 all vehicles have liquids and it goes 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.630
 help absorb liquids from mistakes 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.540

 the mistakes because this is important here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.240
 the important thing is to then remove the seed 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.840

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.970

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.990
 This is the seed 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.440
 When we put it to safety, she releases it. 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.540
 Then we'll do what sticks. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 long lines 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.070

 at this time the trio that I put 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.470
 continues to absorb all the liquid 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.960
 although we put a seasoning 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.050
