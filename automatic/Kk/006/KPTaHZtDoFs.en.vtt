to him let me clarify there is ZERO
proof<00:01:02.739> of<00:01:02.949> any<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:03.459> there<00:01:03.819> is<00:01:03.999> absolutely

proof of any of this there is absolutely

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.740 
proof of any of this there is absolutely
no<00:01:05.490> data<00:01:06.490> at<00:01:06.700> all<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.150> suggest<00:01:07.299> that<00:01:07.630> whey

no data at all to suggest that whey

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.050 
no data at all to suggest that whey

protein of any kind raises testosterone

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.360 
protein of any kind raises testosterone
why<00:01:10.660> whey<00:01:11.170> isolate<00:01:11.770> would<00:01:12.160> raise

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
why whey isolate would raise

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.730 
why whey isolate would raise
testosterone<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.330> whey<00:01:13.930> concentrate<00:01:14.170> would
