00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:35.980
 today I prepare risotto with castelmagno 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.450
 obviously he must not miss his majesty 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:45.580
 the castelmagno a wonderful cheese 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:49.050
 then you will need a shallot not 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:55.110
 there is paul really loves shallots 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:00.340
 of the excellent butter and then or carnaroli 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:04.420
 or of dwarf halo must not be missing 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:08.650
 obviously of its own vegetable made 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:13.030
 with water onion celery carrot a little 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:16.780
 salt the wonderful thing of 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.560
 castelmagno and the presence of these skies 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:24.369
 it's very easy to break 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.130
 so it's very informative I'd almost say 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.560
 tender from this point of view from 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:35.229
 soft heart with these flakes 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.570
 clearly we will not miss ours 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:44.229
 risotto take two tablespoons of oil e 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.409
 put in a pan and then put it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.840
 really chopped shallots 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.280
 finely the flame must be 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.929
 very low and the shallot itself must 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.799
 soften it will turn off inside this 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:08.700
 subject must not be absolutely 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:08.700
 burned cast your castelmagno 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.040
 here are the ingredients for the 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.370
 creaming the shelled castelmagno e 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.800
 then a nice voice of fresh butter 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.660
 fresh, fresh, cool to dose the rice 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.810
 have an eco coffee station 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.910
 practically street add three 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.910
 cups of coffee for three people 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 heat your pot where we will do it 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:51.690
 rice is left by temperature 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.690
 you see that I don't put anything on the bottom 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 when they take it home to object e 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:06.750
 face then we begin to move the rice 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.220
 that network the middle flame 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.490
 now when you hear that rice 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.230
 it begins to tend to cling 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.230
 start by reaching a little bit 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.470
 of broth 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.870
 fabrizi 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.580
 here now being immediately under the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:48.950
 hand that needs another bit of 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:52.489
 broth and then broth is always 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:59.480
 then to mix operation I repeat va 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:01.970
 done continuously for salting 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.349
 go easy on me because I have spent a while 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.069
 of salt 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:10.030
 obviously in the broth and then again there is 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.040
 a strong stability of the castelmagno 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 therefore not added absolutely summer 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.470
 the high edges of the pan is no way 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.870
 that is not always steaming all at once 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.389
 otherwise it makes us relive the double 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.120
 of the amount of broso but skin a little 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:33.740
 stay inside the pot e 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:46.070
 then add the shallots now and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:50.120
 mix the rice is ready then I have 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.960
 the butter is pushed under the flame for a long time 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.750
 and as already said, not mixed much 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:05.990
 very very fast so that the butter does not 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.970
 it all comes together here is now but 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.919
 while the castelmagno you do not have all 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:16.700
 a gimmick just to put on 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.190
 above like here quickly 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:24.889
 I recommend very very very very much 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:29.340
 very fast and solved and very soft in 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:32.520
 this creamy way 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.380
 and white strictly white if you see 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.650
 something black means you have 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:43.470
 practically burned shallots but 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.840
 it must be all white perfect it 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.600
 let only one rest 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:56.190
 finally the seconds after which 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:06:00.080
 so it is served as a plate and is served as a plate 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.080
 to all, good appetite 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:14.740
 I put another bit of castelmagno 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:24.020
 above surface and then just barely 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:27.290
 a bit of white pepper and now this wise 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.160
 it is the first time that he does so 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.160
 proof of the truth 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.259
 great as a pope 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:54.640
 that change the tagliolini na magnata 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:57.000
 villas and it is hard for everyone to give 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.000
 Hello
