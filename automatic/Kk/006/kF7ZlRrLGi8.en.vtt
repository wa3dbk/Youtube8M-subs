like just digging and everything like
that<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.210> weird<00:01:15.920> um<00:01:16.920> they<00:01:17.909> there<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.360> mod

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that is so weird um they there was a mod

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
that is so weird um they there was a mod
like<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.960> before<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.840> came<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.710> can't

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like this before that came out I can't

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.850 
like this before that came out I can't
it<00:01:23.700> kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> did<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> same<00:01:24.299> thing<00:01:24.560> but<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it kind of did the same thing but I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.249 
it kind of did the same thing but I
think<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.549> kind<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:27.960> think

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
think it got kind of I don't think

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
think it got kind of I don't think
anybody<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:28.860> used<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:29.909> think

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
anybody really used it and I don't think

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.520 
anybody really used it and I don't think
it<00:01:30.180> was<00:01:30.240> all<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.509> great<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.380> has

this is one of those things that adds
quite<00:04:04.879> a<00:04:05.000> lot<00:04:05.269> without<00:04:05.780> add<00:04:06.140> actually<00:04:06.680> adding

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
quite a lot without add actually adding

see<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:13.340> know<00:04:13.459> maybe<00:04:13.700> adding<00:04:14.239> back<00:04:14.450> the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
see is you know maybe adding back the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.979 
see is you know maybe adding back the
underground<00:04:15.440> mine<00:04:15.920> shafts<00:04:16.310> and<00:04:16.850> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
underground mine shafts and the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.560 
underground mine shafts and the
fortresses<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.019> stuff<00:04:18.350> like<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:19.359> also<00:04:20.359> it

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
fortresses and stuff like that also it

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.090 
fortresses and stuff like that also it
can<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.810> very<00:04:20.979> very<00:04:21.979> rough<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:23.800> try<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> fight

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
can be very very rough to try to fight

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.879 
can be very very rough to try to fight
off<00:04:25.250> monsters<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:26.000> a<00:04:26.060> 2d<00:04:26.330> perspective<00:04:26.900> uh<00:04:27.800> I

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
off monsters and a 2d perspective uh I

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.500 
off monsters and a 2d perspective uh I
actually<00:04:28.370> became<00:04:28.699> nighttime<00:04:29.180> when<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:29.360> was

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
actually became nighttime when I was

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.070 
actually became nighttime when I was
making<00:04:29.780> this<00:04:29.870> video<00:04:30.020> earlier<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:32.020> wish<00:04:33.020> I

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
making this video earlier and I wish I

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.290 
making this video earlier and I wish I
could<00:04:33.229> get<00:04:33.350> out<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:33.620> perspective<00:04:37.300> but

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
could get out of this perspective but

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.350 
could get out of this perspective but
anyway<00:04:38.539> guys<00:04:38.720> uh<00:04:39.639> you<00:04:40.639> know<00:04:40.760> I<00:04:40.789> want<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.180> see<00:04:41.300> in

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
anyway guys uh you know I want to see in

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.820 
anyway guys uh you know I want to see in
the<00:04:41.449> ad<00:04:41.600> back<00:04:41.840> in<00:04:42.050> those<00:04:42.169> features<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
the ad back in those features and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.260 
the ad back in those features and
everything<00:04:43.100> like<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.610> I<00:04:44.030> think<00:04:44.060> that

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
everything like that and I think that

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.570 
everything like that and I think that
would<00:04:44.330> be<00:04:44.419> really<00:04:44.449> sweet<00:04:44.810> if<00:04:45.590> they<00:04:46.520> could

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
would be really sweet if they could

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.920 
would be really sweet if they could
actually<00:04:46.880> implement<00:04:47.720> their<00:04:48.320> own<00:04:49.720> system<00:04:50.720> of

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
actually implement their own system of

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.760 
actually implement their own system of
like<00:04:51.520> generating<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:53.930> know<00:04:54.050> structures<00:04:54.560> and

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
like generating you know structures and

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.409 
like generating you know structures and
things<00:04:54.919> like<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.070> maybe<00:04:55.400> add<00:04:55.639> some<00:04:55.669> in<00:04:56.150> and

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
things like that maybe add some in and

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.810 
things like that maybe add some in and
maybe<00:04:57.289> make<00:04:57.560> it<00:04:57.680> easier<00:04:58.160> to<00:04:58.340> start<00:04:58.580> out

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
maybe make it easier to start out

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.450 
maybe make it easier to start out
because<00:04:59.479> I<00:04:59.990> started<00:05:00.500> out<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:00.620> a<00:05:00.740> world<00:05:00.979> but<00:05:01.250> did

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
because I started out on a world but did

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.370 
because I started out on a world but did
not<00:05:01.610> have<00:05:01.880> any<00:05:02.210> trees<00:05:02.539> obviously<00:05:03.110> this<00:05:03.229> one

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
not have any trees obviously this one

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.650 
not have any trees obviously this one
has<00:05:03.530> plenty<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.830> trees<00:05:04.070> since<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.090> started<00:05:05.419> in

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
has plenty of trees since I started in

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.560 
has plenty of trees since I started in
the<00:05:06.229> two<00:05:06.410> by<00:05:06.560> two<00:05:08.139> forest<00:05:09.139> jungle<00:05:10.210> biome<00:05:11.210> thing

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
the two by two forest jungle biome thing

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.089 
the two by two forest jungle biome thing
I<00:05:11.750> think<00:05:11.810> I<00:05:12.229> don't<00:05:12.410> know<00:05:12.500> I'm<00:05:12.680> not<00:05:12.740> really<00:05:12.830> all

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
I think I don't know I'm not really all

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.520 
I think I don't know I'm not really all
that<00:05:13.130> positive<00:05:13.370> but<00:05:13.760> anyway<00:05:14.240> guys<00:05:14.410> links<00:05:15.410> will
