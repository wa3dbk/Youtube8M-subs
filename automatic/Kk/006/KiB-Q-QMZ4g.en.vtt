 the youtubers and the first chapter we're going 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.109
 to do with Mr. tiparraco who has 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 a trolley channel today we're going to see how 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.909
 works and with what computer works here 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.199
 at home no and good tiparraco no good 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.840
 we will show you first computer 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.000
 we have here 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 This is Mr. Tiparraco's computer 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.360
 is configured by 15 or 16 gb of ram 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.600
 an amd graphics card from a source 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.120
 550 feed and how much does it have to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.030
 hard disk a terabyte and a half I think 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.710
 a theme and a half is worth it then we go to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.650
 go a little with tiparraco to ask 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 good you put there you give him to subscribe 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.760
 and click on the ads to collect 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.610
 good pasta because then to the idea of 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.940
 small expands Mr. tiparraco to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:48.140
 give me paypal and they left him with 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 the description the good paypal is that it is 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 that we have here is the pro android 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.370
 of Mr. yum and Mr. de orito 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.490
 tickets and well let's continue a little 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.680
 with this it's not good that it came first 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.960
 what inspired you does not share the computer 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.790
 which is the purpose for which it leaves you 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.990
 buy it where you bought it if all that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:12.920
 ok I had before one worked with 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.160
 a small laptop some ask one of 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.020
 these minis that are minis and yes that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.550
 edited and with sony vegas I was going pretty 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.880
 Flojete said nothing is time to 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.260
 buy yourself a piece of pc and that's what 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.260
 what did I do? I went to pc 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 do not 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.450
 the component component no no no 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.930
 we make that pcbox and I started box me 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.340
 recommended this and the truth that I can 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.100
 say I'm half happy because my 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.800
 channel if in my face there is no problem then 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.930
 they're bastards because I spent a thousand 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.640
 euros to use the sony vegas 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.160
 expressly and to be able to play and 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.280
 it turns out that every time I put the sony 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.940
 vegas cp is always peta thousand euros 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.260
 wasted I have tab os cabrones 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.450
 because the record is to recognize that 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.610
 check the computer a year and a half ago 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.310
 computer of these characteristics the 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.680
 mold say that we have a 7,750 of a 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
 giga of ram from a source of 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.760
 550 tan cesc power that already 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.320
 you know that it is not without certificate 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.350
 of course this will be a performance 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.510
 of 400 350 since it is not a very brand 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.200
 recommended in the box as you can see 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.550
 It's very normal, it's good and good, well, 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.160
 computer thousand euros because it is always 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.720
 this aspect is not not that that happens by 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.660
 do not see budgets 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.900
 If I had seen this, it would not have happened 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.820
 but good now what is the future that 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.070
 you have thought you are going to modify the pct the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.380
 future change something and I turn away from the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.580
 advice that you have given me that is a 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.990
 specialist in this subject the first thing that 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.610
 I'm going to do is change the screen 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.710
 because I'm working with a 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.470
 television is a normal television 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.700
 completely normal I would need 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:04.010
 buy me a monitor 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.319
 because then if I would need a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.569
 monitor more than a television 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.680
 television a better monitor because it says 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 loquillo that forces the graph and that's 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.769
 what makes it possible to tighten the sony 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.769
 vegas 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.280
 so very sensual back 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.750
 Well then, well, really after 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.699
 which is going to change and such the computer 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.319
 tiparraco well we already know with what 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.330
 work for you with your house with what pc 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.039

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.479
 interview more people in plan than to 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.800

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.419
 record to edit where they bought it 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.039
