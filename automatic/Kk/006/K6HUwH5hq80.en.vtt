00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
province so now we'll just go over you

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.959

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
little things that have been tripping

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.990 
little things that have been tripping
people<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.129> should<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> go

people up and we should be good to go
from<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:46.079> start<00:00:46.260> from<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> south

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
from there we will start from the south

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.840 
from there we will start from the south
just<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.510> it'll<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.930> easier<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.230> count<00:00:49.410> up

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
just because it'll be easier to count up

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
just because it'll be easier to count up
so<00:00:50.850> we'll<00:00:51.329> start<00:00:51.510> number<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> task

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so we'll start number one of the task

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.619 
so we'll start number one of the task
will<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:54.030> east<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> Sun

let's<00:02:05.219> say<00:02:05.369> southwest<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> hexane<00:02:06.719> regard

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
let's say southwest of the hexane regard

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.490 
let's say southwest of the hexane regard
or<00:02:07.469> north<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.520> art<00:02:08.729> agon<00:02:09.030> woods<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:10.229> pretty

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
or north of the art agon woods so pretty

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.690 
or north of the art agon woods so pretty
much<00:02:10.619> dead<00:02:10.830> center<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.250> little<00:02:11.459> area<00:02:11.610> right

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
much dead center this little area right

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.460 
much dead center this little area right
here

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
here

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.320 
here
and<00:02:12.530> number<00:02:12.800> 16<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.490> pretty<00:02:13.760> much<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
and number 16 is pretty much in the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.320 
and number 16 is pretty much in the
hexane<00:02:14.780> regard<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.340> that'll<00:02:16.730> be<00:02:16.820> all<00:02:16.910> 16<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
hexane regard so that'll be all 16 of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.710 
hexane regard so that'll be all 16 of
them<00:02:17.570> there<00:02:17.780> are<00:02:17.810> 16<00:02:18.260> tasks<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.720> they're

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
them there are 16 tasks and they're

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.540 
them there are 16 tasks and they're
fairly<00:02:20.990> easy<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.290> find<00:02:21.470> I'm<00:02:21.740> just<00:02:22.190> exploring

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
fairly easy to find I'm just exploring

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.590 
fairly easy to find I'm just exploring

from the video the way to get to that
point<00:02:40.220> of<00:02:40.430> interest<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.990> go<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
point of interest is you have to go to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.170 
point of interest is you have to go to
this<00:02:42.800> point<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.190> interest<00:02:43.520> at<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> transfer

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
this point of interest at the transfer

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.430 
this point of interest at the transfer
gate<00:02:44.360> you're<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:44.990> walk<00:02:45.140> through<00:02:45.350> this

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
gate you're going to walk through this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.449 
gate you're going to walk through this
path<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.070> going<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> little

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
path and it's going to be a little

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.190 
path and it's going to be a little
teleporter<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.330> teleporter<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.050> going

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
teleporter and that teleporter is going

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.290 
teleporter and that teleporter is going
to<00:02:48.260> pop<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.709> right<00:02:49.100> back<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.820> can

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
to pop you right back here and you can

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.000 
to pop you right back here and you can
just<00:02:50.660> score<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.110> point<00:02:51.320> of<00:02:51.410> interest<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.890> be

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
just score that point of interest and be

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.750 
just score that point of interest and be
good<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> go<00:02:52.370> um<00:02:53.440> what<00:02:54.440> else<00:02:54.550> there<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
good to go um what else there is a

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.170 
good to go um what else there is a
tricky<00:02:56.540> little<00:02:56.980> Vista<00:02:57.980> that's<00:02:58.520> hard<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:59.150> I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
tricky little Vista that's hard that I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.210 
tricky little Vista that's hard that I
guess<00:02:59.510> took<00:03:00.290> me<00:03:00.500> a<00:03:00.530> little<00:03:00.650> while<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.890> find

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
guess took me a little while to find

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.690 
guess took me a little while to find
it's<00:03:01.490> in<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.060> wild<00:03:02.450> flame<00:03:02.750> caverns<00:03:03.490> so<00:03:04.490> pretty

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
it's in the wild flame caverns so pretty

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.620 
it's in the wild flame caverns so pretty
much<00:03:04.820> you're<00:03:04.940> going<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.090> teleport<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.570> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
much you're going to teleport to the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.970 
much you're going to teleport to the
store<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:05.959> draw<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.440> you're<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:06.830> going<00:03:06.950> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
store and draw and you're just going to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.350 
store and draw and you're just going to
run<00:03:07.250> here<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:07.850> there'll<00:03:08.000> be<00:03:08.030> a<00:03:08.150> little

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
run here and there'll be a little

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.120 
run here and there'll be a little
pathway<00:03:08.540> right<00:03:08.990> along<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.740> that'll<00:03:09.980> get

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
pathway right along here and that'll get

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.680 
pathway right along here and that'll get
you<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.430> it<00:03:11.000> took<00:03:11.180> me<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.330> little<00:03:11.450> bit<00:03:11.570> of

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
you there it took me a little bit of

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.330 
you there it took me a little bit of
while<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.959> find<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.560> actually<00:03:12.890> didn't

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
while to find that I actually didn't

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.220 
while to find that I actually didn't
know<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.550> was<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:13.970> place<00:03:14.630> that<00:03:14.660> they<00:03:14.990> would

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
know this was a place that they would

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.560 
know this was a place that they would
actually<00:03:15.560> put<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:15.830> Vista<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:16.489> they<00:03:17.150> did<00:03:17.390> put

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
actually put a Vista but they did put

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.430 
actually put a Vista but they did put
one<00:03:17.720> there<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:19.430> was<00:03:19.550> also<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:21.200> the

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
one there and there was also for the

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.570 
one there and there was also for the
Golem<00:03:22.450> engineer<00:03:23.450> or<00:03:23.660> something<00:03:24.080> like<00:03:24.170> that

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
Golem engineer or something like that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.759 
Golem engineer or something like that
if<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.030> teleport<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.050> quatl<00:03:27.410> Waypoint

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
if you teleport to the quatl Waypoint

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.430 
if you teleport to the quatl Waypoint
there's<00:03:28.489> an<00:03:28.610> entrance<00:03:29.000> about<00:03:29.269> right<00:03:29.630> here<00:03:30.380> I

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
there's an entrance about right here I

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.259 
there's an entrance about right here I
believe<00:03:30.890> and<00:03:31.160> this<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.640> going<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.850> go<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.150> you

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
believe and this is going to go in you

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.970 
believe and this is going to go in you
have<00:03:32.300> to<00:03:32.450> do<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> little<00:03:32.690> jumping<00:03:33.260> things<00:03:33.769> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
have to do a little jumping things and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.320 
have to do a little jumping things and
you're<00:03:34.070> going<00:03:34.160> to<00:03:34.250> go<00:03:34.400> into<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.670> teleporter

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
you're going to go into a teleporter

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.699 
you're going to go into a teleporter
with<00:03:35.780> when<00:03:35.930> you're<00:03:36.050> in<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.230> teleporter<00:03:36.650> you

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
with when you're in that teleporter you

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.630 
with when you're in that teleporter you
have<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.890> do<00:03:36.980> three<00:03:37.250> attunement<00:03:38.120> jumping

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
have to do three attunement jumping

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.830 
have to do three attunement jumping
jumping<00:03:40.640> puzzles<00:03:41.030> which<00:03:41.209> are<00:03:41.390> actually

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
jumping puzzles which are actually

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.270 
jumping puzzles which are actually
pretty<00:03:42.080> difficult<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:42.769> know<00:03:42.860> you<00:03:42.920> have<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
pretty difficult you know you have to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.220 
pretty difficult you know you have to
make<00:03:43.489> sure<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:43.700> get<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.690> puzzles<00:03:45.080> around

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
make sure you get a the puzzles around

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.600 
make sure you get a the puzzles around
because<00:03:45.470> there's<00:03:45.650> wind<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.160> knocks<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.519> off

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
because there's wind that knocks you off

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.190 
because there's wind that knocks you off
of<00:03:46.820> vines<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.360> then<00:03:47.510> there's<00:03:47.660> lightning<00:03:48.080> that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
of vines and then there's lightning that

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.020 
of vines and then there's lightning that
hit<00:03:48.410> stuff<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.040> when<00:03:49.310> you're<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.519> combat<00:03:49.880> you

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
hit stuff so when you're in combat you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.720 
hit stuff so when you're in combat you
move<00:03:50.269> you<00:03:50.870> know<00:03:50.989> slower<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.160> it's<00:03:52.340> harder<00:03:52.610> to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
move you know slower so it's harder to

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.000 
move you know slower so it's harder to
jump<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.750> that's<00:03:54.080> actually<00:03:54.380> pretty<00:03:54.500> fun<00:03:54.769> at

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
jump so that's actually pretty fun at

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.320 
jump so that's actually pretty fun at
the<00:03:55.130> end<00:03:55.250> of<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.549> do<00:03:55.700> get<00:03:55.880> some<00:03:56.120> nice

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
the end of it you do get some nice

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.330 
the end of it you do get some nice
rewards<00:03:56.900> unfortunately<00:03:57.530> salvaged<00:03:58.040> all<00:03:58.220> of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
rewards unfortunately salvaged all of

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.130 
rewards unfortunately salvaged all of
them<00:03:58.489> we<00:03:59.150> do<00:03:59.269> get<00:03:59.420> some<00:03:59.510> nice<00:03:59.660> Awards<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.019> get

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
them we do get some nice Awards you get

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.810 
them we do get some nice Awards you get
a<00:04:00.170> big<00:04:00.350> chunk<00:04:00.560> of<00:04:00.650> exp<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.549> get<00:04:01.700> some

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
a big chunk of exp and you get some

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.910 
a big chunk of exp and you get some
achievement<00:04:02.239> unlocks<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:03.230> that's<00:04:03.739> always

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
achievement unlocks so that's always

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.030 
achievement unlocks so that's always
good<00:04:05.049> but<00:04:06.049> that<00:04:06.230> will<00:04:06.320> probably<00:04:06.440> do<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:06.890> for

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
good but that will probably do it for

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.400 
good but that will probably do it for
the<00:04:07.820> metrico<00:04:08.330> province<00:04:08.810> I<00:04:09.019> mean<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.320> was

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
the metrico province I mean it was

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.610 
the metrico province I mean it was
pretty<00:04:09.920> straightforward<00:04:10.870> this<00:04:11.870> skill<00:04:12.380> point

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
pretty straightforward this skill point

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.780 
pretty straightforward this skill point
I<00:04:12.769> have<00:04:12.920> seen<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.100> lot<00:04:13.280> of<00:04:13.400> people<00:04:13.640> for<00:04:13.760> some

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
I have seen a lot of people for some

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.820 
I have seen a lot of people for some
reason<00:04:14.120> they're<00:04:14.239> unable<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.690> find<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.170> it's

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
reason they're unable to find it it's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.039 
reason they're unable to find it it's
not<00:04:15.950> actually<00:04:16.280> on<00:04:16.549> top<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.780> place

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
not actually on top of this place

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.840 
not actually on top of this place
there's<00:04:18.650> actually<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.070> little<00:04:19.190> pathway<00:04:19.489> about

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
there's actually a little pathway about

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.670 
there's actually a little pathway about
right<00:04:20.090> here<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.599> leads<00:04:20.780> underneath<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.530> and

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
right here that leads underneath it and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.650 
right here that leads underneath it and
that's<00:04:22.280> where<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.610> find<00:04:22.789> that<00:04:23.030> skill<00:04:23.390> point

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
that's where you find that skill point

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.050 
that's where you find that skill point
but<00:04:24.590> everything<00:04:24.890> else<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.250> pretty<00:04:25.430> much<00:04:25.640> just

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
but everything else is pretty much just

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.379 
but everything else is pretty much just
laid

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
laid

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.670 
laid
out<00:04:26.449> for<00:04:26.689> you<00:04:26.840> no<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.020> just<00:04:27.289> run<00:04:27.409> around<00:04:27.499> the

out for you no you just run around the

easy<00:04:29.300> point<00:04:29.629> of<00:04:29.719> interest<00:04:29.960> you'll<00:04:30.169> be<00:04:30.259> able<00:04:30.319> to

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 
easy point of interest you'll be able to

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.429 
easy point of interest you'll be able to
get<00:04:30.560> to<00:04:30.680> easy<00:04:30.889> your<00:04:31.099> vistas<00:04:31.490> pretty<00:04:32.300> basic<00:04:32.449> not

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:35.949 
too bad of any jumping quests and

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.200 
too bad of any jumping quests and
that'll<00:04:36.949> be<00:04:37.189> about<00:04:37.610> it

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
that'll be about it

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.330 
that'll be about it
so<00:04:38.569> in<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.900> next<00:04:38.990> video<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.499> will<00:04:39.740> be<00:04:39.979> moving<00:04:40.099> up

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
so in the next video I will be moving up

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.989 
so in the next video I will be moving up
to<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.490> Brisbane<00:04:40.909> wild<00:04:41.270> lands<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:41.779> I<00:04:42.169> will<00:04:42.349> be

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 
to the Brisbane wild lands and I will be

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.279 
to the Brisbane wild lands and I will be
hopefully<00:04:43.999> going<00:04:44.360> for<00:04:44.569> a<00:04:44.629> hundred<00:04:44.870> percent<00:04:44.960> in

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
hopefully going for a hundred percent in

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.469 
hopefully going for a hundred percent in
