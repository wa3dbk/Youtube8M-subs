00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
at all times and I don't think that's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.899 
at all times and I don't think that's
ever<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> change<00:01:53.819> as<00:01:54.420> I've<00:01:55.140> read<00:01:55.409> online

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
ever going to change as I've read online

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:02.429 
vision that's just how it is so but you

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.630 
vision that's just how it is so but you
adjust<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.950> they're<00:02:04.950> actually<00:02:05.369> quite

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
adjust to it and they're actually quite

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.389 
adjust to it and they're actually quite
comfortable<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.200> most<00:02:07.440> part<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.069> if

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
comfortable for the most part but if

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.039 
comfortable for the most part but if
you're<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.030> getting<00:02:09.269> them<00:02:09.569> for<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> first

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
you're just getting them for the first

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.570 
you're just getting them for the first
time<00:02:10.350> we<00:02:10.560> don't<00:02:10.679> expect<00:02:11.190> them<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
time we don't expect them to be

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.140 
time we don't expect them to be
comfortable<00:02:12.110> because<00:02:13.160> they're<00:02:14.160> kind<00:02:15.030> of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
comfortable because they're kind of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600 
comfortable because they're kind of
crazy<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.660> get<00:02:15.750> used<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> beginning<00:02:17.010> so

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
crazy to get used to in the beginning so

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.640 
crazy to get used to in the beginning so
if<00:02:17.910> you're<00:02:18.120> wearing<00:02:18.330> them<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.780> long<00:02:18.959> extended

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
if you're wearing them for long extended

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.740 
if you're wearing them for long extended
periods<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.220> time<00:02:20.330> they're<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.630> get

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
periods of time they're going to get

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.740 
periods of time they're going to get

nearly as difficult to get out as you
would<00:04:44.900> think<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:45.500> lot<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.340> people<00:04:46.610> say<00:04:46.820> that

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
would think a lot of people say that

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.940 
would think a lot of people say that
actually<00:04:47.450> scolaire<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> razor<00:04:48.290> pop<00:04:48.740> out

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
actually scolaire is a razor pop out

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.340

than<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.340> normal<00:04:49.850> contact<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:50.840> if<00:04:50.990> you're<00:04:51.140> used

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
than a normal contact so if you're used

than a normal contact so if you're used
to<00:04:51.500> having<00:04:51.680> contacts<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.700> know<00:04:52.850> how<00:04:53.000> to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
to having contacts and you know how to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.390 
to having contacts and you know how to
take<00:04:53.330> them<00:04:53.600> out<00:04:53.780> it's<00:04:54.770> going<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.070> be<00:04:55.190> pretty

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
take them out it's going to be pretty

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.640 
take them out it's going to be pretty
simple<00:04:55.820> for<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:56.150> however<00:04:56.870> for<00:04:57.169> someone<00:04:57.470> who's

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
simple for you however for someone who's

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.920 
simple for you however for someone who's
never<00:04:57.770> worn<00:04:58.160> contacts<00:04:58.669> before<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.510> had

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
never worn contacts before and I had

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.969 
never worn contacts before and I had
never<00:05:00.080> worn<00:05:00.440> contacts<00:05:01.040> before<00:05:02.200> it's<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.830> little

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
never worn contacts before it's a little

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.420 
never worn contacts before it's a little
tricky<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:04.970> get<00:05:05.180> used<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.479> but<00:05:06.169> it's<00:05:06.740> not<00:05:06.860> bad

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
tricky to get used to but it's not bad

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.630 
tricky to get used to but it's not bad
so<00:05:08.200> another<00:05:09.200> thing<00:05:09.530> with<00:05:09.919> scolaire<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.430> you

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
so another thing with scolaire is you

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.850 
so another thing with scolaire is you
name<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.510> should<00:05:11.630> get<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.810> bigger<00:05:11.990> case<00:05:12.350> than<00:05:12.770> a

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
name you should get a bigger case than a

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.000 
name you should get a bigger case than a
normal<00:05:13.190> contact<00:05:13.580> case<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:14.600> keep<00:05:14.780> them<00:05:15.020> in<00:05:15.169> this

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
normal contact case to keep them in this

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.640 
normal contact case to keep them in this
is<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.460> one<00:05:16.610> I<00:05:16.850> use<00:05:17.210> a<00:05:17.510> little<00:05:17.930> larger<00:05:18.320> than<00:05:18.530> a

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
is the one I use a little larger than a

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.700 
is the one I use a little larger than a
normal<00:05:19.040> one<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:19.340> as<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> can<00:05:20.330> see<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:21.050> pretty

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
normal one and as you can see it pretty

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.090 
normal one and as you can see it pretty
much<00:05:22.130> fills<00:05:22.610> it<00:05:22.820> up<00:05:23.050> so<00:05:24.050> definitely<00:05:24.860> think

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
much fills it up so definitely think

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.550 
much fills it up so definitely think
ahead<00:05:25.220> if<00:05:25.640> you're<00:05:25.790> buying<00:05:26.090> them<00:05:26.479> you<00:05:27.350> don't

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
ahead if you're buying them you don't

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.520 
ahead if you're buying them you don't
want<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.860> not<00:05:28.490> have<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:29.090> case<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:30.020> put<00:05:30.229> them<00:05:30.410> in

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
want to not have a case to put them in

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.590 
want to not have a case to put them in
that<00:05:30.710> will<00:05:30.860> fit<00:05:31.220> them<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.820> you<00:05:32.390> definitely

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
that will fit them and you definitely

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.570 
that will fit them and you definitely
don't<00:05:32.990> want<00:05:33.140> to<00:05:33.169> put<00:05:33.320> it<00:05:33.440> in<00:05:33.560> too<00:05:33.770> small<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.310> the

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
don't want to put it in too small of the

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.969 
don't want to put it in too small of the
case<00:05:34.820> because<00:05:35.630> it<00:05:35.750> can<00:05:35.840> damage<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.410> lens<00:05:36.620> I

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
case because it can damage the lens I

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.940
