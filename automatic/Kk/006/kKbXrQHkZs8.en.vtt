00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.959
 let's start with the cooking workshop 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.959
 that we are going to have a sushi workshop today 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.640
 we cook all together people who do not know 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.380
 know each other we had a great time not 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.510
 we must forget that there is a background 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.430
 didactic perez partner to have fun and 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.739
 to be fun and especially when 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.340
 you want to convey that cooking is 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.340
 funny 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.730
 I was surprised by what history is 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.290
 of ft to do is to cook food not 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.649
 I like to cook at home I never 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.710
 I do but tonight here has been something 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.379
 nice simple I do not know if it should be for 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.879
 also because of the environment because there is a 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.879
 spiritual guide 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.450
 the kitchen has become the heart 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.820
 from our homes the stay where 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.220
 more time we spend where we are with 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 our family we received friends a 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.760
 dinner starts or ends with a few drinks and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.250
 the kitchen and every time people 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.080
 we are also more worried because not 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 just for knowing how to cook but to know what 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.150
 we eat in the subject of taking care of health 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.050
 etcetera and there is a growing interest for 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.330
 everything that has to do with the 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.420
 gastronomy also within our 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.420
 houses 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's more interactive do not you feel and that 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.790
 you attend to do something you and talk to 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.800
 the people and this is greatly appreciated and 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.090
 certainly the professionals teach you 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.090
 something that you did not know 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.780
 all the appliances are 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.400
 Domestic furniture are domestic 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.870
 the ovens are domestic the kitchens of 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.490
 domestic induction this is not a 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:03.550
 professional kitchen 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.720
 these are domestic kitchens the truth 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.030
 what a super nice we have spent 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.660
 super well cooking and now let's prepare 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.740

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.740
 Let's see 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.760
