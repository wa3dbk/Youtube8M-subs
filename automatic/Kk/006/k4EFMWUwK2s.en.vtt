so<00:00:36.290> vitamin<00:00:37.290> C<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> necessary<00:00:38.790> element<00:00:39.000> by

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
so vitamin C is a necessary element by

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
so vitamin C is a necessary element by
the<00:00:39.510> body<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> only<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.430> know

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the body it's one of the only you know

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
the body it's one of the only you know
nutrients<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> body<00:00:42.360> can't<00:00:42.899> derive<00:00:43.290> by

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
nutrients that the body can't derive by

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860 
nutrients that the body can't derive by
itself<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.579> therefore<00:00:45.149> we<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.660> get<00:00:45.780> it

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
itself so therefore we have to get it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.330
