00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.059 
to where as in from my understanding
wladimir<00:05:41.060> klitschko<00:05:41.240> is<00:05:41.810> not<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:42.860> this<00:05:42.919> is

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 
wladimir klitschko is not and this is

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.350 
wladimir klitschko is not and this is
not<00:05:43.190> the<00:05:43.310> first<00:05:43.340> time<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:43.849> has<00:05:44.000> come<00:05:44.150> up<00:05:44.210> now

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
not the first time this has come up now

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.450 
not the first time this has come up now
but<00:05:44.630> i<00:05:44.659> think<00:05:44.870> vitamin<00:05:45.229> Chris<00:05:45.380> was<00:05:45.620> clean<00:05:45.889> yes

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
but i think vitamin Chris was clean yes

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.969 
but i think vitamin Chris was clean yes
because<00:05:46.819> he's<00:05:47.000> just<00:05:47.380> if<00:05:48.380> you<00:05:48.560> look<00:05:48.650> at<00:05:48.770> one<00:05:48.949> of

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
because he's just if you look at one of

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.769 
because he's just if you look at one of
the<00:05:49.069> sky<00:05:49.370> he's<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:49.729> he's<00:05:49.940> so<00:05:50.000> intelligent<00:05:50.419> he's

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:50.779 
the sky he's so he's so intelligent he's

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:52.809 
the sky he's so he's so intelligent he's
so<00:05:50.930> smart<00:05:51.259> you<00:05:51.560> know<00:05:51.620> fluent<00:05:52.250> in<00:05:52.400> multiple
