00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
basic idea of how everything works and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.500 
basic idea of how everything works and
i'm<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:51.960> good<00:02:52.200> at<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.380> song<00:02:52.590> sign<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.100> out

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.580 

although<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.810> going<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.110> be<00:02:58.170> driving<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
although it's going to be driving a

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560 
although it's going to be driving a
whole<00:02:58.770> bunch<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> roles<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.490> citizens<00:02:59.970> didn't

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
whole bunch of roles and citizens didn't

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.830 
whole bunch of roles and citizens didn't
know<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.230> this<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.440> alma<00:03:01.800> sensitive<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.840> I'm

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
know and this is alma sensitive so I'm

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.780 
know and this is alma sensitive so I'm
getting<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.739> midi<00:03:05.190> cable<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> fix<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.620> from

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
getting the midi cable to fix that from

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.460 
getting the midi cable to fix that from
neversoft<00:03:08.790> itself<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.480> anyway<00:03:10.080> check<00:03:10.350> this

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
neversoft itself so anyway check this

00:03:10.470 --> 00:04:19.379 
neversoft itself so anyway check this
out

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.699 

and<00:04:20.389> that's<00:04:20.540> pretty<00:04:20.660> much<00:04:20.780> how<00:04:21.019> it<00:04:21.049> works<00:04:21.320> so

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
and that's pretty much how it works so

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.670 
and that's pretty much how it works so
as<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.190> can<00:04:22.310> see<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.790> does<00:04:23.240> work<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:23.960> if<00:04:24.200> you

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
as you can see it does work so if you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.990 
as you can see it does work so if you
want<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.889> use<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.160> world<00:04:25.370> tour<00:04:25.610> kit<00:04:25.639> on
