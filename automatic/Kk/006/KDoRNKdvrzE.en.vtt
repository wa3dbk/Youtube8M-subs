00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.580
 so this video will be about how 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.370
 change the water pump but let's start by 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.549
 order of how to determine that it can 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.520
 be water pump 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:23.369
 car 2008 toyota prius american 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:28.320
 body 20 over time I have become 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:31.380
 light up icons this this icon 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.270
 and in the network the window naturally 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.160
 the triangle has been bothering me for a long time 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.260
 that this car did not want to go squeaking and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 refused to move further cost 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.809
 stop the car at all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.690
 little and all these mistakes they disappeared and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.840
 the car could go but again not long 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.350
 time drove to the diagnosis I got 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.359
 error description is c 1241 system 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 power supply error function also c 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.149
 2318 power supply is not enough 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.420
 stresses 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.040
 but both of these mistakes are bullshit 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 as they stem from this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 the next 3 errors are p0 and a 93 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.850
 the inverter cooling system is just 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 still says that it is covered 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 water pump 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 This is a mistake due to the fact that the inverter 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.729
 heated motor no longer 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.229
 cools for not working this 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.210
 water pump 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.180
 popped up there are the following errors like 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.439
 check the workers you and the company or not 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.240
 even without paying money for 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.210
 diagnostics is very simple 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.210
 car car start 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.670
 come to the tank 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.280
 while the machines are turned off the liquid cask 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.040
 should stand smoothly and not move but 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.310
 when you have a car like me 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.310
 now 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 if you pay attention hope you will 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.780
 you can see the liquid in the tank it boils 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.550
 not calm or in 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.880
 motionless state she rages 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.730
 literally as if you are boiling 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.430
 pan on gas in this case your 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.670
 water pump working if you do this 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.550
 bubbling don't not notice then your 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.760
 water pump came to an end 0 and damn 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.110
 or do you have clogged pipes ? 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.450
 you got clogged pipes 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.440
 the pump will automatically burn too 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.290
 how does a water pump change here 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.350
 plastic pull that holds 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.630
 I already took it off on plastic rivets 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.660
 very complicated 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.940
 next we see the motor mount or 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.750
 electric inverter which need 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.200
 will unscrew 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.000
 this is the first bolt here the second bolt here 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 also back there 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.650
 you will see if there is a flashlight 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.109
 another goal that keeps this 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.940
 the engine is not completely twist it 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.840
 need it need to loosen at least on 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 several centuries 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 for what so that when you him 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.810
 loosen and you can for this lever 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.440
 pulling the lift up about inverter 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.840
 from a TV somewhere five centimeters 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.640
 nestle something so that it is no longer 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.870
 sat down in that case it will be convenient for you 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 take off the pump itself pump here she get 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.250
 until it, too, I was not so difficult to even more 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.709
 I did not have time to tighten this new pump 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.489
 last third bolt she keeps everything 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.850
 on three bolts 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:45.150
 boldly unscrew them unplug the chip 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.170
 and it turns out through this hole here 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.090
 here and here is her husband here 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.549
 inverter 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.430
 pull out well and already there it is further 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.590
 easy to shoot royally set 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.870
 new but put on a new pump 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.109
 nipples back also you her 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.569
 thrust and fasten here even 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.820
 principle, you can not not soared to the account 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.620
 tank even just hold on 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.510
 running pump in her hands she vibrates 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.750
 my completely 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.720
 died and since you see it is easy 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.370
 if you have changed the pads at least once 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.550
 your car is even more so 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.250
 change remember that when working 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.190
 pump when the machine is on 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.400
 the fluid in this tank should always 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.479
 seethe if seething is not observed 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:38.479
 it means your pump broke and 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.280
 it changes as you see very easily and 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.330
 no problem put her back 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.940
 twisted set back inverter 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.460
 spun and you can go like this 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.990
 way changes the water pump on toyota 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.990
 prius 20 bodywork
