00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:10.730
 So today I show you a short time 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.440
 another recipe what i am looking for 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.869
 has done fast if you do not 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.689
 has a lot of time to eat completely 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:24.169
 normal the key and then the 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:36.680
 look great on maximum level with it 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:38.030
 that's right the panama be because 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.700
 I look down his 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.950
 for that I have made myself very easily 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.180
 normal white rice this time somehow 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.150
 I had time today relish on white rice 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.160
 because every day always these these 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.400
 Brown rice does not taste that either 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.610
 more 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.590
 and finally comes uncle ben's 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.970
 again brought 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.220
 like coconut curry I do that 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.230
 now just mixed in the rice 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.360
 with the rice a bit then comes 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.380
 besides that comes chicken and 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.650
 then I look the same again what is 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.740
 in the freezer then I'll do it 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.360
 also a little vegetable pure and it 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.500
 falls to work is always again 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 really a little bit diverse 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.050
 because to bring in the nutrition also from 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.909
 taste 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.260
 if you are the same every day now 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.690
 be both remember then taste the well 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.860
 just not that way I'm doing now 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.360
 the same food and then I show 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.430
 Just do it again when it's done 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.460
 time for everything was now 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.190
 maybe 20 minutes 25 minutes maximum 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.300
 so now for the first time, it does 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.500
 Unfortunately, video is a bit 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.220
 I apologize 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.780
 ever for that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.510
 I'll show you something very briefly 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.240
 I have used exactly here and 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.060
 Although I have good and medica here 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.720
 cheap you see it chicken 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.420
 sliced 5 109 grams for three euros 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.970
 80 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.670
 I've used a spice for this 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.150
 with cupboard end of main places in 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.119
 the kitchen 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.500
 i have used to asia mixture for a long time 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.900
 and you can not see who's recording 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.680
 but I always make sure that I'm in 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.680
 my spices 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.450
 one that there are no flavor enhancers 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.070
 or spice extract or all of this 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.740
 odd terms which one as a layman 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.270
 nothing else i can try that 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.280
 mostly let out very well too 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.830
 I can also recommend you now 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.540
 also with edeka 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.700
 there is the German ready spices that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.140
 nothing in it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 Her looks could be absolutely pure 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.440
 ingredients very important to me right now 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.770
 me as a man human which everyone very much 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.810
 picky on it if I'm anything with 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.950
 Flavors the Markish immediately 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.000
 I love you and so on 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.650
 That's why I have to take special care 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.670
 respect, think highly of 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.260
 yes the cockerel maybe I have with 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.140
 mixed with the spice then I still have 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.850
 a bit of olive oil added to that 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.340
 all because as I said at the highest level 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.510
 sear 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.400
 a few minutes the looks like this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 that's enough for tomorrow 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.290
 probably that's it too 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.480
 same 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.180
 i would like the same with the and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.040
 events coconut curry and gives 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.209
 the rice and a bit more with why 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.390
 I show you my cordial so far 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.610
 freezer makes a bit of a 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.269
 vegetable pan found danger and around 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.900
 services also eternal white again 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.510
 I have everything in my super i have 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.950
 indeed brought me a glass of can you 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.500
 give it a try I think the food 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.530
 tastes of glass somehow better 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.150
 I do not know why but from glass 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.150
 the food tastes fresh and tasty 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.430
 that may just be imagination 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.980
 Plastic to it does not make me so fun 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.660
 Although from this glass tober cost a 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.440
 I 'll be a little bit more in the future 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.410
 probably a few more 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:10.989
 of course the perfect spoon here 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:10.989
 there is a lot of war for it 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:24.660
 perfect already a bit now 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:25.950
 I mean chicken, but I also think so 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.930
 at today in the video is there's even 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:34.380
 not as a bit of a bit 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.280
 tastes good here I have to say here 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.170
 are now may not be the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:58.680
 optimal ingredients but of course 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:05:00.180
 you can do it a bit bigger 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.250
 Troop might be so bad 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.510
 I've been trying to do that now 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.950
 the vegetable is still frozen too 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.400
 but it does not matter if I do that 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.660
 after that stuff the microwave 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:19.229
 then it looks up and is too 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:21.150
 equal but the tastes of the 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:27.030
 That's why I really promise you 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:38.750
 no expensive food necessarily mine now 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:38.750
 cards paprika broccoli chemistry boom and 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.270
 that's it already 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.830
 I 've been shooting around with video now 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.650
 I needed about 30 minutes 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.350
 without video calculation received so looks 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.430
 it comes from the lid of it 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.780
 namely that with then you come afterwards 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.720
 another five minutes in the microwave 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.479
 and you really have a super healthy 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.610
 eat a lot of money for me you can still 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.810
 play a bit with the spices 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.310
 you can of course also others here 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.950
 Taste sauce from uncle ben's 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.870
 action a bunch of other vegetables from 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.610
 maybe good meat or 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.900
 I could also try chopped 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.100
 there are many 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.200
 variations tastes easy 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.180
