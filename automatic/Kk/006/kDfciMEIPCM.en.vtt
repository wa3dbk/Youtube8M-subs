24<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.719> 105<00:00:11.730> not<00:00:12.730> my<00:00:12.849> favorite<00:00:13.330> lens<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.920> it

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
24 to 105 not my favorite lens but it

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.850 
24 to 105 not my favorite lens but it
does<00:00:15.610> have<00:00:15.849> a<00:00:15.879> purpose<00:00:16.119> and<00:00:16.840> what<00:00:17.740> this

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
does have a purpose and what this

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.810 
does have a purpose and what this
purpose<00:00:18.340> is<00:00:18.520> is<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.390> does<00:00:19.900> the<00:00:20.500> same<00:00:20.770> as<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.279> 28

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
purpose is is it does the same as the 28

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.599 
purpose is is it does the same as the 28
to<00:00:22.000> 300<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.779> you<00:00:26.560> don't<00:00:26.800> need<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.160> carry<00:00:27.429> this

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
to 300 but you don't need to carry this

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.730 
to 300 but you don't need to carry this
this<00:00:28.000> around<00:00:28.330> with<00:00:28.480> you<00:00:28.599> sometimes<00:00:29.109> a<00:00:29.259> carpet

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
this around with you sometimes a carpet

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.660 
this around with you sometimes a carpet
is<00:00:30.039> not<00:00:30.970> just<00:00:31.330> not<00:00:31.800> widened<00:00:32.800> so<00:00:32.949> I'm<00:00:33.040> not<00:00:33.190> wide

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
is not just not widened so I'm not wide

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.079 
is not just not widened so I'm not wide
enough<00:00:33.699> for<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.420> 28<00:00:34.930> millimeter<00:00:35.320> so<00:00:36.309> in<00:00:36.730> comes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:37.089 
enough for the 28 millimeter so in comes

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.130 
enough for the 28 millimeter so in comes
the<00:00:37.530> 24<00:00:38.530> millimeter<00:00:38.739> and<00:00:39.489> with<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.390> 105<00:00:40.900> you

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
the 24 millimeter and with the 105 you

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.550 
the 24 millimeter and with the 105 you
can<00:00:41.320> zoom<00:00:41.559> in<00:00:41.769> and<00:00:42.010> get<00:00:42.339> the<00:00:42.489> heads<00:00:42.670> as<00:00:43.059> well

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:45.560 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.230 

dummy<00:00:46.560> batteries<00:00:49.460> we<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.520> all<00:00:50.640> advised<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:51.240 
dummy batteries we are all advised to

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.990 
dummy batteries we are all advised to
use<00:00:51.450> them<00:00:52.070> whatever<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> different

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
use them whatever we do is a different

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.320 
use them whatever we do is a different
matter

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
matter

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.380 
matter
right

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
right

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.600 
right
they<00:00:57.079> actually<00:00:59.050> work<00:01:00.050> very<00:01:00.079> well<00:01:00.440> with<00:01:01.399> this

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
they actually work very well with this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.160 
they actually work very well with this
flash<00:01:01.910> gun<00:01:02.440> when<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.800> just<00:01:04.100> replace<00:01:04.580> one<00:01:05.170> of

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
flash gun when you just replace one of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.660 
flash gun when you just replace one of
the<00:01:06.229> batteries<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:06.830> put<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.070> dummy<00:01:07.250> battery

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
the batteries you put the dummy battery

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.410 
the batteries you put the dummy battery
in<00:01:08.050> then<00:01:09.400> connect<00:01:10.400> it<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.700> your<00:01:10.850> luma<00:01:11.210> dine<00:01:11.390> or

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
in then connect it to your luma dine or

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.240 
in then connect it to your luma dine or
quantum<00:01:12.140> or<00:01:12.260> whatever<00:01:12.590> you're<00:01:12.770> doing<00:01:13.070> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
quantum or whatever you're doing and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.749 
quantum or whatever you're doing and
what<00:01:14.000> happens<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.900> the<00:01:15.440> flash<00:01:16.040> will

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
what happens then is the flash will

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.590 
what happens then is the flash will
automatically<00:01:17.509> power<00:01:17.810> from<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.830> luma<00:01:19.130> dine

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
automatically power from the luma dine

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.249 
automatically power from the luma dine
right<00:01:20.600> now<00:01:21.530> what<00:01:21.710> that<00:01:21.920> achieves<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.900> it<00:01:23.900> stops

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
right now what that achieves is it stops

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.560 
right now what that achieves is it stops
your<00:01:24.409> camera<00:01:24.740> from<00:01:24.950> blowing<00:01:25.460> up<00:01:25.820> sorry<00:01:26.180> stops

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
your camera from blowing up sorry stops

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.690 
your camera from blowing up sorry stops
your<00:01:26.750> flash<00:01:27.080> gun<00:01:27.320> from<00:01:27.560> blowing<00:01:27.740> up<00:01:28.009> because

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
your flash gun from blowing up because

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.060 
your flash gun from blowing up because
it's<00:01:28.850> drawing<00:01:29.180> from<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.170> power<00:01:30.440> source<00:01:30.740> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
it's drawing from one power source and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.870 
it's drawing from one power source and
not<00:01:31.340> from<00:01:31.520> two<00:01:31.820> power<00:01:32.090> sources<00:01:33.039> so<00:01:34.039> if<00:01:34.310> you

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
not from two power sources so if you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.370 
not from two power sources so if you
imagine<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.390> when<00:01:35.630> you've<00:01:35.750> got<00:01:35.899> four<00:01:36.110> normal

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
imagine that when you've got four normal

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.889 
imagine that when you've got four normal
batteries<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:36.979> there<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:38.450> flash<00:01:38.690> gun

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
batteries in there the flash gun

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.570 
batteries in there the flash gun
electronics<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.619> trying<00:01:39.950> to<00:01:40.039> pull<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.369> power

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
electronics is trying to pull the power

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.820 
electronics is trying to pull the power
from<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.970> four<00:01:41.179> batteries<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.080> also<00:01:42.560> trying

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
from the four batteries and also trying

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.249 
from the four batteries and also trying
to<00:01:42.890> pull<00:01:43.100> power<00:01:43.369> from<00:01:43.759> there<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.479> they<00:01:44.720> circuit

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
to pull power from there so they circuit

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.830 
to pull power from there so they circuit
out<00:01:45.440> with<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.550> dummy<00:01:46.729> battery<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.420> totally

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
out with the dummy battery that totally

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480 
out with the dummy battery that totally
gets<00:01:48.020> rid<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.410> problem<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.920> you're<00:01:49.369> only

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
gets rid of that problem and you're only

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.139 
gets rid of that problem and you're only
pulling<00:01:49.759> power<00:01:50.119> from<00:01:50.479> there<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:51.530> warned<00:01:52.149> those

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
pulling power from there we warned those

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.109 
pulling power from there we warned those
batteries<00:01:53.600> still<00:01:53.929> get<00:01:54.530> drained<00:01:54.800> so<00:01:55.550> once

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
batteries still get drained so once

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.930 
batteries still get drained so once
those<00:01:56.270> batteries<00:01:56.750> die<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:58.340> whole<00:01:58.460> thing<00:01:58.729> dies

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
those batteries die the whole thing dies

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.490 
those batteries die the whole thing dies
but<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.950> find<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.369> your<00:02:01.750> lifespan<00:02:02.750> of<00:02:02.780> the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
but we find that your lifespan of the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.679 
but we find that your lifespan of the
flash<00:02:04.070> gun<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:04.490> survive<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.880> lot<00:02:05.270> more<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.600> a

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
flash gun will survive a lot more with a

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.759 
flash gun will survive a lot more with a
dummy<00:02:05.900> battery<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.840> there's<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.929> little<00:02:09.470> tip

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
dummy battery so there's a little tip

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.050 
dummy battery so there's a little tip
for<00:02:10.070> you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.040

cables cables and more cables we love
cables<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.600> as<00:02:22.560> any<00:02:23.490> of<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.820> will<00:02:24.000> know<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:25.350> do

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
cables so as any of you will know to do

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
cables so as any of you will know to do
this<00:02:25.710> job<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:27.170> need<00:02:28.170> lots<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> these<00:02:28.710> cables

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
this job you need lots of these cables

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.590 
this job you need lots of these cables
because<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:31.110> break<00:02:31.440> very<00:02:31.710> easily<00:02:32.600> they

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
because they break very easily they

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.390 
because they break very easily they
break<00:02:33.900> without<00:02:34.170> even<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.590> trying<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.100> break

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
break without even you trying to break

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.060 
break without even you trying to break
them<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:36.510> break<00:02:36.990> just<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.470> they're

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
them they break just because they're

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.610 
them they break just because they're
designed<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.610> break<00:02:39.080> or<00:02:40.080> should<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.350> not<00:02:40.380> say

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
designed to break or should I not say

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.080 

they<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.710> that<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.070> design<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> little

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
they say that this design is a little

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.950 
they say that this design is a little
bit<00:02:53.210> better<00:02:53.360> than<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.780> old<00:02:53.900> design<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.340> but<00:02:55.960> if

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
bit better than the old design so but if

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.600 
bit better than the old design so but if
you<00:02:57.110> notice<00:02:57.320> I'm<00:02:57.800> still<00:02:57.830> using<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.580> old

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
you notice I'm still using the old

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.550 
you notice I'm still using the old
design<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.360> this<00:02:59.870> one<00:03:00.110> because<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.500> one

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
design on this one because this one

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.450 
design on this one because this one
seems<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.780> blasting<00:03:02.780> out<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:04.130> know<00:03:04.220> no

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
seems to be blasting out so you know no

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.370 
seems to be blasting out so you know no
preference<00:03:04.940> they<00:03:05.120> both<00:03:05.330> work

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
preference they both work

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.260 
preference they both work
I<00:03:07.880> need<00:03:08.880> all<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.500> screwdriver<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:12.060> you'll

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
I need all the screwdriver and you'll

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.360 
I need all the screwdriver and you'll
probably<00:03:12.570> be<00:03:12.840> thinking<00:03:13.200> why<00:03:13.860> does<00:03:14.100> he<00:03:14.190> need

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably be thinking why does he need

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.630 
probably be thinking why does he need
that<00:03:14.600> and<00:03:15.600> why<00:03:15.720> does<00:03:15.900> he<00:03:15.990> need<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.440> well<00:03:17.340> let

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
that and why does he need that well let

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.740 
that and why does he need that well let
me<00:03:17.670> show<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.090> why<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.450> need<00:03:18.780> this<00:03:19.100> okay<00:03:20.100> I<00:03:20.750> need

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
me show you why I need this okay I need

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.230 
me show you why I need this okay I need
this<00:03:22.110> because<00:03:22.490> under<00:03:23.490> this<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.170> screw<00:03:25.650> and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
this because under this is a screw and

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.360 
this because under this is a screw and
this<00:03:27.240> gets<00:03:27.510> loose<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.740> again<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.100> need<00:03:29.250> to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
this gets loose now and again I need to

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.480 
this gets loose now and again I need to
go<00:03:29.520> in<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.290> tighten<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.530> up<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:32.160> stop<00:03:32.370> my

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
go in there and tighten it up to stop my

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.180 
go in there and tighten it up to stop my
flash<00:03:32.730> from<00:03:32.910> falling<00:03:33.300> off<00:03:33.420> okay<00:03:34.380> that's<00:03:34.950> one

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
flash from falling off okay that's one

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.650 
flash from falling off okay that's one
reason<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.610> need<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:36.200> secondly<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
reason I need that secondly and

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.790 
reason I need that secondly and
underneath<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.870> plate<00:03:40.230> you'll<00:03:40.530> probably

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
underneath this plate you'll probably

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.050 
underneath this plate you'll probably
see<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.550> that's<00:03:41.760> been<00:03:42.000> pried<00:03:42.450> open<00:03:42.740> okay<00:03:43.770> and

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
see that that's been pried open okay and

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.980 
see that that's been pried open okay and
I<00:03:45.230> don't<00:03:46.230> know<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.380> I<00:03:46.440> can<00:03:46.500> do<00:03:46.740> it<00:03:46.890> now<00:03:47.070> but

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
I don't know if I can do it now but

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.630 
I don't know if I can do it now but
again<00:03:48.990> those<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.770> in<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.010> industry<00:03:50.490> will

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
again those of you in the industry will

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.840 
again those of you in the industry will
know<00:03:50.880> exactly<00:03:51.390> what<00:03:51.600> I'm<00:03:51.720> talking<00:03:52.110> about<00:03:52.170> here

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
know exactly what I'm talking about here

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.460 
know exactly what I'm talking about here
let's<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:54.060> if<00:03:54.150> we<00:03:54.270> can<00:03:54.420> do<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:57.200> we<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
let's see if we can do this we have to

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.990 
let's see if we can do this we have to
get<00:03:58.950> into<00:03:59.520> the<00:04:00.090> back

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
get into the back

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.070 
get into the back
try<00:04:02.810> not<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.050> take<00:04:03.320> your<00:04:03.470> eyes<00:04:03.680> out<00:04:04.780> here<00:04:05.780> we<00:04:05.900> go

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
try not to take your eyes out here we go

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:14.380 
try not to take your eyes out here we go
whoops<00:04:08.440> let's<00:04:09.440> just<00:04:09.650> do<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:10.250> one

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.270 

okay<00:04:15.250> here<00:04:16.250> we<00:04:16.280> go<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.560> what<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.680> see<00:04:18.950> under

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
okay here we go so what you see under

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.230 
okay here we go so what you see under
here<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:20.510> have<00:04:20.690> four<00:04:21.109> screws<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:22.150> with<00:04:23.150> the

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
here you have four screws and with the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.400 
here you have four screws and with the
constant<00:04:23.720> weight<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:25.640> flash<00:04:26.330> gun<00:04:26.570> on<00:04:26.780> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
constant weight of the flash gun on the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.700 
constant weight of the flash gun on the
plate<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:29.000> the<00:04:29.090> movement<00:04:29.540> those<00:04:30.110> screws<00:04:30.440> come

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
plate and the movement those screws come

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.070 
plate and the movement those screws come
loose<00:04:30.950> and<00:04:31.190> what<00:04:31.910> effectively<00:04:32.360> happens<00:04:32.870> is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
loose and what effectively happens is

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.930 
loose and what effectively happens is
that<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.350> contact<00:04:33.860> between<00:04:34.070> your<00:04:34.430> Flash<00:04:34.700> gun

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
that the contact between your Flash gun

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.030 
that the contact between your Flash gun
and<00:04:36.580> the<00:04:38.919> off-camera<00:04:39.919> shoe<00:04:41.169> doesn't<00:04:42.169> work<00:04:42.410> so

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
and the off-camera shoe doesn't work so

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.380 
and the off-camera shoe doesn't work so
you<00:04:43.070> think<00:04:43.640> that<00:04:43.790> you're<00:04:43.880> taking<00:04:44.180> pictures

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
you think that you're taking pictures

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.110 
you think that you're taking pictures
and<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.840> reality<00:04:45.200> is<00:04:45.500> you're<00:04:45.890> not<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:46.640> every

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
and the reality is you're not so every

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.260 
and the reality is you're not so every
so<00:04:47.270> often<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.990> undo<00:04:48.530> this<00:04:48.680> plate<00:04:49.270> and

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
so often you have to undo this plate and

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.140 
so often you have to undo this plate and
tighten<00:04:50.919> these<00:04:51.919> little<00:04:52.370> things<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:53.000> is

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
tighten these little things this is

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.500 
tighten these little things this is
really<00:04:53.540> essential<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.230> be<00:04:54.590> honest<00:04:54.830> with<00:04:54.919> you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
really essential to be honest with you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.490 
really essential to be honest with you
you<00:04:56.510> know<00:04:56.600> once<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:56.930> happens<00:04:57.320> you're

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
you know once this happens you're

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.230 
you know once this happens you're
supposed<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.980> throw<00:04:58.130> these<00:04:58.340> away<00:04:58.520> but<00:04:58.970> they

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
supposed to throw these away but they

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.390 
supposed to throw these away but they
work<00:04:59.419> perfectly<00:04:59.810> well<00:05:00.020> some<00:05:00.650> people<00:05:00.919> suggest

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
work perfectly well some people suggest

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.270 
work perfectly well some people suggest
that<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.700> put<00:05:02.000> nail<00:05:02.300> varnish<00:05:03.070> on<00:05:04.070> those

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
that you put nail varnish on those

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.960 
that you put nail varnish on those
screws<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:05.090> stop<00:05:05.330> them<00:05:05.510> from<00:05:05.750> jiggling<00:05:06.320> out<00:05:06.530> I

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
screws to stop them from jiggling out I

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.400 
screws to stop them from jiggling out I
don't<00:05:07.970> because<00:05:08.480> it's<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.960> end<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.230> day

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
don't because it's the end of the day
