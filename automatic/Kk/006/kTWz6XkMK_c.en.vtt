00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
going to respond to a question that I

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.230 
going to respond to a question that I
got<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.950> use<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.550> punch<00:00:08.790> that

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
got about how do you use the punch that

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.160 
got about how do you use the punch that
puts<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.870> tags<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:12.030> spiral<00:00:12.509> binding<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
puts the tags into the spiral binding I

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.200 
puts the tags into the spiral binding I
am<00:00:13.830> doing<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.190> by<00:00:14.370> myself<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.910> it's<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
am doing this by myself so it's going to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.939 
am doing this by myself so it's going to
be<00:00:15.330> one-handed<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.990> think<00:00:16.230> it'll<00:00:16.379> work

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
be one-handed I think it'll work

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.950 
be one-handed I think it'll work
that's<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> way<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.910> tag<00:00:18.150> looks<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.840> then

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
that's the way the tag looks and then

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.599 
that's the way the tag looks and then
you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.350> see<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.890> just<00:00:19.920> flips<00:00:20.340> right

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you can see that it just flips right

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.700 
you can see that it just flips right
over<00:00:20.970> there's<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:21.869> I'm<00:00:21.990> working<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.439> for

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
over there's the one I'm working on for

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.480 
over there's the one I'm working on for
some--for

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
some--for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.450 
some--for
and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.510> flips<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> forth<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.220> let

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and it just flips back and forth so let

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.040 
and it just flips back and forth so let
me<00:00:26.580> show<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.599> today<00:00:27.810> it's

you are going to place it into the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.139 
you are going to place it into the
Machine<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> use<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.600> left<00:00:51.989> guide

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
Machine and if you use this left guide

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
Machine and if you use this left guide
that's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.420> work<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:54.750> basically<00:00:55.260> where<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that's the work that's basically where I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
that's the work that's basically where I
started<00:00:56.160> put<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> tag<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:57.690> top<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
started put the tag the top of it to the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
started put the tag the top of it to the
right<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.910> place<00:01:00.329> it

up against there push it in all the way
and<00:01:02.570> then<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.809> push<00:01:04.799> down<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.670> got<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> very

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and then I push down it's got a very

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then I push down it's got a very
light<00:01:06.930> lever<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.710> make<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.189> work<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.670> works

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
light lever to make it work and it works

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.730 
light lever to make it work and it works
great<00:01:09.000> you're<00:01:09.780> gonna<00:01:09.869> pull<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
great you're gonna pull it out and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.890 
great you're gonna pull it out and
you're<00:01:10.979> gonna<00:01:11.100> move<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.700> slightly<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you're gonna move it over slightly this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
you're gonna move it over slightly this
is<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> question<00:01:13.650> was<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.580> hard<00:01:14.880> is

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
is what the question was of how hard is

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
is what the question was of how hard is
it<00:01:15.060> took<00:01:15.390> match<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> very

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it took match this up and it's very

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580 
it took match this up and it's very
simple<00:01:17.479> basically<00:01:18.479> what<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.750> doing<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.259> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
simple basically what I'm doing is just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.630 
simple basically what I'm doing is just
lining<00:01:20.130> up

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
lining up

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520 
lining up
I'm<00:01:20.909> putting<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.930> one<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.350> already

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
I'm putting the one that was already

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.830 
I'm putting the one that was already
punched<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.280> between<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> next<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
punched in between the next two if you

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.859 
punched in between the next two if you
can<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.830> move<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> over<00:01:27.200> go<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.229> up

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
can see that I move it over go back up

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
can see that I move it over go back up
punch<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.079> again<00:01:31.490> pull<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.700> out<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.810> all

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
punch it again pull it out and it's all

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
punch it again pull it out and it's all
ready<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:36.090> then

ready to go and all you have to do then

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.030 
ready to go and all you have to do then
is<00:01:38.299> lay<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.509> top<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.960> spiral<00:01:40.380> binding

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is lay it on top of your spiral binding

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010 
is lay it on top of your spiral binding
and<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.610> push<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.180> little<00:01:42.210> tabs<00:01:42.659> right

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and you just push the little tabs right

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.880 
and you just push the little tabs right
in<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:45.270> between<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.780> spiral<00:01:46.229> binding<00:01:46.680> all

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
in to and between the spiral binding all

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.359 
in to and between the spiral binding all
the<00:01:47.189> way<00:01:47.310> down<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.899> there<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the way down and there you go so the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.120

don't<00:02:12.180> think<00:02:12.300> they<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.540> work<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.930> well<00:02:13.140> in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
don't think they would work as well in
