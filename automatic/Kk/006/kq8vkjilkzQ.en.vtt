really sure either way it's pretty cool

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.680 
really sure either way it's pretty cool
actually<00:03:02.700> if<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.790> had<00:03:03.880> both<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.330> those<00:03:04.450> on

actually if you had both of those on

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.510 
actually if you had both of those on
both<00:03:04.930> hands<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.470> would<00:03:05.530> make<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:05.920> even<00:03:06.190> easier

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
both hands it would make it even easier

to<00:03:06.880> clean<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.210> dog<00:03:07.390> i<00:03:07.570> think<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.740> i<00:03:08.800> don't

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
to clean the dog i think but i don't

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.150 
to clean the dog i think but i don't
know<00:03:09.070> i'm<00:03:09.280> not<00:03:09.430> an<00:03:09.610> expert<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.920> one

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
know i'm not an expert and then one

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.630 
know i'm not an expert and then one
final<00:03:12.550> item<00:03:12.990> lean<00:03:13.990> licks<00:03:14.380> run<00:03:14.920> away<00:03:15.190> Frank

final item lean licks run away Frank

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.760 
final item lean licks run away Frank
flavor<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:17.550> think<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:20.500> like<00:03:20.740> a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
flavor I think this is it's like a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.230 
flavor I think this is it's like a
chapstick<00:03:21.520> but<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.060> let<00:03:22.300> your<00:03:22.570> dog<00:03:22.810> lick<00:03:23.380> it

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
chapstick but you let your dog lick it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.930 
chapstick but you let your dog lick it
for<00:03:25.240> flavor<00:03:25.680> at<00:03:26.680> least<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.100> assume<00:03:27.220> that's<00:03:27.730> what

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
for flavor at least I assume that's what

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.540 
for flavor at least I assume that's what
it<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:31.110> excited<00:03:32.110> another<00:03:32.350> similar<00:03:32.830> product<00:03:33.280> so

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
it is excited another similar product so

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.480 
it is excited another similar product so
I'm<00:03:33.670> guessing<00:03:33.850> that's<00:03:34.120> what<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.690> has<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.050> be

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
I'm guessing that's what this has to be

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.890 
I'm guessing that's what this has to be
because<00:03:36.490> I'm<00:03:36.730> not<00:03:36.910> planning<00:03:37.210> on<00:03:37.420> looking<00:03:37.600> now

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
because I'm not planning on looking now

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
because I'm not planning on looking now
myself<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.420> everything<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:41.530> received

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
myself so that is everything I received

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.010

in<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.190> box<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.850> think<00:03:43.180> was<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.300> pretty<00:03:43.540> good<00:03:43.750> box

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
in the box I think was a pretty good box

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.370 
in the box I think was a pretty good box
um<00:03:46.140> more<00:03:47.140> than<00:03:47.350> anything<00:03:47.650> else<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.430> don't<00:03:48.640> know

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
um more than anything else I don't know

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.530 
um more than anything else I don't know
that<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.530> box<00:03:50.740> was<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:51.130> particularly<00:03:51.970> good

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
that the box was a particularly good

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.400 
that the box was a particularly good
value<00:03:53.640> but<00:03:54.640> what<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> did<00:03:55.360> like<00:03:55.630> is<00:03:55.840> i<00:03:55.960> received
