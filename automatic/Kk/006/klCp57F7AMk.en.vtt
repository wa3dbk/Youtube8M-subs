00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
and killing off the top came off very

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.670 
and killing off the top came off very
light<00:05:22.640> so<00:05:22.910> he's<00:05:23.060> able<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.110> back<00:05:24.260> those<00:05:24.470> low

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680
