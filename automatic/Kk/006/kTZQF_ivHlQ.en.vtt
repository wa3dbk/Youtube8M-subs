 dog's stomach dog's stomach refers 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.130
 to a single-chamber stomach and has 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.440
 following anatomical part 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.970
 cardial and part of the place where it flows 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.900
 pyloric esophagus 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.960
 part of the place of exit from the stomach and 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.289
 duodenal ulcer 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 the average ones of the stomach are between 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.820
 map and Belarusians called the body 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.399
 stomach 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.610
 the lower body of the stomach is called 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.329
 thought 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 the smallest distance between the map and 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 Belarusians view 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 arc-shaped lines called small 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.440
 curvature and the greatest distance between 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.829
 by the same parts 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 called the large curvature on the small 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.399
 the curvature of the stomach is fixed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.290
 his mesentery called small sanik in 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.799
 it is deposited fat and pass 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.070
 blood vessels and nerves live by 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.200
 large curvature is attached large 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.939
 stuffing box 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.450
 which also contains fat deposits 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:23.970
 blood vessels and nerves and isolates 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 intestine from the abdominal wall on the large 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.009
 Glands on the gastro-splenic 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.680
 ligament fastened spleen the stomach has 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.890
 two surfaces 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:41.100
 surface facing the organs 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 called visceral and surface 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.710
 which stomach is adjacent liver and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.689
 the diaphragm will be called parietal 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.720
 dog's stomach like any lane 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.079
 body consists of membranes 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.259
 inside the stomach stuck out mucous 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.200
 the dogâ€™s stomach coat is characteristic 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.549
 that the mucous membrane folds 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.539
 which is similar to the brains of the head 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.790
 the brain is covered with liquid transparent 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.159
 mucus 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 mucous membrane of the stomach in its different 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.120
 parts of the gland has a different name 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.040
 which corresponds to the name of the part 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.480
 cardiac ozone glands don named 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.370
 glands and pyloric zone 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.489
 Dog on the mucous membrane of the type 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.560
 refers to the intestinal type stomach 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.290
 have it completely covered 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.900
 digestive glands and has no 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.670
 its surface without glandular zone with 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.480
 white mucous like 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.989
 esophagus esophageal mucosa 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.379
 white with places of the shell of the stomach or 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:56.340
 dark color 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.540
 the muscular membrane of the stomach consists of 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.389
 three layers 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:09.290
 smooth muscle of the longitudinal which goes from 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:11.790
 cardiac orifice pyloric 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.609
 a circular layer which is especially 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.109
 ok the development of the logical part where 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.060
 form a powerful sphincter pelorus and such 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.959
 same sphincter there is at the entrance of the esophagus into 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:30.299
 the stomach and called cardiac and oblique 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:35.159
 your muscles heading off from cardiac 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:37.349
 parts of the stomach to the bottom outside the stomach 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.859
 cover with a serous membrane which 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.169
 called peritoneum peritoneum small and 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.729
 greater curvature forms two glands 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.729
 small and big
