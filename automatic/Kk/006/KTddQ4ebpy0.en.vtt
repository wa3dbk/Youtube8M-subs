00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.689 
making the machine work more effectively
and<00:00:21.510> overcoming<00:00:22.109> problem<00:00:22.830> areas<00:00:23.189> whether<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
and overcoming problem areas whether it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
and overcoming problem areas whether it
be<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.470> range<00:00:25.470> or<00:00:26.070> endurance<00:00:27.080> flexibility

be with range or endurance flexibility
any<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.789> fundamentals<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.849> playing

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
any of the fundamentals of playing

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.630 
any of the fundamentals of playing
hopefully<00:00:31.529> by<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:31.710> you've<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.160> yourself<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
hopefully by now you've got yourself a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700 
hopefully by now you've got yourself a
wind<00:00:32.820> pack<00:00:33.030> which<00:00:33.270> has<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> visualizer

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
wind pack which has got the visualizer

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.650 
wind pack which has got the visualizer
which<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> important<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.450> we're<00:00:36.570> about

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
which is important to what we're about

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
which is important to what we're about
to<00:00:36.840> talk<00:00:36.960> about<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.000> breathing<00:00:39.360> tool

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
to talk about and the the breathing tool

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
to talk about and the the breathing tool
so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.290> your<00:00:40.410> breathing<00:00:40.620> machine

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so you know that your breathing machine

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
so you know that your breathing machine
is<00:00:41.250> working<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:43.230> put<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.590> under<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is working well to put that under the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.380 
is working well to put that under the
instrument<00:00:44.370> I've<00:00:44.520> done<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> videos

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
instrument I've done a lot of videos

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
instrument I've done a lot of videos
using<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> visualizer<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:48.110> want<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.320> take

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
using the visualizer and I want to take

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.389 
using the visualizer and I want to take
the<00:00:50.309> next<00:00:50.610> step<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.600> go<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the next step now and just go I want you

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.580 
the next step now and just go I want you
to<00:00:53.520> visualize<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.719> air<00:00:55.020> trail<00:00:55.289> he's<00:00:55.440> your

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to visualize that as air trail he's your

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
to visualize that as air trail he's your
top<00:00:55.770> lip<00:00:55.980> bottom<00:00:56.340> lip<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.360> airs

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
top lip bottom lip that is airs

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.529 
top lip bottom lip that is airs
traveling<00:00:58.440> through<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.699> air<00:00:59.879> hits<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> top

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
traveling through the air hits the top

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.869 
traveling through the air hits the top
lip<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.809> bounces<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> bottom<00:01:02.730> lip

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
lip and bounces off it's the bottom lip

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.870 
lip and bounces off it's the bottom lip
bounces<00:01:03.239> off<00:01:03.359> goes<00:01:03.539> into<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> mouthpiece<00:01:04.290> Cup

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
bounces off goes into the mouthpiece Cup

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.760 
bounces off goes into the mouthpiece Cup
so<00:01:05.880> they're<00:01:06.150> sort<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.420> sympathetic<00:01:07.140> vibration

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so they're sort of sympathetic vibration

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.460 
so they're sort of sympathetic vibration
of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.100> lips<00:01:08.310> thanks<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:10.020> movement

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
of the lips thanks to the the movement

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.950 
of the lips thanks to the the movement
of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> air<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.640> differential<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
of the air and the differential of the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.020 
of the air and the differential of the
air<00:01:13.200> pressure<00:01:13.409> from<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.890> body<00:01:14.100> through<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
air pressure from the body through the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
air pressure from the body through the
lips<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.509> into<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.810> mouthpiece<00:01:15.990> Cup<00:01:16.409> now

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
lips and into the mouthpiece Cup now

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740 
lips and into the mouthpiece Cup now
I've<00:01:16.770> got<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.909> piece<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.210> paper<00:01:18.330> here

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
I've got a little piece of paper here

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.490 
I've got a little piece of paper here
and<00:01:19.520> on<00:01:20.520> an<00:01:20.790> elastic<00:01:21.330> band<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:21.930> if<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.259> was<00:01:22.470> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and on an elastic band now if I was to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.429 
and on an elastic band now if I was to
just<00:01:23.220> blow<00:01:23.400> air<00:01:23.580> past<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
just blow air past it you could see the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.679 
just blow air past it you could see the
vibration<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.159> happening<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.329> we've

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
vibration that's happening so we've

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
vibration that's happening so we've
spoken<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.380> lot<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:32.159> wall<00:01:32.579> exercise

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
spoken a lot about the our wall exercise

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.749 
spoken a lot about the our wall exercise

owl keeping that lip unpinch t' even in
the<00:01:38.880> upper<00:01:39.119> register<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.689> need<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.079> work<00:01:40.439> on

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the upper register we need to work on

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.190 
the upper register we need to work on
the<00:01:40.740> aperture<00:01:40.950> corners<00:01:41.549> coming<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.140> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the aperture corners coming in so you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160 
the aperture corners coming in so you
imagine<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.579> wanted<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.450> piece

to do is put grip into the lip and start
pinching<00:01:55.140> down<00:01:55.380> onto<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> bottom<00:01:56.670> lip<00:01:56.850> if

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pinching down onto the bottom lip if

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.480 
pinching down onto the bottom lip if
when<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> extreme<00:01:58.680> upper<00:01:59.009> register

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
when you in the extreme upper register

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270 
when you in the extreme upper register
it'll<00:02:00.240> feel<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:01.140> tingle<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.770> in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
it'll feel like a little tingle just in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.069 
it'll feel like a little tingle just in
a<00:02:02.369> little<00:02:02.670> spot<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.299> bottom<00:02:03.600> lip<00:02:03.840> and

a little spot of your bottom lip and

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.319 
a little spot of your bottom lip and
you'll<00:02:04.710> feel<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.100> escape<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> air

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
you'll feel that escape of the air

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.589 
you'll feel that escape of the air
without<00:02:07.640> incredible<00:02:08.640> back<00:02:08.819> pressure<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.420> can

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
without incredible back pressure you can

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.190 
without incredible back pressure you can
you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.600 
you
there's<00:02:10.500> compression<00:02:11.129> which<00:02:11.250> I'll<00:02:11.430> talk

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
there's compression which I'll talk

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.119 
there's compression which I'll talk
about<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> next<00:02:12.270> video<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:13.560> there's<00:02:13.950> only

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
about in the next video but there's only

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.949 
about in the next video but there's only
a<00:02:14.280> limit<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.879> how<00:02:14.910> much<00:02:15.150> compression<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.810> can

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
a limit to how much compression you can

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.400 
a limit to how much compression you can
use<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:17.040> getting<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.760> through<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.170> lips

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
use and it's getting it through the lips

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.089 
use and it's getting it through the lips
without<00:02:20.190> forcing<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.569> keep<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.200> mind

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.860 

swirling<00:02:26.099> air<00:02:26.310> that's<00:02:27.209> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.630> through

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
swirling air that's going to go through

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.390 
swirling air that's going to go through
an<00:02:27.989> aperture<00:02:28.230> that's<00:02:28.500> getting<00:02:28.830> narrower<00:02:29.160> and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
an aperture that's getting narrower and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.590 
an aperture that's getting narrower and
narrower<00:02:29.720> okay<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.200> about<00:02:31.290> that
