00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.510
 Of course the expectations are not the same but the drive is up 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.720
 The same amateurs and professionals ride on the slopes together for Esther Graf 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.720
 For everyone, this race is a big challenge 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:20.389
 great landscapes high speeds and merciless 

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:23.389
 Conditions above all that is what the participants of the Dakar Rally are looking for 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.240
 even more than the victory that only the big manufacturers with their guys were 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.239
 strive for 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.619
 there are some quirks of this extraordinary race amateurs and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.940
 Professionals goes together at the start 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.280
 drive and live together though theirs between the two categories 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.200
 Expectations and also theirs with a tortured offer 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 People go ahead 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.740
 Venice invited their learned is Inter 3 professional ethical Anicker place 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 five an electrician a clever TUI there by a warehouseman 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.920
 I was somehow all first ride on but also shook hands 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.960
 But the difference is above all the financial means and therefore also 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.360
 the supply is still young 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.590
 in the trucks, of course, everything for a car on the slopes are three in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.640
 Parts disassembled the Neckarelz but if one of the trucks 7 and the remains 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.730
 Parts are lost, how can one naturally no longer afford one 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.710
 To have a problem 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.530
 Therefore, on the one hand have to be a small advantage to be sure that was then 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
 but who has and can continue the good conditions 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.400
 we have Super League spare parts as possible 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.300
 There are now also in Germany both we have a small 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.050
 Tutorial committee would have many investors so far extra for front and rear 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.100
 and we also have three or four players 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.400
 We also have enough oil to change it once it is with such 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.840
 clearly distinguished equipment that professionals and amateurs basically 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.670
 do not ride the same race 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.980
 for the amateurs it is even harder because the day does not end with the arrival 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.770
 in the bivouac 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 first after the machine was stopped 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 but that too belongs to the look of the Dakar Rally 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.810
 Monday we are 24 hours in danger with me only has three hours around us 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.809
 to rest Japan coffee drunk did not even have time to shower 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.629
 Nevertheless, we only wanted one car and the next stage 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.859
 The funds are secondary. It is a privilege to be here and me 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.140
 think it is the only race in the world where we have the little amateurs with the 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.849
 Driving professionals we have less money but we have a lot of fun 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.669
 should 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.669
 w until two years ago 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.930
 All this is allowed and the judges go that way because the Dakar Rally is over 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.709
 all a race of amateurs in which the professionals are invited only
