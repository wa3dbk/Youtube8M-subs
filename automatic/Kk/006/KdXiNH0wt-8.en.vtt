00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
much pointless because you can do that

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
much pointless because you can do that
anyway<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.770> wait<00:00:58.920> till<00:00:59.489> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
weapon and then you can swap out your

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.750
