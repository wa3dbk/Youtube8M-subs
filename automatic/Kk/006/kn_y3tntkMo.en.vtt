00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.660
 hi my name is alexander and i want you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.500
 tell about the novelty it is but on the wheel and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.810
 ps it is so compact 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.439
 electric bike that you can take 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.820
 with you anywhere literally subway 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.570
 weight this model represents 12 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.610
 a kilo she is controlled enough 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.190
 just but requires little taxes 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.360
 learning give them tell you how to learn 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.190
 don't ride first you need to put 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.190
 lift pedals vertically 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.589
 turn on 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.170
 electric motor and built-in gyroscope 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:01.269
 which allows the wheel to not fall 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.809
 forward back here I turn on through a half 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.330
 seconds 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.909
 It turns out this is a gyroscope and control this 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.659
 the models are very simple you accelerate 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.759
 or all is also hampered by the wheels 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.939
 there is no front and back either side 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:18.490
 is leading so in order to 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.429
 quickly learn how to manage there are a couple 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.320
 simple exercises 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.659
 first place the wheel between your legs and 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.590
 correctly position the foot and the foot 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.860
 need to have 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.330
 somewhere in the middle . . a little bit 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.459
 hanging sock 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.979
 as I said it is managed by 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.569
 transferring the mass of the body to the tip and forward 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.459
 heel that is, you put 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.350
 very convenient right wheel 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.970
 located under a slight degree 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.179
 tilting here as if you are sitting on 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.600
 the bike stopped to rest the door to 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:53.170
 waiting here for a feeder a lot 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.660
 understand you put your foot here bent by 15 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 degrees and is in this red zone 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 special rezinochki 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.019
 soft for what your little bit if 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.539
 neatly groove was set angle 

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:05.500
 here is slightly tilted too and try 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.280
 how to manage it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 sock bio. sock. since for 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 you it will be a little bit unusual experience 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.189
 the kit comes with a training strap 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.359
 Here is such a free you open 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:27.390
 insert by the handle 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:30.349
 adjust in length also calls 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.730
 little use if Monica too 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.420
 adjusted to the height as you wish 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.909
 They picked up here and I can Satire 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.150
 ride literally 1 day2 at the moment when 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.150
 learn that is you jump snape 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.500
 picked up by him so we stood up 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.230
 the strap is correctly set foot 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.379
 exercise number one try 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.269
 back and forth feel this movement 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.959
 exercise number two after 50 minutes 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 such tests 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.840
 you need to take a step working principle 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.629
 She scrambled on a scooter slightly 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.180
 put your body weight on the leg standing on 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.459
 pedals and under the steps because this foot 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.739
 after a meter or two, look at the briefcase 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.590
 and again so you lean and 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.180
 pull up 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.310
 lean and pull that is 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.530
 such a long step 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.480
 from peter leave somewhere 10-15 minutes not 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.459
 be lazy just draw your attention 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.549
 what I have here is a right foot on 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.849
 rat play on people stands left 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.560
 that which is convenient for you to walk further 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.120
 we walked now we need to learn 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.640
 ride fly use 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.579
 or your friend's shoulder which 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.920
 you can lean or use stenochka 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:48.650
 in my case it will be comrade covenant 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.900
 friend leaning on his shoulder like this 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.410
 one hand and try to jump on 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.230
 wheel 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.390
 stand in your hands I must say that 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.579
 stand on it a little uncomfortable 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.590
 because they need to stand and ride it 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.750
 not a circus machine is enough for him 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.840
 You can quickly get used to it so comrades 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.819
 you say go ahead he goes and you 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.180
 Substitute leg and go 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.450
 here the main task to develop speed 5 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.430
 felt per hour then you won't 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.310
 get distracted by some side strengths 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.660
 fluctuations will learn to get used 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.250
 manuscript speed if you go 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.789
 slower then you have enough 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.580
 wheel 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:28.789
 yuli prowler separately want to note 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.840
 quite strong body which is very 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.450
 be patient with all yours 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.250
 falling experiment which principle 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.530
 should not be much because the bases and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.080
 Science is acquired in 15 20 minutes 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.000
 it is very convenient to stay low from 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 land in which case you jump 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.349
 ran a couple of steps and enough 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.720
 safety strap on 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:49.460
 the second or third day you shoot there 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.740
 models on which people there to repeat 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.110
 jumped light siding is plastic 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.130
 no cracks also wheel is charging 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.150
 from outlet 220 unscrews small 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.510
 Power Supply 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.000
 plug in is charging seamlessly 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:07.490
 It's awesome here that this light bulb 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.010
 battery charge now it is green 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.470
 it means fully beauty is charged when 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.530
 site number is now the whole process then 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.630
 flickers crust 33 percent lights up 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.890
 red all charging stayed here in 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.640
 battery percentage 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:24.680
 I hope that when many of them get warmer 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.630
 You will get such an awesome gadget 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.040
 and together the park of bitter we will 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.990
 handle my flash mob guide 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.200
 with you was alexander join 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.200
 until
