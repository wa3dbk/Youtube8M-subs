00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
I think created some positive momentum

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
I think created some positive momentum
to<00:01:52.979> bringing<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.670> team<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> Seattle

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to bringing the team back to Seattle

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.149 
to bringing the team back to Seattle
