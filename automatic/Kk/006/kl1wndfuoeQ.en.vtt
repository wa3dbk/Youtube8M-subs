 and what until just or cod as and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.929
 head down 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.540
 or have a look at planetside 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:50.660
 very nice game 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:50.660
 hamburger are armor where i look 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.190
 if you 're not smart people by the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.790
 Here they shoot open armor 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.430

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 there I am or battlefield battlefield 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:14.640
 and then you just see something 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.950
 picture of her as said hey ages with 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
 judith iris menn am water com email 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 Now try with the weird ones 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.600
 upper arm defense can be on many 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
 put a hundred thousand 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:37.170
 For example, minecraft is cool too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:40.160
 i do too why do you bring him can he 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.160
 live the vortex 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.790
 what can I do with these pants and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.340
 so do the normal comment 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.440
 it just is not that kind of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.820
 shooter setting take like iraq or something 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.590
 because now somehow a war or 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.899
 but they really have to be awesome 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.119
 be creative this whole world has to be in 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.619
 to be consistent and that I think 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.229
 In any case, I'm very good there 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.090
 respect that they do that, so yes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.679
 which is maybe in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.679
 retrospectively, I am about it now 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:16.730
 think what does not necessarily leave 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.319

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:20.329
 right to the people always denied 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:56.980
 below 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:04:00.030
 there you see that went but that was me 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.030
 already in the last episode 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.360

 get ready 50 or inhibit or 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.690
 100 mbit and that will be synonymous after 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.670
 then somehow a few gigabytes will be 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.050
 screwed down 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.730
