00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
cannot see I just explored by the math

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.060 
cannot see I just explored by the math

wonders like crazy and they got

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.370 
wonders like crazy and they got
Magellan's<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> nice<00:00:19.080> bonus

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380

Magellan's which was a nice bonus
further<00:00:19.830> Navy<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.369> unfortunately<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
further Navy which unfortunately I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.120 
further Navy which unfortunately I
didn't<00:00:21.390> manage<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> build<00:00:21.869> because<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
didn't manage to build because at the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.070 
didn't manage to build because at the
same<00:00:23.160> round<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.910> discovered<00:00:24.660> technology

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
same round the discovered technology

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
same round the discovered technology
with<00:00:25.199> water<00:00:25.470> like<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.920> two<00:00:26.070> three<00:00:26.279> rounds

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
with water like in two three rounds

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.950 
with water like in two three rounds
later<00:00:26.699> they<00:00:26.939> already<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.539> wonders

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
later they already have all wonders

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
later they already have all wonders
built<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.410> that's<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.189> quite

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
built so that's something which quite

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.350 
built so that's something which quite
annoying<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.920> not<00:00:31.920> yeah<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.640> next<00:00:32.940> movie<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
annoying and not yeah the next movie you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
annoying and not yeah the next movie you
can<00:00:33.480> say<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.870> expanded<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> bit<00:00:34.469> got<00:00:35.040> more

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
can say just expanded a bit got more

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430 
can say just expanded a bit got more
technologies<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.880> cannons<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.540> were<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
technologies like cannons which were you

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.889 
technologies like cannons which were you
know<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.670> necessary<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.510> just

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
know what was necessary to just

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
see also got steam engines so that was

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.360 
see also got steam engines so that was
when<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.239> sea<00:00:45.480> bells<00:00:45.750> began<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.860> pumped

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
when the sea bells began I just pumped

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.060 
when the sea bells began I just pumped
out<00:00:47.489> these<00:00:49.520> these<00:00:50.520> team<00:00:50.879> engines<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:51.390> all<00:00:51.629> my

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
out these these team engines from all my

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
out these these team engines from all my
cities<00:00:53.070> which<00:00:53.280> were<00:00:53.809> against<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> st.<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
cities which were against the st. and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.799 
cities which were against the st. and
considers<00:00:55.980> company<00:00:56.489> cities<00:00:56.820> were<00:00:56.969> many

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
considers company cities were many

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.959 
considers company cities were many
unhappy<00:00:58.199> citizens<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.039> hard<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> contain<00:00:59.910> it

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
unhappy citizens so hard to contain it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.020 
unhappy citizens so hard to contain it
just<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.420> build<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:01.730> Colosseum's<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
just had to build those Colosseum's and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
just had to build those Colosseum's and
temples<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.660> early<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.049> possible<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
temples as early as possible so I just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
temples as early as possible so I just
could<00:01:05.070> keep<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.580> pumping<00:01:05.850> those<00:01:06.090> steam

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
could keep on pumping those steam

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.240 
could keep on pumping those steam
engines<00:01:07.170> from<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.590> cities<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
engines from these cities because I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.120 
engines from these cities because I
really<00:01:08.490> needed<00:01:08.700> them<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.090> fight<00:01:09.240> against<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
really needed them to fight against the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.080 
really needed them to fight against the
Japanese<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.159> Greeks<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> other<00:01:11.850> side

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
Japanese and Greeks in the other side

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.289 
Japanese and Greeks in the other side

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
and cannot see they got musketeer song I
also<00:01:22.439> took<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.070> long<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.430> doing<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
also took kind of long and doing that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600 
also took kind of long and doing that
and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.659> still<00:01:25.110> wasn't<00:01:25.439> able<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.009> conquer<00:01:26.189> China

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and I still wasn't able to conquer China

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.120 
and I still wasn't able to conquer China
I<00:01:27.390> tried<00:01:27.630> place<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.229> units<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.770> stream

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I tried place more units in that stream

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.850 
I tried place more units in that stream
as<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.820> will<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.240> done<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.650> i<00:01:31.680> was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
as you will see i have done now so i was

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.289 
as you will see i have done now so i was
successfully<00:01:32.340> able<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.640> conquer<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.970> city<00:01:33.210> i

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
successfully able to conquer that city i

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
successfully able to conquer that city i
even<00:01:33.750> though<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.930> costing<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.439> many

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
even though it costing like many

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.100 
even though it costing like many
counters<00:01:35.189> was<00:01:35.400> still<00:01:35.670> worth<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
counters was still worth it because that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.370 
counters was still worth it because that
city<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.680> pyramids<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:39.000> made<00:01:39.750> my

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
city have pyramids in it which made my

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
city have pyramids in it which made my
other<00:01:40.560> cities<00:01:40.890> grow<00:01:41.100> even<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:41.400> even<00:01:41.939> faster

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
other cities grow even more even faster

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.620

because<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.619> problem<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.159> i<00:01:44.310> figured<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because the problem is i figured out is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.590 
because the problem is i figured out is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that in the side of the grasslands you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.179 
that in the side of the grasslands you
will<00:01:48.869> eventually<00:01:49.530> lose<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:52.189> production

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
will eventually lose the production

be able to have shields in them so you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539
