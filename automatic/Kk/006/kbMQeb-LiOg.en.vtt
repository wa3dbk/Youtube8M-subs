stay as hidden as possible until you get
behind<00:01:36.010> them<00:01:36.570> obviously<00:01:37.570> is<00:01:37.870> behind<00:01:38.230> them

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
behind them obviously is behind them

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.320 
behind them obviously is behind them

more<00:01:40.510> effect<00:01:40.630> on<00:01:40.960> them<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.500> by<00:01:42.159> staying<00:01:42.460> low

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
more effect on them and by staying low

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.330 
more effect on them and by staying low
to<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.360> ground<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.920> getting<00:01:44.920> around<00:01:45.070> behind

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
to the ground and getting around behind

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.460 
to the ground and getting around behind
without<00:01:45.580> being<00:01:45.880> seen<00:01:46.120> they<00:01:46.840> have<00:01:46.990> very<00:01:47.260> little

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
without being seen they have very little

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.950 
without being seen they have very little
time<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.890> react<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.370> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.840> new

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
time to react to you I think in the new

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.590 
time to react to you I think in the new
patch<00:01:50.200> they've<00:01:50.760> made<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.940> so<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.120> if<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.390> tank

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
patch they've made it so that if a tank

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.910 
patch they've made it so that if a tank
hits<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.020> you're<00:01:53.320> basically<00:01:53.710> dead

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
hits you you're basically dead

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.469 
hits you you're basically dead
immediately<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:54.820> that's<00:01:54.970> something<00:01:55.210> you

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
immediately so that's something you

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.420 
immediately so that's something you
really<00:01:55.750> want<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.020> avoid<00:01:56.290> dry<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.280> stays

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
really want to avoid dry and stays

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.980 
really want to avoid dry and stays
hidden<00:01:57.760> as<00:01:57.970> possible<00:01:58.390> until<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.690> get<00:01:58.870> behind

hidden as possible until you get behind

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.469 
hidden as possible until you get behind
them<00:01:59.260> and<00:01:59.350> you<00:01:59.440> can<00:01:59.560> light<00:01:59.740> them<00:01:59.860> up<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.970> good

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
them and you can light them up a good

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.960 
them and you can light them up a good
trust<00:02:01.780> strategy<00:02:02.440> I<00:02:02.470> like<00:02:02.710> to<00:02:02.800> use<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.159> if<00:02:03.760> my

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
trust strategy I like to use is if my

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.550 
trust strategy I like to use is if my
gun<00:02:04.150> is<00:02:04.270> high<00:02:04.450> enough<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.840> he's<00:02:05.200> unlocked

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
gun is high enough and he's unlocked

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.339 
gun is high enough and he's unlocked
guided<00:02:06.070> missiles<00:02:06.430> use<00:02:07.360> them<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.930> conjunction

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
guided missiles use them in conjunction

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.759 
guided missiles use them in conjunction
with<00:02:08.500> your<00:02:08.979> laser<00:02:09.369> laser<00:02:10.000> designator<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.530> get

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
with your laser laser designator so get

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.280 
with your laser laser designator so get
behind<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.129> tank<00:02:12.310> start<00:02:13.209> lasering<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.049> tank

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
behind the tank start lasering the tank

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.390 
behind the tank start lasering the tank
while<00:02:14.500> you're<00:02:14.650> lighting<00:02:14.890> them<00:02:15.099> up<00:02:15.159> of<00:02:15.310> your

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
while you're lighting them up of your

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.820 
while you're lighting them up of your
rockets<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.780> fly<00:02:16.959> over<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.350> you're<00:02:17.650> kind

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
rockets as you fly over it you're kind

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.190 
rockets as you fly over it you're kind
of<00:02:17.890> releases<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.459> guided-missile<00:02:18.750> boom<00:02:19.750> tank

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
of releases the guided-missile boom tank

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.290 
of releases the guided-missile boom tank
dead<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:21.340> one<00:02:21.550> thing<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.880> were<00:02:22.060> talking

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
dead so one thing that you were talking

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.800 
dead so one thing that you were talking
about<00:02:22.360> what

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
about what

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.720 
about what
you<00:02:23.140> know<00:02:23.260> painting<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.739> targets<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.400> coming

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
you know painting the targets and coming

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.290 
you know painting the targets and coming
up<00:02:24.760> from<00:02:24.880> behind<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.360> once<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.700> elite<00:02:27.700> set<00:02:28.120> up

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
up from behind so once the elite set up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.360 
up from behind so once the elite set up
as<00:02:29.230> far<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.590> you're<00:02:29.770> concerned<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
as far as you're concerned for the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.030 
as far as you're concerned for the
choppers<00:02:30.790> as<00:02:30.910> far<00:02:31.120> as<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.630> gunner<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.140> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
choppers as far as the gunner and the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.949 
choppers as far as the gunner and the
pilot<00:02:33.400> goes<00:02:34.200> ok<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.709> like<00:02:35.980> using<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.959> laser

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
pilot goes ok so I like using the laser

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.100 
pilot goes ok so I like using the laser
designator<00:02:38.560> as<00:02:38.800> my<00:02:39.040> my<00:02:39.489> gadget<00:02:39.849> i<00:02:40.330> also<00:02:40.840> have

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
designator as my my gadget i also have

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.500 
designator as my my gadget i also have
players<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.620> avoid<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.280> incoming<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:43.000> missiles

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
players to avoid the incoming a missiles

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.280 
players to avoid the incoming a missiles
and<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> last<00:02:46.269> thing<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.630> have<00:02:46.810> heat<00:02:47.050> seeks

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
and for the last thing I have heat seeks

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.530 
and for the last thing I have heat seeks
to<00:02:47.470> take<00:02:47.650> out<00:02:47.860> other<00:02:48.160> choppers<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.390> they

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
to take out other choppers and if they

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.140 
to take out other choppers and if they
really<00:02:49.810> start<00:02:50.019> annoying<00:02:50.170> me<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:50.470> jets<00:02:50.709> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
really start annoying me the jets and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.699 
really start annoying me the jets and
for<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.209> gunner<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:53.349> like<00:02:53.500> them<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
for the gunner I really like them to

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.430 
for the gunner I really like them to
have<00:02:53.739> stuff<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.519> really<00:02:55.030> helps<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.720> with

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
have stuff that really helps you with

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320 
have stuff that really helps you with
your<00:02:56.470> flare<00:02:56.799> reload<00:02:57.190> times<00:02:57.459> as<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.030> increases

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
your flare reload times as it increases

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.259 
your flare reload times as it increases
the<00:02:58.600> time<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.080> takes<00:02:59.260> for<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.030> four<00:03:01.030> other

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
the time it takes for the four other

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.600 
the time it takes for the four other
stingers<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.690> all<00:03:01.930> other<00:03:02.260> jets<00:03:02.590> or<00:03:02.860> choppers

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
stingers and all other jets or choppers

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.360 
stingers and all other jets or choppers
to<00:03:03.790> lock<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.480> their<00:03:04.630> missiles<00:03:04.989> that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to lock on to you if their missiles that

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.979 
to lock on to you if their missiles that
really<00:03:06.370> helps<00:03:06.640> they<00:03:07.150> obviously<00:03:07.299> again<00:03:07.780> need

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
really helps they obviously again need

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.350 
really helps they obviously again need
flares<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.709> can<00:03:08.920> then<00:03:09.069> keep<00:03:09.849> working<00:03:10.269> in

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
flares so you can then keep working in

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.720 
flares so you can then keep working in
tandem<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.810> get<00:03:11.080> there<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:12.220> make<00:03:12.310> sure<00:03:12.370> that

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
tandem to get there to make sure that

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.720 
tandem to get there to make sure that
you<00:03:12.849> don't<00:03:13.060> get<00:03:13.239> hit<00:03:13.420> by<00:03:13.569> missiles<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.799> then

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
you don't get hit by missiles and then

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.430 
you don't get hit by missiles and then
as<00:03:15.880> i<00:03:16.000> mentioned<00:03:16.390> i<00:03:16.480> want<00:03:16.660> them<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.900> have<00:03:17.080> the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
as i mentioned i want them to have the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.309 
as i mentioned i want them to have the
guided<00:03:17.920> missiles<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.269> we<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.569> take<00:03:19.750> out<00:03:19.930> tanks

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
guided missiles so we can take out tanks

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.339 
guided missiles so we can take out tanks
very<00:03:20.530> effectively<00:03:21.510> i'm<00:03:22.510> sure<00:03:22.780> i<00:03:22.810> really<00:03:23.170> like

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
very effectively i'm sure i really like

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.870 
very effectively i'm sure i really like
those<00:03:23.530> guided<00:03:23.950> missiles<00:03:24.310> i<00:03:24.400> haven't<00:03:24.670> had<00:03:24.730> them

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
those guided missiles i haven't had them

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.120 
those guided missiles i haven't had them
too<00:03:25.120> long<00:03:25.390> seems<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.349> takes<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.769> little

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
too long seems like it takes a little

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.300 
too long seems like it takes a little
bit<00:03:27.370> form<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.910> release<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.810> you<00:03:28.900> have<00:03:29.170> to<00:03:29.380> kind

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
bit form to release so you have to kind

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.280 
bit form to release so you have to kind
of<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.760> sure<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.090> have<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> good<00:03:31.720> look

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
of be sure that you have a good look

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.069 
of be sure that you have a good look
Adam<00:03:32.829> as<00:03:33.040> far<00:03:33.489> as<00:03:33.700> having<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.450> line<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.840> sight

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
Adam as far as having a line of sight

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.229 
Adam as far as having a line of sight
because<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> building<00:03:37.060> or

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
because if you get a building or

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.420 
because if you get a building or
something<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.720> front<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.019> you<00:03:38.200> after<00:03:39.190> moving

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
something in front of you after moving

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.120 
something in front of you after moving
around<00:03:39.790> a<00:03:40.180> lot<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.840> times<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.440> target<00:03:41.920> won't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
around a lot of times that target won't

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.759 
around a lot of times that target won't
be<00:03:42.280> hit<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:42.940> important<00:03:43.359> for<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.769> pilot

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
be hit so it's important for the pilot

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.280 
be hit so it's important for the pilot
to<00:03:44.950> be<00:03:45.160> able<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.940> sure<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.239> get<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.660> line

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
to be able to be sure to get that line

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.059 
to be able to be sure to get that line
of<00:03:47.470> sight<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:47.950> your<00:03:48.100> gunner<00:03:48.600> yes<00:03:50.069> depending

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
of sight for your gunner yes depending

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.970 
of sight for your gunner yes depending
on where<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.690> tank<00:03:53.079> is<00:03:53.290> what<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.769> rude

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
on where the the tank is what you rude

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.629 
on where the the tank is what you rude
be<00:03:54.130> want<00:03:54.310> is<00:03:54.489> about<00:03:54.819> a<00:03:54.850> 200-meter<00:03:56.100> line<00:03:57.100> of

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
be want is about a 200-meter line of

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.879 
be want is about a 200-meter line of
sight<00:03:57.819> so<00:03:58.230> depending<00:03:59.230> on<00:03:59.319> how<00:03:59.410> fast<00:03:59.650> you're

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
sight so depending on how fast you're

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:02.309 
sight so depending on how fast you're
flying<00:04:00.130> that's<00:04:00.340> probably<00:04:00.609> about<00:04:00.810> two<00:04:01.810> seconds

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
flying that's probably about two seconds

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.430 
flying that's probably about two seconds
so<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.010> gives<00:04:03.160> enough<00:04:03.430> time<00:04:03.459> for<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.440> garden

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
so that gives enough time for the garden

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
so that gives enough time for the garden
estas<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.859> lock<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.400> then<00:04:06.910> release<00:04:07.209> just

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
estas to lock on and then release just

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.120 
estas to lock on and then release just
as<00:04:07.750> you<00:04:07.870> pass<00:04:08.139> over<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.560> tank<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.590> if<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
as you pass over the tank so if if the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.949 
as you pass over the tank so if if the
tanks<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> road<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.060> obviously<00:04:13.180> follow

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
tanks on a road you can obviously follow

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.440 
tanks on a road you can obviously follow
the<00:04:14.109> road<00:04:14.290> that's<00:04:14.650> nice<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.069> easy<00:04:15.190> if<00:04:16.180> they're

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
the road that's nice and easy if they're

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.979 
the road that's nice and easy if they're
in<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.870> middle<00:04:17.079> of<00:04:18.060> middle<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.120> buildings<00:04:19.479> what

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
in a middle of middle of buildings what

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.750 
in a middle of middle of buildings what
you<00:04:20.139> really<00:04:20.380> need<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> do<00:04:20.769> is<00:04:20.919> rise<00:04:21.310> up<00:04:21.549> high

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
you really need to do is rise up high

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.330 
you really need to do is rise up high
and<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.270> take<00:04:22.780> quite<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.440> steep<00:04:23.889> gradient

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
and then take quite a steep gradient

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.760 
and then take quite a steep gradient
down<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.850> then<00:04:24.940> pull<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.210> once<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.960> Gunners

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
down and then pull up once the Gunners

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.010 
down and then pull up once the Gunners
released<00:04:27.270> obviously<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:28.389> quite<00:04:28.570> important

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
released obviously it's quite important

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.339 
released obviously it's quite important
to<00:04:29.050> be<00:04:29.289> in<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:30.510> radio<00:04:31.510> contacts<00:04:31.930> or<00:04:32.110> voice

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
to be in a radio contacts or voice

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.529 
to be in a radio contacts or voice
communications<00:04:33.099> with<00:04:33.310> with<00:04:34.030> your<00:04:34.180> gunner<00:04:34.360> as

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
communications with with your gunner as

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.029 
communications with with your gunner as
he<00:04:34.690> can<00:04:34.840> tell<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.140> when<00:04:35.260> he's<00:04:35.440> released<00:04:35.560> as

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:36.450 
he can tell you when he's released as
otherwise

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
otherwise

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.460 
otherwise
it's<00:04:36.610> quite<00:04:36.850> hard<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.090> hear<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:38.080> when<00:04:38.380> you

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it's quite hard to hear so when you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.350 
it's quite hard to hear so when you
release<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.039> can<00:04:39.190> pull<00:04:39.370> off<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.910> go<00:04:40.060> hunt<00:04:40.270> for

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
release you can pull off and go hunt for

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.100 
release you can pull off and go hunt for
another<00:04:40.630> tank<00:04:41.759> in<00:04:42.759> bad<00:04:42.970> company<00:04:43.180> to<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.840> the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
another tank in bad company to the the

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.050 
another tank in bad company to the the
big<00:04:45.539> pilot<00:04:46.539> teton<00:04:46.960> technique<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.800> use<00:04:47.830> was<00:04:48.729> to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
big pilot teton technique to use was to

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.760 
big pilot teton technique to use was to
circle<00:04:49.630> strife<00:04:49.900> around<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> base<00:04:50.830> so<00:04:51.550> it's

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
circle strife around the base so it's

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.170 
circle strife around the base so it's
obviously<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.889> haven't<00:04:54.099> haven't<00:04:54.520> seen<00:04:54.819> any

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
obviously I haven't haven't seen any

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.510 
obviously I haven't haven't seen any
circle<00:04:55.630> strafing<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.169> that<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
circle strafing and that in the the

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.749 
circle strafing and that in the the
piloting<00:04:58.030> seat<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.479> battlefield<00:04:59.380> 3<00:04:59.470> so<00:04:59.979> what's

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
piloting seat in battlefield 3 so what's

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.200 
piloting seat in battlefield 3 so what's
the<00:05:01.120> technique<00:05:01.389> that<00:05:02.349> you<00:05:02.530> feel<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:03.639> is<00:05:03.910> most

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
the technique that you feel that is most

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.339 
the technique that you feel that is most
used<00:05:04.630> by<00:05:04.870> most<00:05:05.440> Pro<00:05:05.889> pilots<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.389> just<00:05:07.720> stay

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
used by most Pro pilots is it just stay

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:16.939 
used by most Pro pilots is it just stay
low<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.130> time

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.409
