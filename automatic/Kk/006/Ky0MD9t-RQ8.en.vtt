00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
that's a good starting point for what

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.990 
that's a good starting point for what

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
a bowl game last year and I think their

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.350 
a bowl game last year and I think their
work<00:00:39.260> ethic<00:00:39.440> was<00:00:40.129> with<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:40.489> mindset<00:00:40.970> let's

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
work ethic was with that mindset let's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.369 
work ethic was with that mindset let's
finish<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.750> season<00:00:41.989> let's<00:00:42.230> finish

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
everything we do let's take it one play

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.970 
everything we do let's take it one play
at<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.600> time<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:44.989> pay<00:00:45.140> attention<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.590> detail

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
at a time and pay attention to detail

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.069

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
and play with the good a good standard a

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.569 
and play with the good a good standard a
good<00:00:48.230> sense<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.500> urgency<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:49.130> I<00:00:49.250> think<00:00:49.430> that's

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
good sense of urgency and I think that's

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:50.830 
good sense of urgency and I think that's
what's<00:00:49.760> really<00:00:49.940> really<00:00:50.239> impressive<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:50.809> far

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
what's really really impressive so far

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.290 
what's really really impressive so far
with<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.260> group<00:00:51.470> picture<00:00:52.399> I<00:00:52.430> played<00:00:52.670> fast<00:00:52.940> and

with the group picture I played fast and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.490 
with the group picture I played fast and
have<00:00:53.450> a<00:00:53.480> point<00:00:53.809> I<00:00:53.870> guess<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.170> enough<00:00:54.320> have<00:00:54.469> a

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
have a point I guess it enough have a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.750 
have a point I guess it enough have a
playing<00:00:54.770> with<00:00:54.890> your<00:00:55.040> hands<00:00:55.219> with<00:00:55.430> your<00:00:55.520> feet

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
and everything we came to realize that

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.950 
and everything we came to realize that
in<00:00:57.890> spread<00:00:58.130> offense<00:00:58.579> as<00:00:59.510> more<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.840> like

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
in spread offense as more of like

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.619 
in spread offense as more of like
running<00:01:00.140> two<00:01:00.379> spots<00:01:00.680> and<00:01:01.129> we<00:01:02.090> didn't<00:01:02.270> have<00:01:02.390> to

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
running two spots and we didn't have to

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.990 
running two spots and we didn't have to
pay<00:01:03.410> that<00:01:03.440> much<00:01:03.800> attention<00:01:03.950> to<00:01:04.369> our<00:01:04.489> technique

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000
