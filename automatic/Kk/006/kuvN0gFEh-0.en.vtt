ok first off when we're fit in the
saddle<00:00:03.210> now<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.510> we<00:00:03.600> found<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.959> saddle<00:00:04.350> that

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
saddle now that we found a saddle that

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.860 
saddle now that we found a saddle that
fits<00:00:04.950> us<00:00:05.190> we're<00:00:06.150> going<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.359> take<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> our

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
fits us we're going to take it to our

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.419 
fits us we're going to take it to our
horse<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:07.379> try<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.680> make<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:07.919> fit<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.130> horse

horse and try and make it fit the horse
and<00:00:08.639> hope<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.420> fits<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> horse<00:00:09.929> before

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
and hope that it fits the horse before

we ride so what I like to do is I like

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.870 
we ride so what I like to do is I like
to<00:00:12.630> put<00:00:12.840> my<00:00:12.870> saddle<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.440> without<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.950> pad<00:00:14.160> just

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to put my saddle on without the pad just

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.300 
to put my saddle on without the pad just
so<00:00:14.969> i<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.150> feel<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.929> contact<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.770> bar<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
so i can feel the contact of the bar and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.300 
so i can feel the contact of the bar and
see<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.750> clearance<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.010> what<00:00:20.160> we're

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
see the clearance up here so what we're

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.000 
see the clearance up here so what we're
looking<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.060> if<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.680> clearance

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
looking for is if we can get a clearance

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.890 
looking for is if we can get a clearance

in there and get some clearance in there

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.490 
in there and get some clearance in there
that's<00:00:30.869> ideal<00:00:31.679> also<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:33.020> nice<00:00:34.020> even

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that's ideal also you want nice even

the way back from the front to the back
if<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.440> feel<00:00:40.710> upon<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.100> horse<00:00:41.370> if<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.879> doesn't

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
if I feel upon this horse if it doesn't

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.090 
if I feel upon this horse if it doesn't
fit<00:00:42.329> quite<00:00:42.780> right<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> little

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fit quite right if it's just a little

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.779 
fit quite right if it's just a little
bit<00:00:44.219> manute<00:00:44.879> off<00:00:45.950> right<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
bit manute off right in here in the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.340 
bit manute off right in here in the
middle<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> reach<00:00:48.629> under<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.320> feel

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
middle if I reach under here I can feel

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.889 
middle if I reach under here I can feel
a<00:00:49.590> little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:51.000> not<00:00:51.239> not<00:00:51.480> hitting<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
a little bit of it's not not hitting a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.209 
a little bit of it's not not hitting a
lot<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> pressure<00:00:52.379> right<00:00:52.530> there<00:00:52.829> which

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
lot of pressure right there which

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
lot of pressure right there which
increases<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.820> pressure<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> front<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
increases the pressure in the front in

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.500 
increases the pressure in the front in
the<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:56.190> if<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.520> minor<00:00:56.760> what<00:00:57.270> i<00:00:57.300> can

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the back so if it's a minor what i can

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040 
the back so if it's a minor what i can
do<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.660> take<00:00:57.960> an<00:00:58.109> old<00:00:58.410> pad<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.930> just<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
do is take an old pad like this just a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
do is take an old pad like this just a
thin<00:01:01.289> thin<00:01:01.890> nice<00:01:02.160> blanket<00:01:03.320> if<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.500> place<00:01:04.799> not

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
thin thin nice blanket if I place not

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
thin thin nice blanket if I place not
just<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.060> middle<00:01:06.229> hopefully

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
just in here in the middle hopefully

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
just in here in the middle hopefully
what<00:01:07.650> I'm<00:01:07.770> trying<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.430> increase

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
what I'm trying to do is just increase

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
what I'm trying to do is just increase
the<00:01:09.060> pressure<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.720> middle<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.170> hopefully

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the pressure in the middle and hopefully

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
the pressure in the middle and hopefully
to<00:01:11.010> decrease<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.909> pressure<00:01:12.119> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.900> front

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
to decrease the pressure at the front

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
to decrease the pressure at the front
and<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> back<00:01:13.880> if<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.119> pad<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.630> chick

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and the back if well pad like this chick

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.719 
and the back if well pad like this chick
doesn't<00:01:16.500> work<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> probably<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
doesn't work then you probably have to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.380 
doesn't work then you probably have to
find<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.240> new<00:01:18.509> saddle<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.070> source<00:01:20.310> ok<00:01:21.180> now

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
find a new saddle for this source ok now

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
find a new saddle for this source ok now
then<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.080> pad<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> put

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
then I've put this pad in here I put

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
then I've put this pad in here I put
this<00:01:23.310> right<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> middle<00:01:24.350> it's<00:01:25.350> only<00:01:25.650> about

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
this right in the middle it's only about

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800 
this right in the middle it's only about
a<00:01:25.890> half<00:01:26.070> gamestick<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.299> done<00:01:27.570> is

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
a half gamestick but what it is done is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
a half gamestick but what it is done is
just<00:01:28.439> filled<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.119> gap<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
just filled in a little bit of a gap and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
just filled in a little bit of a gap and
I<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.079> such<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> bridge<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.549> bar

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I didn't have such a bridge in the bar

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.679 
I didn't have such a bridge in the bar
so<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.479> feel<00:01:34.100> under<00:01:35.100> everything<00:01:35.689> I've

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
so now if I feel under everything I've

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
so now if I feel under everything I've
decreased<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> pressure<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> front

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
decreased the pressure here at the front

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.670 
decreased the pressure here at the front
and<00:01:38.820> I've<00:01:39.630> decreased<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> pressure<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and I've decreased the pressure in the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
and I've decreased the pressure in the
back<00:01:40.799> I've<00:01:41.130> taken<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> pressure

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
back I've taken a little bit of pressure

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.179 
back I've taken a little bit of pressure
up<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> middle<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> this

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
up in the middle because of this this

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.660 
up in the middle because of this this
space<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> top<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.549> get

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
space and also at the top here I can get

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
space and also at the top here I can get
a<00:01:47.700> bit<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.299> my<00:01:48.450> whole<00:01:48.659> hand<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.079> there<00:01:49.229> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a bit more of my whole hand in there so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.469 
a bit more of my whole hand in there so
actually<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> fit<00:01:50.729> quite<00:01:51.240> nice

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
actually this is going to fit quite nice

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.600 
actually this is going to fit quite nice

put like put my pad quite a bit forward

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
put like put my pad quite a bit forward
on<00:02:24.580> them<00:02:24.730> maybe<00:02:25.450> both<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> middle<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.170> his<00:02:26.290> leg

on them maybe both the middle of his leg

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.210 
on them maybe both the middle of his leg
just<00:02:28.870> gets<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.440> up<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.770> down<00:02:29.830> all<00:02:29.980> day

these<00:02:31.150> pads<00:02:31.420> eventually<00:02:31.930> seem<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.260> start

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
these pads eventually seem to start

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.290 
these pads eventually seem to start
working<00:02:32.650> their<00:02:32.920> way<00:02:32.950> back<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:33.550> then<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.150> can

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
working their way back and then you can

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.660 
working their way back and then you can
see<00:02:34.480> my<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:34.780> my<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.620> rockar<00:02:36.010> pad<00:02:36.340> here

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
see my little my little rockar pad here

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.780 
see my little my little rockar pad here
I<00:02:37.540> just<00:02:38.170> place<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.769> middle<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.100> that's

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
I just place it in the middle and that's

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.250 
I just place it in the middle and that's
the<00:02:39.910> one<00:02:40.060> that<00:02:40.209> will<00:02:40.300> hopefully<00:02:40.450> take<00:02:40.989> up<00:02:41.170> a

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
the one that will hopefully take up a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.080 
the one that will hopefully take up a
little<00:02:41.470> bit<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.650> pressure<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.730> area

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
little bit of pressure just in this area

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.030 
little bit of pressure just in this area
here<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:44.380> should<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> nice<00:02:44.769> even

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
here and we should have a nice even

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.870 
here and we should have a nice even
pressure<00:02:45.250> with<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.610> bar<00:02:45.910> going<00:02:46.690> back
