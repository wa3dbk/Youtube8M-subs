00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 They went to the meeting to look into each other's eyes. 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.470
 his 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.290
 put on being perfect talk everything 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.940
 You laughed the truck came out unscathed but the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.630
 truck like to release a car like that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630
 the little steering wheel 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.539
 AndrÃ© was back then you are there 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 in the meeting he's all perfect he knows 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 look into his eyes and it's like not all 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.130
 believe that you watched and you 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.380
 been in very long moments. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.100
 Pleasant together decision to home 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:47.730
 it may be that something rolled still reads 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:52.910
 You stay active and then one day passes without 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.910
 your floor goes by one yourself 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 he disappeared not only do men do this 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 many women also do not go 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.199
 do not talk about it, we will not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.990
 compromise rose it's who left today 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.390
 I come back but it's one was the technician took over 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.740
 It's nice, I'm talking about 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.040
 men and boys who only and not 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 I'm talking about inconsistency and he's just 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 I went around under the mold, I just did not 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.729
 I'm talking about this, I want to make a video. 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.860
 very soon the next week or 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.259
 Next I 'll talk about boys who 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.119
 not consistent but today I am 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 talking about it, this even knows that 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.100
 disappeared on what this could mean and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 this time usually happens, right? 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.500
 that you start thinking a thousand things you 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 begins to review the whole encounter what 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.890
 You did what you used, what you said 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.899
 here was what you said that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.939
 He assumed sex was what you did. 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.820
 which made him feel strange the disappearance 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.570
 can be used by many and many 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.850
 factors 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.200
 I'm going to give some today and that's how it is 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 the most common 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.729
 the first Swiss he did not like you hurts 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.220
 it hurts the soul in people who simply 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.489
 Disliked by 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.210
 so i co 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.670
 he may not be able to 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.860
 the future with you you can be just had 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.750
 a fight for him he can have you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.750
 the company but did not have this 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.750
 so he possibly did not like it so much 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.730
 How much do you possibly know? 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.310
 that same chemistry you did not like 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.800
 you really do not have that possibility 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.140
 but yes or meeting was good right now 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.960
 He likes and designes Saturday my 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.810
 sabbatic not no, right? 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.510
 he may still have things which his and 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.390
 this is not necessarily poetic bad 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.280
 Wow, I'm not good enough, I do not 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.070
 I'm beautiful enough I'm not cool 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.320
 enough for him is not the issue 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.860
 because if he left until 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.470
 abandoned that exaggerating the attacks if he 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.750
 did it for me he has reason to be 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.820
 you simply are not meant to 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.580
 second according to the second question 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.070
 especially if you guys are friends 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.300
 are known he was not really 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:18.240
 false increase he liked hillside of you 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.960
 but not the way you like it is 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.870
 ae 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.640
 then it might be that you think so 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.270
 You know more ahead but work. 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.400
 He only sees you as a friend, people stopped 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.640
 to think that this is a bad thing 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.890
 not a bad thing especially 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.310
 exciting leading of something worse 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 You want a guy who pretends like that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.230
 like you, you deserve better 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.820
 There's a thing for a guy here who 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.530
 It really takes time because he's a man. 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.600
 who likes you and not because he is 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.990
 pretending then there is nothing better than 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:02.970
 which cut at the beginning only once 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:06.370
 it's supposed to be another option he might not be 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.880
 emotionally prepared 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.980
 ai men men men name 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.900
 the amount of men nowadays that 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.560
 you are not emotionally prepared to 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.980
 a relationship is type in a list that 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.840
 we did not run wait because 99% 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.830
 often we're sad to 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.310
 think of yourself 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.490
 passed many times he just wants to 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.039
 amuse at the moment many times it goes 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 do something that this or something in the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.090
 his life that is preventing him is the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.770
 our moment and he is the one who would like to 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.680
 have a relationship with you but not 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.740
 moment in that moment in life does not 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:51.139
 and the last 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.120
 I like to believe that all the guys 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.740
 already disappeared in my life 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:10.039
 It was for this reason it does not all denial 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:14.810
 since it's you it's too much for me it's kind 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:18.139
 too much for me I do not like to use aa 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.050
 The word does not charge the phrase it is for 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.819
 I'm so tired because I heard you climb 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.740
 more in my life and I do not like the 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.469
 sentence her to cause I think half 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.129
 but I understand the concept of 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:34.610
 and let's say he realizes that you 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:41.419
 It's the business that you at for manners. 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:43.400
 Do you know how little size he is? 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.210
 he is not yet ready for a 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.210
 woman as wonderful as you 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.430
 so it is on all my next cars 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.690
 it was probably because of this 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.639
 canceled because right? 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.279
 there is no other justification we will be 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.650
 sincere kidding around here 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.050
 many guys know the woman who is 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.779
 Like the perfect woman for them and they 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.000
 know this but it's so shocking that he 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:13.250
 still not ready for a woman 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.259
 This is it, love and I hope 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.250
 I will have helped you keep an eye on you 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:21.560
 very well since then about men and 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.719
 consistency that only appear and appear 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.860

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:31.389

 feeling of being kissed to
