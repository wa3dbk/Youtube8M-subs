00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.550
 tell you about an event is super 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.360
 important not only the launch of the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.519
 new edition of modern master 2015 but 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.429
 also the biggest event of the 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.580
 magic story the best and biggest 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.309
 first play event that has never been 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.350
 offered the modern master weekend in 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.199
 mother master weekend is a competition 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.680
 super huge that will be organized at the same 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.140
 time in chivas 3 and las vegas exist 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.890
 three ways to fully enjoy the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.079
 modern master weekend first if you go to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.680
 attend the gpu 3 you will have to 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.670
 register first on the page of 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.250
 organizer that also also os 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.949
 attached in the description of this video 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.289
 second if you are not going to attend 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.820
 I recommend going to a nearby store 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.899
 because surely they were organizing 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.980
 type and in this way you can feel 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.770
 included in 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.840
 the game spirit devirtualize 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.220
 it's a cover list that we've called it 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.700
 round the clock what does this mean? 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.880
 that from the minute one in which 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.450
 start the event in chivas in japan 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.830
 until the forty thousand minute in which 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.270

 everything everything that is happening 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.790
 and third and super human we have a 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.950
 exclusive hashtag for this event to 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.710
