00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.670
 previous video 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.890
 I promised you that I was going to talk about 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.859
 capillary schedule and here I am to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 Talk about it there is a timeline nothing 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 more is than a shock treatment 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.439
 that you give your hair for a month 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.199
 is a treatment that people 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 they usually make the hall is to do 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.660
 treatment you will need three 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 types of masks first the mask 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.239
 hydration then nutrition and finally 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.309
 reconstruction in each video I will speak 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.079
 in detail what each of these is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 masks and what you need to 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.500
 identify each one of them and finally I 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.239
 I'll always show you how I graduated in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.820
 nutrition is possible only what I did 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.520
 that week and show you a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.559
 video of how I mixed a little bit of 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 as I applied to you to know with 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.960
 which do not get lost or 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.060
 lost in that they are watching 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.640
 It is in this process that I hope you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 enjoy the first stage of the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 schedule is hydration 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.030
 the hydration is for a mask to be 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.500
 considered with a mask 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.700
 hydration it must contain the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.790
 following ingredients 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.180
 first it uses in its formulation 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 vitamins aloe vera and glycerin ready 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.100
 no algal extract hydrolyzed protein 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 being friends i will be creative 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.070
 bepantol and the hydration function is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 back what the hair loses daily 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 so if you're feeling that your 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.899
 hair is in need of water you 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.450
 needs to hydrate 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.299
 this moisturizing mask it promotes 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.740
 a malleability and your hair is 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.479
 silk threads 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 then this is the characteristic for a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.130
 mask being considered for hydration is 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.570
 I 'll introduce you to I 'm going to put 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.909
 a place here as I did mine 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 moisturizing mason than the most famous 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.369
 more request is what most people like 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.619

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.179
 Hair setting and then I told 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.069
 You as I did 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.379
 during the video you will see that I 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.540
 I used the hair mask for hair 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.109
 flat with no one looks at the mayors 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.909
 vices and doses of natura and was excellent 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:24.299
 so I left my hair 40 minutes 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.829
 and the result is wonderful to show here 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.469

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:35.159
 embedded in rocco my fear button 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.920
 almost dry it was still not 100% dry 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.970
 but today I really like the result 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.269
 I know the adaptation of cornmeal gives me 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.250
 34 days without washing and looks great then 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.250
