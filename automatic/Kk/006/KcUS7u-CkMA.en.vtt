00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and without all the greetings today will tell you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.740
 as subordinate running lights on you own 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.090
 accidentally you 1 099 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 using five contact weld on and so 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.920
 how do connect and contact relays have 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 5 contacts which paragraphs are solved 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.170
 arches to this contact 30 85 86 87 and 88 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.260
 here's how to connect for example here 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 so it is inserted like this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.149
 30 i.e. my case is yellow wire 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.280
 there we connect plus when the machine is already 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.410
 work that is i will take it from 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.660
 generator 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.230
 then contact 88 or 87 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.700
 about my case is brown wire here and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.030
 connect plus daytime running lights -1 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.469
 Running alone I hitched to the ground 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 then contact 86 here is blue this is minus in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:07.140
 learning just forgive to mass a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.270
 contact 80 what is there 85 green about it 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.510
 we connect it turns out on plus to 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.729
 dimensions that is either speak there either 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.180
 dipped to someone as comfortable that is 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 when the car started I taught you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.670
 Daytime Running Lights 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.130
 when you turn on the near or envelope 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.979
 that is, as soon as you connect one and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.409
 running lights will fade away and so how 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.450
 connect this whole thing now show 10 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.210
 plus that is, I took a plus from the generator 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.070
 here it is, this wire is obtained where 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 to take 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 generators go it turns out 4 floor no 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.820
 these here are three together which is one 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
 thin-thin we need him not 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 gives when the car goes to 12 volts well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:58.399
 that is, it will not give 13 ideas there 14 general 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.399
 here it is about an hour I will show them closer 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.119
 here he is this proton kenobi he 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.009
 I need home how to connect - I donâ€™t 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.940
 I will show you where to get a plus 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.590
 from the low beam and either from the dimensions and 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.110
 so not in response and forces the chip out of the headlights and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:26.640
 now he will show the counter from the lights and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 using a multimeter as well, that is, 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.989
 I found no plus and here is 9 Seneca 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.700
 This is already disconnected connector Stalin this 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.349
 plus from the size of my case it's green 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.090
 but no ask for it in yellow 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.440
 it turns out plus goes on overall when 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 turns on says here it appears 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.590
 plus when dipped + 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.110
 appears turns on cris wire 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.349
 goes here plus get get appears 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.300
 here that is, if you want to not 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.790
 other navigation when in the chat of proximity 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.409
 there it fits here 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.849
 principle if you have a multimeter this 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.790
 you can call yourself 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 monks where and connect but now 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.519
 actually and the connection itself so take 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.989
 on the boom 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:24.200
 insert the chip as I said on 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:28.260
 pin 30 i.e. on the yellow wire 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:34.080
 we connect plus from the generator here I have 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:37.880
 I connect the wire to pin 30 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.600
 then on contact 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:53.100
 88 I connect plus daytime running 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:55.890
 lights here i have it closer here here's how 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.380
 then connect so they go off a 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.240
 dimensions or from the neighbor I did not become myself 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.240
 So do, but I will show you how to 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.470
 the light works in principle all here it is 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.210
 the connection itself is like this and of course 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.090
 if not so diversify think yourself 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.590
 I'll put everything neatly now 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.320
 show principle that's how it all works 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.489
 now we will be got out of the car 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.489
 dina lights come on 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.430
 I will show you how to make 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:55.820
 it turns out not on running gaske when you 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:58.520
 turn on the low beam and so here 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:07.010
 so we prepared the connector here and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:08.860
 leave the wire and clamp the other end 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:15.440
 so here 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:18.290
 contacts 85 86 that is here 700 i am cinema 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.440
 on the minus and now I'll show you how it all 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.440
 works 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.440
 as I said 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.120
 on the green wire 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.880
 there is no contact out of 5 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.420
 yes but where is 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.390
 in my case it will be my size 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:52.010
 autumn for 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.010
 Now I will include the envelope and 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.210
 that's when I'm eating blue 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.750
 I cling to the minus is to steal from us 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.000
 when we turn on 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.120
 talk and 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.820
 them running lights go out so 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.630
 study says login and hanami showing 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.630
 fig lit 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:28.220
 kill yourself in principle on this all 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.330
 subscribe to the put put likes channel 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.950
 comment there are such comments on 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.540
 video there leave uchtu 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:41.630
 so this is my first video please don't 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.630
 judge as they say well and everything
