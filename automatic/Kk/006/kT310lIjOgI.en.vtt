00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I know if you've played the game that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.520 
I know if you've played the game that
seems<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.850> an<00:01:35.850> easy<00:01:36.720> observation

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
seems like kind of a an easy observation

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
seems like kind of a an easy observation

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
since it starts and ends on a

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.990

reservation<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.520> assumed<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.939> was

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
reservation but I just assumed it was

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.630 
reservation but I just assumed it was
some<00:01:42.270> white<00:01:42.540> kid<00:01:42.869> who<00:01:42.899> wandered<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.680> at

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
some white kid who wandered in there at

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
some white kid who wandered in there at
the<00:01:44.820> risk<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> cultural<00:01:45.630> insensitivity<00:01:46.020> I'm

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the risk of cultural insensitivity I'm

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.370 
the risk of cultural insensitivity I'm
just<00:01:47.009> gonna<00:01:47.159> come<00:01:47.399> right<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.759> say<00:01:47.970> it
