zombies pond next to you in the diner
you<00:03:14.810> gotta<00:03:14.989> run<00:03:15.230> as<00:03:15.379> fast<00:03:15.590> as<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.069> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
you gotta run as fast as you can to the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.729 
you gotta run as fast as you can to the
bus<00:03:16.459> depot<00:03:16.639> so<00:03:17.419> he<00:03:17.599> spawns<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.229> keep<00:03:18.440> spawning

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
bus depot so he spawns it keep spawning

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.640 
bus depot so he spawns it keep spawning
and<00:03:19.129> spawning<00:03:19.970> until<00:03:20.449> the<00:03:20.569> spawns<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.440> last

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and spawning until the spawns the last

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.439 
and spawning until the spawns the last
time<00:03:21.859> on<00:03:22.010> bus<00:03:22.220> depot<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.819> he<00:03:22.940> gonna<00:03:23.060> see<00:03:23.269> right

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.449 
time on bus depot is he gonna see right

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:27.189 
time on bus depot is he gonna see right
now<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:24.849> here<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:25.879> the<00:03:26.120> zombie<00:03:26.419> he<00:03:26.659> spawned<00:03:27.019> on

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
now so here is the zombie he spawned on

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.050 
now so here is the zombie he spawned on
bus<00:03:27.440> depot<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.979> now<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.430> have<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.790> let<00:03:28.940> him

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
bus depot and now you have to let him

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.180 
bus depot and now you have to let him
bleed<00:03:29.329> out<00:03:29.479> ok<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:30.109> what<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.859> going<00:03:30.979> to

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
bleed out ok and what this is going to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.830 
bleed out ok and what this is going to
do<00:03:31.310> is<00:03:31.459> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.699> create<00:03:31.909> a<00:03:32.000> barrier<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:32.629> he

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
do is going to create a barrier so he

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.250 
do is going to create a barrier so he
dies<00:03:33.049> out<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.949> so<00:03:34.099> right<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:35.049> he<00:03:36.049> dies

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260

dies out is you so right there he dies
out<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:36.949> gonna<00:03:37.099> create<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.489> barrier

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
out and it's gonna create a barrier

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.509 
out and it's gonna create a barrier
which<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.530> obviously<00:03:39.979> going<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.310> allow<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519
