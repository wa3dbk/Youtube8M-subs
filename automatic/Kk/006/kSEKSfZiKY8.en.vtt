 my top 5 products below 5 euros but 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.780
 I also got some questions or me 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.210
 wanted to make a video about it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 my budget favorite in every category 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.199
 so my favorite budget foundation 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.910
 favorite a little eye shadow mine 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.390
 favorite buses that lipstick that I go 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.609
 do today 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 I start with the foundation and the first 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 product that I am going to show that we 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 you really got me on almost every one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 see how to use this tutorial 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.109
 namely this foundation of catrice de 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.719
 all matt plus shine control makeup one 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.760
 the color 010 light base really is a whole 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.809
 fine foundation the light color is real 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 very light 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 the foundation has a matte finish 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 but not so dull that you as the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 whole junk place is through it she sees 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 says corridor very nice foundation I think 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.809
 suitable for any out with a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 medium coverage and other from dislayk 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.820
 nice is not really a foundation 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 but a tinted moisturizer is the 11 bb 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.070
 cream with spf 20 so it also protects 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.760
 again against the harmful rays 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.230
 of the sun 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 he just touches my face 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.810
 smoother without the yes when low back out 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 you see my favorite concealer is there 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 one from catrice this is the motor home 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.010
 awl there are creamy concealer i like it 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.689
 has less color ivory trip good light 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.000
 good coverage whatever I expect 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.580
 of a creamy concealer and this use 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 I like to be with their asses and so on 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 to dot my favorite budget powder 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.590
 is this of 11 this is the high definition 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 power and this is a translusent powder 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 or a white powder that emma on you 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
 face 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.750
 this powder becomes transparent 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 face very much in matte 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.340
 without a yes super powdery finish 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.659
 and he makes your face like that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.280
 unwise 8 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.899
 my favorite bronzer who know a lot 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 probably yours too 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.130
 is this the nyc 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.590
 color wheel mosaic phase builder in the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.790
 color allover plan demolish is a lid 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.380
 but with so there is not so very 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.030
 a lot of it because yes yes he is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.200
 just completely dirty on the inside 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.540
 really forburg 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.099
 but this is a matte bronzer and what i am 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 I like that this one is not 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.880
 orange is clean and beautiful 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.630
 space I have this, I think three years 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.640
 so really for a long time and it still is 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.410
 not even a dent a detour after you 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.000
 you can really do it for a very long time 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.830
 so I never have another bronzer 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.640
 needed appears nice we continue 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.590
 with the pluses 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.170
 First I watched like plus signs of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.220
 sleek very good and fine and be 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.620
 nice colours 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.610
 of course my all time favorite 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.650
 rose gold 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.290
 you probably know it is 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.420
 a bit of the joep van nars orgasm i 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
 have them both but use them too 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.040
 very often the blush of it 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.630
 sleek are super pigmented really 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.310
 watch out a bit with this 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.780
 so you can't sleep in the stores 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.270
 so I buy two more 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.490
 other budget favorite blush shows 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.070
 when is this of essence this is just 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.290
 new what is the plusje powder blush in 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.010
 the color is stuck here and this is another 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.830
 bus from from orange to rosa with coral 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.780
 like color that has very beautiful 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.180
 really nice warm colors and then 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.550
 finally the blouses from h &amp; m 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.230
 also have very long but yet how 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.080
 you can still talk it's the blush 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.990
 go there and in the dazzling color peach 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.750
 this color is so beautiful it is 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.060
 really the perfect peaches coral hue 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.709
 very soft with a bit of pink 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.170
 not being processed 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.870
 glitter or so it is a matte blush 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.820
 really recommended than my favorite 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.650
 highlighters that are 2 of 11 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.300
 these are all sorts of incredibly beautiful 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.850
 and this is quite well known 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.100
 This is because highlighter Gordon clone 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.709
 it's called it's a white gold color 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.600
 with lots of beautiful very nice ones 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.239
 Glitters that really put together for a whole 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.340
 beautiful shine through worries and then this one 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.680
 this is the baked highlighter from 11 die 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.510
 is a bit newer and this is in the color 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.850
 nice light-pearl also this is a bit 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.830
 a white goldish he reader but then 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.110
 just a little more pressure 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.330
 also a warm shade gives a very nice one 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.300
 shine you don't really see glitter 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.770
 you succeeded but above all a very beautiful one 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.450
 subtle shine to continue with the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.090
 eye makeup and first of all late in my 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.430
 favorite budget pallets 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.930
 in the first place a palette palette game 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.940
 french 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.800
 I've walked just one but caught 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.570
 I actually find all pallets from Sleek 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.240
 very beautiful this one has vintage romance 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.530
 with beautiful purple hues and eye shadows 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.940
 of sludge are very well pigmented 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.040
 really always just a little powdery 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.410
 but yes there you learn to cooperate as 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.290
 your sleek and all matter know the palette 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.150
 are just incredibly handy and whole 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.169
 You can use it to be polished 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.720
 in all directions 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.280
 and I really recommend this 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.740
 pallet of essence is very beautiful 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.960
 it is both paradise you and though 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.479
 contains the knot here by Rice 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.240
 six colors arrows color with whole 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.010
 a lot of shine but these are really very bad 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.780
 nice for a summer 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.090
 colorful look and some loose eye shadows 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.160
 as far as I am concerned, that of catrice 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.380
 best when it comes to budget 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.870
 eyeshadows this is the color gold 'a 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.110
 evergreen very nice moss green color with 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.770
 a golden shine and this is the color plan 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.690
 on the chip and this is very beautiful 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.760
 wine red with also with golden glitter 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.310
 they are in and the eye shadows by Catrice 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.320
 well pigmented not all that 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.150
 I need to change there me them so you 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.979
 should really test them in you 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.840
 stores have the eye shadow 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.789
 testuser area where we are really one 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.030
 very nice between including this second 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.550
 my favorite budget eyeliner is this one 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.979
 of 11 this is the horcrux eyeliner pen and 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.690
 this one with such a dot 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.940
 though this kind of eyeliners dry quite there 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.830
 quickly he is really intense black and 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.690
 provides nice thin line but you can 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.400
 even thicker longer moves 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.229
 really a very good eyeliner only yes 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.479
 shame he got out of Roc's so quickly 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.330
 I think that's just a general one 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.910
 problem with many dot eyeliners then 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.979
 we arrived at mascara and i am 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.450
 not really a budget mascara girl i 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:06.220
 love the masses of very much 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.660
 max factor so this if a little 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.370
 difficult for but I still have one 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.560
 found what I am excited about 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.229
 and that is this from catrice 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.990
 the glamor doll is to meet masca 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.240
 waterproof and what makes this mascara so nice 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.039
 makes is the brush 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.130
 he is such a plastic brush with van 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.810
 That 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.120
 short spines and whatever I like 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.710
 is that this is waterproof i get 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.080
 not tasting mascara every day 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.360
 but if i want it then put it on and on 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.820
 then yes my eyelashes really stay all day 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.420
 just good black and he doesn't braid either 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.340
 and so on 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.800
 and finally arrived at the 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.460
 lips lipsticks of Catrice I think 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.920
 very nice 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.270
 this is my favorite it is the color the 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.370
 denominate the further 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.290
 For me, this really is the perfect luna 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.570
 not the pink one because there 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.040
 that is not in my yellow undertone 

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.960
 neither too light nor too dark 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.940
 really the perfect color in the lipsticks 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.930
 Monkeys have a very nice shape because 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.780
 they are whole 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.730
 roma pigmented but at the same time 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.440
 you will sit very well and this one 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.900
 I also thought to show what this is 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.120
 a pure shine lipstick from hema this is 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.860
 number 12 a diet straight out of my mind 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.100
 bright pink the name is not on it 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.410
 but this is really bright bright pink to 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.880
 this one is really very cool so the 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.020
 lift is from hema its also really it 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.790
 worth trying 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.230
 that he then wears a lip gloss 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.390
 last category first one 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.250
 lip gloss of 10 I only have one 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.590
 but I think that is very nice 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.419
 i think my most worn lip gloss and 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.430
 I like the formula of these lip glosses 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.890
 van t is really very nice nice and light 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.570
 and airy especially not sticky and if 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.490
 the end of this essence lip gloss 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.080
 whose packaging is complete 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.710
 worn out so I don't know how anymore 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.050
 hot 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.110
 I know it will shine to xxxl 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.850
 is lip gloss and this is really very bad 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.890
 great this is really such a beautiful one 

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:52.340
 portable new color that actually 

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.540
 everywhere with fits everywhere can and this 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.890
 is really very old so I would 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.979
 actually maybe have a little 

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.720
 throw it away but it is so beautiful 

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.910
 and those were all my budget favorite 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.800
 by category I hope you do something about it 

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.450
 have had and especially share your 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:09.640
