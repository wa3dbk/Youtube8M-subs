00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 well let's continue with the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.000
 criteria for choosing a puppy 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.210
 we have been seeing the teacher the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 mental the part of the instincts too 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.280
 of hunting and the standard of parents 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.890
 even some littermates 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 previous but something important that no 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.390
 we must forget 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 and the health of animals and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
 possible genetic defects that we can 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.150
 be seeing that we can that they can 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.329
 jump into view or take your 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 capture the first thing that I look at 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.220
 miguelángel you are correcting me if you 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.199
 you see other things too but it's in the 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.850
 area of ​​the head you do not have to look that 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.890
 the eyes 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.280
 the dilated pupils are moist and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 that the mucous membranes are rosy 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.480
 those who have a good blood supply 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 and that dogs are well hydrated 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.879
 they do not have any kind of pathology that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.250
 there is no excessive tearing that guarantees 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.420
 that the eyelids are firmly 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.649
 subject to orbit are and how should 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.049
 to be a dog as a dog must be 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.240
 healthy that has neither its own nor entropion or 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.819
 eyelids outward or inward there 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.149
 that look at the nose and nose has to 

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.890
 be wet and clean without getting runny 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.920
 Excessive mucus can also 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.340
 indicate that there may be some of the sign 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.340
 of illness 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 and the mucous membranes also in the mouth 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.750
 that they are pink and wet without 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.780
 there is more salivation 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.310
 another important thing is the denture of 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.370
 the denture should bite in scissors here 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.920
 we see how it perfectly reaches the 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.290
 part above on the bottom one that is 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.520
 teething the scissor lock and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.430
 we have to see that there is no prognathism 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.570
 what would be the opposite is to say that the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 lower part 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.070
 will gándará on the superior one we see what is 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.350
 the closing in scissors and as the teeth 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.440
 that are now changing they close 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.930
 perfectly the two canines and is 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.030
 already losing some of the teeth of 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.800
 milk and teething is perfect and we see 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.780
 that are all the molars and premolars 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.550
 that also now they are 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.900
 changing but there is no absence of 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.030
 any 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 we move on to another important issue the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 ears the internal auditory pavilion should 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.959
 be clean and dry sometimes we see that 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.760
 there is excess wax and this here we see that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.390
 the pain is perfectly clean 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.040
 sometimes too 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.810
 although it can if it is unpleasant 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.000
 it has to be a smell of the mixture 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.310
 natural and if it was unpleasant 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 could do that there was some kind of 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.920
 otitis and how good is that the breeder 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.030
 must hold responsible to take responsibility 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.569
 to deliver the dog in perfect 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.569
 terms
