scraper needle it's just a nice sharp
tool<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.620> makes<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.309> bit

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
tool that this makes it a little bit

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.400 
tool that this makes it a little bit
easier<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> pull<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> out<00:00:48.359> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.870> cutter<00:00:49.079> once

easier to pull it out of the cutter once

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
easier to pull it out of the cutter once
you've<00:00:49.559> got<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.739> cut<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.390> there's<00:00:51.390> three

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
different types of gum paste that you

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.950 
different types of gum paste that you
can<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> found<00:00:54.269> in<00:00:54.359> my<00:00:54.390> experience<00:00:54.870> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
can use that I found in my experience to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779 
can use that I found in my experience to
work<00:00:55.109> well<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.499> these<00:00:55.679> I<00:00:55.980> found<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.670> my

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
work well with these I found that my

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
work well with these I found that my
traditional<00:00:57.239> method<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.780> adding<00:00:58.320> tylose

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
well with these need something a little

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
well with these need something a little
bit<00:01:02.399> stiffer<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.659> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> same<00:01:04.050> time

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
see it a little bit better against this

see it a little bit better against this
dark<00:01:30.689> surface<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.040> rolling<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> out

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
dark surface so just rolling it out

there on my mini mat I'm just gonna peel
this<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.180> pretty<00:01:36.450> thin<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.110> think

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this up and this is pretty thin I think

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.749 
this up and this is pretty thin I think
probably<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.009> little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.280> thinner<00:01:38.460> than<00:01:38.549> an

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
probably a little bit thinner than an

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
probably a little bit thinner than an
eighth<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> an<00:01:39.360> inch<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.740> I'm<00:01:40.829> gonna<00:01:40.979> do

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
eighth of an inch so what I'm gonna do

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
eighth of an inch so what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:42.060> give<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:42.780> spritz<00:01:43.110> with

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is just give this a little spritz with

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.609 
is just give this a little spritz with
canola<00:01:43.740> spray<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> I'll<00:01:45.780> do<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> spritz<00:01:46.530> of

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
canola spray so I'll do the spritz of

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.020 
canola spray so I'll do the spritz of
canola<00:01:46.829> spray<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.280> use<00:01:47.399> vegetable<00:01:47.850> spray

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
you can also go back with your ball tool

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.380 
you can also go back with your ball tool
and<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.800> kind<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.070> go<00:02:11.280> over<00:02:11.580> those<00:02:11.880> cut<00:02:12.180> lines

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.680 
on the edge of the cutter and make sure
it's<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> release<00:02:14.970> nicely<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.600> you

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560 
you look at these that I've already done
this<00:02:53.830> one<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.040> dried<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.820> a<00:02:54.940> net<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.270> a<00:02:55.330> half

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
this one I dried just a net and a half

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.720 
this one I dried just a net and a half
moon-shaped<00:02:55.900> former<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.100> then<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.340> one<00:02:57.550> in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
moon-shaped former and then this one in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.700 
moon-shaped former and then this one in
the<00:02:57.880> flower<00:02:58.120> shaped<00:02:58.570> former<00:02:58.990> so<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> get<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
the flower shaped former so you get a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.200 
the flower shaped former so you get a
couple<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.070> different<00:03:00.460> effects<00:03:00.850> I'll<00:03:01.030> put<00:03:01.150> all

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
couple of different effects I'll put all

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.030 
couple of different effects I'll put all
three<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.570> those<00:03:01.660> together<00:03:01.900> but<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.860> look

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
three of those together but you can look

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.560 
three of those together but you can look
at<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> other<00:03:03.460> designs<00:03:03.790> here<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.270> can<00:03:04.420> see

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
at the other designs here you can see

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.940 
at the other designs here you can see
how<00:03:04.660> pretty<00:03:04.870> these<00:03:05.110> look<00:03:05.320> layer<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.740> one's
