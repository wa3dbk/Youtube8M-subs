00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.830
 as we have seen in the definition the 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.440
 defense in zone each one is responsible 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.420
 of a space in the field and we're 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.059
 seen in the individual defense we can 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.919
 apply the defense by pressing all the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.130
 midfield field even more closed 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.759
 we will place the four defenders the 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.759
 four attackers 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.060
 and there are several ways to place the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.720
 defense in zone 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.770
 a situation in square or 22 where 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.500
 Each player is responsible for this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.080
 space 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.080
 and we divide the field into four parts 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 regardless of the players that 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 beech in each target area is vascular 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.010
 the whole team depending on where it is 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.590
 the ball if there are two players what is not 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.530
 we will never be this but every 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.509
 one will keep his position yes 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.320
 the main objective instead of defending 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.690
 in square is in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.160
 rhombus the initial situation 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.000
 will be this and we will divide the field in 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.000
 different zones 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.680
 where will play a very important role 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.200
 goalkeeper and everyone will be responsible for 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.350
 a certain area the same criteria 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.780
 it will be important not 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.580
 move independently of the number 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.220
 of players in each zone each 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.170
 one is responsible for their space and in the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.360
 moment that the ball enters our 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.850
 spaces when we have to press that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.979
 defend in zone is not equal until 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.560
 relaxed not much less that the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.869
 moment that receives the ball inside 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 our area we have to go for it and 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.680
 we have to try to recover it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.770
 because we say that the goalkeeper plays a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.440
 important role because the whole team 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.420
 scales a lot where the ball is 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.540
 what happens when we press what is left 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.520
 a lot of space behind our backs 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 defensive players then the goalkeeper 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.590
 is when you have to read very well the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.020
 situations and go out to cut any 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.020
 pass that occurs in diagonals 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.310
 the zone defense is that different one 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.530
 of each one maintains its position in the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.750
 field independently of 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.500
 movements that the opposing team makes 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.540
 if you look at this shot 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.850
 the attacking players are in 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.870
 constant movement and players 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.640
 defenders are responsible for an area 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.970
 at the moment the ball enters his 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.150
 area is very important to press hard 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.049
 to the ball 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.049
 in this way 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.550
 will cause for the opposing team a 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.430
 much greater difficulty in development 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.590
 of his offensive game and allow our 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.569
 defending 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.569
 you can retrieve the ball and be able to search 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.580
 the goal that is the ultimate goal in the 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.060
 indoor football 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.060
 the
