00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
used that to outline her face a bit and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.150 
used that to outline her face a bit and

white<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.910> think<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.780> picket<00:02:39.080> fence<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.940> I

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
white I think it's picket fence and I

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.980 
white I think it's picket fence and I
use<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.780> color<00:02:42.350> her<00:02:42.740> face<00:02:43.130> and<00:02:43.930> normally<00:02:44.930> i

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
use it to color her face and normally i

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.230 
use it to color her face and normally i
would<00:02:45.200> use<00:02:45.380> gesso<00:02:45.950> but<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.520> this<00:02:46.670> case<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.120> was

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
would use gesso but in this case it was

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.150 
would use gesso but in this case it was
all<00:02:47.630> about<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.110> spray<00:02:48.350> so<00:02:48.740> i<00:02:49.120> use<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:51.130> then<00:02:52.130> i

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
all about the spray so i use that then i

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.420

brighten up the the bumblebees and use a
marker<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:04.160> go<00:04:04.459> over<00:04:04.910> every<00:04:05.269> insect<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.959> make

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
marker to go over every insect to make

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.140

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
them stand out a bit more it didn't feel

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.180 
them stand out a bit more it didn't feel
really<00:04:08.540> comfortable<00:04:08.750> with<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.620> way<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.980> was

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
really comfortable with the way this was

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.150 
really comfortable with the way this was
going<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:13.239> well<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.480> thought<00:04:15.050> why<00:04:15.560> has<00:04:16.130> a

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
going and and well I thought why has a

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.420 
going and and well I thought why has a
lady<00:04:16.640> got<00:04:17.090> all<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.570> these<00:04:18.380> insects<00:04:19.040> on<00:04:19.250> her

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
lady got all this these insects on her

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.580 
lady got all this these insects on her
face<00:04:19.669> so<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:19.940> thought<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.810> just<00:04:21.080> a<00:04:21.200> strange

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
face so I thought it's just a strange

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.850 
face so I thought it's just a strange
kind<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.070> attraction

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
kind of attraction

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.520 
kind of attraction
I<00:04:23.919> use<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.639> as<00:04:24.969> a<00:04:25.000> sentiment<00:04:25.599> don't<00:04:26.169> know<00:04:26.319> why

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
I use that as a sentiment don't know why

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.059 
I use that as a sentiment don't know why
I<00:04:26.560> think<00:04:27.219> it<00:04:27.370> fits<00:04:27.969> the<00:04:28.150> page<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:30.750> wow<00:04:32.069> we'll
