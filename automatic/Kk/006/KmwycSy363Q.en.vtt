00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
basically you just practice against uh

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.429 
basically you just practice against uh
instead<00:01:56.539> of<00:01:56.600> you're<00:01:56.719> up<00:01:56.810> against<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.109> person

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
instead of you're up against a person

instead of you're up against a person
but<00:01:57.799> with<00:01:57.859> that<00:01:57.979> half<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.609> board<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.350> folded

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
but with that half the board is folded

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.649 
but with that half the board is folded
up<00:02:00.499> and<00:02:00.679> you<00:02:00.770> can<00:02:01.280> there's<00:02:01.490> little<00:02:01.999> target

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
up and you can there's little target

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.330 
up and you can there's little target
stuff<00:02:02.929> here<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.649> basically<00:02:03.829> just<00:02:04.009> got<00:02:04.310> a

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
stuff here and you basically just got a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.849 
stuff here and you basically just got a
you<00:02:05.329> just<00:02:05.479> gotta<00:02:05.659> aim<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.170> hit<00:02:06.319> the<00:02:06.409> targets

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
you just gotta aim and hit the targets

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.609 
you just gotta aim and hit the targets
and<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:07.039> get<00:02:07.159> points<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:08.539> want<00:02:08.750> that<00:02:08.990> and

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
and you get points and you want that and

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.170 
and you get points and you want that and
then<00:02:09.860> there's<00:02:10.039> head-to-head<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:11.030> is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
then there's head-to-head this is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.080 
then there's head-to-head this is
probably<00:02:11.860> as<00:02:12.860> much<00:02:13.160> as<00:02:13.280> great<00:02:13.610> as<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> other

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
probably as much as great as the other

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
probably as much as great as the other
parts<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.569> application<00:02:14.750> are<00:02:15.140> head<00:02:15.830> des

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
parts of this application are head des

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.130 
parts of this application are head des
actually<00:02:16.400> probably<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.750> cooler

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
actually probably one of the cooler

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.170 
actually probably one of the cooler
parts<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.920> because<00:02:19.580> head-to-head

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
parts of it because head-to-head

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.780 
parts of it because head-to-head
what<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.840> totally<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:22.430> normal

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
what is is it totally the the normal

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550 
what is is it totally the the normal
thing<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.270> totally<00:02:23.540> different<00:02:23.630> basically

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
thing is totally different basically

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.230 
thing is totally different basically
instead<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:24.920> doing<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.580> from<00:02:25.700> like<00:02:25.880> your<00:02:26.060> you

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
instead of doing it from like your you

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.400 
instead of doing it from like your you
know<00:02:26.330> your<00:02:26.510> point<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.870> view<00:02:26.990> where<00:02:27.140> you'd<00:02:27.260> be

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
know your point of view where you'd be

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.810 
know your point of view where you'd be
doing<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.740> ping<00:02:27.920> pong<00:02:27.950> you're<00:02:28.580> actually

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
doing the ping pong you're actually

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:29.350 
doing the ping pong you're actually
looking<00:02:28.940> at

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
looking at

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.210 
looking at
above<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.290> that's<00:02:30.530> really<00:02:30.890> cool<00:02:31.100> because

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
above and that's really cool because

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.710 
above and that's really cool because
that<00:02:31.490> way<00:02:31.580> two<00:02:31.820> people<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.240> play<00:02:32.270> on<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.570> same

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
that way two people can play on the same

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.890 
that way two people can play on the same
device<00:02:32.870> really<00:02:33.230> easily<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:35.210> works<00:02:35.690> really

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
device really easily and it works really

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.810 
device really easily and it works really
well<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.740> then<00:02:36.950> there's<00:02:37.160> practice<00:02:37.610> mode

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
well and then there's practice mode

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.250 
well and then there's practice mode
which<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.270> basically<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.930> kind<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.140> like

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
which is basically just kind of like

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.200 
which is basically just kind of like
tournament<00:02:39.650> mode<00:02:39.830> except<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.760> go<00:02:40.910> up<00:02:41.000> against

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
tournament mode except you go up against

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.510 
tournament mode except you go up against
the<00:02:41.450> other<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.290> other<00:02:42.470> team<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:43.250> and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
the other the other team is and

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.190 
the other the other team is and
basically<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.570> only<00:02:44.660> difference<00:02:45.020> is<00:02:45.170> that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
basically the only difference is that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.510 
basically the only difference is that
you're<00:02:45.560> not<00:02:45.710> actually<00:02:45.860> in<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.190> tournament

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
you're not actually in a tournament

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.590 
you're not actually in a tournament
you're<00:02:46.820> just<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.120> know<00:02:47.240> you<00:02:47.300> can<00:02:47.510> pick

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
you're just you know you can pick

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.330 
you're just you know you can pick
whoever<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.960> want<00:02:48.200> play<00:02:48.620> one<00:02:48.800> match<00:02:49.040> that's

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
whoever you want play one match that's

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.810 
whoever you want play one match that's
okay

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
okay

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.300 
okay
and<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:51.140> generally<00:02:51.650> seems<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> be<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> little

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
and it generally seems to be a little

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.900 
and it generally seems to be a little
easier<00:02:52.460> to<00:02:54.160> what<00:02:55.160> Cup<00:02:55.310> ping-pong<00:02:55.670> is

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
easier to what Cup ping-pong is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.550 
easier to what Cup ping-pong is
currently<00:02:56.480> nine<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.840> since<00:02:56.960> the<00:02:57.110> AppStore

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
and there's also a lite version as well

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.930 
and there's also a lite version as well
