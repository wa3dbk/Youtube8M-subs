00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
so I can just tie that in just do a

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.290 
so I can just tie that in just do a
couple<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:04.940> turns<00:01:05.149> to<00:01:05.600> secure<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.440> there

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
couple of turns to secure it in there

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.639 
couple of turns to secure it in there
for<00:01:08.300> our<00:01:08.390> rib<00:01:08.600> we're<00:01:08.960> gonna<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.350> using<00:01:09.619> a

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
for our rib we're gonna be using a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.580 
for our rib we're gonna be using a
material<00:01:09.890> called<00:01:10.039> Peters<00:01:10.580> ribbon<00:01:10.940> quill<00:01:11.590> it's

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
material called Peters ribbon quill it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.380 
material called Peters ribbon quill it's
basically<00:01:12.979> a<00:01:14.530> pearlescent<00:01:15.530> round<00:01:16.039> rib<00:01:19.390> so

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
basically a pearlescent round rib so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.000 
basically a pearlescent round rib so
again<00:01:20.599> we're<00:01:20.750> gonna<00:01:20.840> tie<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.080> in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.230 

then<00:01:27.850> Puglia<00:01:28.300> spun<00:01:28.750> flex<00:01:28.990> tight<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:31.000> take

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
then Puglia spun flex tight and take

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.880 
then Puglia spun flex tight and take
your<00:01:31.450> thread<00:01:31.660> down<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.230> body<00:01:32.410> keeping<00:01:32.710> this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
your thread down the body keeping this

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.880 
your thread down the body keeping this
bum<00:01:33.130> flex<00:01:33.480> as<00:01:34.480> much<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:34.870> she<00:01:34.990> can<00:01:35.170> on<00:01:35.500> top<00:01:35.740> of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
bum flex as much as she can on top of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.290 
bum flex as much as she can on top of
the<00:01:35.950> body<00:01:36.130> of<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.430> fly<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:39.550> then<00:01:39.700> take<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.060> all

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.920 
the body of the fly and then take it all
the<00:01:40.330> way<00:01:40.480> back<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.080> head<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.840> this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
the way back up to the head at this

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.680 
the way back up to the head at this
point<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.760> spun<00:01:46.090> flex<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.450> pull<00:01:46.570> it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
point take a spun flex and pull it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.550 
point take a spun flex and pull it
really<00:01:46.840> tight<00:01:46.930> and<00:01:47.640> then<00:01:48.640> proceed<00:01:49.360> to<00:01:49.720> winding
