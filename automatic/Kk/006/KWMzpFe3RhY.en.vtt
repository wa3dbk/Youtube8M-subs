00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.259
 we must in turn 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.839
 the fire 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.360
 I 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.360
 everything is ok 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.290
 a bit confused 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.040
 i had better 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.700
 this certainly wasn't 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.250
 bam about iran that is how the work hopes 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.430
 yes and that is a good reason 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 she will be this winter so you actually want it 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450
 become a teacher 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.020
 for the the dakar rally 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.250
 I this not very uncertain the dakar rally is going to drive 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.600
 the weather is better here only this last pro race was less successful 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.820
 the car grolse and nothing wrong 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.850
 Otis more ordinary repentant March afterwards turned out to be a certain on a profit point 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.440
 of the four gates 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.000
 have been shot under the hood 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.330
 and the man's duties and you go one again but we have two more to test 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.150
 so have said that I have this basis 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 oad is still reasonable as it is now 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.679
 yes we just go 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.259
 to go within the days 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:14.049
 we have not sure but 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.049
 we will see 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.659
 this a great day 4 would be beautiful weather 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.389
 how honestly went 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.760
 yes I thought so again another stage today fortunately we are twice as happy 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.029
 falls there 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.449
 it was just as much work, but work 2 was fair and new 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.199
 formerly started the 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.599
 10 actually went now being energetic of course you can have to get yourself 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.519
 pick up after his big blow 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.519
 but with actually nice discontinued 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.379
 only the 5 kilometers 10x backwards the lowest 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.459
 I think that has something to do with the crash but 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.899
 the actual nel roeleveld times with without having driven 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.779
 and that was also two years out of battle 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.549
 even though it is now also on it 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:09.849
 on the bivouac 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.869
 especially the old one it goes in the sixteen meter 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.089
 to contain 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.019
 at 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.760
 which I actually have no experience with but that is a very good one 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.419
 afghanen 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.819
 once I did pass but it will be shown and that was actually a bit 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:27.079
 bit our own fault because we are the hunter 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.719
 nevertheless the first one went the turn 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.040
 well that 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.140
 he is not on everything and I am happy that his people are there 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.610
 power over at the start
