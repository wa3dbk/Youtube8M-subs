that plastic was cut and just taped I'm

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.229 
that plastic was cut and just taped I'm
not<00:00:30.200> sure<00:00:30.349> which<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:31.029> supposed<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.059> be<00:00:32.149> the

correct method but in any case here we
are<00:00:35.120> looking<00:00:35.510> at<00:00:35.600> stegasaurus<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.559> it<00:00:36.860> looks

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
are looking at stegasaurus and it looks

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.580 
are looking at stegasaurus and it looks
really<00:00:37.340> good<00:00:37.899> you<00:00:38.899> know<00:00:38.960> one<00:00:39.260> point<00:00:39.440> of

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
really good you know one point of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.990 
really good you know one point of
interest<00:00:39.950> here<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.280> that<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.700> looks<00:00:40.879> like

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
interest here is that it looks like

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.720 
interest here is that it looks like
there<00:00:41.149> are<00:00:41.180> two<00:00:41.620> variations<00:00:42.620> in<00:00:43.219> this<00:00:43.489> deco

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
there are two variations in this deco

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.380 
there are two variations in this deco
Saurus<00:00:44.210> paint<00:00:45.020> scheme<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:46.190> looks<00:00:46.760> like<00:00:46.940> on<00:00:47.149> one

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
Saurus paint scheme it looks like on one

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.910 
Saurus paint scheme it looks like on one
version<00:00:47.629> which<00:00:47.989> is<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.170> one<00:00:48.230> that<00:00:48.440> I<00:00:48.499> received

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
version which is the one that I received

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.169 
version which is the one that I received
the<00:00:49.519> plates<00:00:49.870> have<00:00:50.870> like<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.079> brown<00:00:51.940> kind<00:00:52.940> of

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
the plates have like a brown kind of

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:56.169 
the plates have like a brown kind of
encircling<00:00:54.019> there<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.440> plates<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.609> in

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
encircling there in the plates and in

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.000 
encircling there in the plates and in
the<00:00:57.010> other<00:00:58.010> version<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.510> dinosaur<00:00:59.960> has<00:01:00.230> more

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
the other version the dinosaur has more

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.860 
the other version the dinosaur has more
of<00:01:01.069> a<00:01:01.129> white<00:01:01.370> circling<00:01:01.969> inside<00:01:02.329> those<00:01:02.539> plates

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
of a white circling inside those plates

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.840 
of a white circling inside those plates
this<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:03.890> actually<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.309> one<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:04.580> I<00:01:04.610> thought

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
this is actually the one that I thought

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.670 
this is actually the one that I thought
looked<00:01:05.150> a<00:01:05.239> little<00:01:05.330> bit<00:01:05.540> better<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:05.870> I<00:01:06.050> am<00:01:06.409> glad

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
looked a little bit better so I am glad

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.830 
looked a little bit better so I am glad
that<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.860> got<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:07.370> well<00:01:08.150> here's<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.420> view<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.750> the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that I got it well here's a view of the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
that I got it well here's a view of the
other<00:01:09.050> side<00:01:09.340> not<00:01:10.340> quite<00:01:10.550> sure<00:01:10.580> which<00:01:10.940> one<00:01:11.240> is

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
other side not quite sure which one is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.050 
other side not quite sure which one is
his<00:01:11.600> good<00:01:11.840> side<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.530> think<00:01:13.100> stegosaur<00:01:13.610> kind<00:01:13.909> of

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
his good side I think stegosaur kind of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.180 
his good side I think stegosaur kind of
seems<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.450> indicate<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.900> me<00:01:15.020> that<00:01:15.070> that<00:01:16.070> his

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
seems to indicate to me that that his

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.300 
seems to indicate to me that that his
left<00:01:16.460> side<00:01:16.760> is<00:01:17.000> actually<00:01:17.360> his<00:01:17.450> good<00:01:17.689> side<00:01:17.930> so

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
left side is actually his good side so

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.740 
left side is actually his good side so
we'll<00:01:19.310> turn<00:01:19.490> him<00:01:19.610> over<00:01:19.850> we'll<00:01:20.450> turn<00:01:20.570> him<00:01:20.689> back

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
we'll turn him over we'll turn him back

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.810 
we'll turn him over we'll turn him back
over<00:01:21.079> in<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.439> sec<00:01:21.710> definitely<00:01:22.610> want<00:01:22.759> to

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
over in just a sec definitely want to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.429 
over in just a sec definitely want to
give<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.060> look<00:01:23.240> at<00:01:23.390> him<00:01:23.540> from<00:01:23.719> all<00:01:23.899> angles

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
give you a look at him from all angles

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.499 
give you a look at him from all angles
yeah<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.369> expression<00:01:25.759> on<00:01:25.850> his<00:01:25.969> face<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.479> a

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
yeah the expression on his face is a

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.249 
yeah the expression on his face is a
little<00:01:27.310> dopey<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:28.340> should<00:01:28.610> say<00:01:28.820> but<00:01:29.719> you<00:01:30.110> know

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
little dopey I should say but you know

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.620 
little dopey I should say but you know
maybe<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.039> realistic<00:01:31.520> who<00:01:31.850> knows<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.509> I

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
maybe it's realistic who knows and I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.029 
maybe it's realistic who knows and I
know<00:01:32.689> y'all<00:01:32.990> want<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.289> see<00:01:33.439> stegosauruses

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
know y'all want to see stegosauruses

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.639 
know y'all want to see stegosauruses
backside<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:34.909> there<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.180> is<00:01:35.320> and<00:01:36.320> there<00:01:36.500> he<00:01:36.590> is

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
backside so there it is and there he is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.480 
backside so there it is and there he is
laying<00:01:37.070> down<00:01:37.509> uh-oh<00:01:38.920> better<00:01:39.920> turn<00:01:40.219> them<00:01:40.369> over

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
laying down uh-oh better turn them over

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.660 
laying down uh-oh better turn them over
and<00:01:41.020> finally<00:01:42.020> there's<00:01:42.200> his<00:01:42.350> underside<00:01:42.799> now

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and finally there's his underside now

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.459 
and finally there's his underside now
this<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.939> different<00:01:44.450> none<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.960> my<00:01:45.049> other<00:01:45.079> Pepa

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
this is different none of my other Pepa

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.510 
this is different none of my other Pepa
dinosaurs<00:01:46.009> have<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.899> numeric<00:01:47.899> marking

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
dinosaurs have that numeric marking

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.099 
dinosaurs have that numeric marking
underneath<00:01:49.520> them<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:49.899> interesting<00:01:50.899> on<00:01:51.020> this

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
underneath them so interesting on this

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.999 
underneath them so interesting on this
one<00:01:51.289> does<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.560> don't<00:01:51.710> know<00:01:51.770> what<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:51.979> means

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
one does I don't know what it means

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:52.840 
one does I don't know what it means
exactly

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
exactly

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.599

that<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.479> comments<00:01:56.899> so<00:01:57.649> this<00:01:57.770> tale<00:01:58.009> I

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
that in the comments so this tale I

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.770 
that in the comments so this tale I
noticed<00:01:58.460> before<00:01:58.969> I<00:01:59.149> took<00:01:59.450> them<00:01:59.539> out<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.659> the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
noticed before I took them out of the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.630 
noticed before I took them out of the
packaging<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.439> I<00:02:00.469> wanted<00:02:00.859> the<00:02:00.950> spikes<00:02:01.280> there

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
packaging that I wanted the spikes there

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.719 
packaging that I wanted the spikes there
is<00:02:01.820> kind<00:02:02.119> of<00:02:02.289> bent<00:02:03.289> to<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.829> side<00:02:04.039> I<00:02:04.280> don't<00:02:04.399> know

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
is kind of bent to the side I don't know

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.370 
is kind of bent to the side I don't know
if<00:02:04.909> that's<00:02:05.689> just<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.899> way<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.079> supposed<00:02:06.289> to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
if that's just the way it's supposed to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.700 
if that's just the way it's supposed to
be<00:02:06.640> I'm<00:02:07.640> guessing<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.210> not<00:02:08.330> I'm<00:02:08.990> guessing

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
be I'm guessing it's not I'm guessing

be I'm guessing it's not I'm guessing
maybe<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:10.070> just<00:02:10.310> got<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:11.810> know<00:02:11.920> misshapen<00:02:12.920> and

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
other Peppo dinosaurs we've looked at

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.820 
other Peppo dinosaurs we've looked at
this<00:03:05.300> deck<00:03:05.510> asaurus<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.170> supposed<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.710> be

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
this deck asaurus is supposed to be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.430 
this deck asaurus is supposed to be
based<00:03:07.070> on<00:03:07.490> his<00:03:08.330> appearance<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.230> lost

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
based on his appearance in the lost

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.700 
based on his appearance in the lost
world<00:03:09.620> Jurassic<00:03:10.460> Park<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:12.260> know<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.590> think

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
world Jurassic Park and you know I think

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.800 
world Jurassic Park and you know I think
it<00:03:12.890> pretty<00:03:13.070> much<00:03:13.220> captures<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.150> essence<00:03:14.570> of

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
it pretty much captures the essence of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.500 
it pretty much captures the essence of
the<00:03:15.130> dinosaur<00:03:16.130> in<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.310> film<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.790> don't<00:03:17.390> think

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the dinosaur in that film I don't think

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.670 
the dinosaur in that film I don't think
it's<00:03:17.600> hundred<00:03:17.810> percent<00:03:18.080> exact<00:03:18.410> though<00:03:18.650> I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's hundred percent exact though I

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.170 
it's hundred percent exact though I
don't<00:03:18.830> know<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.190> it's<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.550> plates<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:20.000> think

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
don't know if it's the plates I think

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400 
don't know if it's the plates I think
maybe<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.630> plates<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:20.960> this<00:03:21.110> one<00:03:21.260> are<00:03:21.380> a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
maybe the plates on this one are a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.560 
maybe the plates on this one are a
little<00:03:21.560> bit<00:03:21.770> more<00:03:22.070> Brown<00:03:22.880> than<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:23.360> may<00:03:23.480> have

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
little bit more Brown than it may have

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.850 
little bit more Brown than it may have
looked<00:03:23.750> in<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.930> film<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.380> kind<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.710> remember

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
looked in the film I kind of remember

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.540 
looked in the film I kind of remember
them<00:03:25.160> being<00:03:25.430> more<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.880> like<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.600> darker<00:03:26.930> green

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
them being more of a like a darker green

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.380 
them being more of a like a darker green
but<00:03:28.550> you<00:03:28.640> know<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> haven't<00:03:29.090> watched<00:03:29.240> that
