00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.939
 selection of personalized accessories 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.769
 technology can not be called easy because 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.049
 pick a good case for the same 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.480
 a smartphone is sometimes harder than buying one 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.550
 smartphone so as to get a case or glass 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.800
 on want palace baths so already we 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.200
 decided to review them so that 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.390
 somehow simplify your meal choices with you 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.400
 Dmitry Lutsenko and the project of the company com and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.280
 Today I will tell you about my personal 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.890
 accessories for this smartphone have gone 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.109
 I'll start with the most ambiguous 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.359
 cover original lining yellow 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:38.030
 colors to start a few words about packaging 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.550
 or the role played by durable thick 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.739
 an ace - like cardboard box 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.019
 supplied complete charger a little 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.629
 later you will understand why I accentuated 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.730
 on this attention the cover itself turned out to be 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.429
 a little disappointment because in spite of 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.530
 to all the common opinion he is very 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.600
 slippery perhaps even more slippery 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.550
 than white van to los van whether to force 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.530
 constructive whether due to thin 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.019
 plastic or not accurate selection 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.390
 case often squeaks while sitting 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.820
 He tightly my smartphone already managed 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.649
 fly in this lining after falling from 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.020
 one and a half meters on smooth 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.350
 stone floor device flew across the floor yet 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.149
 with a meter a couple of times turning in the air 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.880
 despite the great impact force the case does not 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.369
 flew off and got off with inconspicuous dents 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.680
 on the corners so what's the strength of it why 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.689
 handed in household use brush not 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.939
 collects dirt on himself though for example 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.310
 ball pen helmet I barely 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.649
 wiped with one of the subjective merits 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.719
 The original lining is its acids 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.090
 on the yellow color which in life is much 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.729
 brighter and more beautiful than the pictures 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.829
 if you like things like these flowers 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.109
 you will like this case 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.140
 under heaven this accessory costs about 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.359
 12 dollars our second guest will be 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.369
 nillkin frosted trim comes 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:54.170
 it is in a soft plastic box 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.479
 which often leads to damage 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.850
 case and other accessories when 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.810
 transportation now i think is understandable 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 why i praise 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.610
 packaging from the van class itself is the same overlay 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.619
 is enough poppin cover 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.909
 whose analogues are now very dressed 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.130
 many smartphones 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.860
 so why I bought it you ask 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.959
 the answer is very simple nillkin sells his 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.959
 accessories at a very low price close 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.300
 to cost and as a result of them almost 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.860
 do not fake therefore as this 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.440
 cover I was one hundred percent sure 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.630
 say the same and branded in a case on 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.980
 I could not check in 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
 back to munich 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.600
 in contrast to the soft original 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.880
 cover it overlay was enough 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.250
 tough particular therefore on the device 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.410
 she sits tighter and no squeaks 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.870
 above the screen this case also protrudes 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 stronger on the one hand protecting the glass 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.349
 but on the other lowering comfort from 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.959
 device use 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.239
 thanks to soft-touch coverage and textures to us 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.459
 at the back of the device case tenaciously lies in 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.860
 palms on the horns slip out as a whole 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.049
 The degree of protection of this lining significantly 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.030
 higher than the original although large 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.790
 differences in increasing the size of the device 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.890
 no that so shovel that so also 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.720
 nice moment is that in 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.030
 set with case manufacturer 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.400
 delivers the last film in essence 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.950
 nothing special on her 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.079
 the presence already pleases especially considering 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.900
 what this kit in china is on average 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.239
 so 6 dollars also to protect the facial 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.000
 smartphone panels I ordered myself a glass 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.549
 from the company year smith called eye 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.859
 about titanium besides this glass on the market 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.319
 also present glass from minkin and 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.340
 quality is similar but not worth a little 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.799
 cheaper than mine 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.840
 and fakes on them again no buy 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.639
 same glass from year smith can easily 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.889
 run into a fake so order 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.410
 their official supplier 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.750
 a link to it is in the description itself 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.819
 the manufacturer has in its arsenal and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.370
 steeper glass of risk 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.489
 it is slightly thinner but more expensive and therefore 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.840
 his purchase is subjectively speaking 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.180
 impractical except those already mentioned 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.560
 companies screen protection release and 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.410
 other manufacturers 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.870
 but as their goods 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.830
 I am not sure and therefore recommend them 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.140
 I can not 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.150
 back to my glass it comes 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.650
 in a massive box guaranteeing 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.320
 integrity clav even under conditions 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.390
 forwarding by regular mail inside everything 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.550
 neatly laid out on an envelope 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.950
 it is felt that the manufacturer cares 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.959
 about its reputation glass glued in 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.600
 something simpler than a film and in some ways even 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.120
 and harder to hold it by analogy with 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.430
 films on static eyes it is titanium 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.560
 has a thickness of 0 3 millimeters and 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.020
 despite the fact that it is much thicker 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.720
 any static film on the device 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.950
 the glass almost does not feel its edge 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.110
 slightly rounded 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.570
 what makes using a smartphone more 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.030
 more comfortable than the case more rough 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.160
 glass processing also pleases oleophobic 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.740
 the cover which in practice turned out 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.430
 better than the one that was on the burned wang 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.470
 plos one 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.330
 glass hardness is high comparable 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.430
 burned his eyes for all the time of his 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.950
 use I did not put on it either 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.990
 single large scratches although motes with 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.360
 I lost the habit of him not blowing this 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.500
 accessory in the same china 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.930
 ten to fifteen green well and a couple 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.270
 the words of music very often ask me 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.210
 what kind of headphones flash in my videos 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.250
 I answer it my everyday 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.410
 soundmagic e10 ears 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.690
 in contrast to the same villages Pistons 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.820
 getting caught at her 10 fake pretty 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.250
 it is difficult that when buying on sites like 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.230
 aliexpress is very important in general for 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.390
 daily use data 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.530

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.570
 fully satisfied 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.150
 more details of them are in 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.370
 video review link to it is in 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.919
 the description of this video is in principle 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.930
 we all wait for your fingers up and
