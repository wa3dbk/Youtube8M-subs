00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.219
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.250
 I think here we are in a new series 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.869
 top 10 skins made by fans of the 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.910
 league of legends and I think it's a 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.529
 very interesting series and that I think that you 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.689
 will like it nonetheless for me to 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.400
 know you can hit the like and good in the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.770
 comments go saying what is your 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.070
 favorite aspect I will create a top in 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.900
 which shows from 1 to 10 the skins of 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.539
 fans that to me personally more 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.329
 many like you will share my ideas and 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.920
 my opinions but maybe others do not 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.819
 So you can tell me in the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.920
 comments 

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:44.499
 let's start with the number one we see 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.600
 to leasing sincerely the drawing is not 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.429
 its strong but I think the idea is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.079
 very good with that backpack and the hat I 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.030
 I think a game the truth is that 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.309
 I would be very handsome although I think that 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.379
 could invent a little ryota some 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.839
 thing more about him and without not doing him the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.629
 Fight style but give it another touch 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.360
 more style maybe like the pool party 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.500
 but with another or with another there is good in 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.610
 end let's move on to number 2 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 we see a heel to fix you that passed normal 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.260
 street dress but with the arm 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.090
 chungo I think he is very handsome I give him 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.820
 number two to this heel we pass to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.100
 number three dips and I could be partying 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.710
 pastry or something so to speak and 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.450
 I think the aspect is very interesting 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.460
 truth is that the design is amazing is 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 beautiful the previous heel was 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.880
 within the game those custom skins 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.740
 that someday I might do a tutorial 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 so you know how to install them though 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.910
 you can only see them but good 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.340
 we are seeing so I think that the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.729
 fan arts is such a last floor 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.290
 appear your web or your site in which 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.930
 things go up in the images so 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.729
 you can see them and pass them and the truth is 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.649
 that are beautiful there are many things 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.240
 interesting out there that I think that 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.039
 rivers should take into account 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.780
 all because maybe we like more the 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.100
 fan art that many skins of which 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.160
 they take out but hey he will not entertain me 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.050
 let's go to number four darius lumberjack 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.570
 I like I like very much to notice that 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.239
 there is already a lumberjack skin that sion and I 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.010
 I sincerely love maybe accompany you 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.379
 with a darius skin 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 and all the drawing better to improve the 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.939
 true but honestly the idea 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.250
 like that why I give the 4 and go to 5 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.590
 that this judge that I love 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.450
 sincerely it hits a lot we see a 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.290
 watermelon there 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.430
 with the mallet also very well I think that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.650
 I would be very good and I would stick a lot inside 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.800
 of the game and within this style of 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.810
 champion in sit-in let's go to 6 that in 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.300
 yes it is to go to marina or something like that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.459
 like seaweed and we look and also 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.950
 good what is the design is a pass 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.110
 I like it a lot because I give it 6 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.660
 and because it's another different color that does not 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.580
 has been seen in rows logically either 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.010
 is that you have many skins you have two nothing 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.530
 but are more good things to me 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.380
 like and sincerely rivers please 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.930
 keep in mind skins like these or like 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.000
 for example the number 7 true is a 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.530
 last is a clear example to pokemon 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 who has not played the little one 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.780
 little pokemon who does not keep playing 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.780
 still not my case I would like 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.239
 also play but good for time 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.790
 that I roll up sincerely we see well 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.410
 juani with a snob and I do not remember it very 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.420
 well the name of the pokemon the truth 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.550
 but it seems to me a pass fixed the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.260
 poker is like shield the map 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.610
 with a super goal I think it's a 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.920
 reference because we have very large very 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.450
 very beautiful from my point of view and that 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.940
 hey who knows that with a touch 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.520
 different how the neighborhoods can can 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.580
 become reality we go to the number 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.220
 8 and sincerely every time the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.820
 I see laughs me because that good me 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.490
 I call it the world I 'm not going to flee and 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.010
 look for improvements in the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.740
 on the altar and world running like a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.210
 crazy never better said releasing that bouquet 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.880
 of flowers that will catch pop and is very 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.540
 funny but imagine the scene 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.210
 in the role within the game a world with 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.300
 that wedding dress the hair flying me 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.640
 I think it would be very authentic and I would 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.000
 I would buy honestly so nights 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.459
 for the world let's go to the 9 gallium gallium 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.950
 Chimera reminds me of a mount that 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.450
 there are in the wow in the world of warcraft and 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.730
 I sincerely believe that within the game 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.280
 equal the keeper will surpass him but it would be 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.860
 one of the corners that by 975 I 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.440
 I would sincerely buy for per course not 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.510
 Tim style that a lion's 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.090
 horns wings hand over everything 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.790
 set as a pulse fire but good at 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.980
 end I like it and for you good and for 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.260
 last one deserves it but for 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.210
 full if they go to battle cast 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.070
 you do not have no words you have not 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.160
 seen the image let's see this is a 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.080
 fan has created a fan I do not know has not done 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.300
 still an image of yes they go on in the 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.850
 normal state would only be the dragon but 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.450
 However and although only the dragon 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.600
 although they are going to be a gun 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.760
 nothing else I bought it because it has 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.220
 to be a real pass to see him there 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.440
 jumping with the ultimate becoming 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.710
 in that also they usually give different 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.780
 sounds to the battle cast and it would be very 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.150
 handsome sincerely so good if you 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.680
