00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
gigabytes of ram it did you know it

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.110 
gigabytes of ram it did you know it
didn't<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.430> seem<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.760> change<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.420> startup

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
didn't really seem to change the startup

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.170 
didn't really seem to change the startup
I<00:02:58.120> have<00:02:58.390> my<00:02:58.570> 15<00:02:59.080> s<00:03:00.720> right<00:03:01.720> now<00:03:02.670> hooked<00:03:03.670> up<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.090> an

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I have my 15 s right now hooked up to an

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.140 
I have my 15 s right now hooked up to an
Alpine<00:03:04.570> b12<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.380> car<00:03:05.560> amplifier<00:03:06.130> I<00:03:06.430> think

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
Alpine b12 and a car amplifier I think

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.020 
Alpine b12 and a car amplifier I think
that's<00:03:07.330> pretty<00:03:07.480> cool<00:03:07.890> but<00:03:08.890> to<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.580> back<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
that's pretty cool but to get back to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.690 
that's pretty cool but to get back to
the<00:03:10.150> point<00:03:11.670> I'm<00:03:12.670> going<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.420> shut<00:03:13.900> it<00:03:14.020> down

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the point I'm going to shut it down
