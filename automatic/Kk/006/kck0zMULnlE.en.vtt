00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
so it is nice to look at and then if you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.780 
so it is nice to look at and then if you
get<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.290> know<00:02:56.410> you<00:02:56.470> mix<00:02:56.800> in<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.280> bit<00:02:57.700> of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
get you know you mix in a little bit of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.420 
get you know you mix in a little bit of
gold<00:02:57.970> color<00:02:58.300> where<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:58.690> yellow<00:02:58.900> would<00:02:59.110> be

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
gold color where the yellow would be

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760 
gold color where the yellow would be
that<00:03:00.430> would<00:03:00.610> be<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.180> only<00:03:01.210> difference<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.590> is

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
that would be the only difference it is

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.700 
that would be the only difference it is
an<00:03:02.890> air<00:03:03.040> cushion<00:03:03.280> finish<00:03:03.820> so<00:03:04.210> it's<00:03:05.200> just<00:03:05.560> like

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.590 
any other bicycle deck with an air
cushion<00:03:08.140> finish<00:03:08.650> only<00:03:09.120> maybe<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.240> little<00:03:10.420> more

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
cushion finish only maybe a little more

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.860 
cushion finish only maybe a little more
pleasing<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.320> eye<00:03:11.350> for<00:03:12.660> handling<00:03:13.660> white
