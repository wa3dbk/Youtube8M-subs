fishermen flight occupant 5b Boeing 767
it's<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> few<00:00:11.849> things<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.240> need<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.480> be

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
it's just a few things that need to be

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.940 
it's just a few things that need to be
done<00:00:12.780> before<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.139> take<00:00:13.380> off<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:13.830> you're

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
done before we take off so if you're

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
done before we take off so if you're
jumping<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> cockpit<00:00:14.759> I'll<00:00:14.969> show<00:00:15.120> you

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
jumping in the cockpit I'll show you

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.010 
jumping in the cockpit I'll show you
what<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.450> need<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.719> do<00:00:17.480> first<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> all<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what we need to do first of all we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.160 
what we need to do first of all we
should<00:00:19.080> set<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.410> auto<00:00:19.650> breaks<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> RTO

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
should set the auto breaks to RTO

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.140 
should set the auto breaks to RTO
that<00:00:22.170> stands<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.680> rejected<00:00:23.490> takeoff<00:00:23.880> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that stands for rejected takeoff and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.429 
that stands for rejected takeoff and
means<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> auto<00:00:24.900> breaks<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.320> be

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
means that the auto breaks will be

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.870 
means that the auto breaks will be
applied<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:26.039> cut<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> throttle<00:00:26.519> during

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
applied if we cut the throttle during

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.630 
applied if we cut the throttle during
dinner

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.280 

so<00:00:32.210> as<00:00:32.330> you<00:00:32.480> can<00:00:32.570> see<00:00:32.630> I've<00:00:32.900> done<00:00:32.930> two<00:00:33.260> things

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
so as you can see I've done two things

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.620 
so as you can see I've done two things
here<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:33.980> mCP<00:00:34.460> first<00:00:35.120> thing<00:00:35.300> I've<00:00:35.420> done<00:00:35.450> is

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
here on the mCP first thing I've done is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.430 
here on the mCP first thing I've done is
set<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.020> speed<00:00:36.260> selected<00:00:36.830> 126<00:00:37.790> knots<00:00:38.440> 126

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
set the speed selected 126 knots 126

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.020 
set the speed selected 126 knots 126
knots<00:00:39.710> is<00:00:39.980> our<00:00:40.100> VR<00:00:40.340> speed<00:00:40.850> or<00:00:41.140> rotate<00:00:42.140> speed

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
knots is our VR speed or rotate speed

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.910 
knots is our VR speed or rotate speed
forming<00:00:44.360> an<00:00:44.450> auto<00:00:44.630> take<00:00:44.900> off<00:00:45.080> in<00:00:45.260> this<00:00:45.380> flight

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
forming an auto take off in this flight

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.470 
forming an auto take off in this flight
I've<00:00:46.280> said<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:46.580> do<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.120> PR<00:00:47.420> speed

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
I've said it do that PR speed

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.640 
I've said it do that PR speed
it<00:00:49.930> set<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.440> altitude<00:00:51.399> selector<00:00:52.210> and<00:00:52.840> 1,000

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
it set the altitude selector and 1,000

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.860 
it set the altitude selector and 1,000
feet<00:00:53.800> above<00:00:54.040> our<00:00:54.250> cruising<00:00:54.670> altitude<00:00:54.760> this<00:00:55.750> is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
feet above our cruising altitude this is

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.860 
feet above our cruising altitude this is
for<00:00:56.050> being<00:00:56.200> a<00:00:56.320> functional

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 

also<00:01:01.590> for<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> other<00:01:02.250> take<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.850> don't

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
also for the other take off you don't

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.140 
also for the other take off you don't
want<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.300> press<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.630> button<00:01:03.870> here

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
want to press this button here

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.380 
want to press this button here
as<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.450> can<00:01:05.570> see<00:01:05.780> that<00:01:06.530> changes<00:01:06.980> our

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
as you can see that changes our

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.200 
as you can see that changes our
engine<00:01:09.140> setting<00:01:09.500> to<00:01:09.890> takeoff<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:10.910> when<00:01:11.060> we

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
engine setting to takeoff so when we

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.240 
engine setting to takeoff so when we
turn<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.840> auto<00:01:12.230> throttle<00:01:12.410> and<00:01:12.860> engine

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
turn on the auto throttle and engine

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.750 
turn on the auto throttle and engine
pressure<00:01:13.400> ratio

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.719 

it'll<00:01:15.910> send<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.210> to<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.420> correct

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.580 

and<00:01:22.180> with<00:01:22.360> all<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.689> done<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.140> last<00:01:23.289> thing<00:01:23.469> we

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
and with all that done the last thing we

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.160 
and with all that done the last thing we
need<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.770> do<00:01:23.979> is<00:01:24.189> set<00:01:24.430> flaps

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.170 

so<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.040> we're<00:01:31.280> ready<00:01:31.430> for<00:01:31.520> takeoff<00:01:31.909> let's

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
so that if we're ready for takeoff let's

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:49.010 
so that if we're ready for takeoff let's
just<00:01:32.390> taxi<00:01:32.720> under<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.020> runway

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.050 

so<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> perform<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.100> other<00:01:50.250> takeoff<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> only

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so to perform the other takeoff the only

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460 
so to perform the other takeoff the only
thing<00:01:51.240> I've<00:01:51.390> done<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.840> engaged<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
thing I've done is engaged the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
thing I've done is engaged the
autothrottle<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.310> set<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> hole<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.270> EPR

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
autothrottle and set the hole to EPR

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:07.450 
autothrottle and set the hole to EPR
which<00:01:55.049> stands<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.439> engine<00:01:55.920> pressure<00:01:56.070> ratio

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:17.240 

the<00:02:07.700> next<00:02:07.940> step

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 

you
