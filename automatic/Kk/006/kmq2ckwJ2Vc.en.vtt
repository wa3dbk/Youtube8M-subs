I'm<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> guessing<00:02:25.170> at<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:25.739> are

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
I'm kind of guessing at what these are

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.250 
I'm kind of guessing at what these are
this<00:02:26.129> one<00:02:26.370> has<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> picture<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.780> little<00:02:27.989> cow

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this one has a picture of a little cow

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.479 
this one has a picture of a little cow
wearing<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.739> hat<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
wearing a hat on it

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.869 
wearing a hat on it
so<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:31.590> could<00:02:31.859> be<00:02:31.890> milk<00:02:32.189> chocolate<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.700> could

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
so it could be milk chocolate it could

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.509 
so it could be milk chocolate it could
be<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.299> piece<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.319> beef<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:34.739> not<00:02:34.950> really<00:02:35.099> sure

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
little polar bear thing so I've actually

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.080 
little polar bear thing so I've actually
had<00:05:42.560> no<00:05:42.740> idea<00:05:43.010> what<00:05:43.130> any<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.460> these<00:05:43.610> things<00:05:43.880> are

so<00:05:44.330> far<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:44.840> I've<00:05:44.960> been<00:05:45.140> surprised<00:05:45.530> each<00:05:45.770> time

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
so far and I've been surprised each time

so far and I've been surprised each time
so<00:05:46.430> I'm<00:05:46.850> looking<00:05:47.479> forward<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.780> this<00:05:47.900> last<00:05:48.110> one

its two wafers one on top of the other

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.880 
its two wafers one on top of the other
and<00:06:03.260> on<00:06:03.380> the<00:06:03.410> inside<00:06:05.350> there's<00:06:06.350> a<00:06:06.470> sort<00:06:06.710> of<00:06:06.770> a

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
and on the inside there's a sort of a

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.690 
and on the inside there's a sort of a
soft<00:06:07.370> new<00:06:07.700> guard<00:06:07.970> type<00:06:08.270> stuff<00:06:08.600> in<00:06:08.720> it<00:06:09.550> I'm<00:06:10.550> not

quite<00:06:10.970> sure<00:06:12.430> what<00:06:13.430> that<00:06:13.460> is<00:06:13.790> to<00:06:13.970> be<00:06:14.060> honest

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
quite sure what that is to be honest

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.810 
quite sure what that is to be honest
it's<00:06:14.450> got<00:06:14.600> a<00:06:14.630> sort<00:06:14.900> of<00:06:14.930> a<00:06:15.370> darker<00:06:16.370> sort<00:06:16.580> of<00:06:16.640> milk

it's got a sort of a darker sort of milk
chocolate<00:06:17.300> on<00:06:17.390> the<00:06:17.510> outside<00:06:18.580> hmm<00:06:21.400> I'm<00:06:22.400> not

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
chocolate on the outside hmm I'm not

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.060 
chocolate on the outside hmm I'm not
sure<00:06:22.640> what<00:06:22.940> that<00:06:22.970> is<00:06:24.010> what<00:06:25.010> nice<00:06:25.250> though

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
sure what that is what nice though

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:36.270 
sure what that is what nice though
okay<00:06:28.070> then<00:06:29.410> scores<00:06:30.410> time<00:06:32.260> hmm<00:06:33.260> I<00:06:34.180> think

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
okay then scores time hmm I think

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.800 
okay then scores time hmm I think
that<00:06:37.280> one<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.909> dark<00:06:38.150> chocolate<00:06:38.240> that<00:06:38.690> we

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
that one the dark chocolate that we

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.640 
that one the dark chocolate that we
tried<00:06:39.020> first<00:06:39.729> is<00:06:40.930> absolutely<00:06:41.930> sensational<00:06:42.319> a

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
tried first is absolutely sensational a

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.680 
tried first is absolutely sensational a
beautiful<00:06:43.280> rich<00:06:43.610> dark<00:06:43.940> chocolate<00:06:44.060> without

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
beautiful rich dark chocolate without

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.089 
beautiful rich dark chocolate without
too<00:06:44.930> much<00:06:45.080> sugar<00:06:45.319> in<00:06:45.470> it<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:45.710> it's<00:06:45.949> got<00:06:46.069> that

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
too much sugar in it so it's got that

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.950 
too much sugar in it so it's got that
light<00:06:46.520> sweetness<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.300> it<00:06:47.330> so<00:06:47.780> it<00:06:47.930> really

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
light sweetness to it so it really

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.649 
light sweetness to it so it really
brings<00:06:48.500> out<00:06:48.620> the<00:06:48.680> flavor<00:06:48.770> of<00:06:49.099> the<00:06:49.250> cocoa<00:06:49.610> and<00:06:49.819> I

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
brings out the flavor of the cocoa and I

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.969 
brings out the flavor of the cocoa and I
would<00:06:50.960> definitely<00:06:51.319> get<00:06:51.409> that<00:06:51.470> 109<00:06:51.949> and<00:06:53.979> the

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
would definitely get that 109 and the

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.320 
would definitely get that 109 and the
fudge<00:06:55.280> thing<00:06:55.669> is<00:06:56.509> probably<00:06:56.780> a<00:06:57.729> close<00:06:58.729> second<00:06:59.270> I

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
fudge thing is probably a close second I

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.430 
fudge thing is probably a close second I
would<00:06:59.389> give<00:06:59.629> that<00:06:59.659> one<00:06:59.900> an<00:07:00.020> eight

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
would give that one an eight

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.680 
would give that one an eight
it's<00:07:00.710> an<00:07:00.860> unusual<00:07:01.610> texture<00:07:02.030> to<00:07:02.270> it<00:07:02.300> but<00:07:02.569> it's

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 
it's an unusual texture to it but it's

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.360 
it's an unusual texture to it but it's
really<00:07:03.080> um<00:07:03.199> it's<00:07:03.349> very<00:07:03.440> milky<00:07:04.069> and<00:07:04.099> very

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.370 
really um it's very milky and very

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.029 
really um it's very milky and very
excited<00:07:04.759> caramely<00:07:05.210> um<00:07:07.180> let's<00:07:08.180> see<00:07:09.009> with<00:07:10.009> a

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
excited caramely um let's see with a

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:12.760 
excited caramely um let's see with a
seven<00:07:10.490> I<00:07:10.580> would<00:07:10.789> probably<00:07:11.030> give<00:07:11.539> the<00:07:11.810> polar

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
seven I would probably give the polar

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.159 
seven I would probably give the polar
bear<00:07:13.099> thing<00:07:13.729> that<00:07:14.180> I'm<00:07:14.330> not<00:07:14.599> quite<00:07:14.750> sure<00:07:14.810> what

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
bear thing that I'm not quite sure what

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:16.600 
bear thing that I'm not quite sure what
it<00:07:15.259> was<00:07:15.440> I<00:07:15.620> think<00:07:15.800> it's<00:07:15.919> new<00:07:16.099> girl<00:07:16.340> on<00:07:16.370> the

it was I think it's new girl on the
inside<00:07:17.500> um<00:07:18.500> seven<00:07:19.129> again<00:07:19.370> for<00:07:19.870> the

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:21.849 
inside um seven again for the

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.839 
inside um seven again for the
yogurt-covered<00:07:22.849> date<00:07:23.659> nut<00:07:24.050> thing<00:07:24.669> that<00:07:25.669> was

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:25.849 
yogurt-covered date nut thing that was

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:28.390 
yogurt-covered date nut thing that was
an<00:07:26.389> unusual<00:07:26.599> one<00:07:27.110> I<00:07:27.169> wasn't<00:07:27.500> expecting<00:07:28.159> a

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
an unusual one I wasn't expecting a

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.040 
an unusual one I wasn't expecting a
dried<00:07:28.789> fruit<00:07:28.819> thing<00:07:29.300> on<00:07:29.389> the<00:07:29.479> inside<00:07:29.810> so<00:07:30.020> that

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
dried fruit thing on the inside so that

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.309 
dried fruit thing on the inside so that
was<00:07:30.460> surprising<00:07:31.460> that<00:07:31.610> I<00:07:31.669> like<00:07:31.940> that<00:07:32.180> and<00:07:32.419> the

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:33.319 
was surprising that I like that and the

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.529 
was surprising that I like that and the
sunflower<00:07:33.740> thing<00:07:34.099> I'll<00:07:34.460> give<00:07:34.669> that<00:07:34.699> a<00:07:34.849> 5<00:07:35.150> I'm

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:38.569 
I'm not really sure I just it has a

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:39.969 
I'm not really sure I just it has a
funny<00:07:38.840> taste<00:07:39.080> to<00:07:39.319> it<00:07:39.349> but<00:07:39.590> I<00:07:39.620> don't<00:07:39.770> really

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:39.979 
funny taste to it but I don't really

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:42.879 
funny taste to it but I don't really
like<00:07:40.190> it<00:07:40.490> that<00:07:40.639> much<00:07:40.669> but<00:07:41.060> um<00:07:41.740> it's<00:07:42.740> definitely

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:42.889 
like it that much but um it's definitely

00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:45.040 
like it that much but um it's definitely
something<00:07:43.400> I've<00:07:43.490> never<00:07:43.610> tried<00:07:43.849> before<00:07:44.050> so

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
something I've never tried before so
