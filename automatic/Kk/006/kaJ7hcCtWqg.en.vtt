thoughts<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.389> but<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.789> then<00:01:14.789> lasted

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
thoughts about it but I then lasted

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.059 
thoughts about it but I then lasted
about<00:01:15.299> 10<00:01:15.600> seconds<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.200> thought<00:01:16.439> about<00:01:16.619> Steven

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
about 10 seconds I thought about Steven

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.609 
about 10 seconds I thought about Steven
Randy's<00:01:17.429> track<00:01:17.700> record<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.779> I<00:01:19.200> knew<00:01:19.409> their

Randy's track record and I knew their

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
Randy's track record and I knew their
time<00:01:19.829> was<00:01:20.159> probably<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.969> spot<00:01:21.359> on<00:01:21.389> which

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
time was probably just spot on which

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.399 
time was probably just spot on which
turned<00:01:22.740> out<00:01:22.889> to<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.719> we<00:01:24.719> took<00:01:24.899> us<00:01:25.049> all<00:01:25.229> look

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
turned out to be we took us all look

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.280 
turned out to be we took us all look
Hughes<00:01:25.679> from

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:37.080

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.529

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
so we kind of continue down that track

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.440 
so we kind of continue down that track
and<00:01:40.840> decided<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.469> upgrade<00:01:42.189> pretty<00:01:42.789> much<00:01:43.000> every
