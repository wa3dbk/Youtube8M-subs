what we call wheel silver it's a it's a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
what we call wheel silver it's a it's a
hammered<00:02:25.650> finish<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.180> even<00:02:28.180> if<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.420> take

hammered finish and even if you take

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.690 
hammered finish and even if you take
this<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.170> straight<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.530> on<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> wheels<00:02:30.310> here

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this and straight up on the wheels here

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.059 
this and straight up on the wheels here
oh<00:02:30.930> geez<00:02:33.900> assuming<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.110> take<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.709> up<00:02:35.799> first

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
oh geez assuming that I take it up first

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.770 
oh geez assuming that I take it up first
you<00:02:36.430> know<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:36.910> can<00:02:37.180> start<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.599> look<00:02:37.720> really

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
you know it can start to look really

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.699 
you know it can start to look really
nice<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:39.099> always<00:02:39.700> paint<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.150> back<00:02:40.360> side<00:02:40.720> of<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
nice I always paint the back side of the

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.039 
nice I always paint the back side of the
wheel<00:02:41.920> first<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.209> then<00:02:43.420> paint<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> front

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
wheel first and then paint the front

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.410 
wheel first and then paint the front
side<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:44.950> how<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.519> get<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.790> bead<00:02:46.030> how<00:02:46.360> do

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
side so how do you get the bead how do

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.400 
side so how do you get the bead how do
you<00:02:46.569> keep<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.200> how<00:02:47.739> do<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:47.950> keep<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.400> the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
paint from getting on the tire well if

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.240 
paint from getting on the tire well if
you're<00:02:52.540> going<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.720> change<00:02:53.019> tires<00:02:53.410> that's<00:02:53.920> easy

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you're going to change tires that's easy

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.339 
you're going to change tires that's easy
just<00:02:54.610> paint<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> whole<00:02:55.150> thing<00:02:55.209> up<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.750> don't

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
just paint the whole thing up and don't

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.080 
just paint the whole thing up and don't
worry<00:02:56.590> about<00:02:56.739> it<00:02:57.069> because<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.610> wheels<00:02:57.819> that

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
worry about it because the wheels that

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.289 
worry about it because the wheels that
turn<00:02:58.420> is<00:02:58.540> going<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.810> come<00:02:58.989> off<00:02:59.849> another<00:03:00.849> way<00:03:01.090> is

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
turn is going to come off another way is

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.660 
turn is going to come off another way is
to<00:03:01.329> take<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> piece<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.049> cardboard<00:03:02.549> swing<00:03:03.549> a

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
to take a piece of cardboard swing a

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.869 
to take a piece of cardboard swing a
radius<00:03:04.090> on<00:03:04.329> it<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:04.750> then<00:03:05.620> fit<00:03:06.069> that<00:03:06.280> up<00:03:06.489> pretty

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
radius on it and then fit that up pretty

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.479 
radius on it and then fit that up pretty
snugly<00:03:07.420> against<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.049> that<00:03:08.319> sounds<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.340> lot

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
snugly against this that sounds a lot

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.599 
snugly against this that sounds a lot
easier<00:03:10.060> than<00:03:10.299> than<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.400> then

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
easier than than it is and then and then

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.569 
easier than than it is and then and then
paint<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.060> or<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:14.290> can<00:03:14.500> just<00:03:14.530> be<00:03:14.889> judicious

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
paint it or you can just be judicious

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.599 
paint it or you can just be judicious
very<00:03:16.359> very<00:03:16.630> careful<00:03:17.109> in<00:03:17.260> your<00:03:17.380> spray<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.130> then

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
very very careful in your spray and then

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.640 
very very careful in your spray and then
take<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> rag<00:03:19.450> with<00:03:19.780> some<00:03:19.959> carburetor<00:03:20.410> cleaner

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
take a rag with some carburetor cleaner

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.069 
take a rag with some carburetor cleaner
on<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:21.340> wipe<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.120> overspray<00:03:22.660> off<00:03:22.690> the

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
on it and wipe the overspray off the

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.259 
on it and wipe the overspray off the
tire<00:03:23.319> at<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.799> end<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.639> really<00:03:24.850> is<00:03:25.090> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
tire at the end that really is the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.849 
tire at the end that really is the
easiest<00:03:25.299> way<00:03:25.930> we're<00:03:26.410> going<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.560> go<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.769> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
here's a TC wheel that we had

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.500 
here's a TC wheel that we had
sandblasted<00:03:45.290> we've<00:03:46.160> got<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.400> jig<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.330> can

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
sandblasted we've got a jig so we can

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.140 
sandblasted we've got a jig so we can
set<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.930> thing<00:03:48.170> up<00:03:48.320> oh<00:03:48.620> boy<00:03:49.070> this<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.400> handy<00:03:49.970> if

problem<00:05:13.160> with<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:14.020> charge<00:05:15.020> get<00:05:15.890> a<00:05:15.920> little

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
problem with the charge get a little

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.810 
problem with the charge get a little
Coulomb's<00:05:16.610> box<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:18.680> get<00:05:18.830> a<00:05:18.860> problem

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
Coulomb's box and you get a problem

to<00:05:24.350> apply<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:26.420> can<00:05:26.600> talk<00:05:26.810> your

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
to apply to it so you can talk your

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.350 
to apply to it so you can talk your
powder<00:05:27.230> coater<00:05:27.530> though<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:27.950> see<00:05:28.360> anyway
