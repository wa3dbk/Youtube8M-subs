night/morning seven days a week

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.240 
night/morning seven days a week
but<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.700> try<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.000> take<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.620> as<00:02:30.620> much<00:02:30.890> time<00:02:31.070> as

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
but we try and take off as much time as

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.090 
but we try and take off as much time as
we<00:02:31.280> can<00:02:31.489> enjoy<00:02:31.880> life<00:02:32.530> not<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.680> much<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:33.980> we'd

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
we can enjoy life not as much as we'd

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:45.380 
we can enjoy life not as much as we'd
like<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.310> that's<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.239> way<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.450> is

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.570 

I<00:02:47.390> think<00:02:48.390> these<00:02:48.569> little<00:02:48.840> places<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:50.280> have<00:02:50.550> a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
I think these little places that have a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.610 
I think these little places that have a
uniqueness<00:02:51.000> about<00:02:51.450> them<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.870> still<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.590> a

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
uniqueness about them and still have a

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.980 
uniqueness about them and still have a
direct<00:02:53.430> contact<00:02:54.120> with<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.450> land<00:02:54.660> and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
direct contact with the land and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.830 
direct contact with the land and
