00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
far cry she realized how slow humans are

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.979 
far cry she realized how slow humans are
like<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.640> when<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> initially<00:00:48.570> tried<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
like and when I initially tried to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
like and when I initially tried to
outrun<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.829> elephant<00:00:50.670> at<00:00:50.940> one<00:00:51.059> point<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.510> I

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
outrun a elephant at one point I think I

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
outrun a elephant at one point I think I
pissed<00:00:51.809> off<00:00:51.989> no<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.920> an

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
pissed off no I don't think it was an

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
pissed off no I don't think it was an
elephant<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.670> lot<00:00:53.879> they're<00:00:54.180> kind<00:00:54.360> of

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
elephant like this lot they're kind of

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.080 
elephant like this lot they're kind of
on<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.629> side<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.920> was<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.070> rhino<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.910> was

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
on your side it was a rhino and I was

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
on your side it was a rhino and I was
thinking<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.750> could<00:00:57.989> outrun<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.530> rhino<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
thinking I could outrun a rhino as a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.060 
thinking I could outrun a rhino as a
person<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> realized

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
person in this game and then I realized

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.250 
person in this game and then I realized
that<00:01:02.280> humans<00:01:02.969> aren't<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.570> faster<00:01:04.019> than

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that humans aren't actually faster than

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.010 
that humans aren't actually faster than
really<00:01:04.710> anything<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> elephants

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
really anything like there is elephants

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.109 
really anything like there is elephants
for<00:01:07.200> faster<00:01:07.560> than<00:01:07.710> people<00:01:08.040> elephants<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.000> run

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for faster than people elephants can run

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.080 
for faster than people elephants can run
35<00:01:09.659> miles<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.080> hour<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> rhinos<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.610> run<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
35 miles an hour and rhinos can run I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
35 miles an hour and rhinos can run I
think<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> rhinos<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.049> slower

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
think that rhinos are actually slower

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.719 
think that rhinos are actually slower
than<00:01:13.350> elephants<00:01:13.979> which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.280> crazy

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
than elephants which is crazy

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.230 
than elephants which is crazy
and<00:01:15.799> yeah<00:01:16.799> rhinos<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.400> run<00:01:17.520> 30<00:01:17.729> miles<00:01:17.970> an<00:01:18.150> hour

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and yeah rhinos can run 30 miles an hour

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.749 
and yeah rhinos can run 30 miles an hour
so<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.530> gonna<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:19.920> smack<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so I was gonna go up smack that I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.550 
so I was gonna go up smack that I
thought<00:01:21.299> humans<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.350> able<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
thought humans would actually be able to

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.730 
thought humans would actually be able to
outrun<00:01:23.180> most<00:01:24.180> thing<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.960> most<00:01:25.229> things<00:01:25.590> but

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
outrun most thing not most things but

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.330 
outrun most thing not most things but
certainly<00:01:26.400> things<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.729> big<00:01:27.799> right<00:01:28.799> let's<00:01:29.100> go

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
certainly things that big right let's go

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.460 
certainly things that big right let's go
look<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.759> guy

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
look at this guy

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.870 
look at this guy
Jesus<00:01:31.470> mask<00:01:32.070> oh<00:01:32.840> well<00:01:34.310> that's<00:01:35.310> fairly<00:01:35.520> useless

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Jesus mask oh well that's fairly useless

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
Jesus mask oh well that's fairly useless
man<00:01:36.390> look<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.750> him<00:01:37.250> he's<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.460> arrows<00:01:38.850> all

man look at him he's like arrows all

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
man look at him he's like arrows all
stuck<00:01:39.299> into<00:01:39.479> him<00:01:39.630> right<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> had<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> use<00:01:41.130> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
stuck into him right I had to use a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.580 
stuck into him right I had to use a
shotgun<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.150> why<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> feel<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.810> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
shotgun there that's why I feel that so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.719 
shotgun there that's why I feel that so
that<00:01:44.040> means<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.670> even

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
that means that I have to get even

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.280 
that means that I have to get even
closer<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.479> him<00:01:45.600> which<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.259> great<00:01:48.290> good

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
closer to him which is not great good

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.819 
closer to him which is not great good

I was there I was in the party with one

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.929 
I was there I was in the party with one
of<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.770> friends<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.759> think

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
of my friends and I was like you think

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.800 
of my friends and I was like you think
the<00:01:57.659> human<00:01:58.500> could<00:01:58.619> outrun<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:59.159> rhino<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.880> he

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the human could outrun a rhino and he

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.319 
the human could outrun a rhino and he
said<00:02:01.020> no<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.469> he<00:02:01.890> thought<00:02:02.850> rhinos<00:02:03.210> were

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
said no because he thought rhinos were

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
said no because he thought rhinos were
faster<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.899> thought<00:02:04.020> he<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.530> lady's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
faster and I thought he was a lady's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.709 
faster and I thought he was a lady's
being<00:02:05.219> stupid<00:02:05.490> think<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.060> start<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
being stupid think and not start but

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.279 
being stupid think and not start but
