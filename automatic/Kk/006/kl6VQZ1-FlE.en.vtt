00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.420
 fresh water management modeling agency 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.360
 organized a benefit evening for money 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.770
 to be collected for projects in africa 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.109
 the models were photographed before 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.970
 a calendar and eight shows entered 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.060
 see return for a small donation 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.460
 where actually we already had this idea 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.560
 for a very long time since we started 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 started fresh 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 I shared that we avoid raising awareness 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.420
 of the prosperity that is here in a country 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 to have 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.789
 and as a child I wanted to be like that after all 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.249
 volunteering in africa and 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:41.129
 that's why we now really avoid matts 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.050
 who represent to africa to the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 but also locals 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 because of the girls that we 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380
 represent 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.620
 I 'm kind of helping 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.930
 box in my two jars on the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.820
 big moves 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170
 yes it is very cozy and it is 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.850
 also the advantage that we are always fresh day 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.530
 have the van you meet there already 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.720
 one you can feel together here 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.250
 traveling of course is on your own 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 it is also very nice to see all those girls 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.880
 and I don't have everyone yet but me 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 know quite a lot more useful so too 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.010
 himself back it's quite a bit 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.180
 complicated but it is very nice and 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.740
 I also really liked the music 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.220
 especially those of nails and nails throughout 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.380
 cheerful and bit exciting 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.700
 life even though it exciting in the show as 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.560
 Immediately I am afraid that we will 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.850
 maybe what forgive we go there 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.970
 that goes well 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.370
 go with the amount that we have at one 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.630
 gathering we are going to buy wood 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.970
 for the playground 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.040
 the play equipment we mean 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.229
 swing come and white matte 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.530
 we have already sponsored a climbing wall 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.170
 but if we have enough enough 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.600
 We want to raise money 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.979
 also build a whole new room at the 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.460
 school and before that of course 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:02:01.830
 cement stones 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:03.090
 a different necessities different 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.040
 fashion designers code for the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.270
 benefit evening part of your collection 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.650
 to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.539
 also got fresh but the management 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.830
 help from dozens of hair stylists and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.239
 make-up artists 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
 when the girls marinate too well and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.420
 the nicer things we do today are the 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.010
 looks that were also shown in both shows 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.400
 so it's really a look that matches the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.840
 collection and we make wifi pedal in we 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.810
 they adjust a bit here and there 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.510
 so that is also suitable for this cap on 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.489
 asked me for the last piece of it 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.650
 shows and two different designers 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:37.530
 and I show a selection of the latter 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.690
 collection that shocked me with him 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
 I also fashion with a lot 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.650
 fashion models so that was quite 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.959
 almost nothing has to go through easily 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.959
 apply those going long turbos 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.660
 yes super nice very cozy with 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.940
 all girls and find it whole there too 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.070
 very nice to do for the kids 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.020
 Africa needs to help him 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.950

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.470

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.180
 even more 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.950
 I think it's very good that you do them 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.180
 engage in other things too 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.100

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.750

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.610
 the netherlands is happening but that is also something 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.670
 yes try to do something good 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.260
 for your children in africa than I am going 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.660
 do not join the program yourself and tick 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.400
 very unfortunate but yes i am glad i did 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.830
 anyway summer stone can be added 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.060
 contribute through the calendar and because 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.470
 I'm doing that with the show 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.100

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.100
 can do something for him 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:23.590
 the energy of that this liesting 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 I hope to go somewhere between five and ten 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.370
 one thousand euros 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.070
 but of course we only know that afterwards 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.750
 tonight and how many more calendars 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.910
 to buy 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.640
 and how many donations are made 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.320
 but purely with ticket sales 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.150
 I believe we are somewhere in between 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.150
 five and six thousand euros 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.550
 the benefit evening already has a lot of money 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.290
 delivered for Uganda but narrowing 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.340
 management will continue for a while 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.050
 with collection 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.050
