00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
thing is just tearing things up it's a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
thing is just tearing things up it's a
like<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> say<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> funnel<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.930> real<00:00:43.140> small

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
like I say the funnel is real small

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.380 
like I say the funnel is real small
I'd<00:00:44.010> say<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.370> funnel<00:00:44.700> might<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.239> any

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I'd say the funnel might not be any

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.229 
I'd say the funnel might not be any
wider<00:00:45.660> than<00:00:45.809> 100<00:00:46.200> yards<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.940> throwing

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
wider than 100 yards but it's throwing

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.850 
wider than 100 yards but it's throwing
lots<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> debris<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.260> intense<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
lots of debris it's very intense at the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.200 
lots of debris it's very intense at the
surface<00:00:50.329> very<00:00:51.329> intense<00:00:52.489> our<00:00:53.489> influence<00:00:54.000> stop

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
surface very intense our influence stop

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.350 
surface very intense our influence stop
is<00:00:54.449> basically<00:00:54.780> nothing<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:56.329> we're<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
