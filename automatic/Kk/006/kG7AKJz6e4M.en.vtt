 I know the draw mode 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.100
 but this car here is not this version 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.320
 white but I'll leave it in color 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.659
 original one that is a metallic blue with 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.880
 ice white band on top then this 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.149
 car has simply been recreated to it's 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.399
 since gta 3 right is one of the cars of 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.009
 faster fugue of gt3 then it comes 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.250
 he has been applauded by the guys there 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.829
 who has played gt for a long time so he is 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.439
 a car that has since gt3 and there the galera 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.659
 decided to create freedom face created 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.359
 it actually a physical version of this 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.140
 banshee put a super sport engine and 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:38.509
 they made a pretty cool version of it 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.969
 and then with that you go they will get round 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.619
 this one got thrown and if car 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.229
 I do not know what the way they are going 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.299
 make to sort out any system of 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.039
 lottery you need to make or not just 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.079
 I know I was just reading there. 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.909
 I found it and I said I'll reproduce a 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.679
 version of banshee I'll put it to 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.229
 turning to see I'll give some 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.149
 technical specifications, you can see that 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 He's got a little tractor tire in there. 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.710
 I will debase money this boy will 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:08.780
 to leave that way, that's the way it is 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:11.270
 blue original blush is is then kind 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.950
 so this one will keep that color there in 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.810
 Above will become an ice white in color 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.630
 secondary that would be this red band 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.970
 there I will create as close as possible to the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.100
 what they did there with the car 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.070
 I'm going to leave the registration link and that's it. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.050

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.860
 so you can see a little better 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.120
 interior of the car like they did 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.430
 with which they did not 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.490
 what were the requirements that they 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.410
 So that's how I'll end this. 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.730
 part of the garage we go to the street to see 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.070
