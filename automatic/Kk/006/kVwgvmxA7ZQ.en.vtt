 mcclain and is watching commodities with 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.469
 our guest today is ronald with the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 Director of Research and Forecasts 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.760
 for metals from thomson reuters 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.619
 reyna welcome to check scope and not the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 let's start talking about the dollar 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.880
 american as the economy 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 American gains momentum the gold se 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.610
 leads its first quarterly loss in 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.500
 2014 and what factors caused this fall 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.539
 by one of the main factors is 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
 the fact that you mentioned the improvement 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.499
 of the US economy that runs the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 Income investment attitudes 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.929
 variable it may be that of some 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.579
 way is already exaggerated but the s &amp; p is 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.420
 in bull market for a while 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.420
 considerable 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.339
 this also indicated that there was less 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.249
 need for protection against risk 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.839
 among so-called professional investors 

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:00.089
 western and at the same time the dollar 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.979
 it has been relatively strong without a doubt 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.449
 against the euro mainly by 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.449
 internal reasons in europe 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.920
 on the other side of the argument is the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.869
 balance between 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.790
 supply and demand when we consider 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.500
 gold as a commodity instead of 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 simply a means to mitigate the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 risk based on this the physical demand 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 of the market has been relatively slow 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 this year good I want monge in web 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 find chrysler can understand this 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.460
 we must go back to 2013 when there was 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.229
 a huge fall in prices in the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.149
 second quarter that generated a huge 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.369
 shopping frenzy especially in the 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.509
 far east these purchases were 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.939
 received by a divestment 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.740
 substantial from the West that is to say there was 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.659
 an overbought I also have a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.670
 surplus that needed to be released 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.450
 this year and that's basically what 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.450
 is happening 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.399
 there was not much net withdrawal in the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.049
 international physical market as 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.539
 As a result of that the price has 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.759
 stalled this year by one of the things 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.979
 he used to say many years ago and now 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.850
 I can say one more time the price is 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.700
 bored and the market interested in the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.560
 young price between the estimated that these 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 recent months have been interesting for 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.930
 gold with geopolitical risk in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.420
 certain areas and at the same 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.700
 the dollar valued as the traders 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.769
 they reacted to this situation very 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.629
 rich there are not two essential points to 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.299
 west some people have suggested that 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.250
 gold has ignored the geopolitical risk 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.319
 7 impressed has increased virtual without 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 However there is an argument against 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.280
 I agree and I know that without the risk 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.019
 geopolitical that we have faced this 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.760
 year the price of gold would be much more 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.170
 under what is now again the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.180
 fact that the price has not increased 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.340
 does not mean that there has not been any 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.109
 medium effect this means that this 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.359
 effect is balancing some of the 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.859
 negative forces in the market 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.769
 including the lack of physical demand for 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:58.720
 the Southeast Asian region 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.549
 espn black virus traders have not shown 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.319
 interest because prices have been 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 stagnant but the traders and the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.430
 investors, both professionals and 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.079
 beginners want to see the movement 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.079
 of prices does not matter in which direction 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.040
 while the price is stagnant 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.689
 investors and traders move 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.780
 for the sides it 's almost as if 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.129
 we had a deadlock at the time 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.440
 nobody wants to act because he is not 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.450
 happening nothing and it will probably be 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.160
 of an external shock to provoke 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:32.140
 any real movement and then 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.000
 we will see some annual boost in your 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.920
 perspective for the price of gold and 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.920
 what are the main drivers of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.780
 the commodities in the coming months 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.370
 do not think I can make a 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.770
 prediction for the specific price 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.240
 because we are going through a period 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.130
 latent compared to the 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.110
 budget before an important 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.030
 publication next week copera 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.920
 but I can talk about trends based 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.300
 in a fundamental analysis and taking into 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.770
 there is very little interest 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.510
 professional in the market in this 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.400
 moment in both markets prices in 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.500
 dollars continue to float down 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.870
 We expect prices to start at 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.560
 recover between the end of this year or 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.560
 early next 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.860
 we really hope that in 2015 the 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.540
 recovery is weak because there is no 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.140
 much interest in investments in the 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.140
 general market 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.530
 and in the future however when the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.690
 European economy finally reach a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.040
 positive momentum and we started to see some 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.650
 type of growth 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.450
 globally synchronizing the concept of 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.460
 inflation expectations has been 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.470
 applied at some point due to the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.150
 decrease in the long-term level 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.580
 of liquidity that has been pushed from 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.410
 oatmeal mix and apparently the central bank 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.410
 European market in the USA 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.180
 if we join this with the improvement of 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.340
 market economy will then increase 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.470
 the demand for jewelry in the West and in 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.270
 this stage we have a resurgence of 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.070
 the demand in the east in creator since 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.170
 the surplus will have been eliminated and 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.480
 we will begin to see the transformation of 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.790
 market with an upward trend such 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.600
 time in the second half of 2015 but 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.070
 undoubtedly it will be in 2017 in girona thanks 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.750
 for your participation 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.030
 sting with this ends commodities 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.760
 today's corner but we'll be back next 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.940
 week with more exclusive interviews 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.940
 see you later
