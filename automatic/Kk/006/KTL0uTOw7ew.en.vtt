normal<00:00:36.470> formation<00:00:37.100> we're<00:00:37.610> gonna<00:00:37.700> key<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:38.240> on

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
normal formation we're gonna key in on

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.050 
normal formation we're gonna key in on
the<00:00:38.600> cover<00:00:38.960> one<00:00:39.590> play<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:40.580> this<00:00:40.730> play<00:00:41.000> is

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
the cover one play and this play is

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.990 
the cover one play and this play is
designed<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.720> send<00:00:41.930> five<00:00:42.230> pass<00:00:43.040> rushers<00:00:43.460> after

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
designed to send five pass rushers after

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.030 
designed to send five pass rushers after
the<00:00:44.090> quarterback<00:00:44.540> with<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> one<00:00:45.470> single<00:00:45.770> high

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
safety so we're gonna really need to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.110 
safety so we're gonna really need to
rely<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.720> our<00:00:48.050> defensive<00:00:48.730> secondary<00:00:49.730> here<00:00:49.970> to

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
rely on our defensive secondary here to

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.730

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
that's gonna make our defensive

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.170 
that's gonna make our defensive
secondary<00:01:36.200> play<00:01:36.770> about<00:01:36.979> seven<00:01:37.640> eight<00:01:37.850> yards

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
back loud the ball but now we see that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.330 
back loud the ball but now we see that

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
our defensive back is in great position

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.980 
our defensive back is in great position
even<00:01:46.580> though<00:01:46.729> he's<00:01:47.060> about<00:01:47.270> seven<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.960> eight

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
even though he's about seven to eight

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.160 
even though he's about seven to eight
point<00:01:48.440> speed<00:01:48.860> slower<00:01:49.820> than<00:01:50.450> Mike<00:01:50.690> walls<00:01:50.960> he

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
point speed slower than Mike walls he

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.390 
point speed slower than Mike walls he
still<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.530> able<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.799> hang<00:01:51.950> with<00:01:52.130> him

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400

on a quick slant a and we're gonna try
and<00:02:22.940> jump<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.210> route<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.570> unfortunately<00:02:24.140> we

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and jump the route but unfortunately we

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.290 
and jump the route but unfortunately we
actually<00:02:24.770> don't<00:02:24.980> make<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.280> play<00:02:25.490> but<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.150> is

what you have to do you have to key in

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.650 
what you have to do you have to key in
and<00:02:28.160> know<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.790> because<00:02:29.150> our<00:02:29.240> coverage<00:02:29.540> is

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
and know that because our coverage is

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.870 
and know that because our coverage is
backed<00:02:29.960> up<00:02:30.170> we<00:02:30.770> don't<00:02:31.070> really<00:02:31.310> need<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.670> worry

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
backed up we don't really need to worry

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.280 
backed up we don't really need to worry
about<00:02:32.030> playing<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.660> deep<00:02:32.900> part<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
about playing in the deep part of the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.650 
about playing in the deep part of the
field<00:02:33.350> with<00:02:33.770> our<00:02:33.950> second<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.610> our<00:02:34.760> deep<00:02:35.420> free

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
field with our second with our deep free

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.210 
field with our second with our deep free
safety<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.410> actually<00:02:36.500> doing<00:02:36.680> here

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
safety so what we're actually doing here

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.190 
safety so what we're actually doing here
is<00:02:37.400> playing<00:02:37.790> up<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.120> box<00:02:38.330> looking<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> jump
