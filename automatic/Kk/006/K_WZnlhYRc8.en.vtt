it's<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.330> can't<00:02:31.840> stand<00:02:32.290> back<00:02:32.530> far<00:02:32.890> enough<00:02:32.920> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's I can't stand back far enough to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.550 
it's I can't stand back far enough to
show<00:02:33.610> you<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.720> give<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.110> perspective

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
show you or to give you a perspective

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.670 
show you or to give you a perspective
I'm<00:02:36.069> going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.340> try<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.470> that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
I'm going to try it right here so that

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.410 
I'm going to try it right here so that
you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:39.010> see<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.700> that's<00:02:39.880> going<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.239> be

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you can see that that's going to be

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.800 
you can see that that's going to be
outstanding<00:02:41.340> hopefully<00:02:42.340> it'll<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:43.150> spaced<00:02:43.569> a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
outstanding hopefully it'll be spaced a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.240 
outstanding hopefully it'll be spaced a
little<00:02:44.110> further<00:02:44.380> apart<00:02:44.950> because<00:02:45.220> each<00:02:46.209> piece

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
little further apart because each piece

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.789 
little further apart because each piece
can<00:02:48.250> stand<00:02:48.700> on<00:02:48.910> its<00:02:49.150> own<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.870> love<00:02:50.380> one

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
can stand on its own and I love one

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.090 
can stand on its own and I love one
pieces<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.610> are<00:02:51.760> very<00:02:52.120> large<00:02:52.450> get<00:02:53.290> opened<00:02:53.950> up

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
pieces that are very large get opened up

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.720 
pieces that are very large get opened up
and<00:02:54.370> let<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.840> kind<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.709> fill<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.400> space

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
and let the I kind of fill in the space

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.250 
and let the I kind of fill in the space
between<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.569> so<00:02:59.319> that<00:03:00.069> piece<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.760> 63<00:03:01.750> inches

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
between it so that piece is 63 inches

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.729 
between it so that piece is 63 inches
wide<00:03:02.670> by<00:03:03.670> now<00:03:04.450> let<00:03:04.750> me<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:05.080> at<00:03:05.260> my<00:03:05.290> paper
