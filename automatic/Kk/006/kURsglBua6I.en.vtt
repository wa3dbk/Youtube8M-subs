00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.960
 hello how are I sprayed arocha and today 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 let's try this question of how 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.070
 detect an aggressive violent man 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.490
 depressed the first thing I have to say 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.220
 is sometimes this kind of people I would 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.840
 I call energetic vampires because all 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.030
 the people who are very 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.560
 depressed or that are very violent in 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.719
 actually they are a kind of ticks 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 that are put here and that you are sucking 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.690
 all your energy that's why the first thing that 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.360
 I have to contact is how I feel 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.130
 with this person we have that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 do with the couple and with all the 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.239
 people around us if when I 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.310
 I'm with another person and I start to 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.110
 feel with less energy I start to 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.750
 feel tired mind that feel 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.300
 irritable means that I am with a 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.090
 person who is suing me more than 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.640
 what I can give 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.560
 a depressed person is angry the 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.550
 depression we can be sure that 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.740
 anger 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.570
 and that anger is a very passive anger if 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.790
 a depressed person has no energy 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.820
 if a person does not have energy he wants 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.460
 steal the other's energy that for a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.560
 side now a violent person then 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.080
 as you are in a place you are in all 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.210
 rest very careful if I see that for 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 example I do not know in a restaurant they try 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.240
 wrong a waiter to a person of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.360
 service speaks to you there I can already 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.600
 know that the man this one we 're 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.820
 talking is violent and there is violence 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.330
 which is non-verbal and there is a violence that 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.940
 is physical non-verbal violence or 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.979
 verbal that is also humiliate criticize 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.399
 there are many types of violence this 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.130
 violence is always going to lead to 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.560
 violence 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.259
 if you see that a person talks to you very 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.060
 Ugly to another person and you do not believe 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.670
 which is because you are very pretty 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.380
 this person is currently 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 trying to look good with you but 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.679
 it is surely going to become a 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.080
 violent person then and a man 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.560
 good that is that is aggressive that is 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.230
 sick who is depressed goes 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.569
 to signal signals always the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.090
 we see what happens is that then later the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.450
 we want to hide not for nothing say the 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.610
 Love is blind but the neighbors do not 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.920
 case sometimes if you have a friend if 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.989
 you have a mother for someone who loves you 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.900
 hey hey there are things about this this man 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.819
 that does not beat me then pay attention to that 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.420
 but also pay attention to what he says 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.670
 your heart if your soul that finally is 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.230
 the best guide we have to take care of ourselves 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.230
 and protect ourselves
