00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.270
 not yet searched unfortunately 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.250
 found but that does not matter 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.990
 new information is on the way 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.640
 First of all, we'll come back for you 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 but can recognize a specific date 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.050
 I'll say more about that right now 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 what can we get out of this fund for 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.980
 Information the zombies attract 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.660
 The photos are natural 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 no black from three combos but 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.989
 black Ops 2 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 zombies from the map of the dead though 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.879
 willwacher tell us that the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 story on the map of the dead 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 I can do it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.920
 really do not say but what i say 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 is that I found out something 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 have on the comic-con official 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 website has indeed there to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 Legal Jason Plan What Posted 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.619
 and had posted it will be one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 new tricky story of the undead 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.090
 Do not reveal and do not miss them 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.439
 release of the dying 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 means for me it will be a new one 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.060
 story written a new zombie 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 history with the birth of the dying 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 9 july presented at the comic-con 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 get and the most important thing we do 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.150
 Of course it is possible to draw from this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 there will be a new birth cast and new ones 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.900
 So it will be characters 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 no longer be the old story and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 not the old story anymore 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.030
 be written down but this 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.369
 I draw that it is a new one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.259
 history will be with new star 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.180
 occupation really cool in any case 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820

 publishes the collector's edition 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.220
 from black ops three which is shown there 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.020
 So a lot 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.340
 Definitely on this comic con too 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.110
 I can only say that I see 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 Damn I'm looking forward to the zombie 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040
 trailer as a zombie seeks the and if 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.660
 even more information appear before the event 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.520
 should I determine that for you 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.260
 not withheld so subscribe to city 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.340

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.350
 to see the zombie mode of action 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.850
 then definitely let a zombies 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.130
 highlight there my friends 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.920
 Oh yes , what I find interesting 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.660
 So whether we have the zombie mode on the beta 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.030
 can test that's a good one 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.340
 ask yourselves what do you think we can 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.170
 but test the zombie mode on the beta 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.750
 We will learn more about this at the comic con 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.220
