00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the good news there's also a guy on the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
the good news there's also a guy on the
enemy<00:00:28.590> team<00:00:28.740> who<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.400> nothing<00:00:29.910> as<00:00:30.029> well

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
enemy team who is nothing as well

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
enemy team who is nothing as well
because<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.960> guess<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> couple<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.980> lovies

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
because I guess a couple of lovies

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.910 
because I guess a couple of lovies
before<00:00:32.700> he<00:00:32.969> saw<00:00:33.180> mean<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.020> he<00:00:34.590> decided

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
before he saw mean I think so he decided

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.709 
before he saw mean I think so he decided
to<00:00:35.070> give<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.700> as<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.570> watch

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
to give it a go as well so you can watch

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
to give it a go as well so you can watch
a<00:00:36.989> game<00:00:37.140> play<00:00:37.440> where<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.829> sort<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.670> against

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
a game play where I'm sort of up against

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
a game play where I'm sort of up against
another<00:00:39.149> knife<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.170> don't<00:00:40.410> know<00:00:40.469> he

another knife of it I don't know he

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.440

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
those five years of uni were the best

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.420 
those five years of uni were the best
times<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.210> my<00:01:33.270> life<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.840> think<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:35.220> made

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
times of my life I think that what made

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.010 
times of my life I think that what made
it<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.729> exciting<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.360> interesting<00:01:36.659> was

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it really exciting and interesting was

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.149 
it really exciting and interesting was
that<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.380> got<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> live<00:01:37.829> with<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.070> many

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that I got to live with so many

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
that I got to live with so many
different<00:01:38.490> people<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.689> across<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
different people from all across the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.469 
different people from all across the
world<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.280> them<00:01:41.430> remain<00:01:41.820> friends

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
world and some of them remain friends

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
world and some of them remain friends
with<00:01:42.509> me<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.170> day<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.680> well<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.369> campus

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
with me to this day as well the campus

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
with me to this day as well the campus
that<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.090> lived<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> was<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.170> different<00:01:46.409> too

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that I lived on was really different too

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.100 
that I lived on was really different too
I<00:01:47.159> guess<00:01:47.520> traditional<00:01:48.149> college<00:01:48.509> campuses

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I guess traditional college campuses

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.889 
I guess traditional college campuses
because<00:01:49.460> instead<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> having<00:01:51.119> dorms<00:01:51.689> or

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
because instead of having dorms or

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.359 
because instead of having dorms or
living<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> apartments<00:01:52.920> where<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.250> sort

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
living in apartments where you're sort

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.850 
living in apartments where you're sort
of<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.670> separated<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.750> had<00:01:55.200> houses

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
of like separated we actually had houses

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.120 
of like separated we actually had houses
so<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.729> had<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.210> 200<00:01:58.079> yells<00:01:58.350> 200<00:01:58.979> houses

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
so we had I think 200 yells 200 houses

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.760 
so we had I think 200 yells 200 houses
and<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.759> each<00:01:59.939> House<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.540> five<00:02:00.960> separate

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and in each House it was five separate

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
and in each House it was five separate
rooms<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.399> five<00:02:02.579> people<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.180> live<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
rooms for five people to live in so as a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
rooms for five people to live in so as a
campus<00:02:04.409> where<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:04.860> was<00:02:04.979> about<00:02:05.280> 900<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
campus where there was about 900 to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
campus where there was about 900 to
1,000<00:02:06.780> students<00:02:07.259> living<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.310> at<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> same

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
1,000 students living there at the same

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.029 
1,000 students living there at the same
time<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.629> um<00:02:09.989> obviously<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:11.009> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
time so um obviously with like a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.380 
time so um obviously with like a
thousand<00:02:11.580> people<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:12.030> not<00:02:12.120> going<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.300> be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
thousand people you're not going to be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.140 
thousand people you're not going to be
friends<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:12.780> every

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
friends with every

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.280 
friends with every
think<00:02:13.269> one<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.540> these<00:02:13.720> people<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:14.110> just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
think one of these people is just

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.319 
think one of these people is just
impossible<00:02:14.530> but<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.549> way<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.879> campus<00:02:16.299> was

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
impossible but the way the campus was

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.880 
impossible but the way the campus was
actually<00:02:16.750> structured<00:02:17.079> was<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.799> were

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
actually structured was that there were

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.640 
actually structured was that there were
like<00:02:18.010> rows<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.640> rows<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.849> houses<00:02:19.239> so<00:02:19.810> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
like rows and rows of houses so you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.979 
like rows and rows of houses so you
actually<00:02:20.829> got<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.879> become<00:02:22.209> pretty<00:02:22.959> good

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
actually got to become pretty good

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.569 
actually got to become pretty good
friends<00:02:23.110> with<00:02:23.500> your<00:02:23.590> neighbors<00:02:24.040> who<00:02:24.370> were<00:02:24.400> in

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
friends with your neighbors who were in

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.729 
friends with your neighbors who were in
the<00:02:24.700> same<00:02:24.879> row<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.659> in<00:02:26.260> my<00:02:26.409> third<00:02:26.709> year

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
the same row as you and in my third year

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.399 
the same row as you and in my third year
actually<00:02:27.280> moved<00:02:27.700> into<00:02:27.909> a<00:02:28.030> house<00:02:28.299> with<00:02:28.870> one<00:02:29.319> of

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
actually moved into a house with one of

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.890 
actually moved into a house with one of
my<00:02:29.500> friends<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.069> Hum<00:02:30.579> that<00:02:31.239> house<00:02:31.480> was<00:02:31.720> sort

my friends and Hum that house was sort

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
my friends and Hum that house was sort
of<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.019> in<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> middle<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:33.250> row<00:02:33.549> so<00:02:33.970> our

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
of like in the middle of that row so our

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
hang out just randomly throughout the

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.420 
hang out just randomly throughout the
day<00:02:40.659> depending<00:02:41.049> on<00:02:41.170> who<00:02:41.379> had<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.069> go<00:02:42.159> to<00:02:42.220> class

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
would happen except it would become like

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.360 
would happen except it would become like
a<00:02:58.180> huge<00:02:58.480> party<00:02:58.930> i<00:02:59.230> guess<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.859> i<00:02:59.889> just<00:02:59.950> really

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
a huge party i guess that i just really

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.330 
a huge party i guess that i just really
miss<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.030> spontaneity<00:03:01.450> part<00:03:02.319> of<00:03:02.560> like<00:03:02.769> being

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
miss the spontaneity part of like being

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.670 
miss the spontaneity part of like being
a<00:03:03.579> lot<00:03:03.700> younger<00:03:04.209> I<00:03:04.389> know<00:03:04.480> I'm<00:03:04.750> still<00:03:05.049> young<00:03:05.349> but

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
a lot younger I know I'm still young but

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.470 
a lot younger I know I'm still young but
it's<00:03:06.189> really<00:03:06.370> different<00:03:06.639> once<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.180> sort<00:03:07.389> of

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
it's really different once you sort of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.210 
it's really different once you sort of
have<00:03:07.659> to<00:03:07.840> start<00:03:08.139> working<00:03:08.439> full<00:03:08.769> time<00:03:08.799> and

have to start working full time and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.470 
have to start working full time and
think<00:03:09.400> about<00:03:09.519> what<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:09.909> want<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.299> with

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
think about what you want to do with

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.500 
think about what you want to do with
your<00:03:10.510> life<00:03:10.810> but<00:03:11.560> back<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:12.189> in<00:03:12.370> uni<00:03:12.819> obviously

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
your life but back like in uni obviously

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.240 
your life but back like in uni obviously
all<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.079> need<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.290> do<00:03:14.409> is<00:03:14.530> study<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.129> you

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
all you need to do is study and you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.129 
all you need to do is study and you
don't<00:03:15.430> really<00:03:15.519> have<00:03:15.819> like<00:03:15.879> I<00:03:16.269> guess<00:03:16.450> real<00:03:16.840> life

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
don't really have like I guess real life

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.400 
don't really have like I guess real life
concern<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.129> that's<00:03:18.940> really<00:03:19.239> nice<00:03:19.449> and<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.230> just

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
concern so that's really nice and I just

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.229 
concern so that's really nice and I just
really<00:03:20.590> missed<00:03:20.859> that<00:03:21.069> I<00:03:21.310> guess<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:21.730> also<00:03:21.879> really

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
really missed that I guess I also really

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.569 
really missed that I guess I also really
missed<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:23.410> spontaneity<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:23.919> like

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
missed just the spontaneity of like

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.759 
missed just the spontaneity of like
meeting<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:25.269> these<00:03:25.419> different<00:03:25.690> people<00:03:26.049> and<00:03:26.410> I

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
meeting all these different people and I

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.530 
meeting all these different people and I
guess<00:03:26.889> in<00:03:27.069> many<00:03:27.310> ways<00:03:27.549> having<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.209> YouTube

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
guess in many ways having a YouTube

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.659 
guess in many ways having a YouTube
channel<00:03:28.569> sort<00:03:29.079> of<00:03:29.139> enables<00:03:29.709> me<00:03:29.889> to<00:03:29.919> kind<00:03:30.639> of

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
channel sort of enables me to kind of

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.189 
channel sort of enables me to kind of
have<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:30.849> same<00:03:31.150> sort<00:03:31.419> of<00:03:31.510> feeling<00:03:31.900> as<00:03:32.019> well

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
have that same sort of feeling as well

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.589 
have that same sort of feeling as well
