problem<00:00:25.410> let's<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.430> some<00:00:26.760> time<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.420> think

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.920 

a<00:00:30.770> little<00:00:31.220> more<00:00:31.430> time

problem solving steps to figure out what
to<00:00:47.580> do<00:00:47.760> okay<00:00:48.170> what<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.350> steps<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:50.550> we

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to do okay what are the steps first we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
to do okay what are the steps first we
need<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.840> stop<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.740> what<00:00:53.130> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
need to stop and think about what the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.060 
need to stop and think about what the
problem<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.850> well<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.200> problem<00:00:55.650> is<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.950> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
problem is well the problem is that the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.030 
problem is well the problem is that the
machine<00:00:56.370> took<00:00:56.670> my<00:00:56.730> money<00:00:57.150> okay<00:00:57.900> next<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.860> need

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
machine took my money okay next we need

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.030 
machine took my money okay next we need
to<00:00:59.310> think<00:00:59.490> about<00:00:59.820> ways<00:01:00.060> to<00:01:00.120> solve<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.990> problem

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
to think about ways to solve the problem

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.090 
to think about ways to solve the problem
well<00:01:02.040> I<00:01:02.370> could<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:02.970> mad<00:01:03.270> sad<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.350> think<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.980> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
well I could get mad sad or think of a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.400 
well I could get mad sad or think of a
way<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> get<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.880> drink<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.390> could<00:01:07.020> break<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
way to get to drink or I could break the

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.770 
way to get to drink or I could break the
glass<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.920> could<00:01:08.460> break<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.910> glass<00:01:09.150> Kim<00:01:09.479> but

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
glass you could break the glass Kim but

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.800 
glass you could break the glass Kim but
would<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.890> choice<00:01:11.220> no<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.360> guess

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
would that be a good choice no I guess

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.070 
would that be a good choice no I guess
not

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
not

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.650 
not
the<00:01:13.619> next<00:01:13.890> step<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.670> decide<00:01:15.030> if<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> choice

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
the next step is to decide if the choice

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.590 
the next step is to decide if the choice
is<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.930> good<00:01:16.140> choice<00:01:16.440> or<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.010> bad<00:01:17.040> choice<00:01:17.450> when<00:01:18.450> we

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
is a good choice or a bad choice when we

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
is a good choice or a bad choice when we
make<00:01:18.810> choices<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.590> need<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.010> decide<00:01:20.430> if<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
make choices we need to decide if the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
make choices we need to decide if the
choice<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.300> good<00:01:21.510> choice<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.380> bad<00:01:22.410> choice
