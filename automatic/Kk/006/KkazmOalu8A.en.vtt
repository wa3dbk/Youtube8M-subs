and good throw from the catcher there to

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.870 
and good throw from the catcher there to
get<00:02:10.260> me<00:02:10.410> out<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.740> well<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.790> give

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
get me out as well so you got to give

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.850 
get me out as well so you got to give
credit<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.210> the<00:02:12.810> catcher<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.290> well<00:02:13.470> it's<00:02:13.710> not

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
credit to the catcher as well it's not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.030 
credit to the catcher as well it's not
just<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.370> speed<00:02:14.670> being<00:02:15.360> not<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.870> great<00:02:16.140> it's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
just my speed being not that great it's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.650 
just my speed being not that great it's
also<00:02:17.220> good<00:02:17.610> throw<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> catcher<00:02:18.240> because

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
if it wasn't a good throw I probably

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.080 
if it wasn't a good throw I probably
would<00:02:20.040> have<00:02:20.100> been<00:02:20.160> safe<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.640> play<00:02:20.970> at

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
would have been safe on that play at

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.910 
would have been safe on that play at
least<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.780> plenty<00:02:22.080> shortstop<00:02:22.530> again<00:02:22.740> let's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630

wasn't<00:03:36.990> able<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.200> get<00:03:37.290> my<00:03:37.440> next<00:03:37.680> hit<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.130> the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
wasn't able to get my next hit of the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.910 
wasn't able to get my next hit of the
day<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:39.120> playing<00:03:39.690> shortstop<00:03:40.020> once<00:03:40.560> again

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
day so playing shortstop once again

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.770 
day so playing shortstop once again
getting<00:03:41.160> ready<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.520> make<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> correct<00:03:42.540> play

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
getting ready to make a correct play

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.480 
getting ready to make a correct play
here<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.260> one's<00:03:43.500> flied<00:03:43.830> out<00:03:43.860> once<00:03:44.220> again

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
here and this one's flied out once again

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.760 
here and this one's flied out once again
but<00:03:44.790> I<00:03:45.030> cannot<00:03:45.690> make<00:03:45.960> the<00:03:46.140> play<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.590> end<00:03:46.740> up

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
but I cannot make the play and I end up

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.590 
but I cannot make the play and I end up
bottling<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.400> probably<00:03:48.090> should<00:03:48.210> have<00:03:48.330> tried

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
bottling it probably should have tried

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.150 
bottling it probably should have tried
for<00:03:48.900> first<00:03:49.170> there<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.560> don't<00:03:49.770> think<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:50.010> would

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
for first there I don't think I would

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.310 
for first there I don't think I would
have<00:03:50.190> gone<00:03:50.430> them<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:50.940> rather<00:03:51.930> than<00:03:52.140> throw

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
have gone them but rather than throw

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.900 
have gone them but rather than throw
it's<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> second<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:52.920> probably<00:03:53.280> should<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.760> at

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
it's a second I probably should have at

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.240 
it's a second I probably should have at
least<00:03:53.940> tried<00:03:54.330> for<00:03:54.660> first<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.170> one<00:03:55.770> of<00:03:55.800> two<00:03:56.100> on

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
least tried for first so one of two on

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.830 
least tried for first so one of two on
the<00:03:56.340> day<00:03:56.490> now<00:03:56.700> we're<00:03:57.270> going<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.420> see<00:03:57.540> if<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.690> can

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
the day now we're going to see if I can

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.990 
the day now we're going to see if I can
pull<00:03:57.990> off<00:03:58.050> another<00:03:58.380> hit<00:03:58.680> here<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.130> 4<00:03:59.340> i'm<00:03:59.820> gonna

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
pull off another hit here or 4 i'm gonna

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.180 
pull off another hit here or 4 i'm gonna
have<00:04:00.120> an<00:04:00.210> unlucky<00:04:00.570> day<00:04:00.720> at<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> plate<00:04:01.470> so

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
have an unlucky day at the plate so

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.980 
have an unlucky day at the plate so
we'll<00:04:02.760> find<00:04:03.000> out<00:04:03.180> there's<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.450> man<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.630> first

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
we'll find out there's a man on first

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.680 
we'll find out there's a man on first
one<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.830> I<00:04:05.040> could<00:04:05.220> look<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.400> just<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.450> lead

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
one out so I could look to just to lead

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.870 
one out so I could look to just to lead
him<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.140> it's<00:04:07.830> hit<00:04:07.980> up<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.280> middle<00:04:08.430> and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
him and it's hit up the middle and

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.780 
him and it's hit up the middle and
unfortunately<00:04:09.660> for<00:04:09.870> me<00:04:10.340> okay<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.490> get<00:04:11.610> there

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
unfortunately for me okay we get there

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.040 
unfortunately for me okay we get there
safely<00:04:12.150> but<00:04:12.330> that's<00:04:12.480> not<00:04:12.570> going<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.810> count<00:04:12.900> for

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
safely but that's not going to count for

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.960 
safely but that's not going to count for
a<00:04:13.140> hit<00:04:13.290> because<00:04:13.500> doesn't<00:04:14.490> feel<00:04:14.640> this<00:04:14.790> choice

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
a hit because doesn't feel this choice

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.699 
a hit because doesn't feel this choice
uh<00:04:16.000> you<00:04:16.660> know<00:04:16.780> they<00:04:16.959> got<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.200> guy<00:04:17.290> out<00:04:17.530> at

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
uh you know they got the guy out at

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.009 
uh you know they got the guy out at
second<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.370> that<00:04:18.579> does<00:04:19.269> not<00:04:19.390> count<00:04:19.600> for<00:04:19.750> hit<00:04:19.989> on

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
second so that does not count for hit on

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.080 
second so that does not count for hit on
me<00:04:20.140> some<00:04:20.470> one<00:04:20.739> on<00:04:20.769> one<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.340> three<00:04:21.610> on<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.880> day

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
me some one on one of three on the day

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.930 
me some one on one of three on the day
but<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.600> mean<00:04:23.260> at<00:04:23.410> least<00:04:23.440> I'm<00:04:23.680> on<00:04:23.800> base<00:04:24.040> right<00:04:24.310> so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
but I mean at least I'm on base right so

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.820 
but I mean at least I'm on base right so
I<00:04:25.240> was<00:04:25.450> trying<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.840> steal<00:04:26.050> their<00:04:26.260> once<00:04:26.500> again
