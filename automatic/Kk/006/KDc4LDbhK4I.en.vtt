00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.660 
remove the ace through ten any ace
through<00:01:19.409> ten<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.130> pull<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:20.520> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
through ten you have to pull them out of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
through ten you have to pull them out of
the<00:01:20.729> deck<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.780> while<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the deck so while you're doing this

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
the deck so while you're doing this
you're<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.430> setting<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> deck<00:01:24.090> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
you're going to be setting the deck and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
you're going to be setting the deck and
that's<00:01:25.200> why<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> prom<00:01:25.950> -<00:01:26.159> because

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
that's why it's in prom - because

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.890 
that's why it's in prom - because
setting<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> deck<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> part<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> trick

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
setting the deck is part of the trick

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.600 
setting the deck is part of the trick
the<00:01:28.409> setup<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> deck<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> you're<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the setup for the deck is you're going

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.520 
the setup for the deck is you're going
to<00:01:29.790> put<00:01:30.000> two<00:01:30.210> kings<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.350> deck

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
to put two kings on the top of the deck

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
to put two kings on the top of the deck
while<00:01:32.340> they're<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.610> together<00:01:32.909> two<00:01:33.420> kings<00:01:33.689> on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
while they're all together two kings on

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
while they're all together two kings on
the<00:01:33.960> top<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> deck<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:35.189> King<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the top of the deck one King on the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.130 
the top of the deck one King on the
bottom<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:37.049> king<00:01:38.450> separating<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.540> fourth

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
bottom and one king separating a fourth

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
bottom and one king separating a fourth
from<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.380> bottom<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.920> there'll<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.159> cards

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
from the bottom so there'll be two cards

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.730 
from the bottom so there'll be two cards
that's<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.390> setup<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.409> don't<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.680> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's the setup but you don't want to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.260

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
and I'll say they won't find that to be

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.890 
and I'll say they won't find that to be
too<00:05:45.860> funny<00:05:46.130> so<00:05:46.700> what<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.060> then<00:05:47.210> say<00:05:47.480> is<00:05:47.630> okay

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
too funny so what you then say is okay

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.690 
too funny so what you then say is okay
let's<00:05:48.110> see<00:05:48.230> if<00:05:48.320> we<00:05:48.380> can<00:05:48.680> find<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.280> King<00:05:49.490> by

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
let's see if we can find the King by

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.600 
let's see if we can find the King by
counting<00:05:50.240> now<00:05:50.990> let's<00:05:51.620> add<00:05:51.860> these<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.280> cards

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
counting now let's add these the cards

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.260 
counting now let's add these the cards
up<00:05:52.790> four<00:05:53.390> and<00:05:53.540> seven<00:05:53.780> is<00:05:54.050> 11<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:54.850> what<00:05:55.850> value

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
up four and seven is 11 and what value

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.420 
up four and seven is 11 and what value
did<00:05:56.480> you<00:05:56.600> give<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.900> the<00:05:57.020> Joker<00:05:57.410> and<00:05:57.530> that's<00:05:58.190> why

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
did you give to the Joker and that's why

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.430 
did you give to the Joker and that's why
you<00:05:58.490> want<00:05:58.820> them<00:05:58.970> to<00:05:59.060> remember<00:05:59.180> they<00:05:59.900> said<00:06:00.140> six

you want them to remember they said six
so<00:06:01.250> 11<00:06:01.700> and<00:06:01.760> six<00:06:02.060> is<00:06:02.240> 17<00:06:02.810> so<00:06:03.350> the<00:06:03.470> seventeenth

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
so 11 and six is 17 so the seventeenth

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.160 
so 11 and six is 17 so the seventeenth
card<00:06:04.310> will<00:06:04.550> be<00:06:04.640> the<00:06:04.760> fourth<00:06:05.000> King<00:06:05.270> one<00:06:05.900> two
