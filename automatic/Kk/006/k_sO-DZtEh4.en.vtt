 first 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.790
 work 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.740
 the easy erico channel of the car in this 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.180
 opportunity I have the pleasure of being here 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.590
 in front of a person who is very 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.600
 important in my country that he is the 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.830
 youtuber most famous his name of ronald 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.390
 mackay 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.980
 You can have a few questions to 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.980
 mccain so let's go with this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.070
 and I'm here just because I had 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.070
 free food 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:52.440
 and the food 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 It would be very bad if you do not 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:01.390
 my youtube channel my video channel 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:09.700
 in which I started it with a microphone that 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 buy at 999 999 999 18 something 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.880
 cost the microphone and a microphone that yes 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 it's up to you to make sonax cable 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.890
 and with a laptop that buys 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.170
 of one of those telephone contracts 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.660
 they said if we do not sell this laptop 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 Saudi as so fast that advancing the 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.380
 technology, we are not going to keep them 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.860
 then I fell down and for a 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.980
 three-year contract not what old 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.830
 and with that I made my life my first my 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:43.260
 first video and everything went well because 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.260
 because I got local love 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 two 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.240
 25 million views of what are the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.729
 choco reactions about 10 million because 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.229
 because it 's something new is not something is something 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.240
 I'm starting to do 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.890
 I have some videos that deleted me and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.409
 that the data is no longer available and neither 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 videos that originally its fine 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.670
 on the first page of the chapín that I had 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.140
 but I can not count either the 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.340
 reproductions that they have had when 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.000
 they are in the videos they are taken to 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.000
 mobile devices 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.450
 the character that cost me the most 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.800
 First I want to thank 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.780
 the fans of the three mice and the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.480
 goals of the doubles gray to wing chapín 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.370
 with the opportunity with the original lord 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.410
 with humberto vélez I tried to make him 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.850
 in front of him and he was so nervous that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.850
 my voice came out again 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.739
 autobots transforming 6 evans in wheat 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.750
 I have a voice that does not belong to any 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.240
 character but the abuse is like generic 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.820
 of whatever 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320
 Any character is speaking 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.790
 main of the videos and this is not a 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.410
 protagonist I think it has reached the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.120
 time to move the most elements 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.120
 competent to fight with this 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.960
 and the girl wanted to be the little step 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.440
 marty mcfly football but you 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.440
 same 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.659
 or the danger the nervous prisoners are 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.519
 are trying to fight crime with 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.519
 good mood well in this 2011 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.390
 well I think that the most 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.740
 competent is someone who is always 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.319
 in the background and that has no role 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.709
 but but it's there for the moment 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.430
 uncomfortable or funny is not a voice to this 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.430
 so dub not 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.640
 thing that I do either radio or 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.069
 videos but that's the voice that I use 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:58.610
 so that things get messed up 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:04:01.650
 put on then the character is 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.230
 greetings to the youtube community 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.590

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.130
 write 8 corrections 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:41.190

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:45.660

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.660

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:57.079
