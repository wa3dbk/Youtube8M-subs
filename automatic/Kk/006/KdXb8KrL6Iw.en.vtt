two<00:00:25.310> thousand<00:00:25.610> eight<00:00:25.700> season

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.260 

I<00:00:28.210> just<00:00:29.050> feel<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:29.770> possibility<00:00:30.699> is<00:00:31.000> even

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
I just feel that possibility is even

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.620 
I just feel that possibility is even
greater<00:00:31.390> than<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.810> world

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.560

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
to win that it was unexpected especially

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
from third on the grid then we'd also

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.520
