about<00:00:38.670> jellyfish<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> first<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
about jellyfish so the first thing that

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.690 
about jellyfish so the first thing that
people<00:00:40.530> ask<00:00:40.710> me<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> lot<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.219> where<00:00:41.550> did

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
people ask me a lot is like where did

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.709 
people ask me a lot is like where did
you<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:42.059> them<00:00:42.239> from

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you get them from

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.729 
you get them from
and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.899> guess<00:00:43.050> has<00:00:43.200> an<00:00:43.320> obvious<00:00:43.620> question

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and I guess has an obvious question

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
and I guess has an obvious question
because<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.250> don't<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.579> them<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.910> pet<00:00:45.239> shops

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
because you don't see them in pet shops

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
because you don't see them in pet shops

system which I really like the tank

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.670 
system which I really like the tank
itself<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.780> quite<00:01:12.960> easy<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.590> together

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
itself is quite easy to put together

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.789

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and do things but the tank was really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.060 
and do things but the tank was really
easy<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> put<00:01:21.990> together<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.710> through<00:01:22.950> what

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
easy to put together that's through what

in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> corners<00:01:29.579> otherwise<00:01:29.880> because<00:01:30.390> they're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
in the corners otherwise because they're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.380 
in the corners otherwise because they're
not<00:01:31.259> smart<00:01:32.009> creatures<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> mean<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
not smart creatures I mean that I have a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
not smart creatures I mean that I have a
brain<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.869> they're<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.439> smart<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.189> guess

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
brain but they're not smart and I guess

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890 
brain but they're not smart and I guess
the<00:01:35.430> basic<00:01:35.549> man<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> talk<00:01:36.030> about<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.659> how

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the basic man to talk about is like how

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.390 
the basic man to talk about is like how
to<00:01:36.960> look<00:01:37.259> after<00:01:37.470> them<00:01:37.740> people<00:01:38.040> either<00:01:38.250> think

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
to look after them people either think

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.469 
to look after them people either think
they're<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.820> super<00:01:39.150> super<00:01:39.240> high

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
they're going to be super super high

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.640 
they're going to be super super high
maintenance<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.380> they're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
maintenance or I think they're going to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
maintenance or I think they're going to
be<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.970> no<00:01:41.970> maintenance<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.630> all<00:01:42.659> because

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
be like no maintenance at all because

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.810 
be like no maintenance at all because
they<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.100> brain<00:01:44.399> or<00:01:44.670> central

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
they don't have a brain or central

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.399 
they don't have a brain or central
nervous<00:01:45.030> system<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.079> truth<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
nervous system and the truth of the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.950 
nervous system and the truth of the
matter<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> actually<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.240> jellyfish

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
matter is that actually the jellyfish

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.929 
matter is that actually the jellyfish
are<00:01:49.079> divas<00:01:49.320> they<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.220> sensitive<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
are divas they are so sensitive to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
are divas they are so sensitive to
changes<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> pH<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> water<00:01:52.229> change<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
changes in the pH of the water change to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.469 
changes in the pH of the water change to
the<00:01:53.430> temperature<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> water<00:01:54.439> changes<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the temperature in the water changes to

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.749 
the temperature in the water changes to
everything<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.100> mainly<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.549> water

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
everything and so it's mainly the water

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
everything and so it's mainly the water
that<00:01:59.939> you've<00:02:00.060> got<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> keep<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.509> top<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that you've got to keep on top of the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010 
that you've got to keep on top of the
food<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.619> actually<00:02:01.740> really<00:02:02.280> easy<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:03.020> look

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
food is actually really easy to look

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
food is actually really easy to look
after<00:02:04.170> them<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.590> cleaning<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> tank<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
after them with cleaning up the tank is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
after them with cleaning up the tank is
actually<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.360> easy<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
actually really really easy I just get a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.359 
actually really really easy I just get a
sponge<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.469> life<00:02:07.619> wipe<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.039> down<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
sponge in life wipe it down the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
sponge in life wipe it down the
jellyfish<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.849> I've<00:02:08.970> got<00:02:09.179> don't<00:02:09.599> really

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
jellyfish that I've got don't really

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.850 
jellyfish that I've got don't really
stink

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
stink

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.530 
stink
and<00:02:10.979> if

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and if

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.850 
and if
times<00:02:11.689> I<00:02:11.840> have<00:02:12.019> been<00:02:12.170> stung<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.470> feels<00:02:12.650> less

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
times I have been stung it feels less

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.229 
times I have been stung it feels less
than<00:02:13.010> an<00:02:13.099> it'll<00:02:13.310> sting<00:02:13.549> so<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:13.909> it<00:02:14.090> doesn't

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
than an it'll sting so like it doesn't

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.000 
than an it'll sting so like it doesn't
it<00:02:14.480> doesn't<00:02:14.689> rather<00:02:14.900> realize<00:02:15.290> put<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.650> hand<00:02:15.860> in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
it doesn't rather realize put my hand in

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.940 
it doesn't rather realize put my hand in
wipe<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.819> sponge<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.840> all<00:02:18.170> good

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
wipe it with a sponge it's all good

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.830 
wipe it with a sponge it's all good
the<00:02:19.010> next<00:02:19.220> thing<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.519> how<00:02:19.549> do<00:02:19.849> you<00:02:20.120> feed<00:02:20.360> them<00:02:20.599> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
the next thing is how do you feed them I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.059 
the next thing is how do you feed them I
think<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.170> biggest<00:02:21.409> question<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.980> people

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
think the biggest question that people

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.619 
think the biggest question that people
always<00:02:22.280> like<00:02:22.519> what<00:02:22.790> do<00:02:22.939> you<00:02:23.030> feed<00:02:23.390> them

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
always like what do you feed them

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.500 
always like what do you feed them
because<00:02:24.439> jellyfish<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.129> eat<00:02:25.430> Turtles

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
because jellyfish can eat Turtles

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.180 
because jellyfish can eat Turtles
did<00:02:26.689> you<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.930> jellyfish<00:02:27.590> can<00:02:27.739> eat<00:02:27.829> Turtles

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
did you know jellyfish can eat Turtles

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.740 
did you know jellyfish can eat Turtles
not<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:28.459> jellyfish<00:02:28.849> but<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.329> big<00:02:29.480> scary

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
not my jellyfish but but big scary

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.270 
not my jellyfish but but big scary
jellyfish<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.470> some<00:02:30.739> jellyfish<00:02:31.069> and

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
jellyfish and some jellyfish and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.050 
jellyfish and some jellyfish and
cannibals

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
cannibals

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.619 
cannibals
so<00:02:32.329> they'll<00:02:32.480> eat<00:02:32.750> about<00:02:33.019> jellyfish<00:02:34.629> Bachelet

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
so they'll eat about jellyfish Bachelet

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.089 
so they'll eat about jellyfish Bachelet
that's<00:02:35.810> really<00:02:36.019> cool<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.260> see<00:02:36.290> sometimes<00:02:36.799> as

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
that's really cool to see sometimes as

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.440 
that's really cool to see sometimes as
morbid<00:02:37.370> as<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.640> sounds<00:02:37.790> because<00:02:38.060> you'll<00:02:38.329> get

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
morbid as that sounds because you'll get

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
morbid as that sounds because you'll get
white<00:02:38.599> colored<00:02:39.049> jellyfish<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:39.769> it's<00:02:40.069> like<00:02:40.220> a

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
white colored jellyfish and it's like a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.949 
white colored jellyfish and it's like a
clear<00:02:40.640> colored<00:02:41.000> jellyfish<00:02:41.359> the<00:02:41.659> colored

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
clear colored jellyfish the colored

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.449 
clear colored jellyfish the colored
jellyfish<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.500> they're<00:02:42.650> also<00:02:42.829> colored<00:02:43.250> on<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
jellyfish so they're also colored on the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.220 
jellyfish so they're also colored on the
inside<00:02:43.819> which<00:02:43.970> i<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.329> really<00:02:44.599> cool<00:02:44.900> how

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
inside which i think is really cool how

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.839 
inside which i think is really cool how
I<00:02:45.260> feed<00:02:45.590> my<00:02:45.769> jellyfish<00:02:46.159> peak<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.579> I<00:02:46.609> just

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
I feed my jellyfish peak because I just

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.940 
I feed my jellyfish peak because I just
had<00:02:47.000> little<00:02:47.299> blubber<00:02:47.989> jellyfish<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.799> I'm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950

had little blubber jellyfish and I'm
gonna<00:02:49.099> get<00:02:49.310> moon<00:02:49.489> jellyfish<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.239> just<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.049> feed

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
gonna get moon jellyfish I just I feed

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.890 
gonna get moon jellyfish I just I feed
them<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.889> which<00:02:52.129> is<00:02:52.370> crushed<00:02:53.060> fish<00:02:53.329> eggs<00:02:53.569> and

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.289

so<00:03:12.950> Ashley<00:03:13.159> special<00:03:13.579> on<00:03:13.730> Instagram<00:03:14.060> wants<00:03:14.239> to

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
so Ashley special on Instagram wants to

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.699 
so Ashley special on Instagram wants to
know<00:03:14.389> why<00:03:14.569> it's<00:03:14.720> different<00:03:14.900> from<00:03:15.109> owning<00:03:15.470> fish

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
know why it's different from owning fish

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.710 
know why it's different from owning fish
to<00:03:15.949> jellyfish<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.639> what's<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.209> cost<00:03:17.449> and

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
to jellyfish and what's the cost and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.569 
to jellyfish and what's the cost and
care<00:03:17.989> basically<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:18.889> don't<00:03:19.069> really<00:03:19.340> have<00:03:19.459> to

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
care basically you don't really have to

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.970 
care basically you don't really have to
spend<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.910> lot<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.120> money<00:03:20.329> on<00:03:20.629> jellyfish<00:03:21.379> for

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
spend a lot of money on jellyfish for

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.800 
spend a lot of money on jellyfish for
like<00:03:22.370> caring<00:03:22.910> for<00:03:23.090> them<00:03:23.269> is<00:03:23.389> basically<00:03:23.599> just

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
like caring for them is basically just

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.449 
like caring for them is basically just
food<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.260> topping<00:03:24.560> up<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.739> water<00:03:24.949> because<00:03:25.310> as

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
food and topping up the water because as

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.009 
food and topping up the water because as
the<00:03:25.699> water<00:03:25.910> evaporates<00:03:26.180> if<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.750> live<00:03:26.870> in<00:03:26.959> a

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
the water evaporates if you live in a

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.960 
the water evaporates if you live in a
hot<00:03:27.109> climate<00:03:27.169> like<00:03:27.620> I<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:28.489> salt<00:03:28.730> still

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
hot climate like I do the salt still

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.280 
hot climate like I do the salt still
stays<00:03:29.180> there<00:03:29.359> so<00:03:29.510> I<00:03:29.540> top<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:30.019> with<00:03:30.049> fresh

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
stays there so I top it up with fresh

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.110 
stays there so I top it up with fresh
bottled<00:03:30.709> water<00:03:30.859> because<00:03:31.190> my<00:03:31.340> tap<00:03:31.579> water<00:03:31.609> isn't

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
bottled water because my tap water isn't

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.729 
bottled water because my tap water isn't
very<00:03:32.329> nice<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:33.049> that's<00:03:33.230> basically<00:03:33.620> because

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
very nice and that's basically because

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.039 
very nice and that's basically because
you<00:03:33.980> don't<00:03:34.129> need<00:03:34.220> any<00:03:34.280> external<00:03:34.849> things<00:03:35.780> for

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you don't need any external things for

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.780 
you don't need any external things for
them<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.290> don't<00:03:36.319> need<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.650> simulate<00:03:36.859> an<00:03:37.190> ocean

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
them you don't need to simulate an ocean

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.430 
them you don't need to simulate an ocean
you<00:03:37.849> don't<00:03:37.970> need<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.150> buy<00:03:38.239> like<00:03:38.419> seaweed<00:03:39.049> or

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you don't need to buy like seaweed or

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.680 
you don't need to buy like seaweed or
sea<00:03:39.620> weed<00:03:39.799> or<00:03:40.010> like<00:03:40.489> castles<00:03:41.060> or<00:03:41.510> like

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
sea weed or like castles or like

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.420 
sea weed or like castles or like
anything<00:03:42.079> to<00:03:42.199> put<00:03:42.349> in<00:03:42.440> the<00:03:42.560> tank<00:03:42.769> because

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
anything to put in the tank because

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.550 
anything to put in the tank because
jellyfish<00:03:44.299> are<00:03:44.449> more<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.840> plants<00:03:45.319> than<00:03:45.470> they

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
jellyfish are more like plants than they

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.379 
jellyfish are more like plants than they
are<00:03:45.590> animals<00:03:46.190> they<00:03:46.699> have<00:03:46.849> no<00:03:47.090> brain<00:03:47.359> no

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
are animals they have no brain no

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.210 
are animals they have no brain no
central<00:03:47.810> nervous<00:03:47.959> system<00:03:48.349> they<00:03:48.650> have<00:03:48.799> no<00:03:48.980> eyes

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
central nervous system they have no eyes

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.289 
central nervous system they have no eyes
so<00:03:49.910> like<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:51.129> doesn't<00:03:52.129> matter<00:03:52.220> which<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.030> which

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
so like you doesn't matter which I which

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.879 
so like you doesn't matter which I which
also<00:03:53.510> bring<00:03:53.780> me<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.079> point<00:03:54.260> where<00:03:54.470> when<00:03:54.859> I

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
also bring me to the point where when I

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.259 
also bring me to the point where when I
first<00:03:55.159> got<00:03:55.310> my<00:03:55.430> jellyfish<00:03:55.760> people<00:03:56.060> were<00:03:56.120> like

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
first got my jellyfish people were like

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.270 
first got my jellyfish people were like
oh<00:03:56.449> isn't<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.959> isn't<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.349> tank<00:03:57.560> too<00:03:57.739> small<00:03:58.099> for

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
oh isn't it isn't the tank too small for

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.099 
oh isn't it isn't the tank too small for
them<00:03:58.430> shouldn't<00:03:59.180> they<00:03:59.299> have<00:03:59.389> more<00:03:59.690> room<00:03:59.930> to

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
them shouldn't they have more room to

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.990 
them shouldn't they have more room to
swim<00:04:00.590> around<00:04:00.709> and<00:04:01.099> like<00:04:01.250> they<00:04:01.519> aim<00:04:01.760> lessly

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
swim around and like they aim lessly

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.819 
swim around and like they aim lessly
swim<00:04:02.389> around<00:04:02.629> this<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.349> literally<00:04:03.709> like

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
swim around this is literally like

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.009 
swim around this is literally like

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
facts about jellyfish I think I

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.050 
facts about jellyfish I think I
mentioned<00:04:57.830> this<00:04:58.010> like<00:04:58.220> 14<00:04:58.580> thousand<00:04:58.910> times

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
mentioned this like 14 thousand times

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.240 
mentioned this like 14 thousand times
already<00:04:59.300> in<00:04:59.419> the<00:04:59.479> video<00:04:59.690> but<00:05:00.200> jellyfish<00:05:01.040> don't

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
already in the video but jellyfish don't

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.710 
already in the video but jellyfish don't
have<00:05:01.490> brains<00:05:01.790> they<00:05:02.150> don't<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.360> a<00:05:02.419> central

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
have brains they don't have a central

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.420 
have brains they don't have a central
nervous<00:05:02.750> system<00:05:03.020> some<00:05:03.710> jellyfish<00:05:04.130> are<00:05:04.250> also

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
nervous system some jellyfish are also

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.900

they<00:05:08.180> outlasted<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.110> dinosaurs<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:10.310> there's

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
they outlasted the dinosaurs so there's

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520 
they outlasted the dinosaurs so there's
a<00:05:10.520> type<00:05:10.700> of<00:05:10.729> jellyfish<00:05:11.180> called<00:05:11.479> to<00:05:11.750> rock<00:05:12.080> this

Button<00:05:23.630> when<00:05:23.990> it<00:05:24.080> gets<00:05:24.229> stressed<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:25.100> gets

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
Button when it gets stressed it gets

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.370 
Button when it gets stressed it gets
younger<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.360> will<00:05:26.479> go<00:05:26.810> back<00:05:26.990> into<00:05:27.260> its

of<00:05:30.080> thankful<00:05:30.350> and<00:05:30.740> then<00:05:30.950> when<00:05:31.130> when<00:05:31.550> danger<00:05:32.030> is

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
of thankful and then when when danger is

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.909 
of thankful and then when when danger is
not<00:05:32.419> all<00:05:32.539> about<00:05:32.840> anymore<00:05:33.289> when<00:05:33.620> it's<00:05:33.770> got

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
not all about anymore when it's got

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.770 
not all about anymore when it's got
through<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.190> get<00:05:34.370> either<00:05:34.490> like<00:05:34.700> oh<00:05:34.850> hey<00:05:35.300> what's

through to get either like oh hey what's
up<00:05:35.960> I'm<00:05:36.200> ready<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.979> check<00:05:37.280> all<00:05:37.490> those<00:05:37.700> things

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
up I'm ready to check all those things

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.640 
up I'm ready to check all those things
again<00:05:38.240> another<00:05:38.660> fun<00:05:38.870> fact<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.200> that<00:05:39.229> jellyfish

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
again another fun fact is that jellyfish

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.560 
again another fun fact is that jellyfish
don't<00:05:39.919> actually<00:05:40.100> have<00:05:40.430> a<00:05:40.669> respiratory<00:05:41.000> system

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
don't actually have a respiratory system

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.480 
don't actually have a respiratory system
a<00:05:41.720> jellyfish<00:05:42.080> your<00:05:42.229> skin<00:05:42.470> tissue<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.919> so<00:05:43.220> thin

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
a jellyfish your skin tissue is so thin

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.850 
a jellyfish your skin tissue is so thin
that<00:05:43.669> it<00:05:43.820> can<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.229> absolute<00:05:45.229> from<00:05:45.470> diffusion

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
that it can get absolute from diffusion

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.969 
that it can get absolute from diffusion
all<00:05:46.700> right<00:05:46.850> yeah<00:05:47.120> there<00:05:47.390> is<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.630> jellyfish<00:05:48.380> that

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
all right yeah there is a jellyfish that

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.529 
all right yeah there is a jellyfish that
is<00:05:49.130> over<00:05:49.460> 90<00:05:50.060> feet<00:05:50.300> long<00:05:50.800> that<00:05:51.800> is<00:05:52.220> longer<00:05:52.729> than

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
is over 90 feet long that is longer than

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.810 
is over 90 feet long that is longer than
a<00:05:53.600> blue<00:05:53.900> lip<00:05:54.500> it<00:05:54.650> whale<00:05:54.889> that's<00:05:55.490> a<00:05:55.610> big-ass

a blue lip it whale that's a big-ass

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.730 
a blue lip it whale that's a big-ass
jellyfish<00:05:56.389> this<00:05:57.139> is<00:05:57.260> big-ass

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
jellyfish this is big-ass

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.010
