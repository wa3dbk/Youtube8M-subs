00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.040 
that I say what would be real would be
like<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.080> Totoro<00:02:13.650> stuff<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.540> let<00:02:15.750> me<00:02:15.810> go<00:02:15.930> back

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
like the Totoro stuff and let me go back

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.809 
like the Totoro stuff and let me go back
here<00:02:16.319> again<00:02:17.269> like<00:02:18.269> these<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:19.140> these<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.040> fine

here again like these are these are fine

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
