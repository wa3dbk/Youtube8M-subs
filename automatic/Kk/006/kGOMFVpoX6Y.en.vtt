torch underneath it a block behind it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.480 
torch underneath it a block behind it
this<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.470> where<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.680> getting<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:31.979> sound<00:01:32.220> from

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this is where it's getting it sound from

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
this is where it's getting it sound from
too<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.030> making<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> sound<00:01:33.659> that's

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
too so it's making the sound that's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
too so it's making the sound that's
going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.170> undert<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.400> red<00:01:35.610> stone

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
going to make undert and the red stone

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.719 
going to make undert and the red stone
on<00:01:35.909> top<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.780> makes<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> random<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.610> will

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
on top it makes it random so this will

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.390 
on top it makes it random so this will
just<00:01:38.880> randomly<00:01:39.119> go<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.780> every<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.320> often<00:01:40.470> see

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
just randomly go off every so often see

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
just randomly go off every so often see
I<00:01:41.610> didn't<00:01:41.880> hit<00:01:41.970> anything<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.869> just

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I didn't hit anything and it's just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
I didn't hit anything and it's just
going<00:01:43.229> off<00:01:43.439> again<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.790> cool

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
going off again so that's kind of cool

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
going off again so that's kind of cool
and<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.630> do<00:01:45.780> especially<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.259> you're
