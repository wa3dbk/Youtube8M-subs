Hello! Welcome back! 
In this video I'll show you how to create a
eclairs, using polymer clay.
It is a typical oblong french pastry!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.480
I tried to realize them as realistic as possible, 
using a dry pastels and icing.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:50.360

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:08.800
Mix a light colored dough: I used white fimo soft and white fimo effect translucent (in equal proportions) and a little of ochre fimo classic.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:36.720
Create a cylinder of a diameter of 5 mm.
Cui it into a 1.5 cm long cylinder.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:02:36.360
Pinch the ends with your fingers, as shown in the video.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:03:12.600
Texture the doug with a foil or sandpaper.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:04:10.520
Color the dough with dry pastels: light yellow, ocre, light brown and brown.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:05:02.160
Apply the icing: I create the polymer clay icing, using fimo liquid plus fimo in different colors (chocolate and white, for example).
You can decorate each eclairs with sand, glitter, microbeads and whatever you want!
Then bake.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.280
Once cooled off, seal with glaze.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:17.640
