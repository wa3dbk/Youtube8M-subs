different<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.980> fact<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.610> they<00:00:32.669> do

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
different in fact that they do

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.780 
different in fact that they do
incorporate<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.420> progressive<00:00:33.989> lens<00:00:34.760> what<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
incorporate a progressive lens what I

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.340 
incorporate a progressive lens what I
mean<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> magnification

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
mean by that is that the magnification

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.660 
mean by that is that the magnification
actually<00:00:37.649> varies<00:00:38.070> depending<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.460> what

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
actually varies depending on what

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.330 
actually varies depending on what
portion<00:00:39.149> Elaine's<00:00:39.420> you're<00:00:39.540> looking<00:00:39.780> through

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
portion Elaine's you're looking through

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.110 
portion Elaine's you're looking through
so<00:00:41.340> for<00:00:41.489> example<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:41.940> gold<00:00:42.210> pair<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so for example in this gold pair this is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
so for example in this gold pair this is
a<00:00:45.149> three<00:00:45.480> dr.<00:00:45.870> pair<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.469> many<00:00:46.620> fame<00:00:46.829> tues<00:00:47.070> and

a three dr. pair of many fame tues and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.630 
a three dr. pair of many fame tues and
the<00:00:48.120> 3dr<00:00:48.510> magnification<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> team<00:00:50.190> that

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the 3dr magnification is a team that

the frames are quite stylish and again

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.999 
the frames are quite stylish and again
and<00:01:16.200> come<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.409> different<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:16.979> different

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and come in different two different

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.550 
and come in different two different
colors<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.729> nice<00:01:18.330> open<00:01:18.570> saddle<00:01:19.080> bridge<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.409> well

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
colors a nice open saddle bridge as well

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
colors a nice open saddle bridge as well
that<00:01:20.189> allows<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.729> comfortable

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that allows it to be very comfortable

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.100 
that allows it to be very comfortable
when<00:01:21.600> wearing<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> show<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> how

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
when wearing it so when I show you how

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.620 
when wearing it so when I show you how
they're<00:01:25.290> used<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.009> they're<00:01:26.220> used<00:01:26.369> for

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
they're used and what they're used for

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.920 
they're used and what they're used for
and<00:01:27.630> I'll<00:01:27.750> grab<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> gun<00:01:28.439> metal<00:01:28.710> frame<00:01:28.950> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
and I'll grab the gun metal frame and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.080 
and I'll grab the gun metal frame and
typically<00:01:30.930> these<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.170> used<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.640> half<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
typically these are used in a half I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.690 
typically these are used in a half I
format<00:01:33.630> like<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.220> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
format like that if you want to you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.249 
format like that if you want to you
could<00:01:35.880> actually<00:01:36.060> slide<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.840> nose<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
could actually slide up your nose and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
could actually slide up your nose and
look<00:01:37.350> through<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> full<00:01:38.280> field<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.210> for

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
look through the full field but for

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.609 
look through the full field but for
demonstration<00:01:39.479> purposes<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.590> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.280 
demonstration purposes I'm just going to
keep<00:01:40.740> that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
keep that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.270 
keep that
I<00:01:41.320> level<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:43.990> mini<00:01:44.470> frame<00:01:44.680> 2<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:44.920> useful

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
I level now the mini frame 2 is useful

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.590 
I level now the mini frame 2 is useful
lots<00:01:45.550> of<00:01:45.610> different<00:01:45.880> tasks<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.480> are

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
lots of different tasks and are

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.960 
lots of different tasks and are
typically<00:01:46.870> used<00:01:46.930> by<00:01:47.410> patients<00:01:48.190> who<00:01:48.460> need<00:01:48.490> a

typically used by patients who need a

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.480 
typically used by patients who need a
little<00:01:49.930> extra<00:01:50.050> magnification<00:01:50.800> so<00:01:51.100> typically

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
little extra magnification so typically

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.730 
little extra magnification so typically
it's<00:01:51.640> presby<00:01:52.030> oats<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.450> one<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.500> tasks

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
it's presby oats and one of the tasks

keyboard for example I'm going to look

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.920 
keyboard for example I'm going to look

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
look at the computer monitor on look

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.220 
look at the computer monitor on look
through<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.340> center<00:02:39.580> part<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.420> look<00:02:41.050> for

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
through the center part and look for

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.360 
through the center part and look for
their<00:02:41.350> way<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.040> look<00:02:42.130> through<00:02:42.310> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
their way I'm going to look through the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.670 
their way I'm going to look through the
top<00:02:42.580> portion<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.959> makes<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:44.290> comfortable

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
top portion so makes it very comfortable

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.790 
top portion so makes it very comfortable

frame to progressive readers is actually

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.500

using a cell phone and for many
presbyopia<00:02:53.430> buttons<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:55.230> cell<00:02:56.230> phone<00:02:56.260> are

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
presbyopia buttons on the cell phone are

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.840 
presbyopia buttons on the cell phone are
small<00:02:56.830> enough<00:02:56.860> but<00:02:57.310> if<00:02:57.670> you're<00:02:57.790> visiting

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
small enough but if you're visiting

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.550 
small enough but if you're visiting
websites<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.570> can<00:02:58.600> see<00:02:58.840> in<00:02:58.930> some<00:02:59.110> cases<00:02:59.350> or

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
websites you can see in some cases or

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.060 
websites you can see in some cases or
emails<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.340> text<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.730> very<00:03:00.820> very<00:03:01.090> small<00:03:02.070> but

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
emails the text is very very small but

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.800 
emails the text is very very small but
in<00:03:03.250> some<00:03:03.400> cases<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.910> text<00:03:04.180> will<00:03:04.299> vary<00:03:04.540> and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
in some cases the text will vary and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.930 
in some cases the text will vary and
this<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> good<00:03:05.500> example<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:06.310> email<00:03:06.519> has<00:03:06.910> a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
this is a good example this email has a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.240 
this is a good example this email has a
very<00:03:07.269> small<00:03:07.480> text<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:08.049> but<00:03:08.620> larger<00:03:09.070> text

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
very small text here but larger text

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.729 
very small text here but larger text
over<00:03:09.549> here<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.840> I<00:03:10.870> may<00:03:11.110> need<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.380> have<00:03:11.530> more

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
over here and so I may need to have more

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.890 
over here and so I may need to have more
magnification<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.640> read<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.269> smallest<00:03:13.600> print

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
magnification to read the smallest print

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.930 
magnification to read the smallest print
and<00:03:14.470> less<00:03:14.739> over<00:03:15.130> here<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.459> what<00:03:15.580> I'll<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.790> with

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
and less over here so what I'll do with

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.699 
and less over here so what I'll do with
the<00:03:16.030> mini<00:03:16.180> frame<00:03:16.390> tues<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:17.230> actually<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> look

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
the mini frame tues is actually I look

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.840 
the mini frame tues is actually I look
through<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.950> lowest<00:03:18.220> part<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.670> lens

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
through the lowest part of the lens

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.729 
through the lowest part of the lens
through<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.450> small<00:03:19.750> print<00:03:19.959> but<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.560> can

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
through the small print but I can

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.440 
through the small print but I can
actually<00:03:20.860> look<00:03:21.580> for<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:21.850> top<00:03:22.060> part<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
actually look for the top part of the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.580 
actually look for the top part of the
lens<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:23.380> read<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.280> larger<00:03:24.610> print

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
lens to read the larger print

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.350 
lens to read the larger print
another<00:03:27.129> application<00:03:27.550> from<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.030> mini<00:03:28.150> frame

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
another application from the mini frame

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.290 
another application from the mini frame
to<00:03:28.569> progressive<00:03:29.019> leaders<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.680> reading<00:03:30.069> a<00:03:30.129> menu

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
to progressive leaders is reading a menu

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.009 
to progressive leaders is reading a menu
so<00:03:31.300> we<00:03:31.390> actually<00:03:31.510> haven't<00:03:31.780> have<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:31.989> menu<00:03:32.230> here

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
so we actually haven't have a menu here
