00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
tape around it again this was a really

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.790 
tape around it again this was a really
good<00:02:29.680> way<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.070> save<00:02:30.490> some<00:02:30.820> space<00:02:31.470> because<00:02:32.470> if

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
good way to save some space because if

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920 
good way to save some space because if
you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:32.980> imagine<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.760> those<00:02:34.150> little<00:02:34.390> drawers

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
you can imagine all those little drawers

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.160 
you can imagine all those little drawers
there<00:02:35.200> or<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.580> whole<00:02:36.880> entire<00:02:37.090> area<00:02:37.720> was<00:02:37.900> just

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
there or this whole entire area was just

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.240 
there or this whole entire area was just
little<00:02:38.350> drawers<00:02:39.570> also<00:02:40.570> another<00:02:41.080> cool<00:02:41.470> idea<00:02:41.860> I

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
little drawers also another cool idea I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.130 
little drawers also another cool idea I
had<00:02:42.970> was<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:45.070> little<00:02:45.370> thingy<00:02:45.760> here<00:02:46.180> where

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
had was this little thingy here where

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.990 
had was this little thingy here where
I'm<00:02:47.230> actually<00:02:47.620> storing<00:02:48.310> my<00:02:48.520> make<00:02:48.700> my

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
I'm actually storing my make my

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.830 
I'm actually storing my make my
lipsticks<00:02:49.420> now<00:02:51.360> looks<00:02:52.360> better<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.720> they're

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
lipsticks now looks better if they're

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.540 
lipsticks now looks better if they're
all<00:02:52.900> going<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.230> same<00:02:53.290> direction<00:02:53.470> but<00:02:54.160> you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
all going in the same direction but you

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.880 
all going in the same direction but you
know<00:02:54.670> what<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:54.850> mean<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:56.080> actually<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:56.770> a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
know what I mean it's actually just a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.530 
know what I mean it's actually just a
pillbox<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.930> regular<00:02:58.930> pillbox<00:02:59.440> I<00:03:00.060> took<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.300> top

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
pillbox a regular pillbox I took the top

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.300 
pillbox a regular pillbox I took the top
off<00:03:01.720> of<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.560> said<00:03:02.800> Monday<00:03:03.100> Tuesday

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.840 
supply also they're just little wire
mesh<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:41.050> one's<00:03:41.260> plastic<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.220> just<00:03:42.460> added

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
mesh this one's plastic but just added

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.870 
mesh this one's plastic but just added
some<00:03:42.880> duct<00:03:43.180> tape<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:46.540> magnet<00:03:47.670> frame<00:03:48.670> has

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
some duct tape this magnet frame has

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.460 
some duct tape this magnet frame has
been<00:03:49.030> doing<00:03:49.240> pretty<00:03:49.360> good<00:03:49.600> every<00:03:50.080> now<00:03:50.260> and

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
been doing pretty good every now and

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.220 
been doing pretty good every now and
then<00:03:50.560> want<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:50.980> fall<00:03:51.160> off<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.750> I've<00:03:52.870> got<00:03:53.080> it

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
then want to fall off so I've got it

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.950 
then want to fall off so I've got it
over<00:03:53.680> here<00:03:53.880> but<00:03:54.880> I<00:03:55.120> guess<00:03:55.330> it<00:03:55.450> just<00:03:55.480> depends<00:03:55.870> on

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
over here but I guess it just depends on

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.990 
over here but I guess it just depends on
the<00:03:56.020> strength<00:03:56.410> you<00:03:56.560> use<00:03:56.860> they<00:03:57.640> don't<00:03:57.820> fall<00:03:57.970> off

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
the strength you use they don't fall off

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.400 
the strength you use they don't fall off
like<00:03:58.240> all<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.540> time<00:03:58.720> just<00:03:58.870> every<00:03:59.140> now<00:03:59.260> and

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
like all the time just every now and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.740 
like all the time just every now and
then<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.530> come<00:03:59.800> in<00:03:59.920> there's<00:04:00.220> one<00:04:00.490> sitting<00:04:01.420> here

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
then I come in there's one sitting here

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.560 
then I come in there's one sitting here
so<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:01.960> know<00:04:02.110> what<00:04:02.320> happened<00:04:02.710> to<00:04:02.740> fell<00:04:02.950> off<00:04:03.570> also

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
so I know what happened to fell off also

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.530 
so I know what happened to fell off also
what<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.350> did<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.920> my<00:04:06.070> full-length<00:04:06.400> mirror<00:04:07.020> is

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
