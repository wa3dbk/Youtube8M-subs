 spring as opposed to subjecting us 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.799
 natural blush but look pale 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 under the bright March sun at all 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.370
 nobody wants so today we 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 talk about blush about one of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.820
 the most important cosmetic tools of each 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.619
 women with which you can 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.840
 artfully correct facial features 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 hide some defects and of course 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.560
 delays and checks and creams during us 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 light texture will help in this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.199
 Couldn't be better and 1 market today he wanted 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.939
 put come homemade 01 very 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 beautiful and absolutely universal 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.130
 blush perfect for everyday 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 make up 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.760
 easy to apply texture them just 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.290
 great and do i would say that on 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 four minutes for like six hours later 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.399
 starts to fade and demands that you them 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.500
 corrected but as for the very 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.480
 subject in companions he chops and much 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.750
 brighter but when shading on tulle cheek 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.579
 muffled and looks more modest like this 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.039
 she looks shading weight 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.750
 making these random hands doesn't want words 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.670
 show how each of these shades 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.199
 looks without shading saturation 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.350
 texture pigments but also just for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.350
 comparisons 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 second blush that's such a baby from max 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.400
 factor of barbel barbel 7 soft boots 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.020
 case 1 time looking at this light 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.420
 it gets scary and its bright 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.790
 screaming and rich red 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.680
 I start to shade it on the pike all 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.990
 this red goes away and ostend such 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.640
 a light transparent blush had to be taken 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.229
 products from the bath several times to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.149
 he became more visible on his face 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.039
 as for stamina, I would not say 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.600
 that they are very persistent after all cream 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.880
 blush is more suitable for owners 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.409
 dry skin on my skin they started 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.630
 roll down and behind a very oily texture 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.190
 I would say that they are the fattest of all 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.960
 today's blush so persistence 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:57.630
 leave the pen even with a minus 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.630
 what shade 07 looks like is shading 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.840
 and as you can see when applying the shading on 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.790
 faces 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 this pigment saturation disappears 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.770
 And now straight thighs won again 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.690
 I will focus but comfortable bottles with 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.390
 pepper and a tight-fitting lid 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.950
 allowing you to open yourself blush 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.990
 have a very delicate peach shade 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 which on the skin looks the same as in 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.710
 flakonchike little dry texture 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 which perhaps can gain some 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.330
 peeling however the product is shaded 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.770
 very easily also pleased and resilience 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.040
 the market lasted all day without 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.930
 interventions forgot to tell you about them 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.070
 haze which gives even more 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.070
 the naturalness of Rubens 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.240
 gently natural blush pretty

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.020
 very long gentle and pleasant texture 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.540
 which is easily shaded to 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.580
 fingertips then kita and with a finger in 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.620
 In principle, they are of that tincture although the end 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.660
 day at first a little crawl but after 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.210
 small intervention without basis

 shone beautiful delicate blush they

 quite easy to lay down if we are hard 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:57.410
 go too far here so the product looks without 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.410
 feathering is very gentle naturally 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.000

 which is very comfortable to carry around 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.030
 beautiful shade of the jar which 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.430
 a little less saturated falls on the face 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.380
 the texture is pretty wise that allows 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.240
 easy to shade the product these blush 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.160
 very under this girls dry skin and but 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.230
 a few minutes after applying they 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.030
 get a matte finish because 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.320
 the blush is very saturated is transferred with 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.330

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.830
 natural 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.690
 the beginnings of the blush the whole day like this 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.790
 look immediately from the jar now you

 You can compare all shades and textures and 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.140
 maybe choose something for yourself 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.930
 attack on this looks like a salt after 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.930
 feathering 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.730
