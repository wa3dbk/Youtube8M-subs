00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
cuz it's what's that brown go this is a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.720 
cuz it's what's that brown go this is a
solder<00:00:51.520> paste<00:00:51.610> or<00:00:51.970> flux<00:00:52.330> yeah<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:54.250> resin

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
solder paste or flux yeah it's resin

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.369 
solder paste or flux yeah it's resin
like<00:00:55.720> a<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:57.010> sort<00:00:57.220> of<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.370> tree<00:00:57.610> resin<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
like a some sort of a tree resin it

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.229 
like a some sort of a tree resin it
helps<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.770> solder<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.640> glue

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
helps the solder like glue

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.280 
helps the solder like glue
no<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.739> helps<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.100> solder<00:01:03.340> flow<00:01:03.730> into<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
no it helps the solder flow into the

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.930 
no it helps the solder flow into the
little<00:01:05.530> cracks<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:05.979> crevices<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.820> are

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
little cracks and crevices that are

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.130 
little cracks and crevices that are
created<00:01:07.479> by<00:01:07.509> all<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.930> little<00:01:08.140> wires<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.930> so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
created by all the little wires and so

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.580 
created by all the little wires and so
and<00:01:11.410> we<00:01:12.399> I<00:01:12.729> have<00:01:13.180> two<00:01:13.479> different<00:01:13.810> kinds<00:01:14.200> this

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
and we I have two different kinds this

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.260 
and we I have two different kinds this
kind<00:01:14.920> just<00:01:15.130> happens<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.580> be<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.850> stinkier

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
kind just happens to be the stinkier

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:26.940 
kind just happens to be the stinkier
kind<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.979> I'm<00:01:18.070> sorry

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.860 

this<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:27.610> not<00:01:27.850> turning<00:01:28.330> out<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.450> way<00:01:28.659> that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
this is not turning out the way that

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.450 
this is not turning out the way that
it's<00:01:29.020> supposed<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.500> it's<00:01:30.010> supposed<00:01:30.250> to<00:01:30.340> be<00:01:30.430> a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
it's supposed to it's supposed to be a

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's supposed to it's supposed to be a
lot<00:01:30.610> easier<00:01:30.640> than<00:01:31.180> this<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.500> keep

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
lot easier than this but I keep

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.980 
lot easier than this but I keep
forgetting<00:01:33.070> things<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.850> my<00:01:34.510> heat<00:01:34.659> shrink

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
forgetting things and my heat shrink

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.219 
forgetting things and my heat shrink
disappears<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.970> now<00:01:37.000> I've<00:01:37.300> got<00:01:37.540> an<00:01:37.960> issue

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
disappears and now I've got an issue

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.490 
disappears and now I've got an issue

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
because I'm all ready got the the solder

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.660 
because I'm all ready got the the solder
in<00:01:44.890> my<00:01:45.130> wires<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.540> now<00:01:47.290> I<00:01:47.680> need<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:48.130> make<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> new

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
in my wires and now I need to make a new

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.380 
in my wires and now I need to make a new
connection<00:01:52.470> hard<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:54.550> right<00:01:54.820> there<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.180> see

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
connection hard that right there you see

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.640 
connection hard that right there you see
how<00:01:55.479> I<00:01:55.750> don't<00:01:55.900> know<00:01:55.960> if<00:01:56.080> you<00:01:56.170> guys<00:01:56.290> can<00:01:56.470> tell

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
this but these wires are all stuck

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.370 
this but these wires are all stuck
together<00:01:58.780> now<00:01:59.140> because<00:01:59.590> I<00:02:00.160> used<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.460> flux<00:02:01.380> no

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
together now because I used that flux no

snap hard just then uh-huh it's cuz the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.330 
snap hard just then uh-huh it's cuz the
solder<00:02:07.780> sucks<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.440> into<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.830> wire<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.190> make<00:02:09.280> a

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
solder sucks up into the wire to make a

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.949 
solder sucks up into the wire to make a
better<00:02:09.580> connection<00:02:09.880> there<00:02:10.539> we<00:02:10.630> go

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
better connection there we go

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.600

okay<00:02:53.739> yeah<00:02:54.360> now<00:02:55.360> what<00:02:56.110> my<00:02:56.260> plan<00:02:56.620> was<00:02:56.650> was<00:02:57.579> to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
okay yeah now what my plan was was to

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.660 
okay yeah now what my plan was was to
superglue<00:02:58.720> this<00:02:59.370> to<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:03.430> that

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
superglue this to that like so so that

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.449 
superglue this to that like so so that
we<00:03:04.600> could<00:03:04.750> put<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.049> into<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> case

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
we could put it into the case

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.750 
we could put it into the case
so<00:03:06.820> heat<00:03:07.780> shrink<00:03:08.730> boop-boop<00:03:09.730> boop-boop

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
so heat shrink boop-boop boop-boop

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.300 
so heat shrink boop-boop boop-boop
boop-boop<00:03:10.269> while<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.320> huge<00:03:11.620> flame<00:03:11.920> admit

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
boop-boop while it's a huge flame admit

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.550 
boop-boop while it's a huge flame admit
he<00:03:12.640> trunk<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.079> usually<00:03:14.079> we<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.320> heat<00:03:14.530> gun

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
he trunk it usually we use a heat gun

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.890 
he trunk it usually we use a heat gun
for<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.250> don't<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.060> cute<00:03:16.239> gun<00:03:16.450> I'm

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
for that I don't have a cute gun I'm

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.520 
for that I don't have a cute gun I'm
gonna<00:03:17.049> later<00:03:17.820> test<00:03:18.820> out<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.150> superglue<00:03:19.570> there

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
gonna later test out the superglue there

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.660 
gonna later test out the superglue there
it<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.829> super<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.940> gluey<00:03:23.190> put<00:03:24.190> some<00:03:24.340> superglue

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it is super and gluey put some superglue

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.490 
it is super and gluey put some superglue
in<00:03:24.850> there

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
in there

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.030 
in there
flip<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> over<00:03:27.690> put<00:03:28.690> some<00:03:28.870> superglue

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
flip it over put some superglue

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:42.820 
flip it over put some superglue
in<00:03:32.040> there<00:03:33.140> maybe<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.290> little<00:03:34.350> bit<00:03:34.650> right<00:03:34.830> here

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.060 

it's<00:03:43.190> just<00:03:43.400> plastic<00:03:43.850> girl<00:03:44.120> come<00:03:44.300> on<00:03:45.070> don't

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
it's just plastic girl come on don't

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.190 
it's just plastic girl come on don't
mind<00:03:46.370> me<00:03:47.230> no<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:48.470> can't<00:03:48.770> see<00:03:49.010> what's<00:03:49.190> going<00:03:49.490> on

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
mind me no you can't see what's going on

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.600 
mind me no you can't see what's going on
but<00:03:51.200> I'm<00:03:51.320> just<00:03:51.470> trying<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.890> superglue<00:03:52.280> this

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
but I'm just trying to superglue this

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:02.350 
but I'm just trying to superglue this
switch<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:57.550> perfect<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:59.590> Jen<00:04:01.210> actually<00:04:02.210> had

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
switch in perfect so Jen actually had

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.060 
switch in perfect so Jen actually had
the<00:04:02.450> much<00:04:02.600> better<00:04:02.840> idea<00:04:03.020> of<00:04:03.230> putting<00:04:03.890> the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
the much better idea of putting the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.680 
the much better idea of putting the
whole<00:04:04.100> switch<00:04:04.550> through<00:04:04.850> because<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.330> glue<00:04:05.510> is

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
whole switch through because the glue is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.350 
whole switch through because the glue is
messing<00:04:06.080> up<00:04:06.170> my<00:04:06.200> switching<00:04:06.680> mechanism<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:08.150> now

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
messing up my switching mechanism so now

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.090 
messing up my switching mechanism so now
if<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.900> glue<00:04:09.110> it<00:04:09.200> in<00:04:09.290> place<00:04:09.320> here

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
if I glue it in place here

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.230 
if I glue it in place here
it<00:04:10.760> won't<00:04:11.150> know<00:04:11.930> who<00:04:12.140> will<00:04:12.260> get<00:04:12.410> it<00:04:12.530> my<00:04:12.620> switch

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
it won't know who will get it my switch

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.640 
it won't know who will get it my switch
it's<00:04:14.240> good<00:04:14.710> yay<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:17.540> was<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.780> lot<00:04:18.049> harder<00:04:18.080> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
it's good yay that was a lot harder and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.170 
it's good yay that was a lot harder and
more<00:04:18.799> annoying<00:04:19.040> that<00:04:19.280> I<00:04:19.370> was<00:04:19.520> expecting<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.150> to

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
more annoying that I was expecting it to
