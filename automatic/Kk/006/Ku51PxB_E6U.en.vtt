to<00:03:02.560> go<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:03.040> New<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.430> in<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> 26th<00:03:04.360> minute<00:03:04.420> god

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
to go to New up in the 26th minute god

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.030 
to go to New up in the 26th minute god
knows<00:03:04.959> what<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.200> keep<00:03:05.380> was<00:03:05.530> doing<00:03:05.770> he<00:03:05.830> didn't

knows what is keep was doing he didn't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.920 
knows what is keep was doing he didn't
even<00:03:06.100> put<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.490> put<00:03:07.000> in<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.209> dive<00:03:07.420> there<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.780> try

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
even put in put in a dive there to try

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.390 
even put in put in a dive there to try
and<00:03:07.959> say<00:03:08.170> they<00:03:08.290> could<00:03:08.410> easily<00:03:08.530> easily<00:03:08.770> dive<00:03:09.160> to
