really<00:02:34.640> interesting<00:02:35.060> layers<00:02:35.270> so<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.290> can<00:02:36.500> start

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
really interesting layers so I can start

really interesting layers so I can start
with<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.070> most<00:02:37.310> densely<00:02:38.170> I'm<00:02:39.170> running

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
with the most densely I'm running

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.680 
with the most densely I'm running
through<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.130> that's<00:02:40.340> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> give<00:02:41.450> me<00:02:41.480> that

we'll just use my hands perfect and then

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.420 
we'll just use my hands perfect and then
i'm<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.960> lay<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.320> mask<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.800> their<00:03:17.100> field

rough

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.730 

I'm

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.670 

what<00:03:28.190> thats<00:03:28.400> 20<00:03:28.790> give<00:03:28.970> me<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:30.080> positive

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.430 

of<00:03:33.069> that<00:03:33.250> word

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
of that word

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.110 
of that word
and<00:03:35.830> then<00:03:36.100> it<00:03:36.220> will<00:03:36.310> pull<00:03:36.580> some<00:03:36.760> of<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.940> pain

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
and then it will pull some of the pain

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.870 
and then it will pull some of the pain
up<00:03:37.300> with<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:39.130> just<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.640> almost

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
up with it and it just looks almost

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.690 
up with it and it just looks almost
looks<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.180> marble<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.710> bullion<00:03:42.370> used

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
looks like marble it just bullion used

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.320 
looks like marble it just bullion used
on<00:03:42.970> texture<00:03:43.450> in<00:03:43.540> there<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:45.610> can<00:03:45.880> also<00:03:46.030> do

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
on texture in there and so I can also do

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.530 
on texture in there and so I can also do
it<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.510> standard<00:03:46.960> way<00:03:47.080> play<00:03:47.500> down<00:03:47.830> pain

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
it the standard way play down pain

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.690 
it the standard way play down pain
or<00:03:50.540> paint<00:03:51.170> first<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.650> wrap<00:03:51.830> and<00:03:52.070> by<00:03:52.460> doing

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
or paint first and wrap and by doing

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.200 
or paint first and wrap and by doing
that<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.240> can<00:03:53.510> build<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.920> same<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.400> over<00:03:56.090> and

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
that I can build the same it over and

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.530 
that I can build the same it over and
over<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:57.080> get<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.320> very<00:03:57.590> sophisticated

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
over and get a very sophisticated

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.880 
over and get a very sophisticated
you<00:04:00.079> can<00:04:00.260> combine<00:04:00.439> it<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:00.799> this<00:04:02.680> maybe<00:04:03.680> your

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
you can combine it with this maybe your

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.649 
you can combine it with this maybe your
community<00:04:05.739> together<00:04:06.739> or<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.459> keep<00:04:07.909> keep

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
community together or just keep keep
