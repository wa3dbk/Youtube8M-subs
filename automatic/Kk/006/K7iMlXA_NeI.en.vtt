be able to get a proper shot in so that

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.770 
be able to get a proper shot in so that
was<00:01:34.920> half<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.509> sort

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
was half time you can see we were sort

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.060 
was half time you can see we were sort
of<00:01:36.869> dominating<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> straight<00:01:38.040> off

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of dominating with that straight off

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
of dominating with that straight off
that<00:01:38.490> before<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.240> even<00:01:39.390> went<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> second

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that before we even went into the second

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
that before we even went into the second
half<00:01:40.500> my<00:01:41.070> opponent<00:01:41.520> decide<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.150> rage<00:01:42.329> quit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
half my opponent decide to to rage quit

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.810 
half my opponent decide to to rage quit
so<00:01:42.899> yeah<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> means<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.040> game<00:01:44.280> won't<00:01:44.549> count

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
so yeah that means this game won't count

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.149 
so yeah that means this game won't count

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.360 
defenders in a row I tried to cut him
but<00:02:51.900> his<00:02:51.989> defender<00:02:52.380> just<00:02:52.620> blocked<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> off<00:02:53.100> and

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
but his defender just blocked it off and

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.920 
but his defender just blocked it off and
I<00:02:53.489> straight<00:02:53.790> after<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> referee<00:02:54.660> blew

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
I straight after that the referee blew

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.870 
I straight after that the referee blew
on<00:02:55.110> his<00:02:55.140> whistle<00:02:55.650> as<00:02:55.800> well<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.519> go<00:02:56.610> into<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
on his whistle as well so we go into the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.640 
on his whistle as well so we go into the
second<00:02:57.180> off<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.540> after<00:02:58.019> two<00:02:58.140> minutes<00:02:58.290> already

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
second off and after two minutes already

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.650 
second off and after two minutes already
he<00:02:58.860> got<00:02:59.040> himself<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.550> goal<00:02:59.790> back<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.269> within

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
he got himself a goal back so within

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.290 
he got himself a goal back so within
like<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.140> few<00:03:01.560> chances<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.280> guess<00:03:02.489> he<00:03:02.790> he<00:03:03.150> got

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
like a few chances I guess he he got

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.820 
like a few chances I guess he he got
himself<00:03:03.420> completely<00:03:04.110> back<00:03:04.290> into<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.650> game<00:03:04.769> I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
himself completely back into the game I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.100 
himself completely back into the game I
made<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.220> all<00:03:05.370> even<00:03:05.760> which<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> bit

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
made it all even which was a bit

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.870 
made it all even which was a bit
annoying<00:03:07.350> especially<00:03:07.560> since<00:03:08.130> we<00:03:08.280> were<00:03:08.459> like

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
annoying especially since we were like

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.820 
annoying especially since we were like
two<00:03:09.150> girls<00:03:09.420> off<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> tried<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.290> sort<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.650> get

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
two girls off so I tried to sort of get

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.320 
two girls off so I tried to sort of get
back<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.370> game<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.550> nice<00:03:11.850> header<00:03:12.120> there

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
back into the game a nice header there

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.910 
back into the game a nice header there
after<00:03:12.600> some<00:03:12.750> nice<00:03:12.930> stuff<00:03:13.140> from<00:03:13.350> her<00:03:13.530> from<00:03:13.709> Bill

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
after some nice stuff from her from Bill

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.680 
after some nice stuff from her from Bill
but<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.550> just<00:03:14.730> went<00:03:14.940> white<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.150> think<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.570> was

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
but it just went white I think it was

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.240 
but it just went white I think it was
easy<00:03:15.870> go<00:03:16.019> with<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.260> header<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.100> would

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
easy go with the header then I would

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.250 
easy go with the header then I would
continue<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> 68th<00:03:18.690> minute<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.079> nice

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
continue on in the 68th minute the nice

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.990 
continue on in the 68th minute the nice
run<00:03:19.500> there<00:03:19.680> from<00:03:19.890> bill<00:03:20.070> cuts<00:03:20.400> inside<00:03:20.670> with<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
run there from bill cuts inside with the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
run there from bill cuts inside with the
fake<00:03:21.180> shot<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.600> we<00:03:21.840> do<00:03:22.049> hit<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.350> post<00:03:22.560> very

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
fake shot and we do hit the post very

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.220 
fake shot and we do hit the post very
very<00:03:23.400> unlucky<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.420> also<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> second<00:03:25.140> half

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
very unlucky so also in the second half

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.410 
very unlucky so also in the second half
we<00:03:25.470> created<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:26.040> lot<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.310> chance<00:03:26.549> but<00:03:26.910> we<00:03:27.239> were

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
we created a lot of chance but we were

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.910 
we created a lot of chance but we were
just<00:03:27.690> really<00:03:27.930> really<00:03:28.049> unlucky<00:03:28.440> when<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.829> came

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
just really really unlucky when it came

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.160 
just really really unlucky when it came
to<00:03:29.130> finishing<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> 78th<00:03:30.750> minute<00:03:30.780> he

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
to finishing and in the 78th minute he

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.250 
to finishing and in the 78th minute he
cut<00:03:31.440> himself<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.950> go<00:03:32.160> back<00:03:32.400> to<00:03:32.430> make<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.570> 3-2<00:03:34.079> in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
cut himself a go back to make it 3-2 in

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.410 
cut himself a go back to make it 3-2 in
his<00:03:34.470> favor<00:03:34.680> actually<00:03:35.130> with<00:03:35.310> Chavez<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.970> that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
his favor actually with Chavez so that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.180 
his favor actually with Chavez so that
was<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.570> bit<00:03:36.780> annoying<00:03:37.049> especially<00:03:37.620> if<00:03:38.130> you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
was a bit annoying especially if you

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.740 
was a bit annoying especially if you
consider<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.700> were<00:03:38.850> two<00:03:39.060> girls<00:03:39.329> up<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
consider we were two girls up at the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.449 
consider we were two girls up at the
start<00:03:39.989> of<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.170> game<00:03:40.440> quite<00:03:40.680> early<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.070> but

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
start of this game quite early on but

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.190 
start of this game quite early on but
anyway<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> 90th<00:03:42.570> minute<00:03:42.630> we<00:03:42.930> had<00:03:43.019> one

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
anyway in the 90th minute we had one

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.620 
anyway in the 90th minute we had one
more<00:03:43.350> chance<00:03:43.410> again<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> garret<00:03:44.880> bill<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.390> on

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
more chance again a garret bill going on

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.940 
more chance again a garret bill going on
a<00:03:45.660> run<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.049> already<00:03:46.380> had<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> chance<00:03:46.709> within

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
a run we already had a chance within

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.770 
a run we already had a chance within
where<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.250> hit<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.519> post<00:03:47.700> but<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.269> 90th

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
where we hit the post but then in a 90th

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.630 
where we hit the post but then in a 90th
minute<00:03:48.810> we<00:03:49.230> finally<00:03:49.739> get<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:49.980> go<00:03:50.100> with<00:03:50.370> him<00:03:50.489> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
minute we finally get to go with him to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.970 
minute we finally get to go with him to
make<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.090> 3<00:03:51.360> 3<00:03:51.660> which<00:03:52.260> means<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.650> had<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.860> go

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
make it 3 3 which means we had to go

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.039 
make it 3 3 which means we had to go
into<00:03:53.190> extra<00:03:53.640> time<00:03:53.670> but<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.060> think<00:03:54.360> we<00:03:54.600> we

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
into extra time but I think we we

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.420 
into extra time but I think we we
probably<00:03:55.290> should<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.590> finished<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:56.070> off<00:03:56.190> in

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
probably should have finished it off in

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.310 
probably should have finished it off in
the<00:03:56.610> normal<00:03:56.970> 90<00:03:57.269> minutes<00:03:57.600> because<00:03:57.750> we<00:03:57.900> had<00:03:58.110> so

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
the normal 90 minutes because we had so

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.620 
the normal 90 minutes because we had so
many<00:03:58.470> chances<00:03:58.890> but<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.430> guess<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.030> was<00:04:00.209> just<00:04:00.239> not

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
many chances but I guess it was just not

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
save for a school keeper against so that

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.600 
save for a school keeper against so that
is<00:05:01.050> how<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:01.229> game<00:05:01.530> in<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.919> you<00:05:02.310> can<00:05:02.460> probably

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
is how the game in it you can probably

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.279 
is how the game in it you can probably
see<00:05:02.909> it<00:05:02.940> from<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.240> final<00:05:03.599> stats<00:05:03.840> as<00:05:03.960> well<00:05:03.990> we

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
see it from the final stats as well we

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.869 
see it from the final stats as well we
had<00:05:04.469> that<00:05:04.650> twice<00:05:04.889> as<00:05:05.069> many<00:05:05.190> chances<00:05:05.729> my

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
had that twice as many chances my

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.700 
had that twice as many chances my
opponents<00:05:06.389> so<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.569> was<00:05:07.080> definitely<00:05:07.440> happy<00:05:07.590> that

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
opponents so I was definitely happy that

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.140

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
variant so I mean we move on we go to

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.219

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.420 
decided to go wrong I don't know what
Chiellini<00:05:34.110> was<00:05:34.380> doing<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.830> tried<00:05:35.039> to<00:05:35.159> clear<00:05:35.340> it

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
Chiellini was doing I tried to clear it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.890 
Chiellini was doing I tried to clear it
away<00:05:35.490> but<00:05:35.789> he<00:05:35.880> completely<00:05:36.300> missed<00:05:36.630> the<00:05:36.779> ball

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
away but he completely missed the ball

he<00:05:37.020> was<00:05:37.139> taking<00:05:37.500> way<00:05:37.650> too<00:05:37.680> much<00:05:37.979> time<00:05:38.219> so<00:05:38.460> he

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
he was taking way too much time so he

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.519 
he was taking way too much time so he
makes<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:38.849> 1-1<00:05:39.240> then<00:05:39.810> just<00:05:40.139> before<00:05:40.409> half-time

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
makes it 1-1 then just before half-time

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
what the hell is Andrew Perez doing you

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.059 
what the hell is Andrew Perez doing you
know<00:05:42.719> this<00:05:42.990> was<00:05:43.169> just<00:05:43.259> one<00:05:43.529> of<00:05:43.560> those<00:05:43.770> games

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
know this was just one of those games

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.950 
know this was just one of those games
where<00:05:44.789> everything<00:05:45.599> and<00:05:45.750> I<00:05:45.779> mean<00:05:45.810> everything

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
where everything and I mean everything

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.040 
where everything and I mean everything
felt<00:05:46.800> so<00:05:47.219> sluggish<00:05:47.699> especially<00:05:48.509> with<00:05:48.659> kicking

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
felt so sluggish especially with kicking

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.050 
felt so sluggish especially with kicking
the<00:05:49.169> ball<00:05:49.319> away<00:05:49.590> with<00:05:49.800> which<00:05:50.130> you<00:05:50.340> again<00:05:50.909> we

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
the ball away with which you again we

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.059 
the ball away with which you again we
can<00:05:51.240> see<00:05:51.419> the<00:05:51.630> goal<00:05:51.810> but<00:05:51.960> this<00:05:52.110> time<00:05:52.349> it<00:05:52.860> was

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
can see the goal but this time it was

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:55.040 
can see the goal but this time it was
actually<00:05:53.370> offside<00:05:53.729> so<00:05:54.000> we<00:05:54.360> got<00:05:54.479> a<00:05:54.509> bit<00:05:54.719> lucky

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
actually offside so we got a bit lucky

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.450 
actually offside so we got a bit lucky
there<00:05:55.199> but<00:05:55.380> again<00:05:55.500> also<00:05:55.860> this<00:05:56.099> time<00:05:56.310> my

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
there but again also this time my

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.719 
there but again also this time my
defense<00:05:56.819> like<00:05:57.469> again<00:05:58.469> Barkley<00:05:59.340> he<00:05:59.430> took<00:05:59.610> the

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
defense like again Barkley he took the

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.879 
defense like again Barkley he took the
ball<00:05:59.879> but<00:06:00.210> then<00:06:00.330> just<00:06:00.990> a<00:06:01.110> better<00:06:01.409> and<00:06:01.830> my

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
ball but then just a better and my

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.230 
ball but then just a better and my
opponent<00:06:02.340> picks<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.580> up<00:06:02.610> with<00:06:02.759> a<00:06:02.789> grow<00:06:03.029> I<00:06:03.210> think

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
opponent picks it up with a grow I think

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.089 
opponent picks it up with a grow I think
and<00:06:03.569> he<00:06:03.629> makes<00:06:03.750> it<00:06:03.870> 2-1<00:06:04.080> just<00:06:04.440> like<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.830> first

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
and he makes it 2-1 just like the first

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.339 
and he makes it 2-1 just like the first
goal<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.460> we<00:06:05.580> actually<00:06:05.729> conceded<00:06:06.389> like<00:06:06.569> my

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
goal that we actually conceded like my

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.809 
goal that we actually conceded like my
defense<00:06:07.680> was<00:06:07.830> not<00:06:07.860> on<00:06:08.069> point<00:06:08.340> I<00:06:08.550> don't<00:06:08.639> know

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
defense was not on point I don't know

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.790 
defense was not on point I don't know
what<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.180> was<00:06:09.300> but<00:06:09.509> the<00:06:09.900> whole<00:06:10.020> game<00:06:10.319> just<00:06:10.349> felt

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
what it was but the whole game just felt

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.920 
what it was but the whole game just felt
sluggish<00:06:11.099> to<00:06:11.430> me<00:06:11.580> I<00:06:11.909> couldn't<00:06:12.419> really<00:06:12.569> score<00:06:12.900> I

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930

mean we move it to the scales up

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.350 
mean we move it to the scales up
you<00:06:41.070> can<00:06:41.220> see<00:06:41.400> right<00:06:41.550> there<00:06:41.760> we<00:06:41.880> actually<00:06:41.970> got

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
you can see right there we actually got

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.180 
you can see right there we actually got
two<00:06:42.600> goals<00:06:42.930> with<00:06:43.110> AUSA<00:06:43.380> 80<00:06:43.740> which<00:06:43.980> is<00:06:44.010> I<00:06:44.160> guess

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
two goals with AUSA 80 which is I guess

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.430 
two goals with AUSA 80 which is I guess
decent<00:06:44.820> and<00:06:45.000> I<00:06:45.390> can<00:06:45.570> see<00:06:45.720> from<00:06:45.900> the<00:06:45.990> challenges

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
decent and I can see from the challenges

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.440 
decent and I can see from the challenges
