approach this shouldn't be a bullet or
gate<00:01:14.070> type<00:01:14.340> exercise<00:01:14.910> but<00:01:15.420> rather<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.810> slow

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
gate type exercise but rather a slow

to enter the trailer with full control

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.609 
to enter the trailer with full control
it's<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.270> good<00:01:21.420> idea<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.750> wait<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> few<00:01:22.229> seconds

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it's a good idea to wait a few seconds

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.990 
it's a good idea to wait a few seconds
after<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> bow<00:01:23.070> has<00:01:23.220> engaged<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> end

this<00:01:25.890> allows<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> straighten<00:01:26.850> up<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this allows you to straighten up the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
this allows you to straighten up the
boat<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> perfect<00:01:28.110> line

next<00:01:32.590> step<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.010> apply<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.310> enough<00:01:33.760> power

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
next step is to apply just enough power

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.050 
next step is to apply just enough power
to<00:01:34.330> push<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.600> boat<00:01:34.780> up<00:01:34.960> onto<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.350> trailer
