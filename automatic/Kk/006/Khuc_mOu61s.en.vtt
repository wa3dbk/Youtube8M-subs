hair<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.560> shower<00:02:16.829> my<00:02:17.280> hair<00:02:17.489> felt<00:02:17.879> softer

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
hair in the shower my hair felt softer

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.289 
hair in the shower my hair felt softer
um<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.500> did<00:02:19.829> not<00:02:19.950> feel<00:02:20.250> very<00:02:20.310> detangled<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
um it did not feel very detangled and

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.240 
um it did not feel very detangled and
also<00:02:21.659> this<00:02:21.810> does<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.200> work<00:02:22.439> really<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:23.040> me<00:02:23.129> as

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
also this does not work really for me as

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.800 
also this does not work really for me as
a<00:02:23.280> rinse<00:02:23.489> out<00:02:23.610> conditioner<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:24.209> does<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:24.599> have

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
a rinse out conditioner it does not have

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.539 
a rinse out conditioner it does not have
any<00:02:25.049> good<00:02:25.260> detangling<00:02:25.739> properties<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.400> it's

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
any good detangling properties so it's

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.520 
any good detangling properties so it's
pretty<00:02:26.700> much<00:02:26.909> just<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.269> deep<00:02:27.450> treatment<00:02:27.689> but<00:02:28.349> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
pretty much just a deep treatment but it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.530 
pretty much just a deep treatment but it
did<00:02:28.680> feel<00:02:28.860> softer<00:02:29.370> I'm<00:02:29.909> just<00:02:30.269> not<00:02:30.420> like

there are a couple other drugstore deep
conditioners<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.079> might<00:02:40.230> try<00:02:40.379> from<00:02:40.709> some<00:02:41.159> of

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
conditioners I might try from some of

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.440 
conditioners I might try from some of
the<00:02:41.310> new<00:02:41.430> red<00:02:41.579> lines<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.970> they've<00:02:42.209> reached

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
probably use this up and then set it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.819 
probably use this up and then set it
aside<00:02:47.819> um<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:49.170> something<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.530> really

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
excited about is that leaving dition of

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.430 
excited about is that leaving dition of
most<00:02:53.639> line<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:54.000> really<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.659> the<00:02:55.019> in<00:02:55.079> addition

most line I really like the in addition

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410 
most line I really like the in addition

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
this has all those ingredients in there

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.379 
this has all those ingredients in there
and<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.129> those<00:03:17.370> are<00:03:17.549> all<00:03:17.669> very<00:03:17.910> moisturizing

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
and so those are all very moisturizing

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.629 
and so those are all very moisturizing
and<00:03:18.840> natural<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.739> then<00:03:20.099> desert<00:03:20.370> you've<00:03:20.489> got

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
and natural and then desert you've got

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.189 
and natural and then desert you've got
some<00:03:20.760> moisturizing<00:03:21.239> alcohols<00:03:21.629> in<00:03:21.810> here<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
some moisturizing alcohols in here and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.330 
some moisturizing alcohols in here and
it's<00:03:22.349> interesting<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.799> they<00:03:22.949> have<00:03:23.129> an

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
it's interesting that they have an

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.680 
it's interesting that they have an
extract<00:03:23.639> from<00:03:23.760> Amla<00:03:24.299> plank

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
extract from Amla plank

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.349 
extract from Amla plank
so<00:03:24.870> um<00:03:25.049> wha<00:03:25.290> oil<00:03:25.949> and<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.519> powder<00:03:26.730> both<00:03:27.060> are

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
so um wha oil and the powder both are

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.009 
so um wha oil and the powder both are
curly<00:03:27.989> curl<00:03:28.949> enhancing<00:03:29.599> ingredients<00:03:30.599> so

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
curly curl enhancing ingredients so

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.869 
curly curl enhancing ingredients so
perhaps<00:03:31.410> this<00:03:31.739> curl<00:03:32.010> enhances<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> little<00:03:32.760> I

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
perhaps this curl enhances a little I

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.159 
perhaps this curl enhances a little I
can't<00:03:33.090> say<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.419> are<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.510> under<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> say<00:03:33.930> huge

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
can't say that are you under to say huge

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.869 
can't say that are you under to say huge
difference<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.069> I<00:03:35.129> think<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.519> nice<00:03:35.669> that

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
difference but I think it was nice that

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.400 
difference but I think it was nice that
they<00:03:36.000> have<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.269> ingredient<00:03:36.720> in<00:03:36.870> there<00:03:37.049> um

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
they have that ingredient in there um

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.409 
they have that ingredient in there um
this<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.949> also<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.250> very<00:03:38.459> natural<00:03:38.790> ingredient

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
this is also a very natural ingredient

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.629 
this is also a very natural ingredient
right<00:03:39.959> thing<00:03:40.260> by<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.769> way<00:03:40.859> neither<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.370> these

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
right thing by the way neither of these

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.000 
right thing by the way neither of these
have<00:03:42.030> any<00:03:42.269> silicones<00:03:42.810> in<00:03:42.989> them<00:03:43.139> or<00:03:43.319> waxes<00:03:43.709> so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
have any silicones in them or waxes so

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.619 
have any silicones in them or waxes so
