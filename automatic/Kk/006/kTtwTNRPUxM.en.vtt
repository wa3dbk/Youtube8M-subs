this<00:00:06.899> is<00:00:07.049> my<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.770> did<00:00:08.309> find<00:00:08.550> something<00:00:10.519> course

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this is my I did find something course

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
this is my I did find something course
up<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> kinda<00:00:14.330> now<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.509> discrimination<00:00:16.379> if<00:00:16.590> I'd

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
up to kinda now my discrimination if I'd

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.990 
up to kinda now my discrimination if I'd
crank<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:20.180> say<00:00:21.180> it's<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.779> about

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
crank it up say it's going off about

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.200 
crank it up say it's going off about
yeah<00:00:24.000> nickel<00:00:24.960> tab<00:00:25.199> area<00:00:25.590> well<00:00:26.340> between<00:00:26.640> iron

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
yeah nickel tab area well between iron

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.700 
yeah nickel tab area well between iron
between<00:00:28.050> iron<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:29.840> five<00:00:30.840> cents<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> don't

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
between iron and five cents so I don't

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.780 
between iron and five cents so I don't
know<00:00:31.800> what<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> be<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.669> I'll

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
know what it's going to be so what I'll

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.260 
know what it's going to be so what I'll
do<00:00:33.000> two<00:00:33.540> things<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.100> will<00:00:35.100> kind<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> pinpoint

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
do two things I will kind of pinpoint

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.220 
do two things I will kind of pinpoint
the<00:00:36.690> best<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.899> don't<00:00:39.899> use<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the best I can like this I don't use the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.410 
the best I can like this I don't use the
pinpointer<00:00:40.800> function<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.660 

I<00:00:45.649> guess<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.829> case<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.190> works<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.460> I've

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
I guess in this case it works but I've

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
I guess in this case it works but I've
got<00:00:48.000> an<00:00:48.149> actual<00:00:48.270> pinpointer<00:00:48.870> works<00:00:49.050> better

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
got an actual pinpointer works better

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.549 
got an actual pinpointer works better
but<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.989> fastest<00:00:55.620> way<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:56.100> course<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> could

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
but the fastest way of course is I could

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.029 
but the fastest way of course is I could
scoop<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.699> which<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.420> my

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
scoop it with this which is my

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
scoop it with this which is my
all-in-one<00:01:02.039> sand<00:01:02.550> tool<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.570> kind

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
all-in-one sand tool here and just kind

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.070 
all-in-one sand tool here and just kind
of<00:01:05.270> give<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> big<00:01:06.630> scoop<00:01:06.930> letter<00:01:07.590> drop<00:01:07.920> out

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
of give it the big scoop letter drop out

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.890 
of give it the big scoop letter drop out
minus<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> object<00:01:11.060> which<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.180> don't<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> but

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
minus the object which I don't have but

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
minus the object which I don't have but
I<00:01:12.930> can't<00:01:13.049> hold<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> phone<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.520> this

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
I can't hold the phone and do all this

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
I can't hold the phone and do all this
so<00:01:15.000> what<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.170> just

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so what I'm going to do really is just

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
so what I'm going to do really is just
pull<00:01:17.280> out<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:18.000> pinpointer<00:01:18.439> it's<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:19.680> easier

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
pull out my pinpointer it's a lot easier

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.190 
pull out my pinpointer it's a lot easier
and<00:01:21.380> try<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> find<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.009> guy<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.729> is

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
and try to find it with this guy this is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:35.149 
and try to find it with this guy this is
actually<00:01:25.200> fairly<00:01:26.360> simple<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.900> go<00:01:34.159> all

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
actually fairly simple there we go all

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.499 
actually fairly simple there we go all
right<00:01:35.340> let's<00:01:35.640> write<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:36.090> their<00:01:36.329> where

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
right let's write about their where

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
right let's write about their where
that's<00:01:36.659> pointing<00:01:37.759> it's<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.970> hard<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> hold

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that's pointing it's just hard to hold

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
that's pointing it's just hard to hold
the<00:01:39.540> phone<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> do<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.890> i'll<00:01:41.040> try

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the phone and do this is all so i'll try

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.749 
the phone and do this is all so i'll try
to<00:01:41.450> my<00:01:42.450> plastic<00:01:42.930> scoop<00:01:43.250> plastic<00:01:44.250> i<00:01:44.430> like

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
to my plastic scoop plastic i like

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.359 
to my plastic scoop plastic i like
because<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.270> doesn't<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.890> doesn't<00:01:46.950> uh<00:01:47.460> oh

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
because it doesn't it doesn't uh oh

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
because it doesn't it doesn't uh oh
there's<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.460> pull<00:01:50.700> tab<00:01:51.020> all<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.200> there<00:01:52.560> as

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's the pull tab all right there as

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.510 
there's the pull tab all right there as
you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.729> see<00:01:54.380> worth<00:01:55.380> noting<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.310> how

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
you can see worth noting so that's how

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.290 
you can see worth noting so that's how
we<00:01:56.670> shut<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.540 

get<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.350> sand<00:02:00.590> out<00:02:00.680> of<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:00.920> that's<00:02:01.040> how<00:02:01.220> pull

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
get the sand out of it that's how pull

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.930 
get the sand out of it that's how pull
tab<00:02:01.820> shows<00:02:02.300> up<00:02:02.600> is<00:02:02.840> kind<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.560> different<00:02:04.490> I'm

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
tab shows up is kind of different I'm

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.200 
tab shows up is kind of different I'm
assuming<00:02:05.420> that<00:02:05.570> was<00:02:05.690> it<00:02:05.870> let's<00:02:06.760> move<00:02:07.760> this<00:02:07.940> bad

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
assuming that was it let's move this bad

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.930 
assuming that was it let's move this bad
boy<00:02:08.450> out<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.660> there<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:10.460> let's<00:02:10.930> actually<00:02:11.930> I

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
boy out of there and let's actually I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.260 
boy out of there and let's actually I
just<00:02:13.940> can't<00:02:14.390> do<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.750> with<00:02:14.990> my<00:02:15.020> one<00:02:15.590> hand

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
just can't do this with my one hand

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.760 
just can't do this with my one hand
let's<00:02:17.270> scan<00:02:17.570> area<00:02:17.810> again<00:02:19.270> mmm<00:02:20.270> doop<00:02:21.050> doop<00:02:21.410> doop

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
let's scan area again mmm doop doop doop

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.620 
let's scan area again mmm doop doop doop
doop<00:02:22.100> doop<00:02:22.370> yep<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.820> was<00:02:22.940> it<00:02:22.970> when<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.300> put<00:02:23.540> it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
doop doop yep that was it when I put it

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.990 
doop doop yep that was it when I put it
over<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.950> goes<00:02:28.100> away<00:02:28.340> pull

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
over here so that kind of goes away pull

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.420 
over here so that kind of goes away pull
tab<00:02:31.600> iron<00:02:32.600> in<00:02:32.750> five<00:02:33.020> cents<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.710> one<00:02:33.920> did<00:02:34.160> so

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
tab iron in five cents this one did so

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
tab iron in five cents this one did so
okay<00:02:35.920> we'll<00:02:36.920> keep<00:02:37.100> on<00:02:37.250> going<00:02:37.520> by
