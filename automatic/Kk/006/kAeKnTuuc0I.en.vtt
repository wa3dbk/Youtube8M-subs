click<00:00:48.300> effects<00:00:48.600> production<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
click effects production so here the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.040 
click effects production so here the
concept<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> certainly<00:00:50.969> room<00:00:51.120> surrounded<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050

to<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.090> yeah<00:01:39.450> man

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
to do this it's not just me yeah man

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.330 
to do this it's not just me yeah man
punch<00:01:40.509> myself<00:01:40.689> in<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:40.990> chest<00:01:41.229> we<00:01:42.009> put<00:01:42.189> some

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
punch myself in the chest we put some

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.399 
punch myself in the chest we put some
blocks<00:01:42.579> under<00:01:43.240> there<00:01:43.420> on<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.689> outside<00:01:44.079> so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
blocks under there on the outside so

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.840 
blocks under there on the outside so
there's<00:01:44.590> no<00:01:44.770> light<00:01:45.009> coming<00:01:45.220> in<00:01:45.490> through<00:01:45.520> those

it'll<00:01:51.610> let<00:01:51.759> you<00:01:52.030> step<00:01:52.540> forward<00:01:52.840> more<00:01:54.210> or<00:01:55.210> we

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
it'll let you step forward more or we

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.109 
it'll let you step forward more or we
need<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.229> turn<00:01:56.830> off<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.310> light<00:01:57.549> so<00:01:58.000> we're
