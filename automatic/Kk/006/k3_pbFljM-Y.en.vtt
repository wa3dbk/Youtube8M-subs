00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.440 

so<00:00:01.610> that<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.090> you<00:00:04.549> remove<00:00:05.549> negative

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
so that is how you remove negative

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.620 
so that is how you remove negative
properties<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.470> then<00:00:08.130> install<00:00:08.700> positive

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
properties and then install positive

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.560 
properties and then install positive
properties<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.710> items<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.210> do<00:00:12.330> this

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
properties on items and I can do this

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.209 
properties on items and I can do this
like<00:00:12.809> for<00:00:12.960> example<00:00:13.290> maybe<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.530> get<00:00:13.799> writers

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
like for example maybe I get writers

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.400 
like for example maybe I get writers
cramp<00:00:14.519> when<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> use<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> certain<00:00:16.080> type<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
cramp when I use a certain type of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.340 
cramp when I use a certain type of
pencil<00:00:16.590> well<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.400> can<00:00:17.640> douse<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.880> pencil<00:00:18.660> to

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
pencil well I can douse that pencil to

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.200 
pencil well I can douse that pencil to
remove<00:00:19.650> any<00:00:19.920> negative<00:00:20.340> energies<00:00:20.670> just

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
remove any negative energies just

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.870 
remove any negative energies just
exactly<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:22.020> I've<00:00:22.350> done<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:22.980> then<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
exactly like I've done here and then I

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.570 
exactly like I've done here and then I
can<00:00:24.260> install<00:00:25.260> positive<00:00:25.949> comfortable

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
can install positive comfortable

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
can install positive comfortable
properties<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.050> anti<00:00:28.529> cramping

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
properties you know or anti cramping

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.370 
properties you know or anti cramping
properties<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> you'll<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.689> amazed<00:00:31.080> at

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
properties to it and you'll be amazed at

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.749 
properties to it and you'll be amazed at
the<00:00:31.439> difference<00:00:31.710> now<00:00:32.130> when<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> pick<00:00:32.579> up<00:00:32.700> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the difference now when you pick up that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.490 
the difference now when you pick up that
pencil<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.420> write<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.809> may<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> give<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
pencil and write you may have to give it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010 
pencil and write you may have to give it
a<00:00:34.559> couple<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> minutes<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.640> again<00:00:36.030> for

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
a couple of minutes like like again for

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.930 
a couple of minutes like like again for
this<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.410> maximally<00:00:38.070> effective<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
this to be maximally effective I have to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
this to be maximally effective I have to
wait<00:00:39.120> probably<00:00:39.300> another<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.770> ten

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
wait probably another you know ten

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.810 
wait probably another you know ten
minutes<00:00:41.070> eight<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.700> ten<00:00:41.850> minutes<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.820> another

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
minutes eight or ten minutes so another

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
minutes eight or ten minutes so another
thing<00:00:44.879> that's<00:00:45.450> kind<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> popular<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.649> some

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
thing that's kind of popular with some

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.700 
thing that's kind of popular with some
of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> people<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.879> know<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:49.079> they

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of the people that I know is that they

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.490 
of the people that I know is that they
will<00:00:49.860> douse<00:00:50.180> their<00:00:52.070> their<00:00:53.070> business<00:00:53.460> card<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
will douse their their business card and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
will douse their their business card and
so<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.710> way<00:00:55.860> people<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.879> feeling

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
so that way people have a good feeling

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
so that way people have a good feeling
about<00:00:57.570> them<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.100> hand<00:00:59.309> them

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
about them when when they hand them

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.080 
about them when when they hand them
their<00:00:59.579> business<00:00:59.969> cards<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:01.219> lot<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> times<00:01:02.609> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
their business cards a lot of times you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.670 
their business cards a lot of times you
know<00:01:03.180> people<00:01:03.449> try<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> design<00:01:04.140> their<00:01:04.379> card<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
know people try to design their card to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
know people try to design their card to
have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> good<00:01:05.250> feeling<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:07.970> attractive

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
have a good feeling or to be attractive

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.140 
have a good feeling or to be attractive
in<00:01:09.180> some<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.710> there's<00:01:11.520> no<00:01:11.729> better<00:01:11.970> way

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
in some way and so there's no better way

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
in some way and so there's no better way
to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> when<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.040> with

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to do that when it would then with

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.170 
to do that when it would then with
energy<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.240> let's<00:01:15.479> douse<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> business<00:01:16.229> card

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
energy so let's douse a business card

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.890 
energy so let's douse a business card
with<00:01:18.180> some<00:01:18.360> properties<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:20.299> first<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.570> we

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
with some properties and first of all we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
with some properties and first of all we
want<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> check<00:01:22.380> always<00:01:23.159> check<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.909> see<00:01:24.060> if

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
want to check always check to see if

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
want to check always check to see if
there<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.270> any<00:01:24.330> negative<00:01:24.630> energies<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.259> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
there are any negative energies now this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.630 
there are any negative energies now this
is<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.770> business<00:01:26.250> card

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is my business card

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
is my business card
okay<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.299> I'm<00:01:27.509> hoping<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.080> no<00:01:28.229> negative

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
okay so I'm hoping there are no negative

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.460 
okay so I'm hoping there are no negative
energies<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.450> business<00:01:30.900> card<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.320> we're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
energies on my business card but we're

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
energies on my business card but we're
gonna<00:01:31.560> check<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.579> same<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:33.720> there

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
gonna check just the same are there

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
gonna check just the same are there
negative<00:01:33.990> energies<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:34.890> business<00:01:35.250> card

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
negative energies on my business card

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.390 
negative energies on my business card
I<00:01:36.650> knew<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> okay<00:01:38.310> alright<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> lot<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
I knew it okay alright so we do a lot of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.319 
I knew it okay alright so we do a lot of
exorcisms<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> stuff<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:44.329> there's

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
exorcisms and stuff like that so there's

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.910 
exorcisms and stuff like that so there's
sometimes<00:01:45.630> negative<00:01:46.320> energies<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> know

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
sometimes negative energies you know

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
sometimes negative energies you know
kind<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.430> away<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.610> us<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.570> alright<00:01:49.200> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
kind of get away from us but alright so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
kind of get away from us but alright so
they're<00:01:49.680> negative<00:01:50.040> energies<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.700> some<00:01:51.030> type

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
they're negative energies of some type

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
they're negative energies of some type
and<00:01:51.540> they're<00:01:51.899> restrictive<00:01:52.530> energies<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.189> some

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and they're restrictive energies of some

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
and they're restrictive energies of some
type<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.240> my<00:01:54.509> business<00:01:54.720> card<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> don't

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
type on my business card now I don't

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
type on my business card now I don't
have<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.009> one<00:01:56.219> card<00:01:56.490> at<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.700> time<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.939> could<00:01:57.270> do

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
have to do one card at a time I could do

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.080 
have to do one card at a time I could do
a<00:01:57.390> whole<00:01:57.979> stack<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> time<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.729> could<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
a whole stack of at a time I could do a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
now it's removing any resistances or

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.750 
now it's removing any resistances or
problems<00:02:13.379> that<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
problems that there are with the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.220 
problems that there are with the
business<00:02:15.060> card<00:02:15.330> well<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:17.099> didn't<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.459> long

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
business card well that didn't take long

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.270 
business card well that didn't take long
yeah<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.410> actually<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.770> does<00:02:19.920> feel<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.190> little

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
yeah and actually it does feel a little

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.320 
yeah and actually it does feel a little
bit<00:02:20.580> different<00:02:20.760> already

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
bit different already

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.530 
bit different already
yes<00:02:21.810> tank<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.319> still<00:02:22.489> cumulating<00:02:23.489> yeah<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> can

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
yes tank is still cumulating yeah I can

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.809 
yes tank is still cumulating yeah I can
still<00:02:24.720> feel<00:02:24.959> energies<00:02:25.470> buzzing<00:02:26.190> up<00:02:26.340> around<00:02:26.670> it

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
still feel energies buzzing up around it

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.089 
still feel energies buzzing up around it
like<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.000> bog<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.650> takes<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.980> little

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
like a bog and so it takes a little

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.220 
like a bog and so it takes a little
while<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.819> it<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> really<00:02:30.510> clear<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.930> even

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
while for it to really clear out even

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.080 
while for it to really clear out even
though<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> rod<00:02:31.650> stops<00:02:32.069> spinning<00:02:32.310> that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
though the rod stops spinning that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
though the rod stops spinning that
doesn't<00:02:33.480> mean<00:02:33.569> it's<00:02:33.750> completely<00:02:34.110> gone<00:02:34.379> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
doesn't mean it's completely gone that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.500 
doesn't mean it's completely gone that
just<00:02:34.800> means<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.129> should<00:02:35.340> break<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:36.739> completely

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
just means it should break up completely

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.119 
just means it should break up completely
because<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:40.019> done<00:02:40.290> its<00:02:40.470> work<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.010> it's

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
because it's done its work and so it's

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.470 
because it's done its work and so it's
just<00:02:41.280> waiting<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.790> effect<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.300> take

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
just waiting for the effect to take

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.440 
just waiting for the effect to take
effect<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.910> okay<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:46.760> just<00:02:47.760> thought<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.420> know

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
effect so okay I just thought you know

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
effect so okay I just thought you know
could<00:02:49.019> be<00:02:49.170> some<00:02:49.349> psychic<00:02:49.739> attack<00:02:50.069> or

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
could be some psychic attack or

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.199 
could be some psychic attack or
something<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:50.790> cards<00:02:51.150> anyway<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.730> are

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
something on my cards anyway so are

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.420 
something on my cards anyway so are
there<00:02:54.390> any<00:02:54.510> other<00:02:54.629> negative<00:02:55.620> energies<00:02:56.160> or

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
there any other negative energies or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.949 
there any other negative energies or
restrictive<00:02:57.000> energies<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.540> would<00:02:57.690> prevent

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
restrictive energies that would prevent

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.559 
restrictive energies that would prevent
me<00:02:58.140> from<00:02:58.340> installing<00:02:59.340> positive<00:03:00.090> properties

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
me from installing positive properties

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.250 
me from installing positive properties
on<00:03:00.810> my<00:03:01.739> business<00:03:01.950> card<00:03:02.370> okay<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:03.330> I'm<00:03:03.840> getting

on my business card okay so I'm getting

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.220 
on my business card okay so I'm getting
you<00:03:04.530> know<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> no<00:03:04.950> response<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.690> I'll<00:03:07.170> go

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you know a no response so now I'll go

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.920 
you know a no response so now I'll go
ahead<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:07.980> install<00:03:08.250> properties<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.360> some

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
ahead and install properties of some

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.750 
ahead and install properties of some
type<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.470> my<00:03:11.040> card

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
type on my card

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.920 
type on my card
so<00:03:12.830> let's<00:03:13.830> see<00:03:14.010> what<00:03:14.819> could<00:03:14.940> we<00:03:15.090> install<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.870> a

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
so let's see what could we install on a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.820 
so let's see what could we install on a
business<00:03:16.409> card

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
business card

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.040 
business card

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
well how about either genuine goodness

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.949 
well how about either genuine goodness
okay<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:23.069> for<00:03:23.220> example<00:03:23.480> my<00:03:24.480> card<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
okay like for example my card is a

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.210 
okay like for example my card is a
therapy<00:03:25.440> card<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.360> so<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.720> want<00:03:28.260> people<00:03:28.409> to<00:03:28.560> to

goodness can you place these energies

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.619 
goodness can you place these energies
upon<00:03:40.379> the<00:03:40.680> card<00:03:41.120> please<00:03:42.120> place<00:03:42.450> these

upon the card please place these

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.530 
upon the card please place these
energies<00:03:43.019> upon<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.500> card<00:03:43.709> now<00:03:44.060> okay<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:45.120> it's

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
energies upon the card now okay so it's

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.699 
energies upon the card now okay so it's
already<00:03:46.110> started<00:03:46.470> spinning<00:03:46.709> okay<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.709> it'll

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
already started spinning okay and it'll

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.390 
already started spinning okay and it'll
spin<00:03:49.890> for<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.190> little<00:03:50.400> bit<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:52.230> that<00:03:53.099> didn't

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
spin for a little bit and that didn't

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.830 
spin for a little bit and that didn't
seem<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.580> take<00:03:53.670> very<00:03:54.030> long<00:03:54.239> okay<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:56.780> all<00:03:57.780> right

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
seem to take very long okay so all right

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.259 
seem to take very long okay so all right
and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.739> can<00:03:58.920> feel<00:03:59.099> energies<00:03:59.580> building<00:04:00.030> on<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
and I can feel energies building on the

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.780 
and I can feel energies building on the
car<00:04:00.450> in<00:04:00.569> fact<00:04:00.720> actually<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:02.010> know<00:04:02.129> could<00:04:02.640> be

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
car in fact actually you know could be

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.309 
car in fact actually you know could be
just<00:04:03.000> me<00:04:03.150> but<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.450> card<00:04:03.659> feels<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.080> it's<00:04:04.230> a

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
just me but the card feels like it's a

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.619 
just me but the card feels like it's a
lot<00:04:04.470> warmer<00:04:04.769> than<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.220> was<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.000> sometimes

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
lot warmer than it was and sometimes
