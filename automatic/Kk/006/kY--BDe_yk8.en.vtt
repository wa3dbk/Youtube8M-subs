00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
the EQ which sounds suspiciously like an

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.839 
the EQ which sounds suspiciously like an

mid-range<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.009> so<00:01:57.190> important<00:01:57.700> for<00:01:57.789> the<00:01:57.910> Tambor

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:58.239 
mid-range is so important for the Tambor

mid-range is so important for the Tambor
of<00:01:58.330> an<00:01:58.420> instrument<00:01:58.660> I'd<00:01:58.899> like<00:01:58.989> to<00:01:59.110> throw<00:01:59.289> a

couple examples out on this for the

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.570 
couple examples out on this for the
first<00:02:01.720> one<00:02:01.899> let's<00:02:02.080> turn<00:02:02.259> this<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.979> let's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
first one let's turn this up and let's

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:20.320 
first one let's turn this up and let's
listen<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.270> both<00:02:04.690> positions

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:39.270 

let's<00:02:21.330> listen<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> other<00:02:21.750> position
