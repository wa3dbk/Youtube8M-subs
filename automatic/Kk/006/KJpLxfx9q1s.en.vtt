00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.330
 we discuss the relationship of television in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.950
 last year and a half when Vasya 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 Lomachenko is in professional 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 boxing is a crime against 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.570
 class lomachenko so ugly 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:24.650
 treat the channels that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.140
 broadcast these fights so carelessly and here 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.890
 in a walk I think it's a crime I 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 I think that it is possible for these one and a half to be 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.579
 years make washi lomachenko a star in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.710
 Ukraine is not less than a mustache 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.829
 because how to make a star for the audience 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 This or that country is work from two 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.110
 parties 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.510
 it is the boxer himself to be and ready to become 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 star and show boxing on such 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.670
 same level and television second 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.489
 component so here as for the antenna 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 and here and there it was all right 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.350
 concerns washi lomachenko from washi 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.560
 Lomachenko did anything and more 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.880
 In addition, he was ready to become a star and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.180
 work with television 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.549
 but television with Vasya Lomachenko 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.250
 they didn't want to make money 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.869
 showed his fights are not always in direct 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.540
 air and all despite the fact that Vasya is but this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.930
 history for centuries as for the whole 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 the rest of the galaxy we are talking and cunning 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:38.460
 and stud rare and peepholes and 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.400
 Derevyanchenko they are all on different now 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.250
 level but they here I think that in general 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.939
 this year 2015 and for our boxers in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.710
 America will be fantastic they 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.840
 now all are our boxers on 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.369
 this level when the american 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.460
 promoter from which does not work looking 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.009
 ready to lead them this will be the year of victories 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.670
 Ukrainian boxers in the US 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.460
 the market they will win more brightly 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.429
 less bright but it will be cool and a lot 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.000
 will win 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.920
 here is the only question to can 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 baskova who went out on enough 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.530
 high level and there may already be 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.740
 There may be nuances of magical sports 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.740
 mind
