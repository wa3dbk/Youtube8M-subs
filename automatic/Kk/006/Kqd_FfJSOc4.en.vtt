00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 well, good evening, I'd like to hear from you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.030
 judgment of this match and then if there 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.330
 says something important about how it is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.009
 As the game started we meanwhile 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 two teams trying to get in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.890
 little depth to leave uttered 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 depth the adversaries us first 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.970
 10 10 minutes maybe no more than we have 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 played great personality with great 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.160
 I liked the game speed like how 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 the team started the game 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.030
 also trying to give amplitude to the 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.890
 young man slowly for Naples has taken 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 field we suffered theirs 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 accelerations we suffered theirs 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.290
 also their restarts have taken over 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.140
 hand the game and then after the expulsion 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.520
 where we were good with insertion 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.120
 of our midfielder 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.790
 in short, to play with an extra man and in the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 second half even if we were slow 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.980
 or better we have to be faster for 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.530
 to put them in difficulty with the passing of 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.710
 minutes we created legitimized the 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.880
 victory even if naples could 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.510
 I was not worried because 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.760
 we have granted some punishment of 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.280
 too much and also some restart with a 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.110
 player who that too closely for the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.850
 second time they showed they knew 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.860
 make the right choices even with great 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.259
 gomez physicality we are all a little more 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.490
 in short, raised after what was seen 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.800
 at the knee it seems that he doesn't hate 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.910
 nothing of concern here is nothing 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.650
 serious see tomorrow the findings and 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:43.460
 we will be a little more relaxed 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:45.229
 here after the confirmation of these resources 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.180
 sometimes it also heals within four 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.810
 days 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.680
 I don't know exactly I don't know good evening 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.930
 good evening you will have asked me if you already had 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.950
 the programmed inputs of vargas 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.620
 Ilicic 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.720
 in the second half to try to face 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.820
 the napoli maybe more tired and then if 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.890
 this victory also the management of 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.019
 match can also be a message 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.140
 for the May cup final in Italy 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.850
 a message for Naples that has plan 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.290
 came the ideas but when 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.150
 of the initial idea is to put 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 a player between the lines as ilicic is 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.170
 them two midfielders and try to give 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.959
 amplitude on the exterior 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
 slowly for transported in this 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.250
 meaning by putting low external square e 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260
 creating double pair of exterior 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.420
 offensive to the right is double pair of 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.830
 externally a little less offensive to the left 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.470
 and always keeping players between 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.870
 lines and then we increased a little 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.190
 ball and plane transmission speed 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 plan we have managed to create 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.110
 some occasion we say that it is put 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.760
 bad for naples to defend themselves in 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.950
 this way but they had no other choices 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.459
 with eight players under the ball we have 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 had difficulty in having spaces are 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.450
 been good about the cup final 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.220
 Italy 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.470
 I hope it is the same match in the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.650
 meaning that naples if you play in ten 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.950
 I would be much happier if he played in 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.950
 ten 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.610
 the last three minutes, however, as you can 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.760
 to complain about the last ten 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.340
 minutes no more than punishable ones go 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.800
 clean mister napoli and fiorentina 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.560
 they have a similar game philosophy 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.760
 both make us positive from 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.380
 this view more beautiful than 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.040
 this combined between both is missing 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.840
 something can be said about what there is and what 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 miss these two teams to search 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.710
 to make the leap in quality is to get to 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.440
 towards depositions but frankly not 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.420
 I know now to judge for Naples 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.130
 it is difficult to see a master 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.530
 as benitez and can explain it better than 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.420
 me and for many reasons compared to the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.420
 fiorentina we are respecting the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.160
 forecasts I also think a little more 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.400
 the action is what happened during 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.470
 the year we are satisfied with this 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.310
 season you can improve you will try to 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.200
 improve the team was amazed 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.830
 when benitez replaced the wayne 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.830
 for behrami 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.400
 No, there can be, he has tried, spent 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.890
 so much higuain that cajon from fullback has 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.110
 spent a lot and here maybe with the 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.520
 speed of caioli in the restarts 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.060
 could put us in trouble 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.030
 two stations that played 90 minutes 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.650
 also last Thursday too 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.150
 choices are never made by chance 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.860
 with view on the 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.140
 she believes at this point that she can 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.750
 get third in the standings he believes in 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.860
 third place but in the meantime I must say that 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.950
 today an extremely positive day 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.530
 for positive perfect for all and all 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.450
 the results because we have moved away and 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.720
 the follower is also on paper 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.130
 maybe they had a favorable shift or more 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.840
 favorable of ours that we played 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.570
 we are on the third place 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.200
 approached the third in the standings 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.720
 then 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.310
 now far away but we must from here to 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.860
 end will do the best try to do the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.420
 better and see what happens is difficult 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.270
 because naples is strong napoli is 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.140
 far but we will try to do some 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.820
 our best 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.820
 we must do our 20 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.620
 hi vincenzo you received after the 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.750
 disappointment for the elimination from Europe 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.080
 league had and received from yours 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.740
 team the answer you expected 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.870
 beyond the positive result or 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.420
 how to say must give even more thanks 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.670
 but I must say that on a technical level 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.230
 tactical we could do a little more but 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.610
 that interested me less today than me 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.160
 interested conviction with that 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.550
 team will take the field to put on 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.980
 behind a bitterness but a disappointment 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.260
 to call it as we want but answered 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.500
 present to the team I saw one 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.820
 great temperament team seems 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.260
 have also done below the plan 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:09.000
 of the quality of the game and of the 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.560
 best matches personality but more 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.870
 I think they could not do 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.850
 players in short and therefore do not have me 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.350
 disappointed I did have to say you have too 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.320
 Naples did not disappoint me because I saw it 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.290
 always very proactive team 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.340
 therefore always present between two teams 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.340
 they reacted to the elimination
