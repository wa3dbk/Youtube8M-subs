 because he is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.430
 very interesting 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.430
 starting with the operating system 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.350

 recognized as one of the best operating systems 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.150
 was one of the safest because it comes with very much antivirus system 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.490

 in the kind that really comes 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.330
 Fantastic 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.100
 so you can see the thickness 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 that model 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.309
 He's really fine anyway. 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:12.419
 very thin before I tell you a little bit about the settings of 100 models 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.919
 I'll tell you a little about the ex-model skin tone. 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.299
 we can 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.719
 to notice that it has another type of network however large and is not 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.829
 look at the skin authors ask for more 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.669
 and it is due to that greatness you try as flexibility as you have 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.180
 a very interesting benefit in this sector of credit 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.670
 where you can comment and resize your images as per 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.789
 example I'm going to make a 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.729
 presentation here for you 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.229
 here we have a text we are browsing here on the apple website then 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.879
 here we are 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.809
 increase the screen 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.959
 so with just two fingers you can increase the size 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.299
 of the letters little of fear of the mother of letters is your choice 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.879
 in this same sense 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.129
 for you who likes to edit videos fiddle with pictures and photos 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.929
 and for you who like to use the iphone and 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.409
 this same type of criticism she is also used for the photos 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.010
 with only three fingers and if you ask you to recognize your three fingers ie 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.779
 you can cut partner in the photo as well as you do more flip too 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.460
 You can also spend 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.679
 the pictures 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.029
 so in this way the same way you do with your iphone 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.159
 You can also do 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.159
 in the method that is the 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.699
 because the grandson system then act 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.619
 limits this capacity, which 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.759
 interesting features of these models hence the apple to rekindle in the 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.049
 dark 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.829
 I once had an objection 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.830
 before him 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.200
 who worked the ballad worked the night 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.239
 He told me so Saul. 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.189

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.269
 snack bar 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.819
 in all the best opportunities 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.679
 because 

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:06.869
 another thing already receive allowance is that at this point if you do not have I like 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:08.350

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.799
 he stated that he can not see these models with a keyboard and 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.760
 so you have 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.870
 the credibility of one of the companies 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.970
