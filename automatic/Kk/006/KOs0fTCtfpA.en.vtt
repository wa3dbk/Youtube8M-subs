double<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:18.240> batteries<00:00:19.910> size-wise<00:00:20.910> they're

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
double a batteries size-wise they're

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710 
double a batteries size-wise they're
both<00:00:22.310> kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> same<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.269> night<00:00:24.449> core<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
both kind of the same the night core is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.519 
both kind of the same the night core is
a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:24.990> bit<00:00:25.109> longer<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:26.130> little<00:00:26.220> bit<00:00:26.760> thicker

a little bit longer a little bit thicker

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.880 
a little bit longer a little bit thicker
as<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:30.019> actually<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.109> pretty

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
as you can see here actually it's pretty

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
as you can see here actually it's pretty
a<00:00:33.590> lot<00:00:34.590> thicker<00:00:35.750> reflector<00:00:36.750> wise<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.500> both

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
a lot thicker reflector wise they both

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.080 
a lot thicker reflector wise they both
have<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> smooth<00:00:38.820> reflector<00:00:40.910> seems<00:00:41.910> like<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
have a smooth reflector seems like the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.010 
have a smooth reflector seems like the
night<00:00:42.270> core<00:00:42.540> has<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.170> little<00:00:43.620> bit<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.920> mirror

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
night core has a little bit more mirror

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.830 
night core has a little bit more mirror
finished<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> eagletac<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:48.360> reflectors

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
finished in the eagletac the reflectors

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.049 
finished in the eagletac the reflectors
slightly<00:00:49.680> bigger<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:51.870> deeper

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
slightly bigger it's a little bit deeper

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.689 
slightly bigger it's a little bit deeper
and<00:00:54.440> comparing<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:55.620> looks<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and comparing these two looks like the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.020 
and comparing these two looks like the
XML<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.680> u2<00:00:58.680> LED<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.489> smaller

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
XML to u2 LED is a little bit smaller

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
XML to u2 LED is a little bit smaller
than<00:01:01.399> the<00:01:03.080> xm-l<00:01:04.080> u2<00:01:04.949> LED<00:01:07.159> somebody<00:01:08.159> might<00:01:08.310> want

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
than the xm-l u2 LED somebody might want

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.350 
than the xm-l u2 LED somebody might want
to<00:01:08.549> correct<00:01:08.820> me<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.320> but<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:11.360> visualized

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to correct me on that but I visualized

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.420 
to correct me on that but I visualized
it<00:01:12.600> looks<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.020> little<00:01:13.650> smaller<00:01:13.979> which<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.220> barely

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it looks a little smaller which I barely

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.020 
it looks a little smaller which I barely
noticed<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.939> until<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.360> now<00:01:17.210> output<00:01:18.210> wise

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
noticed that until right now output wise

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.800 
noticed that until right now output wise
the<00:01:21.030> nightcore<00:01:21.479> cranks<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:23.000> 860<00:01:24.000> lemons<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the nightcore cranks out 860 lemons the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.580 
the nightcore cranks out 860 lemons the
eaglet<00:01:25.080> at<00:01:25.200> cranks<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> 915<00:01:26.610> lemons<00:01:27.590> I'll

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
eaglet at cranks out a 915 lemons I'll

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.399 
eaglet at cranks out a 915 lemons I'll
show<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> batteries<00:01:30.619> configuration<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.740> both

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.800 

here's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> tail<00:01:38.009> cap<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> two<00:01:38.810> eagletac

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
here's the tail cap of the two eagletac

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.460 
here's the tail cap of the two eagletac
on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.320> nightcore<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> left<00:01:42.470> there

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
on the right nightcore on the left there

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.330 
on the right nightcore on the left there
you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.799> kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.159> size-wise<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you can kind of see size-wise the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can kind of see size-wise the
difference

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
difference

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.220 
difference
so<00:01:50.710> there's<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.100> battery<00:01:51.490> configuration

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
so there's the battery configuration

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.810 
so there's the battery configuration
ecotech<00:01:53.230> on<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.470> left<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.070> nightcore<00:01:54.580> on<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
ecotech on the left and nightcore on the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:05.100 
ecotech on the left and nightcore on the
right<00:01:56.700> put<00:01:57.700> some<00:02:02.760> user<00:02:03.760> interface<00:02:04.210> with<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right put some user interface with the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.530 
right put some user interface with the
nightcore<00:02:05.590> compared<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.040> eagletac<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
nightcore compared to the eagletac the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.999 
nightcore compared to the eagletac the
nightcore<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.050> can<00:02:08.170> do<00:02:08.259> everything<00:02:08.649> with<00:02:08.800> one

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
nightcore you can do everything with one

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.180 
nightcore you can do everything with one
hand<00:02:09.250> operation<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.890> can<00:02:12.010> do<00:02:12.100> everything

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
hand operation you can do everything

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.950 
hand operation you can do everything
with<00:02:12.430> one<00:02:12.550> hand<00:02:12.670> operation<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:16.660> easily

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
with one hand operation really easily

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.850 
with one hand operation really easily
and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:19.060> with<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.300> eagle<00:02:19.480> attack<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:20.710> can

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
and then with the eagle attack you can

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.670 
and then with the eagle attack you can
do<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.190> hand<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.760> off<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.240> then<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
do one hand on and off but then to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.230 
do one hand on and off but then to
change<00:02:23.920> modes<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.520> have<00:02:24.610> to<00:02:24.730> twist<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.090> head

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
change modes you have to twist the head

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.590 
change modes you have to twist the head
with<00:02:25.720> two<00:02:25.900> hands<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.820> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.360> do

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
with two hands or you can you can do

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.830 
with two hands or you can you can do
with<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:28.930> hand<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.730> not<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.880> fast<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.480> if

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
with one hand but not as fast and if

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.020 
with one hand but not as fast and if
your<00:02:31.990> hands<00:02:32.140> are<00:02:32.290> slippery<00:02:32.940> it'll<00:02:33.940> be<00:02:34.000> a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
your hands are slippery it'll be a

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
your hands are slippery it'll be a
little<00:02:34.180> harder<00:02:35.700> output<00:02:36.700> wise<00:02:37.560> here's<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
little harder output wise here's the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.360 
little harder output wise here's the
nightcore<00:02:39.550> on<00:02:40.120> its<00:02:40.330> max<00:02:40.720> brightest<00:02:41.140> mode<00:02:41.370> as

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
brightest the setting it actually is

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.690 
brightest the setting it actually is
brighter<00:02:54.370> than<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:55.120> g<00:02:55.450> x<00:02:55.600> 25<00:02:56.250> but<00:02:57.250> we<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:57.519> know

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
brighter than the g x 25 but we all know

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.810 
brighter than the g x 25 but we all know
that<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.480> equal<00:02:58.660> attack<00:02:58.840> will<00:02:59.290> lose<00:02:59.820> this

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
that the equal attack will lose this

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.330 
that the equal attack will lose this
turbo<00:03:01.239> mode<00:03:01.420> once<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.320> batteries<00:03:02.709> drain<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.310> a

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
turbo mode once the batteries drain to a

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.030 
turbo mode once the batteries drain to a
certain<00:03:03.850> percentage<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.620> case<00:03:05.830> it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
certain percentage so in that case it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.330 
certain percentage so in that case it
would<00:03:06.130> go<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.940> this<00:03:07.090> mode<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:08.800> case<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
would go to this mode in that case the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.170 
would go to this mode in that case the
eagletac<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.330> brighter<00:03:10.930> than<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.730> nightcore

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
eagletac is brighter than the nightcore

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.820 
eagletac is brighter than the nightcore
so<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.390> long<00:03:16.540> run<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:17.110> eagletech<00:03:17.440> will<00:03:17.680> be

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
so in the long run the eagletech will be

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.420 
so in the long run the eagletech will be
brighter<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:19.620> wouldn't<00:03:20.620> think<00:03:20.860> that<00:03:21.010> an<00:03:21.220> eagle

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
brighter I wouldn't think that an eagle

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.699 
brighter I wouldn't think that an eagle
attack<00:03:21.640> would<00:03:21.910> let<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.600> flashlight<00:03:22.989> lose

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
attack would let this flashlight lose

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.490 
attack would let this flashlight lose
its<00:03:23.950> turbo<00:03:24.600> max<00:03:25.600> brightness<00:03:25.840> even<00:03:26.320> when<00:03:26.410> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
its turbo max brightness even when the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.280 
its turbo max brightness even when the
batteries<00:03:26.860> are<00:03:27.040> less<00:03:27.640> than<00:03:27.850> half<00:03:28.440> full<00:03:31.290> spill

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290

you<00:04:17.239> can<00:04:17.359> kind<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.630> see<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.989> tint<00:04:18.320> difference

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
you can kind of see the tint difference

and compared to both throw wise the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.400 
and compared to both throw wise the
nightcore<00:04:25.430> throws<00:04:25.700> a<00:04:25.730> little<00:04:25.970> bit<00:04:26.060> further

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
nightcore throws a little bit further

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.930 
nightcore throws a little bit further

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940

that<00:04:29.090> max<00:04:29.410> turbo<00:04:30.410> brightness<00:04:30.889> but<00:04:31.310> like<00:04:31.430> I

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
that max turbo brightness but like I

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.890 
that max turbo brightness but like I
said<00:04:31.610> you're<00:04:32.180> going<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.360> lose<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.540> once<00:04:32.780> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
said you're going to lose it once the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.020 
said you're going to lose it once the
batteries<00:04:33.200> drain<00:04:33.350> a<00:04:33.440> little<00:04:33.590> bit<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.970> then

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
batteries drain a little bit and then

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.080 
batteries drain a little bit and then
that<00:04:35.540> case<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:36.169> eagletac<00:04:36.700> throws<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.729> little

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
that case the eagletac throws a little

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.030 
that case the eagletac throws a little
further<00:04:40.300> distance<00:04:41.300> wise<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:42.260> night<00:04:42.590> Corp<00:04:42.860> has

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
further distance wise the night Corp has

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.340 
further distance wise the night Corp has
a<00:04:43.070> little<00:04:43.340> bit<00:04:43.430> bigger<00:04:43.580> hotspot<00:04:44.210> than<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
a little bit bigger hotspot than the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.900 
a little bit bigger hotspot than the
Eagle<00:04:45.919> attack<00:04:46.690> when<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.780> comes<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.080> throwing

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
Eagle attack when it comes to throwing

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.860 
Eagle attack when it comes to throwing
but<00:04:49.910> they<00:04:50.000> both<00:04:50.120> pretty<00:04:50.840> much<00:04:51.020> throw<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.410> same

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
but they both pretty much throw the same

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.700 
but they both pretty much throw the same
feeling<00:04:53.870> since<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.530> had<00:04:54.650> them<00:04:54.770> on<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:56.150> nikkor

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
feeling since I had them on the nikkor

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.719 
feeling since I had them on the nikkor
definitely<00:04:57.710> gets<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.919> little<00:04:58.010> bit<00:04:58.190> more<00:04:58.310> warmer

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
definitely gets a little bit more warmer

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.540 
definitely gets a little bit more warmer
than<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.960> Eagle<00:05:00.290> attack<00:05:00.590> just<00:05:01.220> because<00:05:01.460> of

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
than the Eagle attack just because of

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.780 
than the Eagle attack just because of

both the finish on both was really

top-notch fit wise in the hand this is

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.250 
top-notch fit wise in the hand this is
how<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.620> nightcore<00:05:19.870> feel<00:05:20.870> is<00:05:20.990> actually

how the nightcore feel is actually

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.830 
how the nightcore feel is actually
really<00:05:21.440> nice<00:05:21.680> easy<00:05:22.520> one<00:05:22.789> finger<00:05:23.800> operation
