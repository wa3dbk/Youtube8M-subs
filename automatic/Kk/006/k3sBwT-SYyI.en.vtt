00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.990
 ruppin edition and grandpa what is that one 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 Thundercloud people to clear out what 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.270
 Behind there hides the fly 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.699
 into it 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.300
 you feel that behind the black ones 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.449
 clouds 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.340
 what is striking is a strong wind blowing 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.540
 if possible, you still in the clouds 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 No, I want to let it fly 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.700
 go old we want no because in this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.100
 cloud is a legendary pokémon in it 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.820
 whatever you could grab and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.600
 you can see it again as you can see 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.489
 the fifth-generation pokémon was boris 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.590
 where i got the other book from therefore 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.149
 Makes me say yes have the good 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 There are boreas here 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 Of course, ruby age is up to it 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 the opposite of it and if you join 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.519
 you can even have the land from the fang 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 you get healed this afternoon i catch 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.229
 yes, finally , at the bushel 1 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.700
 not at all on the people 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.950
 know how her pokémon gets her 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.600
 just have to do that in front of me 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 weather as the tu gets something 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.619
 have in the team and then here the day 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 just fly in or out of the sky 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.439
 more teams or tias than what ever 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 for an edition and then 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.310
 appears as I said there are and and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.619
 then you can catch the good book 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 yes, that is not so much who once 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.310
 want quite costly die 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.890
 by honking and curious is now 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.799
 not so cool I prefer 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.320
 over the earth form the earth form has 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.990
 especially they say what irritates is 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.329
 because it can just fly on the ground 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 earthquake and is just massive stronger 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.700
 running his cats later from 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.229
 just brutal 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.329
 you can see all the pokémon from the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.280
 15 in animal form I believe he 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.130
 becomes the bird that donna thing becomes 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.040
 a cat per us dollar dinklage to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 bird and he also no work you know 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.130
 it probably wants the ghost so for 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.960
 ska 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.780
 maybe wave i want some 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.090
 weaken but no matter 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.950
 yes we still have several plans pokémon 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.489
 I'll catch it because there are still 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 so some 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.959
 the party follows and so and yes I have 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.330
 what a few people I own 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.630
 could still do 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.519
 and I'm still looking forward to new ones 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.590
 there should be something else then 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.870
 should I still go big in the sun 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.120
 and so what will definitely be 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.110
 still do 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.610
 and yes, if the park time a bit 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.650
 shorter then it is just like that because I 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.790
 Actually what I want in the park yet 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.590
 are have really only in part 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.450
 to bring in good German as an aid 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.489
 how do I curiously not get in just as well 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.590
 the lot of humor boris first time make 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:56.650
 berlin ari people still no i believe 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:03:00.819
 you know what I mean yes people like that 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.819
 defeat her bios 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:14.769
 that's not how you do it you knew best 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.769
 God is the embarrassing way that begins 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:22.069
 borussia guru died 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.110
 that boris just give in on it 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:30.130
 but I have a cascade emptiness 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.260
 rather good Christian know now 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.230
 so far give it to me and I have too 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.610
 after 8 billion 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.099
 and I do not think so 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.650
 save the thing with screen again 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:47.450
 Definitely catch up you see that 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.370
 from me too as she would have to get one 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.470
 just have to take it all in and 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.599
 then you can be full of this boris 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.860
 or just wanted to see loos and then 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.910
 can you at some point just the two 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.150
 Meteor from field 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:06.730
 the next thing goes from you zero good 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.730
 apparent meeting here see that one 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.430
 that's the prism turret okay that 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.530
 landmark of my procity this 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.959
 Incidentally, champion is not just for 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.239
 There is no such thing as an extreme 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.829
 important function of the prism 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.840
 Turrets namely a place 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.330
 took neumann is glad not far from 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.610
 you see the light here that shows 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.850
 that usually something unworthy 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.850
 going 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.560
 and there you come into the game I want 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.660
 but ask for something next to me 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.020
 after all, move our conversation to me 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.389
 home 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.010
 the cozy i was in the 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.010
 Residence was happy on the first floor 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.230
 there were a few comments one 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.640
 quest with the old and white 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.190
 Not at all where I have to go I have 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.330
 no but nine times in glad one is glad 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.850
 In my opinion, that was then 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.930
 always down here 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.280
 we need or secret base you 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.290
 always used the choice pretty much 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 cool right here the tree and though 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.920
 Nine times in frome here it is not all 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:23.560
 because they also do something 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:26.580
 but we can look through the retina 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:30.520
 recognize initiated 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.870
 beaten cool here is definitely 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.840
 We will definitely like it 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.520
 said going in when I remember 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.050
 we will not do that when 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.220
 you 're through the whole legionnaire 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.750
 then we would be the whole quest 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.160
 I really wanted to open up 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.830
 ever answer the question because they 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.050
 was just asked 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.210
 and I think I have none 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.920
 secret papers are doing I believe 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.620
 the next place a little closer 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.810
 catch then I will know 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.520
 Geim basen action is a bit of a breeze 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.280
 post game action beer for example with 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.670
 Walter the story and I would say 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.620
 then see if we are in which position 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.450
 still have and then if we too 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.360
 challenge the top four already 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.850
 well then she was a few part of that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.200
 project do not worry people but as short 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.470
 units from today again with it 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.260
 comes because last days for me 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.370
 again, little time 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.010
 and maybe I still have today 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.930
 a few too as the silver looks out 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.810
 definitely a storm silbersky 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.310
 storm silver base case lok is a 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.420
 wonderful are brought after work 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.550
 I will be back from the skin 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.550
 goes to next part under zero
