now<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.890> actually<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:21.949> unit<00:00:22.949> or<00:00:23.100> pic

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
now this actually was not a unit or pic

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.340 
now this actually was not a unit or pic
that<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.730> chose<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:24.750> sent<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
that I chose they actually sent this to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
me

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
me
the<00:00:26.640> color<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.240> obviously<00:00:27.660> not<00:00:27.900> matching<00:00:28.410> my

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the color is obviously not matching my

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.429 
the color is obviously not matching my
natural<00:00:29.160> color<00:00:29.910> however<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
natural color however I think that this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
natural color however I think that this
has<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> lot<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:32.009> potential<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.820> was<00:00:33.059> looking<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
has a lot of potential it was looking a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 
has a lot of potential it was looking a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
natural texture and then the texture of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.900 
natural texture and then the texture of
the<00:00:38.850> Marley<00:00:39.210> hair<00:00:39.480> /<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.469> husband<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.370> thought
