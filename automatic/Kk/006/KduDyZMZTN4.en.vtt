 Brecht changes a lot 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.290

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.390
 it's time to take responsibility. "He makes two important decisions 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.380
 the first is the separation of coach Peter Lundgren the Bremen goal it can 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.599
 just as natural 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.329
 we know each other so well 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:57.329
 and I was kind of burned out and tired 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.599
 and these are after a change 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.599
