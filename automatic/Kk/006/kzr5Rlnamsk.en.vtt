got a nice explosion with some nice time
blocks<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.799> was<00:02:05.490> wondering<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:06.030> much<00:02:06.180> time

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
blocks I was wondering how much time

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.119 
blocks I was wondering how much time
blocks<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.439> he<00:02:07.619> didn't<00:02:07.890> tell<00:02:08.099> me

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
blocks do you get but he didn't tell me

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
blocks do you get but he didn't tell me
I'm<00:02:08.849> guessing<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.330> might<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.690> one<00:02:09.869> stack<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I'm guessing it might be one stack and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.420 
I'm guessing it might be one stack and
we<00:02:10.890> got<00:02:11.039> some<00:02:11.190> mob<00:02:11.370> spawners<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.090> well
