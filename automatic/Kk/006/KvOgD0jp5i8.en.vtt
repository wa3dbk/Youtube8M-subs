00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
now this has been three weeks and it's

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.559 
now this has been three weeks and it's
as<00:03:16.760> good<00:03:17.150> as<00:03:17.510> new

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.410 

was<00:03:20.569> previously<00:03:21.230> using<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.590> different<00:03:21.920> brand<00:03:22.129> I

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
was previously using a different brand I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.819 
was previously using a different brand I
probably<00:03:23.420> use<00:03:23.750> 10<00:03:23.959> percent<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.500> brand

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
probably use 10 percent of that brand

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.100 
probably use 10 percent of that brand
and<00:03:25.579> what<00:03:25.910> I've<00:03:26.030> doing<00:03:26.209> probably<00:03:26.390> 80<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.750> 90

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
and what I've doing probably 80 to 90

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.900 
and what I've doing probably 80 to 90
percent<00:03:27.140> now<00:03:27.500> because<00:03:28.129> I<00:03:28.250> find<00:03:28.489> there<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
percent now because I find there the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.110 
percent now because I find there the
parts<00:03:29.269> universe<00:03:29.629> or<00:03:29.870> look<00:03:30.019> especially<00:03:30.230> the

glossy<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.310> great<00:03:46.760> all<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.360> time<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.870> got<00:03:47.990> a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
glossy and great all the time it's got a

glossy and great all the time it's got a
clear<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.410> it<00:03:48.590> that's<00:03:48.800> what<00:03:48.980> it's<00:03:49.100> designed<00:03:49.250> to

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
clear on it that's what it's designed to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.970 
clear on it that's what it's designed to
do<00:03:49.760> all<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.570> vehicles<00:03:51.020> they<00:03:51.380> don't<00:03:51.590> have<00:03:51.830> that

do all the vehicles they don't have that
clear<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.460> it<00:03:52.610> so<00:03:52.940> they're<00:03:53.390> more<00:03:53.510> susceptible

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
clear on it so they're more susceptible
