00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.420
 hello welcome to the blandi channel 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.120
 group today I wanted to share with you 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.800
 one of my biggest hobbies and some that 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.800
 other tips for drawing 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.429
 It is one of my best drawings 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.980
 if you want to draw something like that 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.270
 part of natural talent if you are given 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.830
 well draw I'll show you some 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.260
 Four tricks to draw 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.360
 fairly good and make it more fun 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.270
 but we have to start with the 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 tools tools such as the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.320
 drawing block 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.540
 once I bought myself here 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.330
 well, this drawing blog can 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.059
 I started with him and it was a bit difficult 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.170
 paint that why then because its 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.989
 texture was 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.510
 reds and there and that caused that when 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.789
 I will blur blurred too no 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.970
 he calculated well how much he had to squeeze 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:03.880
 or anything like that 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.340
 110 grams per square meter then 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 Seeing such a palm tree, I did not go shopping 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.810
 one with more quality and I found this in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.480
 henry this one was a prettier paper 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.030
 it did not have so much roughness and with this 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.190
 I tried and it went very well, it has 125 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.260
 grams 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.930
 Another fundamental tool is the 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.590
 pencils 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.570
 If you do not know, there are several shades 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.110
 of pencils there are several types of pencils 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.110
 to paint 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.010
 I have this that is 2 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 it serves to paint a little looser 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.810
 then there is the typical the typical pencil of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.170
 all life yellow and black cloth 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.380
 as well as that of hamas and then there is this 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.230
 what is 5b 5b this is for painting 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.600
 a little bit more more more black for example 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.380
 in this drawing this serves to paint 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.229
 this darker part this 2h serves 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.210
 to paint this here more clearly and 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.510
 it is used to paint intermediate tones 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.700
 like these or these from here another 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.610
 tool not dispensable for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.470
 painters is this with the eraser too 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.510
 can be painted can be achieved in a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.550
 black background white shades that 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.880
 it is also painting this consists of a 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.150
 brush to remove chips from 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.730
 draft for you when you delete then 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.790
 do not blur 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.330
 and here is this is a draft in the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.569
 pencil 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.040
 erase some little elements 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.890
 where you delete if you put a little 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.380
 black and when you're going to tackle it then what 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.140
 you better paint an eraser black 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.970
 cesc is essential other than to 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.620
 my profile is too dispensable is 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.710
 the blurring and blurring 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.870
 I use I use this if it is still 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.280
 toilet paper and I blurred with this the 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.980
 name wants to go to the store to buy 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.020
 a blur that makes me same is worth 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.380
 of the paper that as I use it because very 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.050
 easy removed two squares then the 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.740
 I fold again with this part 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.020
 we put alone over we cover the finger 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.810
 with the paper and here you can 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.150
 use to blur well another way 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.410
 of which as can be used is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:31.940
 doing like a rice and so we roll up 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.740
 if this would then be rolled up 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.100
 So with this, you can also 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.590
 blur and do the same as blur 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.350
 according to the phase find an image the 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.750
 image has to be of quality and to be 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.400
 possible a black and white image 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.520
 for beginners to make them 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.540
 easier than as a third phase the 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.690
 Grid 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.940
 if you are a beginner and you are not given 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.920
 well draw what is the outline of 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.350
 the things to guide you more or less how 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.150
 doing it is a grid in proportion 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.180
 with the drawing to start drawing 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.760
 It is also a little dispensable to use a 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.980
 sheet yes yes a sheet a blank sheet 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.170
 a folio for example I have I have this 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.910
 man here was the outline also not 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.740
 is the guiding shadows then yes 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.570
 you start to draw the sinister thing 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.450
 example that we would put here if 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.940
 I start to draw here this part of 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.030
 drawing by when I go to this part 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.170
 my arm and it's mostly this part of 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.640
 here it will fill me with paint 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.310
 then you will blur the drawing 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.200
 so if you prefer to start 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.790
 paint on this side the most recommended 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200
 is to put in was over so that when 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.220
 you 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:45.490
 and another technique is that you the eye is 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 accommodates a view 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.220
 you are the drawing and it fits into that view 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.990
 of the eye then then you when you're 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.180
 drawing as the hand tends to draw 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.340
 not the drawing itself but what you 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.460
 have you seen then maybe you draw 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.060
 things that are not as they are in the drawing 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.290
 then to turn the eye over it is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.300
 to say for the eye to give itself that 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.000
 custom to drawing and what I do is 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.890
 turn over the drawing then the 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.500
 eye totally loses prospects 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.810
 of the drawing does not know what is coming 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.790
 continuation man if he knows but not 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.770
 you know it as much as I know if I explain myself 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.990
 if maybe you put it like that upside down 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.390
 and you when you are copying from the drawing 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.970
 you writing your eye is going to force more 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.400
 to see what is in the drawing for 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.200
 copy it then here then it is also 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.990
 very well turn it around and compare 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:41.000
 drawings and see what it is that in what you 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.000
 you have failed if one thing you are
