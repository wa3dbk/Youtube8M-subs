got<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> long<00:00:26.640> probe<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> camera<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
got a long probe on here the camera and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.200 
got a long probe on here the camera and
the<00:00:28.529> light<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> end<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.090> you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the light at the end of it and what you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.880 
the light at the end of it and what you
can<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> can<00:00:30.869> actually<00:00:30.990> run<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.769> up

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
can do is you can actually run it up

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.100 
can do is you can actually run it up
inside<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.460> these<00:00:32.550> heat<00:00:32.850> exchanger<00:00:33.360> tubes<00:00:33.660> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
inside of these heat exchanger tubes and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.920 
inside of these heat exchanger tubes and
find<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.610> cracks<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.600> weak

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
find out if there are cracks or weak

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
find out if there are cracks or weak
spots<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.530> rust<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.270> one

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
spots or rust I'm actually on this one

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
spots or rust I'm actually on this one
it<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.719> pretty<00:00:39.899> easy<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.829> did<00:00:40.950> on

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it was pretty easy to see what I did on

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
it was pretty easy to see what I did on
this<00:00:41.340> particular<00:00:41.670> model<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.739> inspected<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
this particular model as I inspected it

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
this particular model as I inspected it
with<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> camera<00:00:44.460> from<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> bottom<00:00:45.180> tubes

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
with the camera from the bottom tubes

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.790 
with the camera from the bottom tubes
and<00:00:45.600> realized<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.320> was<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> lot<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and realized that there was a lot of

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000 
and realized that there was a lot of
rust<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.789> what<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> did<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.140> decided<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.890> go

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
rust so what I did is I decided to go

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
rust so what I did is I decided to go
ahead<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> tear<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> Machine<00:00:51.000> down<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.420> find

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
ahead and tear the Machine down to find

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.470 
ahead and tear the Machine down to find
out<00:00:51.809> exactly<00:00:52.579> what<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
out exactly what was going on with this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
out exactly what was going on with this
up<00:00:54.660> pulled<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.960> top<00:00:55.170> off<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> what<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
up pulled the top off of it and what you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.729 
up pulled the top off of it and what you
have<00:00:56.730> here<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.120> come<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.379> started

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
have here is I come in and I started

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.260 
have here is I come in and I started
looking<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> integrity<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.000> heat

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
looking at the integrity of the heat

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.720 
looking at the integrity of the heat
exchanger<00:01:00.690> tubes<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.859> clearly<00:01:02.280> what<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.550> see

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
exchanger tubes and clearly what you see

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.020 
exchanger tubes and clearly what you see
here<00:01:02.969> are<00:01:03.329> holes<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.549> when<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.729> make

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
here are holes in and when they make

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.000 
here are holes in and when they make
these<00:01:06.270> heat<00:01:06.540> exchangers<00:01:07.080> they<00:01:07.260> put<00:01:07.830> these

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
these heat exchangers they put these

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
these heat exchangers they put these
little<00:01:08.640> weld<00:01:09.270> marks<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.840> things<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.290> there

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
little weld marks and things in there

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
little weld marks and things in there
when<00:01:10.680> they're<00:01:10.799> actually<00:01:11.150> fabricating<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
when they're actually fabricating it and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
when they're actually fabricating it and
a<00:01:12.810> lot<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> times<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> weakest

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
a lot of times those are the weakest

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
a lot of times those are the weakest

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
heat in the moisture and it has actually

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.020 
heat in the moisture and it has actually

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
rusted it away there's fine little marks

rusted it away there's fine little marks
in<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.950> side<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.579> it

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
in here if you get to this side of it
you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.680> they're

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
you can actually see where they're

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.580 
you can actually see where they're
thinner<00:01:32.729> spots<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.320> could<00:01:34.560> argue

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
thinner spots of it and one could argue

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.960 
thinner spots of it and one could argue
that<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.729> not<00:01:36.570> ready<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.409> replaced<00:01:37.970> if

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that it is not ready to be replaced if

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630 
that it is not ready to be replaced if
you<00:01:39.060> come<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> look<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.920> fine<00:01:41.220> seams

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you come and look at these fine seams

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
you come and look at these fine seams
those<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.869> cracks<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.470> could<00:01:43.619> actually

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
those are cracks you could actually

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
those are cracks you could actually
slide<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:45.090> small<00:01:45.899> material<00:01:46.560> between<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
slide a small material between that you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.730 
slide a small material between that you
could<00:01:47.939> actually<00:01:48.119> come<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.470> was

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
could actually come in here this was

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.950 
could actually come in here this was
actually<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.939> rusted<00:01:51.420> through<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> way

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
actually not rusted through all the way

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.100 
actually not rusted through all the way
and<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.229> did<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> tip<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.909> my<00:01:53.939> pen<00:01:54.390> if

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and I did that with the tip of my pen if

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.490 
and I did that with the tip of my pen if
you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.649> come<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.689> heat<00:01:57.689> exchanger<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you can come in on a heat exchanger and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.539 
you can come in on a heat exchanger and
come<00:01:59.369> through<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.729> expect<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.899> pen

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
come through and expect it with a pen

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.760 
come through and expect it with a pen
and<00:02:01.700> literally<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.360> rust<00:02:02.600> flakes<00:02:02.810> off<00:02:03.200> before

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
and literally the rust flakes off before

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.819 
and literally the rust flakes off before
you<00:02:04.000> chances<00:02:05.000> are<00:02:05.119> you're<00:02:05.689> in<00:02:05.869> severe<00:02:06.380> need<00:02:06.649> of
