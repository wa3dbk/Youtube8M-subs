 [Music] 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 Today I'm going to show you how to do it. 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 the experience of the satellite 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.260
 experience is very simple but very 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
 cool is really a challenge and I'm going to use it 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 very simple materials a little bit of 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.689
 The wood I cut here now has a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.430
 drill at each end 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.080
 if you can not do these 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.269
 curious is only you to put a nail in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 florim place and I'm going to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.349
 wood four pieces of string 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 about one meter long 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.940
 making a kind of a basket of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.670
 rock amac on the edge or use a classic 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 98 with a video I recorded at the end of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.629
 world you do not know how to do a magnificent 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.190
 18 No one lowered the base is ready 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.760
 Now let's see if we can 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.059
 turn a glass up here as if he 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.710
 orbiting the earth as if it were 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.710
 a satellite 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.260
 oh look there 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.260
 [Music] 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:25.639
 ayew 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:25.639
 [Music] 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:02:01.569
 will be 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:02:01.569
 [Music] 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.880
 Have you ever seen that with a glass that works 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:43.560
 if now you stay in place of the glass 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:43.560
 [Music] 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:54.499
 four cups will be 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.499
 [Music] 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.810
 and now you can understand why the body does not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.849
 fly when people spin 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.620
 Let me take a look at my book. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.450
 virtual physics 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.790
 when we start to turn the body to 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.860
 tendency is for it to escape on the tangent 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.230
 it flies off the tangent as 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.480
 This design that daniel made there 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.860
 You and why does not he fly out? 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.250
 does not fly because there is a force 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.739
 that pulls it to the center of the circle that 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.260
 force is a centripetal force I am 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.970
 making this force using these strands 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.800
 neighbors here then if the trend is that 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.019
 he pulls a pulling force from the tangent 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.750
 to the center the result is that the glass 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.970
 spins and these forces are very 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.130
 stronger than gravity and 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.410
 The safe did not fall, either. 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.989
 And why did I call this glass of glasses? 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.239
 because that's what happens with 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.819
 satellites is very similar to what 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.830
 happens the glass and when we launched 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.720
 a satellite in Earth orbit the people 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.060
 launch the satellite spinning around 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.850
 planet earth and that leaves the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.130
 raids cover of its orbit 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.280
 It's not a joke with this one, it's not 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:12.560
 precisely the gravity of planet earth 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:22.370
 but times start here you will find in the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:24.380
 next Tuesday on the blog what do you like about these 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.750
 experiences with inertia and gravity and 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.870
 glasses I'll leave that side here 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.880
 Challenge the cups and the egg challenge well 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.070
 legal, which is also difficult to do 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.140
 because it is also a bit wrong in 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.180
 first time I did it and I leave it here 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.100
 leaving a nice video with the camera 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.050
 go pro that the camera you've rotated 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.500
 along with it is the video I recorded 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.570
 number 200 of the world of manual 200th 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.580
 I do not know who the new video is. 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.979
 number 201 of the world in which I 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.000
 camera with a sling and you leave. 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.499
 flying 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.949
