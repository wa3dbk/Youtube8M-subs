in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.020> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.949> be<00:00:02.040> running

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
in this video we're going to be running

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.690 
in this video we're going to be running
geekbench<00:00:02.939> on<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.449> new<00:00:03.629> ipad<00:00:04.080> 4<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:05.190> see<00:00:05.400> how

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
geekbench on the new ipad 4 to see how

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.960 
geekbench on the new ipad 4 to see how
it<00:00:05.759> performs<00:00:06.620> so<00:00:07.620> I've<00:00:07.799> got<00:00:08.010> geek<00:00:08.309> bench<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
it performs so I've got geek bench to

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.020 
it performs so I've got geek bench to
hear<00:00:09.300> let's<00:00:09.570> go<00:00:09.780> ahead<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.019> launch<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
hear let's go ahead and launch it so it

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.240 
hear let's go ahead and launch it so it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
with that out of the way let's run the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:58.220 
with that out of the way let's run the
benchmarks<00:00:56.420> so<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> benchmarks<00:00:58.079> are

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
benchmarks so the benchmarks are

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.900 
benchmarks so the benchmarks are
finished<00:00:58.530> running<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.879> see

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
finished running and as you can see

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.080 
finished running and as you can see
we've<00:01:00.359> got<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.539> geekbench<00:01:01.079> score<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:03.619> 1770<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
we've got a geekbench score of 1770 and
