00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.669
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.290
 what are you doing, I hope you are 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.940
 all very well and welcome once more 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.280
 to the secondary channel today is against 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.540
 really spectacular news 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.970
 the images that you are seeing in 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.890
 screen really are not real they are 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.869
 mounted but we had spent wishing 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.600
 that is a very active user in our 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.190
 channel and that has told us to imagine how 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.350
 you could have the signature elements if 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.990
 we could replace the moon with others 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.550
 planets really good to say that the 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.720
 moon is a satellite that did not deceive me that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.369
 then come the comments and I 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.309
 they say the net is that the moon is not a 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.649
 planet is a satellite I know but today 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.870
 I come to talk about what would happen if 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.559
 we will replace the moon with others 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.239
 planets 380 thousand kilometers from 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.129
 distance from the earth the moon 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.229
 occupies a beautiful place of heaven 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.579
 night seen from our planet and 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.159
 American artist and photographer 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.350
 ron miller raises the idea of 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.639
 transform this beautiful panorama 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.440
 placing each of the planets of the 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.900
 solar system in a satellite location 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.510
 natural earth the result 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.580
 It's a fantastic collection of views in 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.560
 which we can appreciate for example to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.350
 venus that is three times bigger than 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.230
 the moon illuminated with its shine the night 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.300
 terrestrial another part of the tube that is 14 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.910
 times bigger than the moon it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.240
 it would profile like a huge blue balloon in 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.700
 the sky and the saturn rings 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.560
 they would exceed our view on the horizon 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.740
 we would also have the giant jupiter 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.780
 which is 40 times bigger than the moon and 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.850
 it would be a very unique panorama 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.619
 because due to its enormous size it would not be 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.869
 possible to see the north and south poles of 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.550
 planet from the earth is to say that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 to make this amazing collection 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.260
 miller had to ignore the conditions and 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.760
 characteristics of each planet because that 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.820
 could dramatically affect the 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.470
 earth this has to be said of being so 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.479
 near us as the moon is not 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.860
 because you have to say that we have to 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.440
 make some concessions for the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.590
 imagination according to this talented artist 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.990
 in his blog say that these images the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.520
 you can find under the link of the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.050
 description when you have to put it 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.550
 here you can see the images in good 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.150
 resolution here when you give him 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.880
 and directly to this person's blog and 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:15.420
 you can see directly what's coming 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.180
 being these wonderful photos first 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.510
 as I have shown you before how is the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.400
 moon seen from a road and then 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.910
 what would the different planets be like 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.090
 seen from 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.680
 from our from that road as 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.660
 if it were the moon that was us 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.530
 illuminating to say that it is impressive 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.910
 but you have to say as you said 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.910
 this article the writer of this 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.580
 article that has obviated the problems 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.910
 that could have having the problems that 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:52.390
 could have on our planet the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.360
 be so close to these others since 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.210
 there are different thermal conditions of 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.160
 proximity because the best thing is to have 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.260
 the mass so big in these planets 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.120
 like jupiter and saturn we could 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.940
 make ourselves our own 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.470
 satellites of these planets so nothing 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.720
 guys and I let you delight these images 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 or a little kiss to everyone and see you in another 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.700
 more video of this channel until next time
