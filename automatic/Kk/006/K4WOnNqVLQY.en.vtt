00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.269
 and here we are on January 21st 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.859
 and this is the last trip to 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 serve this dear re not hiding 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:23.730
 sixteen horses last trip because we 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.160
 are we going to dismount it today here and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.000
 irony of fate he makes us a little 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.650
 bench of honor and refuses to start 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 but you have to bring the boat back 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.559
 the other side so by means or by a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.140
 else we will lead him to the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 captaincy for the mechanic to begin 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.160
 to extract it last trip go 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.149
 how to follow all the evolution of this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.390
 project which involves changing the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.390
 engine 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.479
 and we travel in this little engine 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.420
 hard to start for us 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.580
 keystone after 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.390
 you fear nourished 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 he is the next author 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.060
 definitely dare 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.670
 we will attend live at the last 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.900
 stop small engines to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.900
 two years 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:35.270
 she was the light it's over 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:37.700
 never went but that's the work has 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:43.970
 therefore started to expand and to 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.500
 the arrco of quick service which is to 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.550
 artwork 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.550
 how did this boned us this poor engine 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.190
 and well that's all is disconnected 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 disconnected from high schools we just 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.560
 reconnect the battery there to have 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.540
 a little juice the bilge pump and then 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.590
 expected the crane in this afternoon 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.590
 early afternoon and for him 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.350
 still feeds like that you pass 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.350
 above the gulf 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.490
 like that is close to sion 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.310
 There you go 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.310
 the little 16 who are dead 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.210
 good 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.920
 received 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:11.380
 Oh 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:18.700
 yes but that's good, but that's it 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.700
 here is more free space engine 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:28.940
 so now second step removed 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:35.620
 all to remove everything clean everything and 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.340
 takes over and after retail and building 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.720
 adapt it to the new coasts 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.500
 the engine arrives tomorrow or the day after tomorrow 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.500
 and following the next issue 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.410
 good so today tuesday so well the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.600
 engine flew off we saw it yesterday 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 good this morning cleaning the engine hold 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.610
 and the one thus cutting the hatch 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.270
 I decided to cut a trace a 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.030
 hatch to access the organs of 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.820
 review of the new engine that is 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.090
 will find here mainly so by 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.830
 there we will get better access to the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:21.820
 change of return of water pumps and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.820
 emptying and so here I am
