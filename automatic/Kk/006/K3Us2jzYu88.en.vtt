Randy<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.540> what's<00:00:15.719> change<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> last<00:00:16.590> ten

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
Randy so what's change in the last ten

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
Randy so what's change in the last ten
years<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:17.160> liposuction<00:00:17.580> there's<00:00:18.300> been

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
years with liposuction there's been

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.060 
years with liposuction there's been
significant<00:00:19.260> changes<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.619> liposuction

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
significant changes in liposuction

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.710 
significant changes in liposuction
probably<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> most<00:00:20.760> changes<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.270> any<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
probably the most changes of any of the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
probably the most changes of any of the
plastic<00:00:22.230> surgical<00:00:22.529> procedures<00:00:23.070> there's<00:00:23.609> been

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
plastic surgical procedures there's been

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.429 
plastic surgical procedures there's been
a<00:00:23.789> variety<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.330> new<00:00:24.539> technologies<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.380> are

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
a variety of new technologies that are

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.050 
a variety of new technologies that are
emerged<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.949> market<00:00:26.400> new<00:00:26.730> ones<00:00:26.910> are

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
emerged on the market new ones are

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.029 
emerged on the market new ones are
coming<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.779> know<00:00:27.900> all<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.890> time

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
coming out you know all the time

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.980 
coming out you know all the time
everything<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> based<00:00:29.910> upon<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.359> traditional

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
everything is based upon the traditional

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.139 
everything is based upon the traditional
approach<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.309> know<00:00:32.460> where<00:00:32.940> we're

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
approach of you know where we're

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.479 
approach of you know where we're
injecting<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.809> saline<00:00:34.200> solution<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.920> we're

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
injecting a saline solution and we're

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.220 
injecting a saline solution and we're
pretty<00:00:35.700> much<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.450> basis<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.780> liposuction

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pretty much the the basis of liposuction

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
pretty much the the basis of liposuction
is<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> you're<00:00:37.860> removing<00:00:38.129> fat<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.940> area

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is that you're removing fat from an area

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.010 
is that you're removing fat from an area
using<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.629> cannula<00:00:40.020> okay<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.149> over

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
using a cannula okay and you know over

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
using a cannula okay and you know over
over<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> last<00:00:43.710> 10<00:00:43.920> years<00:00:43.950> we've<00:00:44.280> seen

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
over the last 10 years we've seen

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.860 
over the last 10 years we've seen
significant<00:00:45.090> changes<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.480> know<00:00:45.600> there's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
significant changes you know there's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
significant changes you know there's
been<00:00:45.960> lasers<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.980> been<00:00:47.070> introduced<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
been lasers that have been introduced to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.150 
been lasers that have been introduced to
attempt<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> melt<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> fat<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
attempt to melt the fat and to

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
attempt to melt the fat and to
theoretically<00:00:50.760> tighten<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> skin<00:00:51.870> there's

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
theoretically tighten the skin there's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.240 
theoretically tighten the skin there's
been<00:00:52.890> altra<00:00:53.309> sound<00:00:53.520> assisted<00:00:55.250> technologies

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
been altra sound assisted technologies

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
been altra sound assisted technologies
kind<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.879> use<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> vaser<00:00:57.510> okay

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
kind of like what we use the vaser okay

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.590 
kind of like what we use the vaser okay
which<00:00:58.739> uses<00:00:58.980> an<00:00:59.100> ultrasound<00:00:59.579> probe<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.180> melt

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
which uses an ultrasound probe to melt

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
which uses an ultrasound probe to melt
the<00:01:00.750> fat<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.170> people<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:01.920> been<00:01:02.010> doing<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the fat and people have been doing that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
the fat and people have been doing that
first<00:01:02.760> they've<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.030> trying<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> externally

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
first they've been trying it externally

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.980 
first they've been trying it externally
and<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:04.379> we'd<00:01:04.559> actually<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> internally

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
and now we'd actually do it internally

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
and now we'd actually do it internally
and<00:01:06.990> there's<00:01:07.290> radiofrequency<00:01:07.920> waves<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and there's radiofrequency waves that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.190 
and there's radiofrequency waves that
have<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.060> been<00:01:09.270> used<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> attempt<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> melt

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
have also been used to attempt to melt

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
have also been used to attempt to melt
the<00:01:10.290> fat<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.619> whole<00:01:10.740> theory<00:01:10.979> behind<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the fat the whole theory behind it is

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.270 
the fat the whole theory behind it is
that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.740> we're<00:01:13.740> trying<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> come<00:01:14.220> up

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
that you know we're trying to come up

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.060 
that you know we're trying to come up
with<00:01:14.400> better<00:01:14.939> ways<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> result<00:01:16.470> with

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
with better ways to get the result with

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.850 
with better ways to get the result with
the<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.939> patient<00:01:18.240> satisfaction<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the better patient satisfaction in a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
the better patient satisfaction in a
faster<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.670> time<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> work

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
faster down time get you back to work

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740 
faster down time get you back to work
faster<00:01:22.619> than<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> traditional<00:01:23.880> ways<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> lipo

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
faster than the traditional ways of lipo

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.859 
faster than the traditional ways of lipo
so<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.259> talked<00:01:25.590> off-camera<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.759> even<00:01:27.750> my

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
so now we talked off-camera and even my

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.090 
so now we talked off-camera and even my
perception<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.560> everybody's<00:01:28.950> doing

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
perception is that everybody's doing

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
perception is that everybody's doing
liposuction<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> same<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
liposuction in the same way is that a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.240 
liposuction in the same way is that a
frustration<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> yours<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
frustration of yours you think I'm you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.980 
frustration of yours you think I'm you
think<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.549> common<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.420> common<00:01:33.780> thought

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
think that's common a common thought

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
think that's common a common thought
that<00:01:34.680> liposuction<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.340> liposuction

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that liposuction is liposuction

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
that liposuction is liposuction
liposuction<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.930> definitely<00:01:37.409> not<00:01:37.500> reelection

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
liposuction is definitely not reelection

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.520 
liposuction is definitely not reelection

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
liposuctions probably one of the most

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.420 
liposuctions probably one of the most
difficult<00:01:54.470> operations<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.040> plastics<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
difficult operations and plastics is

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700

that right it's to me it's the second
most<00:01:58.740> difficult<00:01:59.159> operation<00:01:59.549> behind

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
most difficult operation behind

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.289 
most difficult operation behind
rhinoplasty<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.219> nose<00:02:02.299> surgery

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
rhinoplasty you know in the nose surgery

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.969 
rhinoplasty you know in the nose surgery
and<00:02:03.420> nasal<00:02:03.780> snow<00:02:03.990> surgery<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.500> by<00:02:04.740> far<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and nasal snow surgery is by far the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.800 
and nasal snow surgery is by far the
most<00:02:05.159> difficult<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.549> was<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.659> tough

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
most difficult I was this so tough

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
most difficult I was this so tough
liposuction<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.649> mean<00:02:08.009> seems<00:02:08.220> very

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
liposuction I mean seems very

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.160 
liposuction I mean seems very
straightforward<00:02:08.720> respectfully<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.810> say<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
straightforward respectfully I say it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
straightforward respectfully I say it
seems<00:02:10.739> like<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.580> theory<00:02:11.790> behind

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
seems like it you know the theory behind

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.700 
seems like it you know the theory behind
is<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.480> remove<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.349> for

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
is you remove that for

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.170 
is you remove that for
an<00:02:13.770> area<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> body's<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
an area but you know the body's not a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.420 
an area but you know the body's not a
flat<00:02:15.780> surface<00:02:16.230> it's<00:02:16.620> not<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> easy<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.340> know

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
flat surface it's not that easy you know

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
flat surface it's not that easy you know
people<00:02:17.850> want<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.660> create<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.080> certain<00:02:19.560> look

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
people want you to create a certain look

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.580 
people want you to create a certain look
in<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.460> certain<00:02:20.760> image<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.570> know<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:21.960> goal<00:02:22.230> in

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
in a certain image you know your goal in

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
in a certain image you know your goal in
doing<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.890> procedure<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.700> create<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> curve

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
doing the procedure is to create a curve

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
doing the procedure is to create a curve
so<00:02:25.050> think<00:02:25.290> about<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.680> know<00:02:25.710> you're<00:02:26.070> using

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so think about it you know you're using

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.000 
so think about it you know you're using
something<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.360> remove<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:28.410> fat<00:02:28.620> from<00:02:28.920> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
something to remove the fat from the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.830 
something to remove the fat from the
body<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.610> create<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.850> shape<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.690> do

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
body to create a shape but if you do

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.470 
body to create a shape but if you do
that<00:02:31.250> incorrectly<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:33.000> could<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.270> disastrous

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
that incorrectly it could be disastrous

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.100 
that incorrectly it could be disastrous
result<00:02:34.200> okay<00:02:34.800> now<00:02:35.070> I<00:02:35.130> talked<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.820> other

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840 
you know what's the best way that we can
get<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.470> best<00:03:16.650> result<00:03:16.980> for<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.190> patients<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
get the best result for the patients and

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.850 
get the best result for the patients and
this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:18.900> came<00:03:19.020> up<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.410> which<00:03:19.800> is

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
this is what we came up with which is

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.340 
this is what we came up with which is
smooth<00:03:20.760> sculpt<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.270> right<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.230> know

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
smooth sculpt all right and you know

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.440 
smooth sculpt all right and you know
what<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:22.950> it's<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.280> combination<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.970> several

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
what it is it's a combination of several

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.500 
what it is it's a combination of several
different<00:03:24.840> factors<00:03:25.200> it's<00:03:25.710> a<00:03:25.860> preoperative

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
different factors it's a preoperative

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
different factors it's a preoperative
operative<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.720> postoperative<00:03:28.380> protocol<00:03:29.280> you

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
operative and postoperative protocol you

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.850 
operative and postoperative protocol you
know<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.480> first<00:03:30.630> thing<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.870> we<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.260> we

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
know the first thing that we do is we

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.470 
know the first thing that we do is we
kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.070> want<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.490> fat<00:03:32.670> ready<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.360> be

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
kind of want to get the fat ready to be

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.140 
kind of want to get the fat ready to be
removed<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.560> we<00:03:34.740> use<00:03:34.860> an<00:03:35.040> external<00:03:35.460> ultrasound

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
removed so we use an external ultrasound

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.910 
removed so we use an external ultrasound
device<00:03:36.450> which<00:03:37.050> kind<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.440> loosens<00:03:37.770> up<00:03:37.860> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
device which kind of loosens up the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.440 
device which kind of loosens up the
fastest<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.550> day<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.910> surgery<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.390> is

is we're actually taking next to an
ultrasound<00:03:55.250> we're<00:03:56.250> putting<00:03:56.520> it<00:03:56.610> all<00:03:56.760> over<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
ultrasound we're putting it all over the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.940 
ultrasound we're putting it all over the
area's<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.570> be<00:03:57.720> treated<00:03:57.930> we're<00:03:58.320> warming<00:03:58.830> up

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
area's to be treated we're warming up

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.910 
area's to be treated we're warming up
the<00:03:59.670> tissues<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.080> loosening<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.710> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
the tissues which is loosening up the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.650 
the tissues which is loosening up the
fat<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.400> kind<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.670> helping<00:04:03.000> get<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.360> fat

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
fat and it's kind of helping get the fat

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.330 
fat and it's kind of helping get the fat
ready<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.080> be<00:04:04.230> dissolved<00:04:04.950> a<00:04:05.010> little<00:04:05.220> bit

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
ready to be dissolved a little bit

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.270 
ready to be dissolved a little bit
faster<00:04:05.820> try<00:04:06.600> okay<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.200> then<00:04:07.590> afterwards<00:04:08.040> then

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
faster try okay and then afterwards then

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.160 
faster try okay and then afterwards then
we<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.520> operation<00:04:09.120> now<00:04:09.450> what<00:04:09.780> we're<00:04:09.930> doing

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
we do the operation now what we're doing

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.600 
we do the operation now what we're doing
the<00:04:10.230> operation<00:04:10.470> we're<00:04:10.830> using<00:04:11.010> the<00:04:11.400> vaser

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
the operation we're using the vaser

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.250 
the operation we're using the vaser
which<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.060> an<00:04:12.180> ultrasound<00:04:12.630> assistive<00:04:13.050> probe

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
which is an ultrasound assistive probe

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.350 
which is an ultrasound assistive probe
so<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.680> with<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:13.980> small<00:04:14.370> instrument

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
so this is with a small instrument

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.479 
so this is with a small instrument
cannula<00:04:15.960> very<00:04:16.410> small<00:04:16.710> ones<00:04:16.859> goes<00:04:17.040> in<00:04:17.280> there

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
cannula very small ones goes in there

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.849 
cannula very small ones goes in there
and<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.030> doing<00:04:18.660> what<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.560> know<00:04:19.680> we're

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and it's doing what you know we're

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.560 
and it's doing what you know we're
making<00:04:20.100> two<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.489> three<00:04:20.700> millimeter<00:04:21.180> incisions

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
making two to three millimeter incisions

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.330 
making two to three millimeter incisions
are<00:04:21.720> tiny<00:04:21.750> they're<00:04:22.440> about<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.800> big<00:04:22.860> they're

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
are tiny they're about this big they're

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.100 
are tiny they're about this big they're
inconspicuous<00:04:23.760> once<00:04:24.270> they're<00:04:24.419> healed<00:04:24.630> we

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
inconspicuous once they're healed we

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.860 
inconspicuous once they're healed we
actually<00:04:25.320> insert

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
actually insert

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.110 
actually insert
underneath<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.590> skin<00:04:27.860> through<00:04:28.550> all<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.910> fat

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
underneath the skin through all the fat

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.290 
underneath the skin through all the fat
this<00:04:29.330> ultrasound<00:04:29.750> device<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.410> shoots<00:04:30.740> out

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
this ultrasound device and it shoots out

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.670 
this ultrasound device and it shoots out
ultrasound<00:04:32.300> waves<00:04:32.479> listen<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:32.900> eat<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.500> hot

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
ultrasound waves listen I eat is it hot

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.920 
ultrasound waves listen I eat is it hot
it<00:04:33.979> does<00:04:34.490> get<00:04:34.639> warm<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:35.210> can<00:04:35.360> feel<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.750> you

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
it does get warm you can feel it you

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.270 
it does get warm you can feel it you
know<00:04:36.050> when<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.320> have<00:04:36.440> your<00:04:36.530> hand<00:04:36.800> on<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.040> skin

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
know when you have your hand on the skin

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.400 
know when you have your hand on the skin
the<00:04:37.400> heat<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.729> skin<00:04:37.970> does<00:04:38.150> get<00:04:38.330> warm<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:39.290> it's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
the heat the skin does get warm but it's

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.900 
the heat the skin does get warm but it's
actually<00:04:39.500> emulsifying<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.460> fat<00:04:40.610> so<00:04:40.760> that

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
actually emulsifying the fat so that

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.700 
actually emulsifying the fat so that
when<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.120> remove<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.540> it's<00:04:42.080> like<00:04:42.290> putting

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
when you remove it it's like putting

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.010 
when you remove it it's like putting
melted<00:04:43.130> butter<00:04:43.310> on<00:04:43.490> popcorn<00:04:43.630> really<00:04:44.630> not<00:04:44.900> an

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
melted butter on popcorn really not an

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.870 
melted butter on popcorn really not an
overstatement<00:04:45.320> you<00:04:46.010> can<00:04:46.220> see<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.550> difference

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
overstatement you can see the difference

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.280 
overstatement you can see the difference
in<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.030> in<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.540> cannulas<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.110> we<00:04:48.169> remember

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
in the in the cannulas that we remember
