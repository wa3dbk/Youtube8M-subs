00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.830 
what I wanted to share with you guys
today<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.759> first<00:01:13.030> thing<00:01:13.299> you're<00:01:13.689> going<00:01:13.780> to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
today so the first thing you're going to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.929 
today so the first thing you're going to
want<00:01:13.899> on<00:01:14.229> this<00:01:14.380> Remington<00:01:14.890> r5<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
want on this Remington r5 is the

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.179 
want on this Remington r5 is the
foregrip<00:01:16.539> attachment<00:01:17.200> now<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.799> photograph

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
foregrip attachment now this photograph

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.859 
foregrip attachment now this photograph
attachment<00:01:18.609> helps<00:01:18.909> even<00:01:19.060> more<00:01:19.210> for<00:01:19.630> shooting

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
attachment helps even more for shooting

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.569 
attachment helps even more for shooting
at<00:01:19.960> long<00:01:20.140> range<00:01:20.409> because<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.039> reduces<00:01:21.159> that

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
at long range because it reduces that

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.700 
at long range because it reduces that
recoil<00:01:21.939> just<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.359> bit<00:01:22.570> more<00:01:22.780> because<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.289> does

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
recoil just a bit more because it does

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.620 
recoil just a bit more because it does
without<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.340> have<00:01:24.609> a<00:01:24.640> little<00:01:25.090> bit<00:01:25.299> like<00:01:25.479> the

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
without it have a little bit like the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.569 
without it have a little bit like the
tiniest<00:01:26.170> little<00:01:26.469> bit<00:01:26.619> but<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.100> can<00:01:27.249> barely

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
tiniest little bit but you can barely

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.039 
tiniest little bit but you can barely
even<00:01:27.759> notice<00:01:28.149> so<00:01:28.240> i<00:01:28.299> put<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.539> for<00:01:28.780> grip<00:01:28.899> on

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
even notice so i put this for grip on

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.840 
even notice so i put this for grip on
because<00:01:29.320> i<00:01:29.469> like<00:01:29.710> my<00:01:29.859> weapons<00:01:30.159> as<00:01:30.280> stable<00:01:30.759> as

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
because i like my weapons as stable as

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.179 
because i like my weapons as stable as
possible<00:01:30.969> so<00:01:31.899> now<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.319> has<00:01:32.439> literally<00:01:32.770> no

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:33.189 
possible so now it has literally no

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.950 
possible so now it has literally no
recoil<00:01:33.609> whatsoever<00:01:34.240> just<00:01:34.329> shoots<00:01:34.749> in<00:01:34.869> a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
recoil whatsoever just shoots in a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200 
recoil whatsoever just shoots in a
straight<00:01:35.229> line<00:01:35.259> perfectly<00:01:36.189> fine<00:01:36.609> now<00:01:37.149> the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
straight line perfectly fine now the

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.459 
straight line perfectly fine now the
next<00:01:37.420> thing<00:01:37.659> i<00:01:37.810> like<00:01:37.929> to<00:01:38.020> put<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.200> here<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.439> a

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
next thing i like to put on here is a

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.679 
next thing i like to put on here is a
red<00:01:38.740> dot<00:01:38.979> sight<00:01:39.280> because<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:40.149> iron<00:01:40.299> sights<00:01:40.569> on

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
red dot sight because the iron sights on

putting this red dot sight on there will

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.639 
putting this red dot sight on there will
make<00:01:46.179> it<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.479> lot<00:01:46.780> clearer<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.319> now<00:01:47.590> the

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
anything really small works really well

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.699 
anything really small works really well
for<00:01:57.579> this<00:01:57.819> gun<00:01:58.030> but<00:01:58.689> if<00:01:58.869> you<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.469> using

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
for this gun but if you do like using

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:01.739 
for this gun but if you do like using
the<00:01:59.859> bigger<00:02:00.100> reticles<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.789> fine<00:02:00.969> I<00:02:01.240> like

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
the bigger reticles that is fine I like

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.179 
the bigger reticles that is fine I like
the<00:02:01.899> smaller<00:02:02.139> ones<00:02:02.350> just<00:02:02.469> so<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.649> can<00:02:02.709> see<00:02:03.039> my

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
the smaller ones just so I can see my

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.919 
the smaller ones just so I can see my
enemies<00:02:03.579> still<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.179> giant<00:02:04.659> reticle

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
enemies still and the giant reticle

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.319 
enemies still and the giant reticle
isn't<00:02:05.200> taking<00:02:05.499> up<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.709> entire<00:02:05.740> site<00:02:06.459> now

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
isn't taking up the entire site now

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.270 
isn't taking up the entire site now
first<00:02:07.929> secondary<00:02:08.410> on<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.800> weapon<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:09.190> have

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
first secondary on this weapon I have

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.420 
first secondary on this weapon I have
the<00:02:09.369> MP<00:02:09.700> 443<00:02:10.410> crotch<00:02:11.410> so<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.130> actually<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
the MP 443 crotch so this is actually a

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.490 
the MP 443 crotch so this is actually a
really<00:02:12.670> good<00:02:12.820> pistol<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.720> probably<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
really good pistol it's probably the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.830 
really good pistol it's probably the
best<00:02:14.830> pistol<00:02:15.070> in<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> game<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.580> think<00:02:15.730> one

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
best pistol in the game I think one

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
best pistol in the game I think one
thing<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.050> stay<00:02:17.200> away<00:02:17.349> from<00:02:17.379> if<00:02:17.739> you're

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
thing to stay away from if you're

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.170 
thing to stay away from if you're
choosing<00:02:18.129> pistols<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.700> definitely<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
choosing pistols is definitely the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.479 
choosing pistols is definitely the
Magnum<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.870> does<00:02:20.080> not<00:02:20.260> work<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:20.530> well<00:02:20.950> Adam

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
Magnum it does not work that well Adam

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.320 
Magnum it does not work that well Adam
at<00:02:21.879> kind<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.810> medium<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.500> short<00:02:23.530> range<00:02:24.330> just

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
at kind of medium to short range just

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.540 
at kind of medium to short range just
because<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.260> has<00:02:26.440> such<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> big<00:02:27.069> recoil

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
because it's like has such a big recoil

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.759 
because it's like has such a big recoil
on<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.239> you<00:02:28.450> can<00:02:29.050> use<00:02:29.200> if<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.470> want<00:02:29.650> if

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
on it so you can use if you want if

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.500 
on it so you can use if you want if
you're<00:02:29.860> really<00:02:30.010> good<00:02:30.190> with<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.430> by<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.330> means

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
you're really good with it by all means

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.300 
you're really good with it by all means
use<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:32.050> pistol<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.560> recommend<00:02:33.129> using

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
use that pistol but I recommend using

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.270 
use that pistol but I recommend using
the<00:02:33.519> m4<00:02:34.030> 43<00:02:34.660> because<00:02:35.290> I<00:02:35.319> find<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.010> high

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the m4 43 because I find it really high

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.430 
the m4 43 because I find it really high
damage<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.970> really<00:02:37.510> low<00:02:37.629> recoil<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.290> works

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
damage and really low recoil so it works

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.800 
damage and really low recoil so it works
very<00:02:38.709> well<00:02:38.860> for<00:02:39.190> having<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:40.360> pull<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.690> out<00:02:40.780> and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
very well for having to pull it out and

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.410 
very well for having to pull it out and
kill<00:02:41.080> your<00:02:41.200> enemies<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.680> now<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.790> lethal<00:02:42.970> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
kill your enemies with now for lethal I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.390 
kill your enemies with now for lethal I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
like using the ID like usual this thing

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.740 
like using the ID like usual this thing
is<00:02:45.489> great<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:45.910> throwing<00:02:46.120> down<00:02:46.330> anywhere<00:02:46.720> in

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
is great for throwing down anywhere in

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.960 
is great for throwing down anywhere in
like<00:02:47.140> hallways<00:02:47.560> doors<00:02:47.860> people<00:02:48.489> run<00:02:48.640> into<00:02:48.790> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
like hallways doors people run into it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.520 
like hallways doors people run into it
they<00:02:49.090> blow<00:02:49.269> up<00:02:49.299> there's<00:02:49.660> an<00:02:49.780> extra<00:02:50.110> kill<00:02:50.319> for

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
they blow up there's an extra kill for

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.350 
they blow up there's an extra kill for
you<00:02:50.680> helps<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.459> lot<00:02:51.549> for<00:02:51.790> cranked<00:02:52.150> if<00:02:52.239> you're

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
running around with this class because

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.559 
running around with this class because

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
it isn't a salt rifle so it's not an SMG

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
really fast and throw it farther helps

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.629 
really fast and throw it farther helps

I<00:04:07.120> put<00:04:07.540> focus<00:04:07.989> on<00:04:08.319> here<00:04:08.530> is<00:04:08.560> my<00:04:08.620> last<00:04:08.980> perk<00:04:09.190> now

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
I put focus on here is my last perk now

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.220 
I put focus on here is my last perk now
focus<00:04:09.819> is<00:04:10.000> one<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.329> best<00:04:10.540> perks<00:04:10.870> in<00:04:11.079> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
focus is one of the best perks in the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.440 
focus is one of the best perks in the
game<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.410> think<00:04:11.590> same<00:04:12.069> with<00:04:12.220> black<00:04:12.400> ops<00:04:12.609> 2<00:04:12.760> focus

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
game I think same with black ops 2 focus

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.030 
game I think same with black ops 2 focus
is<00:04:13.569> pretty<00:04:13.780> much<00:04:13.900> exactly<00:04:14.049> like<00:04:14.470> toughness

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
is pretty much exactly like toughness

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.520 
is pretty much exactly like toughness
just<00:04:15.310> reduces<00:04:15.819> flinch<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.359> sway<00:04:17.109> when<00:04:17.410> you're

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
just reduces flinch and sway when you're

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.469 
just reduces flinch and sway when you're
aiming<00:04:17.769> down<00:04:17.889> sights<00:04:17.950> which<00:04:18.789> is<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.239> nice

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
aiming down sights which is so nice

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.479 
aiming down sights which is so nice
because<00:04:19.750> toughness<00:04:20.530> on<00:04:20.680> black<00:04:20.859> ops<00:04:21.039> 2<00:04:21.220> was

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
because toughness on black ops 2 was

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.640 
because toughness on black ops 2 was
like<00:04:21.729> essential<00:04:22.330> for<00:04:22.479> me<00:04:22.599> too<00:04:22.810> because<00:04:23.020> I'm

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
like essential for me too because I'm

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.800 
like essential for me too because I'm
all<00:04:23.889> about<00:04:23.919> ultimate<00:04:24.610> stability<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.419> when<00:04:25.780> I

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
all about ultimate stability and when I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.600 
all about ultimate stability and when I
get<00:04:26.020> shot<00:04:26.289> that<00:04:26.530> flinch<00:04:26.950> just<00:04:27.280> throws<00:04:27.580> me

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
get shot that flinch just throws me

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.339 
get shot that flinch just throws me
completely<00:04:28.180> off<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.780> don't<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.020> all<00:04:29.169> we

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
completely off and I don't know I all we

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:30.600 
completely off and I don't know I all we
seem<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.560> miss<00:04:29.680> my<00:04:29.860> targets

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
seem to miss my targets

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.700 
seem to miss my targets
so<00:04:30.699> focus<00:04:31.120> keeps<00:04:31.389> me<00:04:31.659> on<00:04:31.780> point<00:04:32.080> and<00:04:32.319> I<00:04:32.560> can

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
so focus keeps me on point and I can

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.649 
so focus keeps me on point and I can
always<00:04:32.919> hit<00:04:33.189> them<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.759> just<00:04:33.819> helps<00:04:34.270> that<00:04:34.479> much

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:34.659 
always hit them it just helps that much

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:37.709 
always hit them it just helps that much
more<00:04:34.870> with<00:04:35.349> reducing<00:04:36.099> that<00:04:36.159> flinch<00:04:36.699> now<00:04:37.240> for

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:37.719 
more with reducing that flinch now for
