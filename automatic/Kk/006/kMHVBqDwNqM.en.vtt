00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.480 
doesn't have its own built-in batteries
so<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.930> strictly<00:01:49.290> keep<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.100> Bluetooth

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
so it's just strictly keep a Bluetooth

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
so it's just strictly keep a Bluetooth
keyboard<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.210> secondly<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
keyboard and secondly is just the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
keyboard and secondly is just the
connection<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.520> it's<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.759> open<00:01:54.180> slot<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
connection here it's an open slot that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
connection here it's an open slot that
pretty<00:01:55.049> much<00:01:55.200> accepts<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> tablet<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.490> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pretty much accepts the tablet like so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.730 
pretty much accepts the tablet like so
it<00:01:56.909> slides<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.079> unfortunately<00:01:58.560> there's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it slides in but unfortunately there's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
it slides in but unfortunately there's
no<00:01:58.860> lock<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.030> tablet<00:02:00.329> could

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
no lock to it so the tablet could

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289 
no lock to it so the tablet could
actually<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:01.259> off<00:02:01.290> very<00:02:01.799> easily<00:02:02.299> the

actually come off very easily the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.709 
actually come off very easily the
display<00:02:03.630> here<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> 5-inch<00:02:04.680> 1080p<00:02:04.979> IPS<00:02:05.790> LCD

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
knowing that it doesn't surprise us that

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.500 
knowing that it doesn't surprise us that
it<00:02:13.990> produces<00:02:14.590> some<00:02:14.830> fine-looking<00:02:15.300> detail<00:02:16.300> so

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it produces some fine-looking detail so

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.870 
it produces some fine-looking detail so

very crisp looking what's most

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.940 
very crisp looking what's most
impressive<00:02:19.270> about<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.020> display<00:02:20.440> is<00:02:20.710> how

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
impressive about the display is how

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.340 
impressive about the display is how
accurate<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.060> color<00:02:22.390> reproduction

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
accurate it is with color reproduction

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.860 
accurate it is with color reproduction
it<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.710> nearly<00:02:24.250> spot-on<00:02:24.880> with<00:02:25.300> every<00:02:25.660> single

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it is nearly spot-on with every single

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.170 
it is nearly spot-on with every single
color<00:02:26.350> viewing<00:02:27.280> angles<00:02:27.520> are<00:02:27.700> good<00:02:27.940> with<00:02:28.030> this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
color viewing angles are good with this

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.690 
color viewing angles are good with this
too<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.050> maintains<00:02:29.440> its<00:02:29.590> cloudy<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.310> has<00:02:30.460> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
too so it maintains its cloudy but has a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.910 
too so it maintains its cloudy but has a
little<00:02:31.030> bit<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.270> weaker<00:02:31.750> brightness<00:02:32.410> output

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
little bit of a weaker brightness output

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.370 
little bit of a weaker brightness output
so<00:02:33.160> outdoor<00:02:33.610> visibility<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.840> challenging

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
so outdoor visibility can be challenging

takes a little bit over four hours for
the<00:06:37.420> battery<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.960> completely<00:06:38.350> charge

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:38.920 
the battery to completely charge

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.190 
the battery to completely charge
luckily<00:06:39.430> the<00:06:39.790> tablet<00:06:40.210> dock<00:06:40.390> has<00:06:40.720> its<00:06:40.960> own

luckily the tablet dock has its own

luckily the tablet dock has its own
internal<00:06:41.590> battery<00:06:42.100> so<00:06:42.550> when<00:06:42.730> it's<00:06:42.880> in<00:06:43.060> there

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
internal battery so when it's in there

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.530 
internal battery so when it's in there
it's<00:06:43.660> gonna<00:06:43.930> recharge<00:06:44.770> the<00:06:45.040> device<00:06:45.370> in<00:06:46.300> a<00:06:46.420> way

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
it's gonna recharge the device in a way

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.650 
it's gonna recharge the device in a way
we<00:06:47.020> can<00:06:47.140> argue<00:06:47.380> that<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:48.160> Asus<00:06:48.520> Padfone<00:06:48.550> X<00:06:49.450> is

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
we can argue that the Asus Padfone X is

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.900 
we can argue that the Asus Padfone X is
that<00:06:49.900> only<00:06:50.200> one<00:06:50.650> device<00:06:50.890> we've<00:06:51.250> been<00:06:51.430> wanting

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
that only one device we've been wanting

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.780 
that only one device we've been wanting
for<00:06:52.420> some<00:06:52.780> time<00:06:53.110> it's<00:06:53.770> a<00:06:53.890> smartphone<00:06:54.310> with<00:06:54.760> a

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:54.790 
for some time it's a smartphone with a

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.340 
for some time it's a smartphone with a
tablet<00:06:55.180> aspect<00:06:55.870> to<00:06:56.140> it

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
tablet aspect to it

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.740 
tablet aspect to it
so<00:06:56.650> you<00:06:56.740> get<00:06:57.040> a<00:06:57.070> lot<00:06:57.340> of<00:06:57.370> functionality<00:06:57.970> out<00:06:58.450> of

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
so you get a lot of functionality out of

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.200 
so you get a lot of functionality out of
it<00:06:58.930> still<00:06:59.440> for<00:06:59.770> the<00:06:59.890> diverse<00:07:00.400> functionality

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 
it still for the diverse functionality

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.270 
it still for the diverse functionality
we<00:07:01.300> get<00:07:01.480> out<00:07:01.630> of<00:07:01.660> it<00:07:01.900> it's<00:07:02.080> not<00:07:02.200> a<00:07:02.500> perfect

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
we get out of it it's not a perfect

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.980 
we get out of it it's not a perfect
smartphone<00:07:04.000> so<00:07:04.330> when<00:07:04.480> you<00:07:04.570> compare<00:07:04.960> it

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
smartphone so when you compare it

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.200 
smartphone so when you compare it
against<00:07:05.320> some<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.650> the<00:07:05.740> flagship<00:07:06.220> devices<00:07:06.640> it

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:07.210 
against some of the flagship devices it

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.120 
against some of the flagship devices it
just<00:07:07.510> doesn't<00:07:07.840> feel<00:07:08.110> as<00:07:08.170> cutting<00:07:08.860> edge<00:07:09.070> as

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
just doesn't feel as cutting edge as

just doesn't feel as cutting edge as
