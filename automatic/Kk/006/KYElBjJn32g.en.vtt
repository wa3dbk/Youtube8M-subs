has it and as luck would have it we have

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.219 
has it and as luck would have it we have
a<00:00:42.649> good<00:00:42.920> reason<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.339> use<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.670> down<00:00:44.479> there<00:00:44.960> dogs

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
a good reason to use it down there dogs

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:46.959 
a good reason to use it down there dogs
I've<00:00:45.859> done<00:00:46.039> a<00:00:46.069> lot<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.309> testing<00:00:46.670> with<00:00:46.699> the

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
I've done a lot of testing with the

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.840 
I've done a lot of testing with the
accuracy<00:00:47.420> is<00:00:47.600> absolutely<00:00:48.199> spot-on<00:00:48.559> but<00:00:48.889> as

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
accuracy is absolutely spot-on but as

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.939 
accuracy is absolutely spot-on but as
you<00:00:49.969> can<00:00:50.120> imagine<00:00:50.210> being<00:00:50.749> 30<00:00:51.049> Cal<00:00:51.350> four<00:00:51.739> or

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
you can imagine being 30 Cal four or

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.799 
you can imagine being 30 Cal four or
fifty<00:00:52.309> or<00:00:52.399> grain<00:00:52.639> pellets<00:00:53.059> is<00:00:53.210> only<00:00:53.510> running

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
fifty or grain pellets is only running

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.169 
fifty or grain pellets is only running
78<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.559> pound<00:00:54.889> eight<00:00:55.159> hundred<00:00:55.549> and<00:00:55.579> forty

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
78 for pound eight hundred and forty

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.229 
78 for pound eight hundred and forty
eight<00:00:56.299> hundred<00:00:56.329> fifty<00:00:56.719> feet<00:00:57.049> per<00:00:57.229> second<00:00:57.649> the

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
eight hundred fifty feet per second the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.489 
eight hundred fifty feet per second the
trajectory<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.359> very<00:00:59.569> very<00:00:59.809> loopy<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.440> you

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
trajectory is very very loopy so you

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.349 
trajectory is very very loopy so you
need<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.280> spend<00:01:01.519> a<00:01:01.670> lot<00:01:01.819> of<00:01:01.850> time<00:01:02.089> and<00:01:02.299> know

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
need to spend a lot of time and know

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.819 
need to spend a lot of time and know
your<00:01:02.510> trajectory<00:01:02.659> one<00:01:03.319> of<00:01:03.440> the<00:01:03.499> hardest

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
your trajectory one of the hardest

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.289 
your trajectory one of the hardest
things<00:01:03.949> at<00:01:04.100> night<00:01:04.129> is<00:01:04.519> obviously<00:01:04.820> range<00:01:05.089> hike

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
things at night is obviously range hike

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.410 
things at night is obviously range hike
which<00:01:05.690> is<00:01:05.869> why<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:08.000> know<00:01:08.090> we're<00:01:08.240> a<00:01:08.270> very

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
which is why you know we're a very

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.210 
which is why you know we're a very
little<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.470> we're<00:01:09.560> going<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.740> be<00:01:09.799> using<00:01:09.979> some

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
little so we're going to be using some

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.820 
little so we're going to be using some
digital<00:01:10.640> night<00:01:10.790> vision<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:11.390> fixed<00:01:12.140> position<00:01:12.350> if

100% sure that Fox is at 55 meters

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.280 
100% sure that Fox is at 55 meters
because<00:01:20.360> it's<00:01:20.510> going<00:01:20.660> to<00:01:20.720> be<00:01:20.810> clean<00:01:21.080> head
