where he's about to run to and you know

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.270 
where he's about to run to and you know
depending<00:00:36.140> on<00:00:36.230> how<00:00:36.559> many<00:00:36.739> arrows<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.129> can

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
depending on how many arrows you can

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.560 
depending on how many arrows you can
concentrate<00:00:37.520> more<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.850> getting<00:00:38.270> really<00:00:38.510> good

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
concentrate more and getting really good

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.670 
concentrate more and getting really good
shots<00:00:38.809> if<00:00:38.960> you've<00:00:39.050> got<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.170> lot<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.410> hours<00:00:39.590> you

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
shots if you've got a lot of hours you

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.440 
shots if you've got a lot of hours you
can<00:00:39.800> sort<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.070> just<00:00:40.250> do<00:00:40.700> it<00:00:40.760> randomly<00:00:40.969> I<00:00:41.120> see

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
can sort of just do it randomly I see

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.150 
can sort of just do it randomly I see
there<00:00:41.629> I've<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.930> lot<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:42.530> they're<00:00:42.680> one<00:00:42.890> shot

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
there I've a lot but they're one shot

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.200 
there I've a lot but they're one shot
there<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:43.640> another<00:00:43.760> shot<00:00:44.030> there

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
there and then another shot there

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.549 
there and then another shot there
because<00:00:44.390> I<00:00:44.480> judged<00:00:44.960> where<00:00:45.170> he<00:00:45.230> was<00:00:45.350> going<00:00:45.500> to

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
because I judged where he was going to

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.950 
because I judged where he was going to
run<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.399> that's<00:00:46.579> how<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.789> use<00:00:46.940> a<00:00:47.120> bow<00:00:47.359> in<00:00:47.659> terms

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
run so that's how you use a bow in terms

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.139 
run so that's how you use a bow in terms
of<00:00:48.079> leading<00:00:48.260> your<00:00:48.379> arrows<00:00:48.820> one<00:00:49.820> thing<00:00:49.999> that

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
of leading your arrows one thing that

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.220 
of leading your arrows one thing that
you<00:00:50.239> don't<00:00:50.359> want<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.659> do<00:00:50.749> when<00:00:50.899> someone<00:00:51.199> is

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
you don't want to do when someone is

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.959

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
is running forward and backwards you

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.399 
is running forward and backwards you
know<00:00:58.159> juking<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:58.789> dodging<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.149> arrows<00:00:59.449> this

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
guy just run in a straight line so is

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.399 
guy just run in a straight line so is
easy<00:01:01.789> to<00:01:01.940> judge<00:01:02.179> where<00:01:02.420> he<00:01:02.569> was<00:01:02.690> running<00:01:03.050> so

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
easy to judge where he was running so

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.160 
easy to judge where he was running so
that's<00:01:04.370> why<00:01:04.519> he<00:01:04.940> was<00:01:05.300> being<00:01:05.449> hit<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:05.690> much<00:01:05.960> if

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that's why he was being hit so much if

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.510 
that's why he was being hit so much if
he<00:01:06.260> was<00:01:06.409> dodging<00:01:06.740> properly<00:01:07.130> he<00:01:07.280> would<00:01:07.430> have

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
he was dodging properly he would have

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.520 
he was dodging properly he would have
gotten<00:01:07.670> away<00:01:07.850> and<00:01:08.210> maybe<00:01:08.330> regen<00:01:08.750> beat<00:01:09.080> me<00:01:09.260> but

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
gotten away and maybe regen beat me but

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.050 
gotten away and maybe regen beat me but
what<00:01:09.770> he<00:01:09.860> did<00:01:10.010> was<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.220> run<00:01:10.430> in<00:01:10.550> this<00:01:10.670> one

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
what he did was just run in this one

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.969 
what he did was just run in this one
direction<00:01:11.510> and<00:01:11.659> never<00:01:12.229> really<00:01:12.440> -<00:01:12.590> -<00:01:12.770> dodged

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
direction and never really - - dodged

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.969 
direction and never really - - dodged
and<00:01:13.340> made<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.909> easy<00:01:14.030> for<00:01:14.150> me<00:01:14.330> to<00:01:14.360> shoot<00:01:14.510> him<00:01:14.979> so

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
and made it easy for me to shoot him so

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.050 
and made it easy for me to shoot him so
now<00:01:16.100> we're<00:01:16.190> gonna<00:01:16.280> look<00:01:16.430> at<00:01:16.580> how<00:01:16.670> you<00:01:16.729> dodge

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
now we're gonna look at how you dodge

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.080 
now we're gonna look at how you dodge
arrows<00:01:18.070> okay<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.130> when<00:01:19.370> you're<00:01:19.520> dodging<00:01:19.850> ours

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
arrows okay so when you're dodging ours

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.610 
arrows okay so when you're dodging ours
what<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.330> want<00:01:20.480> to<00:01:20.570> do<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.960> go<00:01:21.170> side<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.470> side

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
what you want to do is go side to side

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.500 
what you want to do is go side to side
but<00:01:22.100> switch<00:01:22.400> it<00:01:22.580> up<00:01:22.730> don't<00:01:23.030> go<00:01:23.150> in<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.300> same

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
but switch it up don't go in the same

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.540 
but switch it up don't go in the same
order<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.170> example<00:01:24.860> you're<00:01:25.010> going<00:01:25.040> left<00:01:25.400> and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
order so example you're going left and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.650 
order so example you're going left and
right<00:01:25.640> left<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.090> right<00:01:26.180> they're<00:01:26.420> going<00:01:26.540> to

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
right left and right they're going to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.730 
right left and right they're going to
figure<00:01:26.780> out<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.050> you're<00:01:27.260> going<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.530> same

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
figure out that you're going the same

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.560 
figure out that you're going the same
order<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.220> eventually<00:01:28.670> just<00:01:28.820> start<00:01:29.120> leading

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
order and eventually just start leading

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.600 
order and eventually just start leading
that<00:01:29.870> direction<00:01:30.170> what<00:01:30.800> you<00:01:30.950> want<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:31.370> is

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
that direction what you want to do is

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.430 
that direction what you want to do is
change<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.630> they<00:01:32.750> can't<00:01:32.960> really<00:01:33.080> judge

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
change it up so they can't really judge

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.230 
change it up so they can't really judge
which<00:01:34.130> direction<00:01:34.400> you're<00:01:34.580> going<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.120> way

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
which direction you're going in that way

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.090 
which direction you're going in that way
you'll<00:01:35.390> say<00:01:35.570> live<00:01:35.720> longer<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:36.920> just

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
you'll say live longer and you can just

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.460 
you'll say live longer and you can just
avoid<00:01:37.310> them<00:01:37.490> for<00:01:37.730> even<00:01:38.000> longer<00:01:38.230> now<00:01:39.230> I'm<00:01:39.320> going

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
avoid them for even longer now I'm going

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.870 
avoid them for even longer now I'm going
to<00:01:39.530> show<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.650> how<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:39.860> can<00:01:40.040> use<00:01:40.220> hip<00:01:40.430> boxes<00:01:40.760> in

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
