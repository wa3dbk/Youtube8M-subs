00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.010 
there's so much detail in these figures
just<00:04:37.490> take<00:04:37.730> a<00:04:37.760> look<00:04:38.120> at<00:04:38.300> her<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.720> there<00:04:38.870> is

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
just take a look at her and there is

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.900 
just take a look at her and there is
like<00:04:39.970> like<00:04:40.970> she<00:04:41.270> looks<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:41.720> accurate<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:42.530> like

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
like like she looks so accurate to like

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.660 
like like she looks so accurate to like
her<00:04:43.910> original<00:04:44.200> doll<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:46.040> just<00:04:46.190> so<00:04:46.430> much

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
her original doll it's just so much

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.110 
her original doll it's just so much
detail<00:04:47.060> on<00:04:47.270> these<00:04:47.630> like<00:04:48.140> in<00:04:48.470> their<00:04:48.710> eyes<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
detail on these like in their eyes the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.790 
detail on these like in their eyes the
reason<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.450> thought<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.870> she<00:04:51.080> looks<00:04:51.290> so<00:04:51.500> givi

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
reason I thought that she looks so givi

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.470 
reason I thought that she looks so givi
is<00:04:52.040> because<00:04:52.310> she<00:04:52.460> has<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.580> little<00:04:52.790> bat<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.270> there

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
is because she has a little bat in there

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.630 
is because she has a little bat in there
and<00:04:53.840> it<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.770> makes<00:04:54.920> her<00:04:55.100> look<00:04:55.250> so<00:04:55.520> adorable

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
and it just makes her look so adorable

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.020 
and it just makes her look so adorable
um<00:04:56.420> I<00:04:57.290> think<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.390> cool<00:04:59.690> yeah<00:04:59.930> I<00:05:00.760> think<00:05:01.760> she

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
um I think what is cool yeah I think she

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.640 
um I think what is cool yeah I think she
has<00:05:02.180> little<00:05:02.420> cherries<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.170> there

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
has little cherries in there

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.490 
has little cherries in there
she<00:05:04.490> has<00:05:04.670> cherries<00:05:05.030> all<00:05:05.180> over<00:05:05.390> her<00:05:05.540> shirt<00:05:05.840> um

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
she has cherries all over her shirt um

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.070 
she has cherries all over her shirt um
those<00:05:06.830> are<00:05:06.860> either<00:05:07.070> cherries<00:05:07.820> yeah<00:05:08.600> those<00:05:08.930> are

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
those are either cherries yeah those are

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.990 
those are either cherries yeah those are
probably<00:05:09.200> cherries<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:09.980> they<00:05:10.340> also<00:05:10.580> kind<00:05:10.880> of

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
probably cherries but they also kind of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.430 
probably cherries but they also kind of
look<00:05:11.090> like<00:05:11.120> music<00:05:11.630> notes<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:11.990> guess<00:05:12.170> that's

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
look like music notes I guess that's

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.130 
look like music notes I guess that's
just<00:05:12.530> to<00:05:12.740> me<00:05:12.860> though<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:17.180> yeah<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:17.990> guess

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
just to me though but yeah so I guess

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.630 
just to me though but yeah so I guess
they<00:05:18.410> each<00:05:18.560> has<00:05:18.830> something<00:05:19.160> different<00:05:19.580> in

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
they each has something different in

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.920 
they each has something different in
their<00:05:19.790> eyes<00:05:20.650> it's<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:21.860> cool<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:23.630> then<00:05:23.750> like
