00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
gonna be loud I can define the own

bottom

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.530 

so<00:01:48.100> yeah<00:01:48.310> that's<00:01:48.580> probably<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.120> best<00:01:49.330> way<00:01:49.510> to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
so yeah that's probably the best way to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.050 
so yeah that's probably the best way to
do<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.080> because<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.520> completely<00:01:51.520> capture<00:01:52.000> a

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
do it because it completely capture a

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.050 
do it because it completely capture a
little<00:01:52.210> bit<00:01:52.980> no<00:01:53.980> because<00:01:54.280> I'm<00:01:54.430> showing<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
little bit no because I'm showing the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.030 
little bit no because I'm showing the
bomb<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.450> needles<00:01:55.810> have<00:01:55.900> come<00:01:56.470> out<00:01:56.620> because

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
bomb the needles have come out because

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.240 
bomb the needles have come out because
of<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.400> option<00:01:57.910> but<00:01:58.530> well<00:01:59.530> right<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:02.410> yeah

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
of this option but well right so yeah

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.550 
of this option but well right so yeah
what's<00:02:03.760> like<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.720> said<00:02:04.900> probably<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.260> best<00:02:05.410> way

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
what's like I said probably the best way

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.660 
what's like I said probably the best way
to<00:02:05.590> get<00:02:05.920> rid<00:02:06.100> of<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.340> successfully<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.640> I
