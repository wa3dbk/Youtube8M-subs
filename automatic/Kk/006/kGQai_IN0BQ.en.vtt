00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
it becomes a pretty good idea to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.820 
it becomes a pretty good idea to
supplement<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.849> type<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.270> stuff<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:10.289> with

anyway i would i would recommend

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.240 
anyway i would i would recommend
integrating<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:22.140> into<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.680> survival

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
integrating these into your survival

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.490 
integrating these into your survival
diet<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.910> survival<00:02:24.390> situation<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
diet in a survival situation the the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.520 
diet in a survival situation the the
percentages<00:02:29.220> here<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> look<00:02:31.320> out<00:02:31.500> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
percentages here you going to look out a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.750 
percentages here you going to look out a
little<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.550> talk<00:02:32.730> about

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
little bit on what they talk about

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.610 
little bit on what they talk about
serving<00:02:33.360> size<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:35.100> seems<00:02:35.670> like<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:37.440> bigger

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
serving size so it seems like the bigger

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.490 
serving size so it seems like the bigger
one<00:02:37.980> has<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.820> little<00:02:39.120> more<00:02:39.240> going<00:02:39.570> on<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:40.050> far<00:02:40.080> as

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
one has a little more going on as far as

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.080 
one has a little more going on as far as
you<00:02:40.650> by<00:02:40.800> your<00:02:41.010> movement<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.580> stuff<00:02:41.850> goes

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
you by your movement all that stuff goes

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.380 
you by your movement all that stuff goes
so<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.960> definitely<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> better<00:02:43.710> deal<00:02:44.390> once

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
so it's definitely the better deal once

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.170 
so it's definitely the better deal once
it's<00:02:45.570> open<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.170> shop<00:02:46.560> life<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.070> gone<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
it's open to the shop life is gone you

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.660 
it's open to the shop life is gone you
know<00:02:48.270> you'll<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.250> probably<00:02:50.580> go

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
know you'll need to you can probably go

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.460 
know you'll need to you can probably go
