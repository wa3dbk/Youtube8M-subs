00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:13.699
 q 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.609
 many people 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.060
 I just sat down this time 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 if i do get a whole lot of course 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.610
 I'm sitting here just to look back on a good bit of practice 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.149
 I am coming behind us for the Olympic Games 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
 I don't have to explain to you that a lot has happened 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.270
 everyone has not been told that this is what they are 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.820
 hectic time 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.460
 but i have in this clan i want to talk to you about is actually about 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.780
 two faces of vancouver 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.030
 on the one hand and I have experienced wonderful preparation 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.380
 with a very successful first week 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.350
 that lead to gold medals from sven kramer 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.910
 on the five kilometers and a gold medal perhaps for some people 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.230
 Surprisingly, but we already saw a bit coming for the cler one 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.780
 must 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.560
 in the fifteen countries 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.200
 and then 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.240
 a black day in my coach career the second week 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620
 those were also central 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.439
 who has shown a completely different character and has been a difficult week for healing 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.499
 I would like to discuss these two topics with you in this clip 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.720
 so I had those two faces about it 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.240
 of the winter Olympics in Vancouver 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.150
 I will name the theme in the first part 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 working towards a top performance 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.910
 and the second part 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.840
 is it actually dealing with setbacks 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 sound a little bit I think aniek crisis management had to be done days 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.820
 by my own doing 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.480
 crisis management mainly takes place on myself 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.020
 I was not used to that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.760
 but also direction strict 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.030
 yes the relationship between sven 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 and being a coach in big money 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.070
 but had to keep the whole team in mind later 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.039
 and me alone 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.200
 and for as good as it went 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 It was still important for me to go somewhat to the outside world 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.060
 what to do only there is of course always a passage between namely 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.740
 media 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.130
 who brings out my message 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.800
 the first subject but i have met 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.360
 the end up everywhere 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.879
 is working towards a top performance 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.089
 starts very clearly in the basics with knowledge 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.249
 yes ends 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.329
 at the moment that you are working towards a top performance closer to the top 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 performance comes work more from your intuition 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.709
 in the end it is true that if I am near such a 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.179
 such a top performance 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:33.289
 then j is the core is still linked to the base in my case that means 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.839
 then 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.910
 in a patient who is ill training 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.719
 that can be a body 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.199
 but the tuft of the victim on the cake comes much more from intuition 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.770
 that gives this a perk it is a piece of python management you have there 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.130
 deal with one 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.830
 sports talk with an athlete the end knows coaching of the sport 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.859
 working towards a top performance 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.430
 What is also very important is that you as a leader as the basis of the whole 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.350
 very clear 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.209
 one that controls the situation 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.060
 it is a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.489
 and a situation of extreme pressure 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.900
 extreme stress 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.990
 the situation with us still occurs only once in four years 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.460
 that you don't recognize because it's not a good idea 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.669
 if jannes boss shows that your situation was under control 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.169
 that gives peace 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.169
 in brustem combination with the greatness of the event 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.240
 so a nice combination that allows motivation missions so that the span 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.129
 in peace 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.359
 that comes back and that can ultimately give a good balance 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.359
 can really work 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.200
 I can perform at the right time and I can deliver top performance 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.320
 the second topic that we do not link 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.129
 at the olympic winter games in vancouver 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.179
 that was also very clearly linked to that second 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:51.079
 he stepped with the ten kilometers of sven 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.489
 where I make a gross mistake 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.229
 and let it be clear 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.949
 that they disappoint 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.619
 just as unexpected for me 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.400
 if it happened throughout the Netherlands it was natural 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.219
 an intention that was very pure 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.620
 a problem in this case was a pitch problem in this case that is so one 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:11.149
 setback 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.489
 one and there we are talking about dealing with a phone that is also one 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.819
 was caused 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.269
 by in this case say the boss himself 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.449
 In the process of thinking back and about, a number of points are very bad 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.879
 been important 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.349
 First, it was clear to me 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:29.770
 just had to take responsibility 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.890
 I couldn't hide behind that mistake couldn't blame it on anyone 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.890
 give differently 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.379
 Clearly my mistake I knew that right 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.550
 I also communicated immediately 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.900
 it was my fault 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.090
 what I did that responsibility so I hopefully right on my own 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.439
 taken 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.599
 The second set is that I am not in the first hours 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.569
 especially after stopping not to stop 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.120
 we have shown I have shown myself 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.120
 then I am just a little bit that position that 3 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.550
 find peace rest have paid my emotions a little bit a chance now 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.460
 also do not want to snatch away 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.589
 but according to 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:10.129
 it is according to a fourth phase I say to be a little distracted too 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.779
 are an incubator in this case 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:16.429
 have been eating out with the staff and am talking about completely different things 8 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.800
 the next day the combining was again very important 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.990
 for the same situation as immediately after the race immediately after the moment 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.800
 from the setback 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.009
 what are you going to do are you going to hide or confront 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.889
 and also in the second instance 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.460
 I chose not to walk away, I showed the face again 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.540
 to the press but especially 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.350
 I opted to use the shelves to pick up the work again 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.010
 do what I did the day before 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.120
 and what I am in a normal situation 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.659
 of course we just get gold 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.069
 had done 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.000
 if that team leader is back on the ice the coach can pick up and 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.000
 that we do the ball by hand 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.569
 what i had to do 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:01.550
 the nice thing when i tell this story is when i go back to it 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.879
 for example working towards a top performance 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:08.449
 everything that came about was of course not something in a text 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.280
 book was that I could not base on a piece of knowledge 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.030
 we are certainly not on a piece of experience so I had to do this completely 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.830
 from my intuition 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.200
 and when you get it back 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.430
 then it also appears that in difficult times 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.580
 ten so just really needs a leader even though he has led the mistake 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.270
 made i have to get out i have to get over it 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.980
 and certainly in this case 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.119
 expects the athlete in question 9 as a twente 

00:06:35.119 --> 00:06:37.310
 I also expect that I am just the leader 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.279
 remains in question 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.849
 also this time 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.419
 I have another assignment for 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.029
 maybe you can place yourself in my situation maybe 

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:48.190
 you have yourself 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.289
 a turning point has been experienced dramatically that could come true 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.059
 how would you be in such a situation 

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:56.499
 others 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.899
 and what has learned purely 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:02.959
 that situation with you or perhaps what you have learned from the situation then 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:07.099
 I would like to hear your opinion 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.569
 on the fight on that and linkin 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:10.610
 it's no more 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.419
 the back at the next 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.399
 business coach 2 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:16.879
 I know who went 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.240
 how to handle gordon 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.020
 with positive and negative stress
