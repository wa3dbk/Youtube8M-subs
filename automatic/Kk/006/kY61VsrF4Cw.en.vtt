 how to plant a tree first thing 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.890
 must do to prepare to plant 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.139
 a tree is to dig a hole remove the 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.600
 top layer with grass making a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 circle is at least twice 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.060
 as wide as the container where it is 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.369
 the tree place the top layer with 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 Pasture in a pile at the side start 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.370
 to dig his hole placing the earth in 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.309
 a separate stack of the top layer 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.579
 grass must escape hole 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.339
 so that when the tree is planted the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.190
 place where the trunk is widened 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:50.190
 at the same height or slightly above 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.979
 up to two to one inch of the level 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 of the land or the land surrounding the 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.649
 trunk the areas where the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.319
 trunk is at the base of the trunk where 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.619
 ends the trunk and the roots begin 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:08.310
 It is noticeably wider than the rest 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.369
 of the trunk use your shovel to measure the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.969
 size of the root ball and check 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.570
 If your hole is cape, the 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.119
 adequate depth remove the tree from the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.850
 container releasing it first of 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.030
 the sides of the container shake the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.920
 cube where the tree is and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.920
 Remove the root set 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.829
 Massage the roots to release them and 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.490
 allow the tree to grow 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.090
 properly check if there is any root 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.000
 that grows surrounding surrounding the roots or 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.640
 that is bent and remove the if the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.539
 roots are flexible can stretch 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.179
 to straighten up place the tree in the 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.560
 center of the hole and so that is 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:11.459
 right and do not hinder the grass come back 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.920
 to fill his hole I stepped on it as I 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.310
 go filling to eliminate the spaces 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.310
 of air 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.040
 make a watering ditch around the 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:31.340
 tree so that the water goes directly 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.609
 to the roots take the pieces of layer 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.390
 top with grass and place them with the 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.189
 Grass down around the hole 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.680
 compact additional land against 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:44.790
 top layer with grass to create a 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.549
 berm 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.379
 remove the stakes and ties that have 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.379
 come with the nursery tree 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.980
 bringing their stakes up 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.510
 vertically beyond the roots 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.750
 approximately one foot from the base of the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.750
 trunk 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.500
 before ties in the lower third 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.500
 From the tree 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.550
 leaving it between two and three inches of 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.190
 movement 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.030
 slowly water your tree with 15 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.030
 gallons of water 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.780
 cover the area that has planted the tree and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.590
 the berm with a layer of pieces 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.010
 organic between 3 and 4 inches of 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.010
 thick 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.680
 remember the trees need the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.409
 people and people need trees 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:09.170
