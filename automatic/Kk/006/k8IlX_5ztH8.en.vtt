so here's my clean sound let's jump
right<00:01:09.130> in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.830 

now<00:01:19.570> I'll<00:01:19.750> be<00:01:19.870> starting<00:01:20.170> with<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.530> cleanest

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
now I'll be starting with the cleanest

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.020 
now I'll be starting with the cleanest
setting<00:01:22.840> on<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.200> pedal<00:01:23.620> so<00:01:24.460> here's<00:01:24.910> what

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
setting on this pedal so here's what

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:35.870 
setting on this pedal so here's what
that<00:01:25.060> sounds<00:01:25.210> like

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.330 

all<00:01:36.880> right<00:01:37.030> let's<00:01:37.660> take<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.840> look<00:01:38.080> at<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.340> which

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
all right let's take a look at the which

00:01:39.340 --> 00:02:08.609 
all right let's take a look at the which
is<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.200> all<00:01:42.010> right<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:08.140> let's<00:02:08.350> turn<00:02:08.560> up

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
is on this all right now let's turn up

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:41.820 
is on this all right now let's turn up
the<00:02:08.739> peak<00:02:09.040> a<00:02:09.160> little<00:02:09.429> bit<00:02:09.520> more<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.620> switch

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
the peak a little bit more the switch

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.140 
the peak a little bit more the switch
all<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.100> way<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.400> right<00:02:42.430> controls<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
all the way on the right controls the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.270 
all the way on the right controls the
range<00:02:43.360> of<00:02:43.510> frequencies<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.709> we<00:02:44.799> turn<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
range of frequencies so if we turn it to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220 
range of frequencies so if we turn it to
the<00:02:45.400> low<00:02:45.610> setting<00:02:45.940> uh<00:02:46.090> let's<00:02:46.989> see<00:02:47.080> what<00:02:47.200> that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the low setting uh let's see what that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:03:03.180 
the low setting uh let's see what that
sounds<00:02:47.440> like<00:03:01.530> now<00:03:02.530> here's<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.890> other<00:03:02.980> one

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
sounds like now here's the other one

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.789 
sounds like now here's the other one
back<00:03:03.310> maybe<00:03:06.930> cool<00:03:07.930> now<00:03:08.170> let's<00:03:08.380> check<00:03:08.530> out<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
back maybe cool now let's check out the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:21.009 
back maybe cool now let's check out the
mid<00:03:09.040> pass<00:03:09.340> filter

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:30.350 

now<00:03:22.019> let's<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.560> highest<00:03:22.950> range<00:03:29.360> now

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
now let's go to the highest range now

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.759 
now let's go to the highest range now
let's<00:03:30.569> hear<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.780> mid-range<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.560> more<00:03:31.680> time

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
let's hear that mid-range one more time

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:49.759 
let's hear that mid-range one more time
and<00:03:34.769> now<00:03:35.459> let's<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.760> to<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.940> low<00:03:36.120> setting<00:03:48.769> now

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and now let's go to the low setting now

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.979 
and now let's go to the low setting now
if<00:03:49.920> we<00:03:50.040> flip<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.549> drive<00:03:50.879> button<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.510> actually

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
if we flip the drive button it actually

00:03:51.989 --> 00:04:00.680 
if we flip the drive button it actually
can<00:03:52.410> reverses<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.310> wave<00:03:59.209> so<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.329> definitely

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
can reverses the wave so it's definitely

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.250 
can reverses the wave so it's definitely
a<00:04:00.750> cool<00:04:00.989> sound<00:04:01.340> builder<00:04:02.340> okay

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.809 

now<00:04:07.800> let's<00:04:08.010> go<00:04:08.159> ahead<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.430> check<00:04:08.610> that<00:04:08.640> out

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
now let's go ahead and check that out

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:29.510 
now let's go ahead and check that out
with<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.690> filter<00:04:10.080> on<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.500> mid-range<00:04:28.520> now

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
with the filter on the mid-range now

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.550 
with the filter on the mid-range now
finally<00:04:30.090> let's<00:04:30.330> turn<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.810> filter<00:04:31.020> on<00:04:31.290> to<00:04:31.440> the

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
finally let's turn the filter on to the

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:48.230 
finally let's turn the filter on to the
high<00:04:31.800> range<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:46.560> now<00:04:47.370> let's<00:04:47.610> once<00:04:47.820> again<00:04:47.880> turn

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
high range and now let's once again turn

00:04:48.240 --> 00:05:04.000 
high range and now let's once again turn
it<00:04:48.389> back<00:04:48.570> into<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.930> funk<00:04:49.169> setting

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.320 

now<00:05:05.010> let's<00:05:05.190> hear<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.370> clean<00:05:05.760> setting<00:05:06.030> once

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
now let's hear the clean setting once

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.900 
now let's hear the clean setting once
again

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:25.540
