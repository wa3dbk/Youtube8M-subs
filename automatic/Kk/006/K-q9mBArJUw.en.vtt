00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:07.790
 oh wow i get lately 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.490
 there are so many questions about sugar 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.170
 or about carbohydrates and it seemed to me 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.060
 nice to make a whole video there 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.600
 because it is so bad in it nowadays 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.910
 news 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.820
 sugars carbohydrates what do they do with you 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.440
 body stuff and I want 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.869
 tell exactly disappointment 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.940
 actually explain as well as possible how 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.800
 what sugars do with your body how 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.960
 it is recorded how you react 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.160
 body on it and for how the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.230
 different types 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.629
 carbohydrates what type do you have and what 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.729
 do them with you with your blood values 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.949
 I want to make today any clear 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:41.269
 with a number 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.780
 drawings 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:47.629
 it is quite a difficult physiological 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.129
 chemical story but I still try this way 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.710
 clearly possible to do for you 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.120
 actually make it simple i hope 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.850
 that you liked to see I have 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.319
 a very specific question you got eyes 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.629
 I believe from Bart 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.159
 thank you bart and i hope i like it 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.190
 which can make it clearer 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.909
 watch this video go well there 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.799
 we then 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.270
 I sailed a little physiologically 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.890
 story was going to be and I want you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.710
 first go tell what 's actually there 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.800
 happened when you eat carbs you see 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.570
 here the esophagus if you eat something 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 got it through the esophagus 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.300
 so your stomach and your stomach starts with 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.980
 digesting the carbohydrates or 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.600
 actually several nutrients 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.450
 talk to me about the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.420
 carbohydrates that made from carbohydrates 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.930
 so finer in smaller pieces and then 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.420
 they go through to your intestines 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.910
 if they come here clear then get it 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.680
 the pancreas a signal 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.720
 the pancreas involves a hormone 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.480
 make that is insulin 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 draw it as small dots and 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.409
 insulin is released to the intestines 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.540
 those carbohydrates go from the intestines 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.790
 that have since been demolished until 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.740
 glucose globules these round globules 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.770
 that see here are transported 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 to the blood and also to the insulin 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.509
 is made by pancreas goes through the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.310
 intestines to blood in here is also one 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.040
 ball with a dot 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.489
 so and you offered glucose and a dot 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.580
 insulin the blood comes in, and in that 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.140
 by both glucose and insulin 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.660
 your blood that the that combination again 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.819
 deliver to the body cells and only if 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.810
 it is in your cells then your body can 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.180
 something with it 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.800
 it is stored as glycogen and as 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.620
 it is too much glycogen, it becomes 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.560
 ultimately saved as fat so the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.489
 tied to that bullet 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.810
 insulin, the glucose as the ball 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.540
 cells in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.340
 and is it really high in the body 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.930
 blood sugar value so if there are many 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.670
 glucose is in the blood 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.739
 the body is not very nice 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 so that's why it transports it so fast 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.090
 possibly to the cells 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.349
 now we know what exactly is happening in it 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.030
 I also agree with you on the body 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.860
 look at what happens in it 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.780
 blood with the different types 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.580
 carbohydrates that we actually have 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.680
 put simply have two types 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.650
 carbohydrates you have as they call 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.230
 fast sugars that are two globules 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.060
 glucose together and you have the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.260
 complex carbohydrates 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.900
 slow sugars 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.019
 that is a lot of balls of glucose 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.359
 to each other that sit slow sugars 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.190
 for example in whole grain products such as 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.230
 brown rice whole grain bread 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.720
 potatoes like that 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.370
 it contains starch and dietary fiber 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.660
 and that is therefore a very long line 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.160
 all of those little balls 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.859
 each other 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.239
 these are the quick sugars and those 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.889
 are in cookies for example 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.500
 sweets but also a boulder a small 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.209
 little bit of fruit like that 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.530
 and for example in table sugar such as 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.810
 we know it 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.600
 you've seen that that very long 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.000
 molecule can be properly broken down into one 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.319
 receipt so glucose to such a small 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.790
 ball 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.889
 that appointment is made by the stomach 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.750
 and through the intestines every time mother one 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.250
 ball can be broken off and that is what I can do 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.600
 to the bloodstream and another bullet 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.000
 broken off in the can then to the 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.730
 bloodstream in the blood that looks like 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.160
 follows from it is slowly released 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.940
 So the blood sugar level is going to rise 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.389
 The Pancreas Farmer The Pancreas 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.519
 produces that insulin and then the 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.650
 absorbed in the cells so the blood we 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.469
 the dropping again and then comes 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.479
 about three if you have blood sugar 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.819
 below which the three comes then you really notice 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.279
 that you get hungry you start shaking and you 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:35.360
 just crave something you are hungry 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:38.129
 and that it is around this point with that 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.249
 slow carbohydrate is about after 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.990
 about two three hours because it is whole 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.490
 is recorded slowly 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.900
 the stanley carbohydrates that only need 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.819
 but through the middle and both of them fat 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.680
 globules of glucose can therefore cause bleeding 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.870
 the increase in blood sugar value 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.389
 much quicker because of the very much insulin 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.599
 produced making you very fast too 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.039
 those couples put glucose back in it 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.259
 body can come 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.349
 you also fall very quickly and as a result 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.689
 get to those three very quickly and you have 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.419
 quickly notice that you notice, for example 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.219
 if you have a candy or a biscuit or 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.930
 I 've just taken something like that a lot 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:18.029
 pull back faster than if you do something 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.580
 eaten with a lot of fiber 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:22.529
 but then you will be full of this for much longer 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.960
 you can use very well in you 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.819
 nutrition because if you have less sugars 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.379
 used is to add less sugar to 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.599
 certain things you just have a lot 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:33.120
 less likely to pull again because you last longer 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.710
 maintains a full feeling for it all 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.180
 exactly what happens in your body is therefore one 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.919
 very complex story i have it 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.849
 tried to be as simple as possible again 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.129
 to give 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.139
 I hope that a little bit is successful 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.490
 well that was the story about the sugars 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.169
 I hope to give you a piece 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.909
 clearer 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.129
 I already understand a lot of questions
