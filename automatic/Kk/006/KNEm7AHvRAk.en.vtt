00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.690
 word 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 let's go to the third figure 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.610
 fraser versus 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.610
 no no 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.799
 It seems that it has opened well 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.400
 here is the base 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.180
 not only based on 10 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.180
 we wait 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.770
 here as you see there 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.770
 a fist 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170
 now we have it 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 i 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.620
 let's go to the box 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.620
 it fits well 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.830
 This is 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.830
 bigger than the previous ones 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.909
 how to be well 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.710
 as you can see 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 to be in costume 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460
 very currada 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.110
 being here for the moment and we go to each 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.110
 state before here is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.000
 this is lovely 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 it's huge 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.039
 it's a span 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.369
 of mine that are line and two 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.369
 spans 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's put it there 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.270
 in this perhaps and that it would take a 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.360
 little bit of your Peru because as you can 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.360
 watch 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.870
 the perfect fit will be like this but in 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.920
 how much do you let it go it moves a little bit 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.459
 it is not going to fall 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.459
 but 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.330
 put a little bit of the time 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.250
 the other arm 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.060
 and quite long is great 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.390
 someone with care why 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.390
 the truth that these pieces are fragile 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.600
 It has a special lace, so it's 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.600
 very easy to see the posture in which it goes 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.050
 like the previous ones 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.050
 yes 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.670
 or 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.550
 the first option would be the fist 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.650
 it seems that the fist does not quite fit 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.390
 I do not know if I have put it on 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.319
 a little bit wrong 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.849
 it costs to fit 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.270
 the truth is that I do not want to press 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.190
 a lot because 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.190
 I do not intend to put a fist 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.670
 I guess it squeezes you could sit 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.859
 but 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.449
 better than not 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.879
 the truth is that if you want to put the 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.879
 fist this would be a considerable failure 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.940
 and now let's put something halo 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.810
 this fits perfectly as you can 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.270
 see not like the other half left 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.100
 stepped out 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.570
 maybe 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.570
 knock on bojan's chest 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.370
 this is awesome 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.690
 is almost the most impact 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.690
 of the diagram 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.280
 well let's go for the next
