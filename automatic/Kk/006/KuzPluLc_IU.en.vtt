okay<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:46.770> how<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> by

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
okay and how do you do you do that by

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
okay and how do you do you do that by
scoring<00:00:49.410> cards<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.100> your<00:00:50.190> wreck<00:00:50.420> so

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
scoring cards you have in your wreck so

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.979 
scoring cards you have in your wreck so
how<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.690> start<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> game<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:53.059> by<00:00:54.059> drawing<00:00:54.600> six

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
how you start the game is by drawing six

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.220 
how you start the game is by drawing six
cards<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> I'll<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.480> fast<00:00:57.809> for

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
cards and I'll do that really fast for

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
cards and I'll do that really fast for
each<00:00:58.350> player<00:00:58.820> so<00:00:59.820> those<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.270> different

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
each player so those all look different

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
each player so those all look different
on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> back<00:01:01.280> yes<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:02.940> on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
on the back yes they are different on

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
on the back yes they are different on
the<00:01:03.329> back<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:05.220> are

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the back and that's because these are

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.280 
the back and that's because these are
all<00:01:05.519> reversible<00:01:05.729> cards<00:01:06.540> you'll<00:01:06.720> notice<00:01:07.110> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
all reversible cards you'll notice that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.750 
all reversible cards you'll notice that
they<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.500> different<00:01:08.070> patterns<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
they have different patterns and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
they have different patterns and
different<00:01:08.880> colors<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.799> all<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
different colors and that is all how you

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.260 
different colors and that is all how you
play<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> game<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> kinda<00:01:14.220> random<00:01:14.549> cool<00:01:14.880> yeah

those<00:01:48.450> first<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.140> for<00:01:49.350> flip<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:50.659> just<00:01:51.659> flip

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
those first one for flip is just flip

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.499 
those first one for flip is just flip
the<00:01:52.020> card<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.470> rank<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.270> don't<00:01:54.420> know

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the card in your rank is you don't know

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819
