00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
start off with a water droplet shape for

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.509 
start off with a water droplet shape for
the<00:00:08.940> head<00:00:09.380> then<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.469> go<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.309> eyes

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the head then I go on to doing the eyes

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the mouth and the nose and then I shade

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.029 
the mouth and the nose and then I shade
in<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.750> cheeks<00:00:16.020> using<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.619> q-tip

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
in the cheeks using the q-tip

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.759 
in the cheeks using the q-tip
I<00:00:18.099> do<00:00:18.640> an<00:00:18.939> outline<00:00:19.119> for<00:00:19.329> the<00:00:19.630> hair<00:00:19.900> and<00:00:20.109> then

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
I do an outline for the hair and then

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.740 
I do an outline for the hair and then
once<00:00:21.070> I've<00:00:21.220> got<00:00:21.250> the<00:00:21.550> right<00:00:21.699> shape<00:00:21.999> I<00:00:22.210> draw<00:00:22.720> the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
once I've got the right shape I draw the

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.220 
once I've got the right shape I draw the
lines<00:00:23.109> in<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.710> add<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.310> tones<00:00:24.960> then<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:25.989> did

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
lines in to add the tones then I did

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.189 
lines in to add the tones then I did
ears<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.890> I<00:00:27.550> use<00:00:27.849> some<00:00:28.210> kind<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.599> screwballs

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
ears and I use some kind of screwballs

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.220 
ears and I use some kind of screwballs
around<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:29.649> edge<00:00:29.769> to<00:00:30.070> make<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.369> very<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:32.019> then

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
around the edge to make it very and then

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.350 
around the edge to make it very and then
do<00:00:32.379> an<00:00:32.529> outline<00:00:32.649> for<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.129> body<00:00:33.370> in<00:00:33.820> order<00:00:34.059> to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
do an outline for the body in order to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.189 
do an outline for the body in order to
get<00:00:34.659> the<00:00:34.750> proportions<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:36.010> good<00:00:36.190> shape<00:00:37.199> then

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
get the proportions in a good shape then

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.290 
get the proportions in a good shape then
I<00:00:38.320> start<00:00:38.620> drawing<00:00:38.829> the<00:00:39.100> details<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.820> start<00:00:40.180> off

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
I start drawing the details I start off

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.350 
I start drawing the details I start off
at<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.870> neck<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.589> do<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:42.040> necklace<00:00:42.460> followed

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
at the neck I do the necklace followed

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.680 
at the neck I do the necklace followed
by<00:00:43.540> the<00:00:43.600> chest<00:00:44.409> and<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.739> armor<00:00:45.449> then<00:00:46.449> I<00:00:46.540> go

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
by the chest and the armor then I go

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.259 
by the chest and the armor then I go
into<00:00:46.930> doing<00:00:47.170> the<00:00:47.290> arms<00:00:47.710> I<00:00:48.010> just<00:00:48.399> shade<00:00:48.969> them

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
into doing the arms I just shade them

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.170 
into doing the arms I just shade them
really<00:00:49.600> using<00:00:49.899> the<00:00:49.930> q-tip

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
really using the q-tip

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.180 
really using the q-tip
makes<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.080> lot<00:00:53.170> easier<00:00:53.230> than<00:00:53.740> using<00:00:53.950> the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
makes it a lot easier than using the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.090 
makes it a lot easier than using the
pencil<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.660> can<00:00:55.690> just<00:00:55.990> nudge<00:00:56.380> it<00:00:56.560> really<00:00:56.920> and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
pencil you can just nudge it really and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.590 
pencil you can just nudge it really and
it<00:00:57.700> makes<00:00:57.940> quite<00:00:58.150> a<00:00:58.180> good<00:00:58.390> effect<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.600> it's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
it makes quite a good effect and it's

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.690 
it makes quite a good effect and it's
also<00:01:01.750> an<00:01:01.960> even<00:01:02.380> affect<00:01:02.710> it<00:01:03.010> doesn't<00:01:03.370> it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
also an even affect it doesn't it

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.030 
also an even affect it doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:03.730> like<00:01:04.270> have<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.870> edge<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.530> pencil

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
doesn't like have the edge of the pencil

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.070 
doesn't like have the edge of the pencil
marks<00:01:06.400> or<00:01:06.580> anything<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.910> that<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:07.900> all

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
marks or anything like that it's all

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.190 
marks or anything like that it's all
smooth<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.550> it's<00:01:09.700> more<00:01:09.850> realistic

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.290 

as<00:01:14.200> you<00:01:14.380> can<00:01:14.530> see<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:15.040> die<00:01:15.190> over<00:01:15.400> do<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:15.970> knee

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
as you can see I die over do the knee

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.840 
as you can see I die over do the knee
and<00:01:16.540> so<00:01:17.140> I<00:01:17.170> just<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.650> raise<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:18.070> out<00:01:18.190> and<00:01:18.520> then<00:01:18.550> I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
and so I just to raise it out and then I

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.120 
and so I just to raise it out and then I
start<00:01:19.150> doing<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.480> again<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.680> looks<00:01:20.920> better

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
start doing it again and it looks better

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.980 
start doing it again and it looks better
this<00:01:21.310> time<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.820> after<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.570> draw<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
this time so after that I just draw the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.230 
this time so after that I just draw the
hands<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.770> don't<00:01:27.100> really<00:01:27.310> shade<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.790> hands<00:01:28.000> in

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
hands I don't really shade the hands in

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.280 
hands I don't really shade the hands in
too<00:01:28.450> much<00:01:28.690> because<00:01:29.020> they<00:01:29.850> look<00:01:30.850> dirty<00:01:31.150> 4d<00:01:32.020> too

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
too much because they look dirty 4d too

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.050 
too much because they look dirty 4d too
dark

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
dark

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.929 
dark
and<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.530> boots<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:36.040> don't<00:01:36.340> really<00:01:36.520> want<00:01:36.790> to

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
and for the boots I don't really want to

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.389 
and for the boots I don't really want to
do<00:01:37.060> much<00:01:37.270> detail<00:01:37.750> on<00:01:37.869> those<00:01:38.079> either<00:01:38.399> not

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
do much detail on those either not

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.219 
do much detail on those either not
really<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.759> main<00:01:39.909> focus<00:01:40.450> for<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.780> drawing<00:01:41.759> so

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
really the main focus for the drawing so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.279 
really the main focus for the drawing so
the<00:01:44.229> tails<00:01:44.560> are<00:01:44.979> mostly<00:01:45.340> scribble<00:01:45.970> as<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:47.170> can

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
the tails are mostly scribble as you can

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.050 
the tails are mostly scribble as you can
see<00:01:47.530> doesn't<00:01:48.070> take<00:01:48.220> very<00:01:48.340> long<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.579> scribble

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
see doesn't take very long to scribble

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.260 
see doesn't take very long to scribble
it's<00:01:49.299> it's<00:01:49.990> more<00:01:50.259> enjoyable<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:50.830> fact<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.280> to

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
it's it's more enjoyable in fact to to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.310 
it's it's more enjoyable in fact to to
just<00:01:52.479> scribble

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
just scribble

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.620 
just scribble
it's<00:01:55.010> more<00:01:55.190> expressive<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:56.030> think

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.440 

and<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.780> just<00:01:59.960> smudge<00:02:00.350> around<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:01.100> tails<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
and I just smudge around the tails to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.800 
and I just smudge around the tails to
give<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.750> some<00:02:02.960> kind<00:02:03.230> of<00:02:03.350> smoky<00:02:04.040> effect

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
give it some kind of smoky effect

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.960 
give it some kind of smoky effect
I<00:02:05.869> hope<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.860> liked<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:07.130> video<00:02:07.220> thanks<00:02:07.790> for
