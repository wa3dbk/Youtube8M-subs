the time LaBelle is also the best-known
and<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> exactly<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.020> kind<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.320> string

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
and this was exactly the kind of string

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.800 
and this was exactly the kind of string
these<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.850> not<00:01:20.970> modern<00:01:21.270> strings<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.750> are

the old kinds of strings that they used

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.539 
the old kinds of strings that they used

they<00:01:30.900> put<00:01:31.200> strings<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
they put strings like this on and this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.850 
they put strings like this on and this
would<00:01:32.880> be<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.090> tone<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.299> would<00:01:33.680> come<00:01:34.680> out

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:51.840 

and<00:01:40.390> or<00:01:41.390> if<00:01:41.509> your<00:01:41.689> calc<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:42.289> get<00:01:42.500> your<00:01:42.619> pick

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.270

very percussive no slapping and popping

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.410 
very percussive no slapping and popping
allowed<00:01:59.590> you<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:00.619> do<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.009> but<00:02:01.220> how<00:02:02.210> does<00:02:02.329> that

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
allowed you can do it but how does that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.320 
allowed you can do it but how does that
sound<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:06.140> let's<00:02:06.560> see<00:02:06.799> not<00:02:07.549> as<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.880> know<00:02:07.909> in

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
sound so let's see not as you know in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.809 
sound so let's see not as you know in
string<00:02:08.599> demos<00:02:08.929> not<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> whole<00:02:09.920> lot<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.160> discuss

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
string demos not a whole lot to discuss

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.400 
string demos not a whole lot to discuss
but<00:02:11.060> let's<00:02:11.180> talk<00:02:11.330> about<00:02:11.390> playability<00:02:12.080> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
but let's talk about playability and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.650 
but let's talk about playability and
flexibility<00:02:12.980> ha<00:02:13.670> these<00:02:13.849> are<00:02:14.060> bridge<00:02:14.360> cables

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
flexibility ha these are bridge cables

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.039 
flexibility ha these are bridge cables
these<00:02:15.319> are<00:02:15.500> bridge<00:02:15.709> cables<00:02:15.920> these<00:02:16.250> are<00:02:16.400> why

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
these are bridge cables these are why

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.300 
these are bridge cables these are why
they<00:02:18.049> came<00:02:18.290> up<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.500> other<00:02:18.769> types<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.160> strings

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
they came up with other types of strings

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.070 
they came up with other types of strings
this<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.730> why<00:02:19.849> LaBella<00:02:20.209> has<00:02:20.480> another<00:02:20.750> type<00:02:21.049> of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
this is why LaBella has another type of

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.539 
this is why LaBella has another type of
string<00:02:21.950> called<00:02:22.310> low<00:02:22.610> tension<00:02:22.910> flexible<00:02:23.599> flats

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
string called low tension flexible flats

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.979 
string called low tension flexible flats
because<00:02:25.549> these<00:02:26.000> are<00:02:26.180> not<00:02:26.330> low<00:02:26.480> tension<00:02:26.840> these

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
because these are not low tension these

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.780 
because these are not low tension these
are<00:02:27.140> extraordinarily<00:02:27.620> high<00:02:28.220> tension<00:02:28.670> they

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
are extraordinarily high tension they

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.250 
are extraordinarily high tension they
they<00:02:29.390> jump<00:02:29.900> off<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:31.430> jump<00:02:31.790> off<00:02:32.260> your

they jump off the they jump off your
