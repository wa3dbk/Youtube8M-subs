00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
start throttling data speeds once you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.020 
start throttling data speeds once you
get<00:00:30.769> past<00:00:31.149> 2.5<00:00:32.590> gigs<00:00:33.590> of<00:00:33.890> data<00:00:34.399> usage<00:00:36.700> so<00:00:37.700> what

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
get past 2.5 gigs of data usage so what

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.720 
get past 2.5 gigs of data usage so what
I<00:00:38.059> recommend<00:00:38.239> doing<00:00:38.960> is<00:00:39.890> downloading<00:00:40.520> this

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
I recommend doing is downloading this

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.540 
I recommend doing is downloading this
app<00:00:41.710> and<00:00:43.420> it's<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.630> data<00:00:44.870> manager<00:00:45.620> I<00:00:45.980> think<00:00:46.430> it's

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
app and it's a data manager I think it's

00:00:46.550 --> 00:01:01.860 
app and it's a data manager I think it's
called<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:46.969> data<00:00:47.300> manager<00:00:47.989> actually<00:00:48.820> see

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
how much everything is using so right

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.600 
how much everything is using so right
now<00:02:17.709> youtube's<00:02:18.700> using<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.269> most<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.430> is

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
now youtube's using the most but this is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.789 
now youtube's using the most but this is
a<00:02:24.640> good<00:02:24.910> app<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.480> keep<00:02:25.690> track<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.019> it'll<00:02:26.650> stay

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
a good app to keep track and it'll stay

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.970 
a good app to keep track and it'll stay
in<00:02:27.130> your<00:02:27.250> notification<00:02:27.519> bar<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:29.140> there<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.709> so
