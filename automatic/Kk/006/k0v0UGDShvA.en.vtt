00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
able to start your server so make sure

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.380 
able to start your server so make sure
you<00:03:28.000> change<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.989> save<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.590> changes

you change that and you save the changes

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.120 
you change that and you save the changes
ok<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.450> before<00:03:31.930> we<00:03:32.260> start<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> server<00:03:32.890> up

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
ok so before we start the server up

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
ok so before we start the server up
again<00:03:33.459> we're<00:03:34.360> gonna<00:03:34.420> do<00:03:34.690> some<00:03:34.900> port

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
again we're gonna do some port

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.930 
again we're gonna do some port
forwarding<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:35.980> quick<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.520> if<00:03:36.610> you're<00:03:36.790> on

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
forwarding really quick so if you're on

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.180 
forwarding really quick so if you're on
Windows<00:03:37.420> 7<00:03:37.630> or<00:03:38.440> 8<00:03:38.739> go<00:03:39.400> to<00:03:39.430> run<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.739> then<00:03:41.920> type

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
Windows 7 or 8 go to run and then type

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.850 
Windows 7 or 8 go to run and then type
in<00:03:42.400> CMD<00:03:44.160> brings<00:03:45.160> up<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.459> black<00:03:45.700> prompt<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.269> so

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
in CMD brings up a black prompt like so

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.630 
in CMD brings up a black prompt like so
then<00:03:47.860> you<00:03:48.070> just<00:03:48.100> type<00:03:48.489> an<00:03:48.670> IP<00:03:48.940> config<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
then you just type an IP config and it

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.229 
then you just type an IP config and it
gives<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.030> bunch<00:03:52.269> of<00:03:52.360> random<00:03:52.690> numbers<00:03:52.720> etc

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
gives you bunch of random numbers etc

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.790 
gives you bunch of random numbers etc
the<00:03:55.239> primary<00:03:55.810> information<00:03:56.530> you're<00:03:56.769> looking

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
the primary information you're looking

the primary information you're looking
for<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.510> ipv4<00:03:59.410> address<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.880> default

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
for is the ipv4 address and the default

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.740 
for is the ipv4 address and the default
gateway<00:04:01.890> right<00:04:02.890> those<00:04:03.250> two<00:04:03.670> numbers<00:04:03.910> down<00:04:04.300> or

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
gateway right those two numbers down or

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.050

UDP and then for the server IP address

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.100 
UDP and then for the server IP address
you<00:05:08.870> just<00:05:08.900> put<00:05:09.259> in<00:05:09.379> the<00:05:09.620> ipv4<00:05:10.550> like<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:11.330> and

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
you just put in the ipv4 like so and

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.439 
you just put in the ipv4 like so and
then<00:05:12.259> for<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.590> server<00:05:12.800> ports<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.520> ports<00:05:14.150> in
