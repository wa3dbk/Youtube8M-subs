00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.660
 hi friends from youtube good hello friends 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.660
 no more because I'm from youtube I do not like it 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.730
 this 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.099
 this time now I will teach you how to do 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.829
 the partition without computers and nothing 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.500
 from the recovery mode easy to 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:21.020
 that do not do so much spin and what 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.450
 we will need are the club that is in the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.550
 description and the link if you like 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.580
 download in place toro anyway 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.020
 I will leave you the description of the file and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 no more download it and already 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.580
 they install it but that goes after us 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.590
 that they do the partition but not what 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.040
 download before 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.410
 and what we 're going to do is see what 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.680
 I will do in a memory of 2 gb not 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.260
 I have nothing right 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
 this instead seems here is the one 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 I had is 8 I recommend doing it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.559
 in one of 8 gb 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.559
 so that it's much better to do it and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 this time I tell them that I will do it in 2 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.420
 gb the one that goes to samsung that is there in 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.159
 the cell phone storage 1.86 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.710
 says allow tito 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 among them brightness we lower it like this 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 sad 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.580
 we go 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.880
 storage and it 's 1.86 says 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.550
 and this normal what we will do is 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.940
 turn it off you know the club hormones out 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.840
 of the folder so as not to look for it 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.840
 with your partner 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.850
 good to hope it vibrates 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.679
 and we're all going to go into recovery mode 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.690
 volume plus the turn off and the button 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.330
 home 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.330
 all three at the same time for five 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 seconds and they are already released 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.730
 let's apply and give you from city card 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:31.379
 we installed the clauer mont and we're going to 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:36.129
 advanced and here says partition sd card 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:38.480
 we do it and we choose whatever it is that is 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.200
 the amount that we are going to do 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.409
 let's extract from the memory sd 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.019
 card we put it good in case of 8 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.180
 Put him 512 but here in 2 good 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.700
 as you want it is already the normal space 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.799
 But beware because when you give 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.269
 one of these will appear other 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.930
 options that are going to add those 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:04.530
 also then it would be 256 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.510
 normal there they are always given 256 and here 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.299
 are the others already add the other 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.200
 more than they want me in my case I will put 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.660
 128 mb and wait for it to be done 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.120
 partition 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.630
 eye it seems that way is the card like this 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.000
 it seems that so 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.980
 then have your data backed up and 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.900
 Sorry for not saying do not leave it in the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.230
 description 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.439
 it goes out and they wait so much longer they no longer leave 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.250
 back with a back button and what 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.020
 they understand 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.020
 that's why we want them to light 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.880
 samsung galaxy young 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.220
 wait for some end 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.900
 Sun 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.110
 you know wait until you read in full 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.500
 this case as I have nothing is going to be 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.500
 Quick 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.240
 I read it to you full 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.320
 see that there are 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:53.790
 we leave 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.790
 but if you are reading everything well 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.190
 we wait and 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.640
 we go to storage 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:15.740
 a good option is configuration and 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.740
 we look for the storage option 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.520
 and we are going to see that the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.729
 partition 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.650
 and now it says a few points 50 gigabytes 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.270
 in the 8's I recommend doing a 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.040
 Most 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.660
 and let's go and we go to the link they install it 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.910
 the phone was moving so that 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.100
 format worship with memory is what 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.810
 I did move it to the phone and there it is 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.810
 let's go to the link 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.129
 and we wait 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.039
 and we give you information on 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.349
 storage and ready there says second 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.979
 partition no longer need to be external 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:01.280
 neither to pay it nor to turn it on and there is the 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.099
 partition was 229 mb already and this is 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.490
 how they want to do it there they increase it in 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:11.889
 the recovery mode to your liking 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.889
 then we left and I am already 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.340
 so that the automatic ones are made like this 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.070
 download in place thor for example 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.169
 facebook is automatically installed on 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.850
 the phone but it will link to the 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:27.320
 partition so that there they are saved in the 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.660
 data cache and the lic go to adjustments and 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.580
 it is already in the automatic good you 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.759
 they will look like this, it seems they give 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.070
 automatic and ready link and that's it 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:38.470
 for today 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.970
 is the one that is formatted the card if not 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.970
 I show you how to install something 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.930
 good is everything already
