this World Cup I quite fancy a bit on

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
this World Cup I quite fancy a bit on
Bangladesh<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.380> upset<00:01:55.740> India<00:01:56.100> but

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
Bangladesh to it to upset India but

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
Bangladesh to it to upset India but
again<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> depend<00:01:57.600> on

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
again I think it's going to depend on

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.440 
again I think it's going to depend on
who<00:01:58.049> bats<00:01:58.320> first<00:01:58.820> okay<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.119> you're<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
who bats first okay so you're going to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
who bats first okay so you're going to
go<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.810> Bangladesh<00:02:01.320> having<00:02:01.619> knocked<00:02:01.770> out

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
go for Bangladesh having knocked out

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
go for Bangladesh having knocked out
your<00:02:02.310> pre-tournament<00:02:02.820> hopes<00:02:03.270> England<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
your pre-tournament hopes England to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.800 
your pre-tournament hopes England to
carry<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.619> momentum<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.719> they've

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
carry on that momentum I think they've

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.479 
carry on that momentum I think they've
got<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.140> good<00:02:07.350> chance<00:02:07.409> um<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
got a really good chance um you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
got a really good chance um you
obviously<00:02:09.000> can't<00:02:09.030> discount<00:02:09.869> India<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
obviously can't discount India but I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.790 
obviously can't discount India but I
think<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.129> they<00:02:11.520> come<00:02:11.910> under<00:02:12.060> pressure

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
think if they come under pressure

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.850 
think if they come under pressure
from<00:02:13.220> Bangladesh<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.090> in<00:02:14.750> probably<00:02:15.590> chasing

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
from Bangladesh in in probably chasing

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.640 
from Bangladesh in in probably chasing
the<00:02:16.160> runs<00:02:16.370> then<00:02:17.000> there<00:02:17.450> could<00:02:17.600> be<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.960> huge

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the runs then there could be the huge

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.950 
the runs then there could be the huge
upset<00:02:19.070> I'm<00:02:19.790> gonna<00:02:20.030> go<00:02:20.270> with<00:02:20.450> India<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:20.900> I

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
upset I'm gonna go with India but I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.020 
upset I'm gonna go with India but I
don't<00:02:21.320> think<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.740> will<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:22.010> easy<00:02:22.220> I<00:02:22.430> mean<00:02:22.700> India

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
don't think it will be easy I mean India

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.790 
don't think it will be easy I mean India
they<00:02:23.570> keep<00:02:23.750> bowling<00:02:23.960> teams<00:02:24.320> out<00:02:24.530> which<00:02:24.650> is

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
they keep bowling teams out which is

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.050 
they keep bowling teams out which is
great<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.220> them<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:25.700> chamois<00:02:25.970> and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
great for them and it's chamois and

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.050 
great for them and it's chamois and
great<00:02:26.300> for<00:02:26.540> me<00:02:26.690> miss<00:02:26.840> yellow<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.320> example<00:02:27.350> but

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
great for me miss yellow for example but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.220 
great for me miss yellow for example but
India<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.180> me<00:02:29.270> will<00:02:29.420> be<00:02:29.540> too<00:02:29.780> strong<00:02:29.840> for

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
India for me will be too strong for

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.500 
India for me will be too strong for
Bangladesh<00:02:30.710> but<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.010> could<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.670> could<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.270> go

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
Bangladesh but it could it could just go

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
Bangladesh but it could it could just go
down<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.020> wire<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.500> close<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.190> there

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
down to the wire so close on there

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.150 
down to the wire so close on there
perhaps<00:02:34.850> we<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:35.900> move<00:02:36.260> on<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.530> Adelaide

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
perhaps we then move on to Adelaide

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.130 
perhaps we then move on to Adelaide
where<00:02:37.370> Australia<00:02:37.790> take<00:02:38.270> on<00:02:38.480> Pakistan

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940

Pakistan well probably I'm going to be
one<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.360> few<00:03:05.720> because<00:03:06.440> if<00:03:07.160> Pakistan<00:03:07.460> turn

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
one of the few because if Pakistan turn

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.810 
one of the few because if Pakistan turn
up<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.660> day<00:03:08.840> they<00:03:09.560> could<00:03:09.830> win<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.100> so<00:03:10.430> um

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
up on the day they could win it so um

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.900 
up on the day they could win it so um
again<00:03:11.240> good<00:03:11.900> odds<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.650> maybe<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.580> little<00:03:13.610> on

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
again good odds so maybe a little on

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.090 
again good odds so maybe a little on
Pakistan<00:03:14.660> well<00:03:15.110> I'm<00:03:15.410> gonna<00:03:15.770> stick<00:03:16.040> with

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
Pakistan well I'm gonna stick with

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.010 
Pakistan well I'm gonna stick with
Australia<00:03:16.640> Ellen<00:03:16.970> I'm<00:03:17.240> quite<00:03:17.420> stubborn<00:03:17.690> as

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
Australia Ellen I'm quite stubborn as

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.330 
Australia Ellen I'm quite stubborn as
you<00:03:18.230> know<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.650> I've<00:03:18.740> been<00:03:18.920> predicting

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
you know and I've been predicting

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.770 
you know and I've been predicting
Australia<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.910> win<00:03:20.090> this<00:03:20.240> thing<00:03:20.300> for<00:03:20.510> what

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
Australia to win this thing for what

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.300 
Australia to win this thing for what
feels<00:03:21.020> like<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.350> number<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.709> months<00:03:21.920> even<00:03:22.100> years

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
feels like a number of months even years

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.040 
feels like a number of months even years
now<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.060> think<00:03:23.150> they're<00:03:23.390> going<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.540> be<00:03:23.630> just

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
now so I think they're going to be just

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.810 
now so I think they're going to be just
too<00:03:24.290> strong<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.620> Pakistan's<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.610> better

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
too strong for Pakistan's and the better

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.699 
too strong for Pakistan's and the better
bowlers<00:03:26.360> Pakistan<00:03:26.840> ravaged<00:03:27.170> by<00:03:27.320> injuries

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
bowlers Pakistan ravaged by injuries

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.680 
bowlers Pakistan ravaged by injuries
both<00:03:27.890> before<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.310> tournament<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:29.360> now<00:03:29.390> with

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
both before the tournament and now with

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.240

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
four against well John this is probably

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.030

the<00:03:56.870> one<00:03:56.990> that<00:03:57.050> we're<00:03:57.290> going<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.530> agree<00:03:57.920> upon

the one that we're going to agree upon

the one that we're going to agree upon
and<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.760> think<00:03:59.380> the<00:04:00.380> New<00:04:00.620> Zealand<00:04:00.650> are<00:04:01.100> going<00:04:01.250> to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
and I think the New Zealand are going to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.080 
and I think the New Zealand are going to
beat<00:04:02.600> West<00:04:03.530> Indies<00:04:03.980> quite<00:04:04.310> handsomely

beat West Indies quite handsomely

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.410 
beat West Indies quite handsomely
