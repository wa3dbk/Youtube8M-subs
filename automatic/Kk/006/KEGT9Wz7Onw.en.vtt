wait an entire year before they can be
together<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.759> certainly<00:01:48.119> get

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
together then I can certainly get

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080

through<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.140> chapter<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.430> not<00:01:50.700> skip<00:01:50.970> ahead

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
through this chapter and not skip ahead

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
through this chapter and not skip ahead

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
but when they sort of they begin to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.360 
but when they sort of they begin to
approach<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.530> relationship<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.190> more

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
approach a relationship for more

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.270 
approach a relationship for more
realistic<00:02:41.760> perspective<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.560> is

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
realistic perspective and that is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.819 
realistic perspective and that is
helpful<00:02:44.549> strengthens<00:02:45.180> them<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.680> was
