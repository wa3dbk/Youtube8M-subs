to make extra money but as you can see
there's<00:03:12.330> no<00:03:12.600> ads<00:03:12.870> anywhere<00:03:13.440> i<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.650> actually

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
there's no ads anywhere i can actually

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.030

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
not put ads on the site yet so i guess

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.039 
not put ads on the site yet so i guess
due<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> Addison's<00:03:18.450> problems<00:03:18.900> I've<00:03:19.019> had

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
due to the Addison's problems I've had

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.930 
due to the Addison's problems I've had
