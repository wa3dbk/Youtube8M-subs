00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.710
 Hi everybody 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:15.000
 which i show you how to make a whole 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.379
 easy place came a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.100
 that lets you shift your hair nicely 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.260
 he is called the pitch of period of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 waterfall braid and looks complicated 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.270
 I also get a lot out of it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.990
 method was actually very simple 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.520
 explain in 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.690
 a bit tricky here but i'm going 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.030
 just trying this is two more hairs 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.260
 then we can breadth or even than 300 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 kinds of guy is from 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.059
 is it an ideal hair style i'm after 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.699
 the washing 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.920
 luxurius volume spray first on of 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 geoffrey de and then the side extra 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.719
 power cover for normal hair 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.289
 that your question always and I already do in the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.420
 dots and then the old one from jovial 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.420
 way so that I no longer have 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.590
 what do you need two simple sliders 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:19.189
 and her head and her spray you can do this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.500
 also if we do your music in June 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 report in her and then it's fun 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.960
 war what sea salt spray has 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.950
 referred really rougher for that 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.770
 music 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.020
 idea but I do not now I am going now 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:42.740
 for the microphone jan because he could you 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:47.159
 picks your front pick a pick of no 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.020
 so this is about and if you just look 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.270
 here to the mirrors can and will in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 lion 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.229
 then you do the front over the game 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.390
 and what you are going to do and that is the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 trick of this sheet i'll give you a tuft 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.329
 every day with a side part of the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.330
 general corridor you grab a thin tuft 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:15.080
 her 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.970
 well can be very thin and do it 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.940
 you have these two which gedraai 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.370
 admit with praise explain you have this 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.680
 two tufts with turned whose rain 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.110
 the in between 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.720
 then you release naked here and then turn 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.420
 your top spec you've also 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.900
 turning already 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.900
 have a laugh 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.830
 energy not well inside as you go 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.950
 so grab it again 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.290
 helper from above spectator 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.650
 super neat or this to 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.650
 bit 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:59.240
 stage now so again points that 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.050
 put it over the top again 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.590
 out 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.020
 then grab the bottom and then your own 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.060
 world lag now this is busy 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.830
 power than is there is a jump 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.920
 through it that's why we got it 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.680
 here also a pack just through it 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.560
 and just turned in the very blow then grab 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:33.170
 you again a tuft of the ball with mine 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:34.550
 time to go anywhere and nergen so over again 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.640
 upper one 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.180
 then pick the bottom and then pick 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.130
 knit 4 strokes so you actually do it 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.080
 only thing you do with a bit of what you are from 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.730
 doing a suit here is a sticking through 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.650
 but your requested not per meter 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.650
 they fight past the light early flat 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.950
 only system 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:00.700
 she picks up the laying and her will 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.700
 just running is not safe 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.280
 how do you grab a thin tuft 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.290
 focus on her 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.620
 I underestimated some 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.720
 and then turn impact now proceed 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.310
 arrived for reach just one more 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.020
 once 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.290
 then you grab a clip and you and you 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.290
 wait 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.570
 and the other bowl does not help you cut 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.540
 and so I actually a very fast 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.800
 simple look 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.800
 discuss on her plv 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.250
 and you 're done 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.480
 benefit can still see well 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.700
 well i think it is also an ideal look for 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.140
 is your canvas top layer the jump i 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.330
 always have on 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.820
 you still have a bit of a hard time 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.020
 Fairly doing a very grassy posey 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.760
 can do ideal for after work or 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.480
 festivals but remember and it is 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.760
 ideal 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.270
 and I underwent overnight too 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.890
 just a little out of my face 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.820
 well i hope you liked it and or 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.820
 fast enough
