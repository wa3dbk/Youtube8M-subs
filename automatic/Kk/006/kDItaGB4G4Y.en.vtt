most<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.940> know<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.360> filter<00:00:42.690> fan<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
most of you know the filter fan is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.340 
most of you know the filter fan is
designed<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.520> attach<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.660> regular<00:00:46.110> fan

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
designed to just attach to a regular fan

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
designed to just attach to a regular fan
and<00:00:46.590> set<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.950> floor<00:00:47.219> i<00:00:47.460> set<00:00:48.180> mine<00:00:48.420> on

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and set on the floor i set mine on

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180 
and set on the floor i set mine on
benches<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.590> when<00:00:49.739> i'm<00:00:49.860> working<00:00:49.980> on

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
benches and things when i'm working on

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.910 
benches and things when i'm working on
projects<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.360> i'm<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> do<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.110> I'm

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
projects but what i'm going to do is I'm

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.119 
projects but what i'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> rotate<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.879> fan<00:00:54.770> over<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.890> its<00:00:56.070> side

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
going to rotate the fan over on its side

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.720 
going to rotate the fan over on its side
and<00:00:56.730> hang<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> from<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> ceiling<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.739> I'm

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and hang it from the ceiling so I'm

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.799 
and hang it from the ceiling so I'm
doing<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:02.059> is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
doing this so that this is the the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.710 
doing this so that this is the the
on/off<00:01:04.199> knob<00:01:04.559> will<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.720> reasonably

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
on/off knob will be a reasonably

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
on/off knob will be a reasonably
accessible<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.740> stand<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.280> tippy<00:01:08.549> toes

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
accessible if I stand on my tippy toes

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
accessible if I stand on my tippy toes
and<00:01:09.590> we'll<00:01:10.590> take<00:01:10.860> set<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> side<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.540> you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and we'll take set it on the side so you

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
and we'll take set it on the side so you
can<00:01:12.750> slide<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> filters<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> out<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
can slide the filters in and out and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.399 
can slide the filters in and out and
then<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> top<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.780> fan<00:01:15.960> i'm<00:01:16.229> just

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
then on the top of the fan i'm just

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
then on the top of the fan i'm just
going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> drill<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.520> couple<00:01:17.850> holes<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
going to drill a couple holes in the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.039 
going to drill a couple holes in the
corners<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:21.740> put<00:01:22.740> some<00:01:22.979> islets<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.049> not

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
corners here and put some islets in not

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.719 
corners here and put some islets in not
the<00:01:25.170> perfect<00:01:25.380> eyelets<00:01:25.950> i<00:01:26.100> should<00:01:26.460> use<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the perfect eyelets i should use a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.050 
the perfect eyelets i should use a
threaded<00:01:27.540> eyelets<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.340> with<00:01:29.340> nuts<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.880> them

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
threaded eyelets and with nuts on them

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.190 
threaded eyelets and with nuts on them
but<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:31.020> i<00:01:31.079> had<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:32.600> supplies<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.930> was<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
but all i had in my supplies there was a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.370 
but all i had in my supplies there was a
couple<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.280> eyelets<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.600> i've

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
couple little eyelets like this and i've

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.649 
couple little eyelets like this and i've
gots<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.579> spare<00:01:38.850> wood<00:01:38.880> i'm<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.540> going

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
gots got some spare wood i'm just going

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.060 
gots got some spare wood i'm just going
to<00:01:39.689> drill<00:01:39.900> through<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.439> use<00:01:40.650> wood<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to drill through there and use wood as a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.749 
to drill through there and use wood as a
backing<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.850> not<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> perfect<00:01:43.020> solution<00:01:43.439> but

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
backing and not the perfect solution but

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.960 
backing and not the perfect solution but
we'll<00:01:44.759> make<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.939> work<00:01:46.159> if<00:01:47.159> some<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.670> decide

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
away from mounting point and like I say

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.540 
away from mounting point and like I say
I<00:02:59.780> what<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:01.370> should<00:03:01.580> have<00:03:01.700> used<00:03:02.080> instead<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.260> a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
I what we should have used instead of a

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.490 
I what we should have used instead of a
wood<00:03:04.550> threads<00:03:05.000> or<00:03:05.300> like<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.140> machine

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
wood threads or like this is the machine

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.979 
wood threads or like this is the machine
thread<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.190> nuts<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.120> washers<00:03:08.330> on<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.810> back

but<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:09.560> what<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.160> don't<00:03:10.430> have<00:03:10.610> that

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
but you know what I don't have that

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.630 
but you know what I don't have that
today<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.959> i<00:03:11.989> will<00:03:12.170> do<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:13.280> stick

these through the hole here and I've got

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.250 
these through the hole here and I've got
just<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:18.080> couple<00:03:18.110> little<00:03:18.470> plywood<00:03:19.100> blocks

just a couple little plywood blocks

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.570 
just a couple little plywood blocks
thought<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.500> worked<00:03:21.709> better<00:03:21.920> than<00:03:22.040> hardwood

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
thought that worked better than hardwood
