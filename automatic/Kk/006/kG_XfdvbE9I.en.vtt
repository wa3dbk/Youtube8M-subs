00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
series design then going on to the board

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.640 
series design then going on to the board
design<00:00:32.660> here<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.020> can<00:00:33.140> see<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.410> has<00:00:33.500> a<00:00:33.530> pretty

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
design here you can see it has a pretty

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.740 
design here you can see it has a pretty
extreme<00:00:34.280> angle<00:00:34.730> up<00:00:34.910> towards<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.270> top<00:00:35.300> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
extreme angle up towards the top and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.420 
extreme angle up towards the top and
also<00:00:36.410> on<00:00:36.650> the<00:00:36.740> board<00:00:36.980> it's<00:00:37.130> going<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.340> be<00:00:37.400> a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
also on the board it's going to be a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.340 
also on the board it's going to be a
nice<00:00:37.700> thin<00:00:38.090> design<00:00:38.330> as<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:38.720> can<00:00:38.930> see<00:00:39.140> going

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
nice thin design as you can see going

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.950 
nice thin design as you can see going
around<00:00:39.620> here<00:00:39.980> it's<00:00:40.490> extremely<00:00:41.270> thin<00:00:41.510> board<00:00:41.810> so

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
around here it's extremely thin board so

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.880 
around here it's extremely thin board so
that's<00:00:42.050> going<00:00:42.230> to<00:00:42.290> help<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:42.590> reduce<00:00:42.740> the

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
that's going to help to reduce the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.280 
that's going to help to reduce the
overall<00:00:43.280> weight<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.820> blocker<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:44.480> then<00:00:45.260> I

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
overall weight of the blocker and then I

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.260 
overall weight of the blocker and then I
going<00:00:45.740> on<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.100> side<00:00:46.340> protection<00:00:46.910> here<00:00:47.120> you

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
going on to the side protection here you

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.210 
going on to the side protection here you
can<00:00:47.420> see<00:00:47.570> it's<00:00:47.720> a<00:00:47.810> binding<00:00:48.140> list<00:00:48.500> side<00:00:48.770> right

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
can see it's a binding list side right

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.130 
can see it's a binding list side right
there<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:50.360> that's<00:00:50.510> going<00:00:50.630> to<00:00:50.750> do<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.020> just

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
there so what that's going to do is just

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.690 
there so what that's going to do is just
open<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.590> blocker<00:00:51.829> up<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.190> little<00:00:52.400> bit<00:00:52.520> more

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
open the blocker up a little bit more

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.800 
open the blocker up a little bit more
and<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:52.940> give<00:00:53.090> you<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.239> little<00:00:53.390> bit<00:00:53.570> more

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810 
and just give you a little bit more

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.290 
and just give you a little bit more
coverage<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.470> protection<00:00:55.010> there<00:00:55.220> then<00:00:56.090> going

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
coverage and protection there then going

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.970 
coverage and protection there then going
on<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.630> side<00:00:56.870> piece<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:57.440> can<00:00:57.590> see<00:00:57.620> it's<00:00:57.890> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.290 
that's a nice feature to see on this one
then<00:02:25.160> going<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.670> inside<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
then going on to the inside of the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.850 
then going on to the inside of the
blocker<00:02:26.569> here<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.319> see<00:02:27.470> they're<00:02:27.620> using

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
blocker here you can see they're using

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.949 
blocker here you can see they're using
an<00:02:27.950> ash<00:02:28.190> material<00:02:28.400> on<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.849> inside<00:02:29.239> there<00:02:29.510> with

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
an ash material on the inside there with

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.600 
an ash material on the inside there with
those<00:02:30.140> foams<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.800> there<00:02:30.980> as<00:02:31.069> well<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.310> that's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
those foams in there as well so that's

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.030 
those foams in there as well so that's
going<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.790> provide<00:02:32.120> that<00:02:32.319> back<00:02:33.319> hand<00:02:33.650> kind<00:02:33.980> of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
going to provide that back hand kind of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.610 
going to provide that back hand kind of
saddle<00:02:34.489> design<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.780> what<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.080> does<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.470> when

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
saddle design so what that does is when

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.050 
saddle design so what that does is when
you<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.860> take<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.190> shots<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> blocker<00:02:37.850> it

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you do take it shots of the blocker it

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.000 
you do take it shots of the blocker it
just<00:02:38.209> holds<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.080> blocker<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.530> your<00:02:39.620> hand<00:02:39.860> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
just holds the blocker to your hand a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.199 
just holds the blocker to your hand a
little<00:02:40.040> bit<00:02:40.310> better<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.790> you're<00:02:41.000> not<00:02:41.060> gonna

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
little bit better so you're not gonna

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.880 
little bit better so you're not gonna
have<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> blocker<00:02:41.690> rotating<00:02:42.350> around<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.739> whole

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
have the blocker rotating around a whole

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.100 
have the blocker rotating around a whole
lot<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:44.060> also<00:02:44.269> on<00:02:44.540> there<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.810> have<00:02:44.930> that

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
lot then also on there you have that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.320 
lot then also on there you have that
mesh<00:02:45.380> cuff<00:02:45.709> right<00:02:45.920> here<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.850> mesh<00:02:47.090> cap

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
mesh cuff right here and that mesh cap

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.000 
mesh cuff right here and that mesh cap
is<00:02:47.510> gonna<00:02:47.630> be<00:02:47.720> nice<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.140> loose<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:48.590> well<00:02:48.769> so

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
is gonna be nice and loose as well so

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.620 
is gonna be nice and loose as well so
it's<00:02:49.160> going<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.310> give<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.880> lot<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.360> wrist

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
it's going to give you a lot of wrist

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's going to give you a lot of wrist
