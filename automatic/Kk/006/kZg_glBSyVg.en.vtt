it<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.719> we<00:02:40.719> could<00:02:40.900> later<00:02:41.109> give<00:02:41.349> her<00:02:41.469> another

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
it and we could later give her another

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.670 
it and we could later give her another
bath<00:02:42.099> if<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.579> need<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.989> point<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.500> putting

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
bath if we need to the point of putting

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.039 
bath if we need to the point of putting
the<00:02:44.920> oil<00:02:45.129> super<00:02:45.609> hair<00:02:45.879> is<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.329> can<00:02:46.450> brush<00:02:46.750> it

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
the oil super hair is so we can brush it

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.349 
the oil super hair is so we can brush it
and<00:02:47.409> have<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.099> nice<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.849> saw<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:50.700> if<00:02:51.700> you're

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
and have it nice and saw and if you're

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.720 
and have it nice and saw and if you're
having<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.750> hard<00:02:53.019> time<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:54.310> her<00:02:54.489> hair

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
having a hard time with her hair

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.080 
having a hard time with her hair
brushing<00:02:55.269> her<00:02:55.389> hair<00:02:55.659> don't<00:02:56.560> tug<00:02:57.129> because<00:02:58.000> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
brushing her hair don't tug because you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.000 
brushing her hair don't tug because you
can<00:02:58.239> actually<00:02:58.599> pull<00:02:58.810> her<00:02:58.989> hair<00:02:59.319> off<00:02:59.470> her<00:02:59.680> scalp

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
can actually pull her hair off her scalp

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.940 
can actually pull her hair off her scalp
so<00:03:00.909> just<00:03:01.150> add<00:03:01.329> more<00:03:01.510> oil<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.290> don't<00:03:02.620> worry<00:03:02.799> if

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
so just add more oil and don't worry if

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.860 
so just add more oil and don't worry if
it's<00:03:03.099> feeling<00:03:03.430> really<00:03:03.579> oily<00:03:03.939> you<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.720> later

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
it's feeling really oily you can later

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.470 
it's feeling really oily you can later
take<00:03:05.169> that<00:03:05.349> off<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.849> it's<00:03:06.849> actually<00:03:07.209> looking

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
take that off and it's actually looking

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.449 
take that off and it's actually looking
pretty<00:03:07.510> better<00:03:07.989> compared<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.620> this<00:03:08.859> side<00:03:09.159> it's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
pretty better compared to this side it's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.940 
pretty better compared to this side it's
really<00:03:09.549> bad<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.540> is<00:03:10.689> working<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.650> keep

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
really bad so it is working so just keep

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:21.660 
really bad so it is working so just keep
at<00:03:12.159> it<00:03:12.310> guys<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:15.099> now<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.819> other<00:03:16.209> side

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.210 

I<00:03:21.730> cut<00:03:22.420> this<00:03:22.569> oil<00:03:22.930> at<00:03:23.290> Sally's<00:03:23.860> Beauty<00:03:24.040> Supply

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
I cut this oil at Sally's Beauty Supply

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.400 
I cut this oil at Sally's Beauty Supply
and<00:03:24.880> that's<00:03:25.270> what<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.480> use<00:03:25.690> for<00:03:25.870> my<00:03:25.989> hair<00:03:26.230> when

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
and that's what I use for my hair when

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.040 
and that's what I use for my hair when
it<00:03:26.530> gets<00:03:26.709> really<00:03:27.040> really<00:03:27.190> frizzy<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.840> it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
it gets really really frizzy and it

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.839 
it gets really really frizzy and it
works<00:03:29.319> really<00:03:29.560> great<00:03:29.770> for<00:03:29.890> my<00:03:30.190> hair<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.790> I

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
works really great for my hair so I

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.300 
works really great for my hair so I
figured<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.989> should<00:03:32.200> work<00:03:32.440> if<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.770> works<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.099> my

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
figured it should work if it works on my

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.620 
figured it should work if it works on my
hair<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.940> should<00:03:34.120> work<00:03:34.239> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.599> doll's<00:03:34.840> hair

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
hair it should work on the doll's hair

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.120 
hair it should work on the doll's hair
all<00:03:37.630> right<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.440> what<00:03:38.590> she<00:03:38.709> looks<00:03:38.950> like

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
all right this is what she looks like

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.300 
all right this is what she looks like
with<00:03:39.340> her<00:03:39.520> hair<00:03:39.790> comb<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:41.440> so<00:03:41.739> much<00:03:41.980> better

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
with her hair comb it's so much better

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.110 
with her hair comb it's so much better
but<00:03:43.000> it's<00:03:43.180> still<00:03:43.420> very<00:03:43.560> frizzy<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.819> just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
but it's still very frizzy and I just

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.330 
but it's still very frizzy and I just
noticed<00:03:46.440> now<00:03:47.440> that<00:03:47.650> it's<00:03:47.769> comb<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.190> it's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
noticed now that it's comb that it's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.540 
noticed now that it's comb that it's
uneven<00:03:49.019> they<00:03:50.019> seem<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.620> cut<00:03:50.920> parts<00:03:51.430> of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
uneven they seem to have cut parts of

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.640 
uneven they seem to have cut parts of
her<00:03:51.670> hair<00:03:52.030> off<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.599> I'm<00:03:52.810> going<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.110> have<00:03:53.440> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
her hair off so I'm going to have to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.449 
her hair off so I'm going to have to
strain<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.319> try<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.380> make<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.769> even<00:03:56.950> I

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
strain it and try to make it even I

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.210 
strain it and try to make it even I
didn't<00:03:58.420> want<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.630> do<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.319> it<00:03:59.980> looks

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
didn't want to do that but it looks

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.890 
didn't want to do that but it looks
really<00:04:00.430> bad<00:04:00.730> but<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:03.280> final<00:04:03.730> step<00:04:04.120> is<00:04:04.450> to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
really bad but the final step is to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.670 
really bad but the final step is to
blow-dry<00:04:05.440> her<00:04:05.920> hair<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:07.140> we<00:04:08.140> don't<00:04:08.380> want<00:04:08.560> to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
blow-dry her hair and we don't want to

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.350 
blow-dry her hair and we don't want to
strain<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.190> because<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.760> would<00:04:09.850> be<00:04:09.880> too<00:04:09.940> much

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
strain it because it would be too much

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.380 
strain it because it would be too much
heat<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.989> when<00:04:11.709> we<00:04:11.830> blow<00:04:12.040> dryer<00:04:12.340> hair<00:04:12.819> it<00:04:13.090> has

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
heat and when we blow dryer hair it has

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.039 
heat and when we blow dryer hair it has
to<00:04:13.630> be<00:04:13.810> in<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.319> low<00:04:14.560> setting<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:16.060> go<00:04:16.450> ahead<00:04:16.540> and

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
to be in a low setting so go ahead and

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.060 
to be in a low setting so go ahead and
sit<00:04:17.799> her<00:04:17.889> down<00:04:18.180> grab<00:04:19.180> any<00:04:20.019> little<00:04:20.410> brush<00:04:20.650> and

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
sit her down grab any little brush and

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.520 
sit her down grab any little brush and
her<00:04:21.760> hair<00:04:22.120> used<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.690> be<00:04:22.750> straight<00:04:23.260> I'm

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
her hair used to be straight I'm

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.460 
her hair used to be straight I'm
assuming<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.729> I<00:04:24.760> will<00:04:25.150> use<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.930> same<00:04:26.200> little

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
assuming so I will use the same little

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.940 
assuming so I will use the same little
coal<00:04:26.830> and<00:04:28.020> I<00:04:29.130> would<00:04:30.130> just<00:04:30.539> very<00:04:31.950> delicately

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
coal and I would just very delicately

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.760 
coal and I would just very delicately
put<00:04:33.640> her<00:04:33.789> hair<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.479> just<00:04:34.930> blow<00:04:35.200> dry<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
put her hair and just blow dry it in the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.310 
put her hair and just blow dry it in the
lowest<00:04:36.280> setting<00:04:36.700> we<00:04:37.419> don't<00:04:37.630> want<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.930> too<00:04:38.080> hot

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
lowest setting we don't want it too hot

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.710 
lowest setting we don't want it too hot
we<00:04:38.620> don't<00:04:38.800> want<00:04:38.919> her<00:04:39.010> hair<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.250> melt<00:04:39.580> or<00:04:39.940> just

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
we don't want her hair to melt or just

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.260 
we don't want her hair to melt or just
come<00:04:40.930> off<00:04:41.140> because<00:04:41.500> of<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.890> heat<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:43.090> do

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
come off because of the heat so just do

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.570 
come off because of the heat so just do
it<00:04:43.450> in<00:04:43.690> in<00:04:44.289> something<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.070> feels<00:04:45.280> kind<00:04:45.490> of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
it in in something that feels kind of

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.020 
it in in something that feels kind of
warm<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.680> so<00:04:47.680> let's<00:04:47.919> do<00:04:48.039> it<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.310> warm<00:04:48.669> and
