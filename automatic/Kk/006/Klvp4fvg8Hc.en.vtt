00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
exactly however you want it and when you

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.440 
exactly however you want it and when you
stop<00:04:46.620> molding<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.280> want<00:04:47.520> more<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.120> one<00:04:48.300> in

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
stop molding you want more the one in

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.980 
stop molding you want more the one in
the<00:04:48.540> back<00:04:48.750> first<00:04:49.670> okay<00:04:50.670> so<00:04:51.420> that<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:51.870> in

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
the back first okay so that the one in

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.310 
the back first okay so that the one in
the<00:04:52.020> front<00:04:52.350> would<00:04:52.740> just<00:04:53.090> kind<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.320> follow

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
the front would just kind of follow

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.250 
the front would just kind of follow
through

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
through

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.500 
through
and<00:04:58.260> at<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:58.590> point<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:59.610> basically<00:05:00.090> want<00:05:00.420> to

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
and at this point you basically want to

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:10.190 
and at this point you basically want to
UM<00:05:02.480> do<00:05:03.480> these<00:05:03.720> steps<00:05:04.080> as<00:05:04.560> I'll<00:05:04.830> call<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:10.020> I

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
UM do these steps as I'll call it and I

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.350 
UM do these steps as I'll call it and I
don't<00:05:10.260> try<00:05:10.650> to<00:05:10.710> get<00:05:10.950> too<00:05:11.010> crazy<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:12.090> steps

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
don't try to get too crazy on the steps

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.350 
don't try to get too crazy on the steps
in<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.660> back<00:05:12.870> because<00:05:13.820> that's<00:05:14.820> not<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.210> most

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
in the back because that's not the most

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.530 
in the back because that's not the most
visible<00:05:15.900> part<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.320> this<00:05:16.530> head<00:05:16.770> to<00:05:16.920> high<00:05:17.070> is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
visible part of this head to high is

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.260 
visible part of this head to high is
actually<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.660> one<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.080> front<00:05:19.700> so<00:05:20.700> I<00:05:21.000> put

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
actually the one in the front so I put

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.880 
actually the one in the front so I put
all<00:05:21.390> my<00:05:21.420> energy<00:05:22.110> on<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.440> one<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.530> just<00:05:28.800> like

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
all my energy on that one and just like

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.920 
all my energy on that one and just like
we<00:05:29.160> made<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.520> accordion<00:05:30.030> style<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.720> back

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
we made the accordion style on the back

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.260 
we made the accordion style on the back
when<00:05:31.170> we<00:05:31.320> tie<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.860> want<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.430> kind<00:05:33.180> of

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
when we tie that you want to kind of

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:41.869 
when we tie that you want to kind of
make<00:05:33.480> your<00:05:33.630> steps<00:05:33.960> like<00:05:34.230> that

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.820 

and<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.509> think<00:05:42.809> the<00:05:42.959> more<00:05:43.199> you<00:05:43.229> play<00:05:43.619> around

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
and I think the more you play around

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:52.129 
and I think the more you play around
with<00:05:44.309> it<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.669> better<00:05:44.849> looks<00:05:45.889> so<00:05:47.749> basically<00:05:51.139> by

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
with it the better looks so basically by

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.949 
with it the better looks so basically by
the<00:05:52.199> time<00:05:52.319> we're<00:05:52.740> finished<00:05:53.419> this<00:05:54.419> is<00:05:54.599> what<00:05:54.779> you

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:54.959 
the time we're finished this is what you

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.659 
the time we're finished this is what you
have<00:05:55.229> and<00:05:55.709> you<00:05:55.860> can't<00:05:56.069> mess<00:05:56.189> around<00:05:56.219> with<00:05:56.610> it

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
have and you can't mess around with it

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.419 
have and you can't mess around with it
if<00:05:57.059> you<00:05:57.209> need<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.449> I<00:05:57.959> don't<00:05:58.770> like<00:05:59.069> to<00:05:59.399> use

00:05:59.419 --> 00:05:59.429 
if you need to I don't like to use

00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:02.989 
if you need to I don't like to use
needle<00:06:00.259> on<00:06:01.259> Maya<00:06:01.740> or<00:06:02.099> pins<00:06:02.490> right<00:06:02.819> I<00:06:02.849> don't

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:02.999 
needle on Maya or pins right I don't

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.559 
needle on Maya or pins right I don't
like<00:06:03.179> to<00:06:03.449> use<00:06:03.479> pin<00:06:04.229> on<00:06:04.559> my<00:06:05.459> head<00:06:05.759> ties<00:06:06.029> so<00:06:06.539> I

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:06.569 
like to use pin on my head ties so I

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:08.809 
like to use pin on my head ties so I
stay<00:06:07.020> away<00:06:07.289> from<00:06:07.349> that<00:06:07.770> because<00:06:07.919> sometimes<00:06:08.550> I

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
stay away from that because sometimes I

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:10.399 
stay away from that because sometimes I
forget<00:06:08.999> that<00:06:09.209> I<00:06:09.360> have<00:06:09.659> it<00:06:09.779> and<00:06:09.899> I<00:06:09.990> come<00:06:10.229> to

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
forget that I have it and I come to

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.739 
forget that I have it and I come to
unravel<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.189> the<00:06:11.909> pin<00:06:12.149> just<00:06:12.330> gets<00:06:12.569> stuck

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:12.749 
unravel it and the pin just gets stuck

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.529 
unravel it and the pin just gets stuck
on<00:06:12.809> my<00:06:13.050> finger<00:06:13.080> so<00:06:13.679> I<00:06:14.009> don't<00:06:14.969> play<00:06:15.149> around<00:06:15.209> with

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
on my finger so I don't play around with

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.619 
on my finger so I don't play around with
pins<00:06:15.839> but<00:06:16.080> if<00:06:16.259> you<00:06:16.469> do<00:06:16.800> prefer<00:06:17.459> to<00:06:17.699> use<00:06:18.089> pin<00:06:18.449> to

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
pins but if you do prefer to use pin to

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.139 
pins but if you do prefer to use pin to
make<00:06:18.839> sure<00:06:19.019> everything<00:06:19.559> stays<00:06:19.830> in<00:06:20.039> place<00:06:20.149> this

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:21.149 
make sure everything stays in place this

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.749 
make sure everything stays in place this
path<00:06:21.569> is<00:06:22.139> definitely<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:22.860> place<00:06:23.189> where<00:06:23.429> you<00:06:23.550> can

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
path is definitely a place where you can

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.129 
path is definitely a place where you can
pin<00:06:24.119> pin<00:06:25.080> down<00:06:25.289> but<00:06:25.349> otherwise<00:06:26.779> usually<00:06:27.779> stays

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
pin pin down but otherwise usually stays

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.320 
pin pin down but otherwise usually stays
on<00:06:28.469> when<00:06:28.709> I<00:06:28.769> tie<00:06:29.159> it<00:06:29.189> it<00:06:29.429> just<00:06:29.729> stays<00:06:29.969> on<00:06:30.149> by

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
on when I tie it it just stays on by

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.649 
on when I tie it it just stays on by
itself<00:06:30.719> and<00:06:31.580> like<00:06:32.580> I<00:06:32.729> said<00:06:32.789> it<00:06:33.240> mess<00:06:33.479> around
