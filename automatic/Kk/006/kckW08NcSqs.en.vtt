00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
card what you're going to need is a full

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.990 
card what you're going to need is a full
sheet<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.910> construction<00:00:30.689> paper<00:00:30.929> and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
sheet of construction paper and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.060 
sheet of construction paper and
basically<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> did<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.260> folded<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> in

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
basically what I did is I folded it in

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.459 
basically what I did is I folded it in
half<00:00:35.100> lengthwise<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.930> cut<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
half lengthwise and then you just cut it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
half lengthwise and then you just cut it
in<00:00:43.770> half<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:45.629> where<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.260> end<00:00:46.590> up<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.660> piece

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
in half to where you end up with a piece

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830 
in half to where you end up with a piece
of<00:00:48.690> paper<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.940> again<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.570> fold

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
of paper like this that again you fold

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
of paper like this that again you fold
in<00:00:52.110> half<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.910> card<00:00:54.559> will<00:00:55.559> open<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.129> like

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
in half so your card will open up like

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.510 
in half so your card will open up like
this<00:00:57.410> then<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.219> is<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:01.050> fold<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
this then all you do is you fold in the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.359 
this then all you do is you fold in the
bottom<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.809> top<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> card<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:07.830> form<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
bottom of the top of the card to form a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.240 
bottom of the top of the card to form a
point<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> I'll<00:01:09.240> show<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:10.250> more

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
point and I'll show you this more

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
point and I'll show you this more
closely<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> second<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.520> here's<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> inside

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
closely in a second so here's the inside

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.190 
closely in a second so here's the inside
of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> card<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.240> did<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.820> just

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
of the card and and what I did is I just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
of the card and and what I did is I just
folded<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.350> both<00:01:25.590> corners<00:01:26.040> till<00:01:26.369> they<00:01:26.520> met<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
folded up both corners till they met in

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.950 
folded up both corners till they met in
the<00:01:27.450> middle<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.700> does<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.659> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the middle and then what this does is it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.950 
the middle and then what this does is it
forms<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.560> point<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.210> front<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> card

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
forms a point on the front of the card

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.190 
forms a point on the front of the card
now<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.700> become<00:01:36.200> Rudolph's

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
now this is going to become Rudolph's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.039 
now this is going to become Rudolph's
nose<00:01:38.360> here's<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.810> finished<00:01:40.710> product<00:01:41.189> and

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
nose here's the finished product and

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.370 
nose here's the finished product and
this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.470> you'll<00:01:43.710> end<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.299> putting<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
this is where you'll end up putting the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.679 
this is where you'll end up putting the
pom-pom<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.100> Rudolph's<00:01:47.610> nose<00:01:49.790> on<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.119> inside
