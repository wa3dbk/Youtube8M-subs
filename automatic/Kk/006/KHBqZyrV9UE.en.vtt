to see right

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.229 
to see right
so<00:02:14.720> we'll<00:02:15.170> see<00:02:15.530> he<00:02:16.430> has<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:17.030> peg<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.670> his<00:02:19.670> right

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
so we'll see he has one peg on his right

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.630 
so we'll see he has one peg on his right
foot<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:21.709> he<00:02:21.950> slides<00:02:22.310> into<00:02:22.610> you<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:25.400> if<00:02:25.550> I
