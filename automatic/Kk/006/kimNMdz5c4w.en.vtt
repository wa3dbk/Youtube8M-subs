you've got it when you reverse it that's
upside<00:02:26.270> down<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.590> right<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.220> up

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
upside down and that's right way up

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:38.730 
upside down and that's right way up
you'll<00:02:29.600> see<00:02:29.630> your<00:02:29.840> patterns<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.620> like<00:02:30.800> that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
and again like to say various ones or

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.400 
and again like to say various ones or
take<00:03:32.180> them<00:03:32.330> all<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.720> bags<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.290> can

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
take them all on the bags but you can

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.730 
take them all on the bags but you can
see<00:03:33.620> what<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:33.860> like<00:03:35.080> some<00:03:36.080> of<00:03:36.110> these<00:03:36.290> are<00:03:36.530> really

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
see what I like some of these are really

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.730 
see what I like some of these are really
nice<00:03:37.960> different<00:03:38.960> metals<00:03:39.200> in<00:03:39.350> them<00:03:39.470> again

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
nice different metals in them again

want
material<00:04:22.160> ones<00:04:22.480> little<00:04:23.480> rosettes<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:24.260> was

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
material ones little rosettes that was

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.140 
material ones little rosettes that was
somewhat<00:04:24.800> one<00:04:25.010> that<00:04:25.190> somebody<00:04:25.460> made<00:04:25.640> me<00:04:25.670> but

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
somewhat one that somebody made me but

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.420 
somewhat one that somebody made me but
then<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.420> salt<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:26.780> can<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:28.250> can<00:04:28.280> make<00:04:30.430> and

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
then the salt we can be we can make and

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.320 
then the salt we can be we can make and
things<00:04:31.820> like<00:04:32.030> this<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:34.040> one's<00:04:34.280> bit<00:04:34.490> material

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
things like this this one's bit material

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:44.200 
things like this this one's bit material
and<00:04:36.040> hard<00:04:37.040> so<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.000> using<00:04:38.480> both<00:04:42.880> again<00:04:43.880> this<00:04:44.060> is

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
and hard so you using both again this is

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.800 
and hard so you using both again this is
the<00:04:44.300> twisted<00:04:44.720> one

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
the twisted one

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.100 
the twisted one
beautiful<00:04:46.710> flowers<00:04:46.889> they<00:04:47.220> are<00:04:48.050> using<00:04:49.050> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
twisted technique look at the profile on

00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:03.439 
twisted technique look at the profile on
that<00:04:57.889> and<00:04:58.889> just<00:04:58.919> various<00:04:59.610> things<00:04:59.669> like<00:04:59.970> that

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.200
