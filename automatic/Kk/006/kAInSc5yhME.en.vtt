00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 However , it can not be treated early and neglected. 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 The enlargement of the lymph nodes causes the pus to flow down and the skin to loose. 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:22.720
 Oh, he now suffers tuberculosis in old scars left few in 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.770
 Although many traces of tuberculosis can be found, many have TB 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.150
 It does not take 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:33.400
 However, since the immune system usually works well in normal times , 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.540
 Park Eun-sun of the dry body recurred five times after suffering from blue lymph node tuberculosis 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.420
 I am immune to the cold, and I can recur, 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.230
 It was about six times a day surgery 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.910
 Homes 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:54.280
 What twisted my thimble poured neurago the contents therein 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.280
 Surgery from the neck to cry until I continued recurrences you give 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:06.950
 Trail toed pus Kolmar's neck where the wound can not be left in the machine 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:09.470
 20 years of floral offerings jjogeum decisive action long been plagued for patients 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.130
 I will try 5 but 4 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.130
 Western Jogye Order 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:22.760
 If you do not want to do it, 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.980
 I eat well and work out and lose that weight nowadays 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.820
 One of the typical symptoms of tuberculosis is weight loss and anorexia 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.780
 Please do'll continue to clean up after the immune system can never escape while to 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 none 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.700
 I need to be able to level out the middle level. 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.590
 There was a lot of game verse tuberculosis in the past. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.120
 That's enough to say. 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:53.600
 In what is called scrofulous gusuri stand clustered hanging in a row 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:59.000
 Scrofulous a time window that gun control is the best bet Nago pus quality 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:04.850
 If you leave this lymph node tuberculosis intact, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.560
 As the lymph nodes are being utilized and growing, they are bursting with their skin 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.820
 I have a pus 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:16.460
 But that's the playing field . If you have tuberculosis of lymph nodes without pulmonary tuberculosis, 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:23.470
 It is not contagious respiratory just because there is pus has tuberculosis 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:23.470
 It can be infected by touching the pus or by touching the cloud. 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:32.490
 Some TB being hit in the past two diseases are holding your head back 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 Due to diet and stress, young tuberculosis patients are soft 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.500
 The number of deaths increased in eight years 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:49.220
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been lurking quietly without revealing its true color, 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.220
 We are attacking our body in a gap where the spiritual power is weakened 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 907 this day 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.200
 It's stressful to use young people. 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.200
 Especially now , 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.549
 Well, go to the school after school and also studied a bad night, do you eat yet 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.590
 I do not have enough viscosity. 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:18.379
 To defense against TB, we have nutrition or 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.609
 I need to take a good night's sleep and have an immune system like this. 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.609
 I think they are bad. 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.300
 What is this 39 degrees 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:40.310
 Some 38 degrees out 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.530
 And that the three candidates in the next year and Wondering ux with 38 or more a week 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.540
 The fever continues. 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.140
 Heat is evidence that somebody in our body is infected with pathogens such as viruses or bacteria 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.220
 All 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:59.840
 Oh, what big money coming from it but times are gay youngbae 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.910
 I could not find any other symptoms of the high fever bay, 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.450
 Did not fall 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.450
 Wool wool 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:14.790
 Korea is busy indeed and 9 for students studying pitiful phrases 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.790
 Make a lot of bottles are of course students Yes 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:25.760
 Sleeping stress itself rather Compiling a thermal stress is now being jammot wrong 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:29.180
 While eating, the nutritional host comes 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.500
 I do not know what viruses 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:37.640
 Neither tuberculosis nor these infections are absolute candidates 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:42.770
 There are a lot of cases that come with a disease, 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.100
 Be the cause of this disease should not be visible until now, both tests normal dangso 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.100
 ego 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:54.110
 Well obviously you where you are alike neukkyeojineunde can not find the cause of the 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:05:00.199
 I'm hiding. 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:03.380
 So this may be an inflammation of the large negative yiseungyeol most one-third in the case of a patient 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:09.680
 If the tuberculosis is hiding in the belly 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:15.020
 There is also a case where the armpit or the crowd sanctuary is hidden, 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:19.910
 I like lupus, but autoimmune autoimmune diseases such as vasculitis 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.720
 In line with this disease, there is also no tracking, the initial symptoms have met 10 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.919
 It appears. 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.919
 10 does not show the whole picture what a typical encounter 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:36.320
 Unexplained fever lasts more than three weeks and lasts for over a week . 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.320
 Tells you when you do not know the cause 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:45.560
 Unexplained fever is a persistent disease with a variety of possibilities in mind. 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.560
 We need effort. 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:54.490
 As a deduction system that protects the body from infection , 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:59.080
 An attacking autoimmune disease or one of them. 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.960
 There are numerous kinds of Java Immune Disease , but the introduction needs to be afforded by the executives 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:06.129
 I do not have any symptoms 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:11.249
 The same is true of tuberculosis when it is hidden 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:11.249
 U 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.499
 What you can do next 

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:21.639
 A lymphoma that is a malignant tumor in the lymph nodes . 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:27.599
 But there are many other diseases with fever 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.599
 Two or three of the ten unknown 10 patients do not know the circle . 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:45.560
 I do not prescribe antibiotics because I am afraid that Huh Joon Hwa is feverish. 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.560
 Abuse of antibiotics can also lead to resistant bacteria 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:55.940
 H1N1 influenza deaths occur for the first time in Korea 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.690
 I have recently traveled to Thailand and I am just going to give you a good 4. 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.690
 H1N1 flu 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.419
 In the 20s who were healthy in the middle of the day, 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.889
 I'm on board 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:11.290
 What a bottle I was so drunk in a new epidemic that spread at the fastest rate in history 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:15.610
 People were embarrassed. 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:18.570
 H1N1 influenza A (H1N1) influenza A 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.570
 virus 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.440
 The catastrophe that struck the whole world came to an end only after it took many lives. 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:36.810
 Oh, Korea Now, in the beginning of the modern era, 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:44.000
 The case is 2009 H1N1 flu. 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:44.000
 Oh, after seeing it, I've had enough vaccines in the meantime .
