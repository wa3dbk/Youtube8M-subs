00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.830
 focus on heating we don’t 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.599
 we will be as it depends on your 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.660
 location that is admissible 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.699
 advise you to use 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.939
 gas as it is done here 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.070
 very relatively cheap and convenient but we 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.039
 we understand that not everyone can fail 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.919
 your greenhouses gas depending on where you are greenhouse 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.050
 is so make a decision 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.460
 you still have to drown than 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.550
 and how to heat for a greenhouse but 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.920
 we are a little bit if you have such 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.810
 opportunity to bring gas to its greenhouse 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.460
 we'll tell you a little bit on your 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.730
 an example of how this is done 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.030
 and further all the same 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.250
 decision specific decision to make you 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.740
 that is, if you prefer track and drown 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.890
 firewood or look on the internet very 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.920
 huge amount of information therefore 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.189
 there are some sadness to use what 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.630
 fuel use we know that even 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:11.659
 make and warm floors and well, just wood 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.270
 also someone uses some kind of electro 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.420
 breakage guides 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 elements of your greenhouse we show you 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.640
 our example will tell you how 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.659
 us heated greenhouses how 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:33.260
 show some drawings on our 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.330
 It was a specific example of what was 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.729
 there was no greenhouse what choice heating not 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.940
 used first turn 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.680
 attention to her dignity weathe 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.140
 we have a greenhouse from the greenhouse 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.700
 overwhelm polystyrene that gives 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.720
 additional heat effect 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.950
 does not allow frost to break through the greenhouse and 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.350
 the outside of the greenhouse 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.260
 initially 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.540
 layed onions turnip that is 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.600
 remaining after cutting the pen 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.900
 that's the way and further sprinkled 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:11.400
 ground for heating greenhouses we 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.950
 use carriage torch Ubrab 16 we 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.720
 they are different heating very different 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.020
 kind of but how can you see here 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.780
 the main thing is that the ovens themselves are in - depth 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.550
 it gives land the opportunity to spend 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.600
 pipe as low as possible in order to 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.730
 from the bottom also the racks were heated themselves 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.300
 pipes 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 you can can not need how can 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.430
 closer to the wall to adjust the stove 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.340
 brick over or others 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.130
 non - combustible material to and warm 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.130
 persisted 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.440
 bricks themselves or in this material and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.440
 so that the hot air does not go on the bow so 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.940
 like a bow that doesn’t like pipes 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.770
 arrange also flattered loan on 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.200
 the main thing that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.600
 working space at the expense of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.940
 because of the location of the pipes 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:12.430
 the heating did not decrease better themselves 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.330
 hold pipes on the shadow side 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.459
 greenhouses as the sun still gives 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.540
 your effects if the side is sunny 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:28.000
 sun somehow anyway 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.680
 will heat your greenhouse here on 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.600
 our view we show you the most 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.989
 such a successful solution we like very much 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.820
 that option, that is, from two sides 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.520
 heating fits one to one 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.880
 chimney 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.430
 You can see it in the drawings 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.950
 also here it should be taken into account that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.630
 the rules of the furnace industry in one 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.900
 the chimney must fit two pipes 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:58.390
 smaller diameter i.e. if diameter 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.900
 pipes you have 250 300 millimeters then pipe 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.920
 to heating the heating tube should you 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.940
 should fail 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.910
 a maximum of 120 150 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.370
 millimeters in diameter should also 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:19.720
 say that especially when leaving the oven 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.450
 1 knee should be made from such 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.120
 refractory material 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.390
 large thickness so that it does not 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 I've already lost 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:35.620
 use pipes 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:40.570
 less than some wall thickness 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:45.190
 durable pipes are greenhouses and lined 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:49.030
 brick stove also note 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.820
 what we have in each greenhouse inscription 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.660
 there is a container with water that you have 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.630
 there will always be warm water of the waterfall to him 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.060
 water will warm up too 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.840
 importantly accounting as we advised 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:09.730
 It is better to water with warm water 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.350
 an example of how the heating itself told us 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.100
 done differently somewhere with the knees 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:19.020
 somewhere direct and this example in one of 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.790
 greenhouses so as greenhouses wide here we are 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.470
 in the middle 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.240
 the greenhouse itself as close to the ground as possible 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.050
 located heating and it passes here 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.390
 at the end under the shelves themselves but 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:38.410
 after all heating you will carry out 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:40.420
 at your discretion so the choice is yours 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.180
 how will you have it 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.510
 read read look 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.980
 information on the Internet I repeat 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.800
 a lot of information 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.060
 advise and explain how 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.889
 make heating we can't you 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.950
 it is possible that you would suggest but not 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:06:00.889
 know your greenhouse designs do not know 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.470
 what gas opportunities do you have 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:09.340
 maybe it's easier for you to heat wood 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.340
 and coal somehow but the choice is yours
