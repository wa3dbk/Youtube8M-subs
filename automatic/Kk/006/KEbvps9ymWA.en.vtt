00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.899
 and 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.439
 flanges so we used to call this 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.209
 footwear 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.580
 and this name got attached to them because 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:13.620
 settlement in which they did in 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 Soviet Union in the Leningrad region 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.810
 in the city of slates the manufacturer drank on 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.689
 the name of the city is so the buyers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.110
 there were that this is the name of the shoes on 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.759
 Actually these are slippers 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.770
 there are dozens of types of shoes but who 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.649
 how it creates possible in the mind arises 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.559
 image of a lone cobbler is in the past 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.420
 Today shoes sew factories for needle 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.150
 they don't immediately grab here first 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.250
 come up and develop a model in contrast 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.900
 from the clothes of the patterns here do right on 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.060
 leg certainly not real on 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.280
 plastic pad looms 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.130
 future boot model with all the little ones 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 the details we remove this unwrapped coffee 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.520
 It turns out such a primer model for which 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.190
 already building the model itself is obtained here 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 such a sketch now we select the fabric 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 landmark not only on attractive 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 structures but also on the quality of the material for 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.439
 this expert from each flap 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.639
 cuts off a sample in a lab check 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.639
 its strength and elasticity 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
 the fabric is matched the pattern is ready but 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.760
 at first the shoemaker will only drive one pair 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.830
 shoe 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.110
 if the move the council approves the model is already in 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.420
 the finished form the pattern will multiply on 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.210
 the entire size range and send to the shop on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.670
 sewing a whole line every shift 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.979
 the master gets the basket with the task here 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.930
 there is a pair of shoes true still in 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.660
 disassembled here is just the task 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.790
 experienced specialist using the template 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.790
 assemble the finished product from parts 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.020
 without shoes this house to give it 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 leg shape the blank is sent to the shop with 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.950
 high-tech equipment 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.630
 1 molding us to the shoe plate 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.580
 they warmed up to a certain 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.370
 temperatures they press protracted 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.170
 the edge extended by pincers and actually 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.150
 saying forgive gluing lingering 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.620
 hem to main insoles main 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
 the insole is by the way called the main 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.510
 because the main fixture blank 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.610
 the top of the shoe happens on the insole 2 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.830
 heel forming this process is easier 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.350
 first the shoe is put on a hot uniform 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.480
 followed by a cold case for fixing 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.220
 left behind the sole and and order 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.390
 pre-connect these two blanks 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.390
 there will be a vacuum machine 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.670
 check again quality check 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.500
 this pair of shoes and with a positive 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.240
 the result will send through the department 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.240
 marketing on the shelves for us 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.220
 probably not afraid of cars and so then 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.319
 all get this advice for newbies from 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.180
 experienced specialist but 9 years ago 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.040
 Natalia Belkovo herself she was her 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.830
 mentor Larisa Mana Gasheva 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.020

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.620
 didn't see a sewing machine depends on 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.120
 wishes let 's say it is given to someone 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.280
 someone is not given 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.650
 someone is trying to learn but from him 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.890
 somewhere something is hard to do 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.830
 someone can just sat down and became 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.049
 sew as if a hundred years already worked 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.150
