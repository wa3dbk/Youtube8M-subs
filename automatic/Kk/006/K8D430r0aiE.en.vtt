price<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.470> little<00:04:10.560> absurd<00:04:11.220> that's

apparent<00:04:14.040> reason<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.670> EA<00:04:14.910> did<00:04:15.180> go<00:04:15.330> forth<00:04:15.600> and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
apparent reason so EA did go forth and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.449 
apparent reason so EA did go forth and
actually<00:04:16.109> lower<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> price<00:04:16.769> though<00:04:17.310> they

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
actually lower the price though they

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.759 
actually lower the price though they
only<00:04:17.640> dropped<00:04:17.970> into<00:04:18.209> 2999<00:04:19.080> now<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.709> course

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
only dropped into 2999 now of course

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.590 
only dropped into 2999 now of course
they're<00:04:20.100> still<00:04:20.370> really<00:04:20.580> confusing<00:04:21.390> as

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
they're still really confusing as

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.300 
they're still really confusing as
because<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:21.989> not<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.380> par<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:22.950> North

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:27.870 
9 now at first many people thought well
of<00:04:26.919> course<00:04:27.190> it's<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.430> difference<00:04:27.820> between

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
of course it's the difference between

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.790 
of course it's the difference between
the<00:04:28.210> u.s.<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.540> of<00:04:28.870> course<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.169> Australian

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
the u.s. and of course the Australian

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.890 
the u.s. and of course the Australian
economy<00:04:30.070> which<00:04:30.460> is<00:04:30.639> somehow<00:04:30.940> affecting<00:04:31.750> this

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
economy which is somehow affecting this

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.659 
economy which is somehow affecting this
game<00:04:32.229> price<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:32.949> if<00:04:33.100> we<00:04:33.220> take<00:04:33.250> this<00:04:33.520> into

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669
