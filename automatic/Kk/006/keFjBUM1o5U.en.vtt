00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello very good everyone we will see how 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.940
 pass documents from our computer 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.380
 to ipad through itunes 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.580
 then as we can see here I have 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.580
 three new documents 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.850
 and we're going to use itunes to move them 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.760
 towards our device 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.610
 in this case I have the ipad connected to 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.440
 through the usb cable and I'm in the 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
 application tab in the part of 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.290
 down where you see the applications that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.290
 I have installed 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.540
 I'm going to reduce a bit of the screen 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.540
 so you can see how easy it is 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 pass the documents 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 from our computer to the ipad 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.329
 to pass the presentation what I'm going to 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.409
 do is catch 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.989
 the power point document and move it in 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.030
 this case to the keynote application that 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.140
 appears on the itunes 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.799
 basically the fact of choosing quina is 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.990
 because if I take this presentation and the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.630
 step to another application like it can be and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.360
 movie that is just above 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.659
 when it's inside the ipad and try 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.219
 see the content is not going to be possible 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.790
 because the application that reproduces 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.920
 presentations in this case is keynote 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.180
 then I have it here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.880
 and I will show you 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.080
 on the iPad how can we 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.080
 recover that presentation 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.510
 here from the ipad we click on 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.510
 our king out application 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.990
 and the little buttons that have up to 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.390
 the left 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.390
 we have a plus sign we press 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 and we give the copy button of itunes 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 and as you see here we have the presentation 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.940
 we press you start the process of 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.300
 import 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.600
 Y 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.700
 Here we see the classic warning that 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.230
 there are some fonts that have not 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.960
 could be recognized 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.590
 let's say ok and here we have a 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.590
 presentation 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.130
 imagine that we want to do now the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.740
 process in reverse ie we want 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.440
 pass it from our ipad to the computer 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.050
 through itunes 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.430
 simply by clicking on the icon 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.140
 that appears above on the left that 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.440
 has a little arrow pointing towards 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.140
 top click on the send button 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.720
 a copy 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.319
 we choose the presentation and we will 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.299
 go out 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.540
 a drop down in which we can 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.430
 select the itunes app what 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.430
 we press 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.680
 It asks us to select the format 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.299
 we tell you that power point 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.290
 and with this we already have our 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.420
 presentation on itunes we are going to 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.019
 check it on the iTunes and how can we 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.360
 see we have the presentation that we had 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.210
 past 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.710
 and we have the presentation that we just 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.200
 to move from the ipad to the computer 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.900
 then once from itunes we can already 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.319
 tell you where we want to save that 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.780
 presentation 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.430
 let's choose the folder we're going to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.090
 select the folder 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.859
 and we already have this presentation here 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.859
 that we just transferred 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.780
 let's repeat now the process with the 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.190
 document and the spreadsheet 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.170
 then we come to movies 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.170
 we take the document 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.480
 and we move it to itunes 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.069
 we are going to numbers 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.069
 we take a spreadsheet 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.040
 we drag 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.120
 to this light jones we already have the sheet 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.100
 calculation in the numbers 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.980
 and the document in the country 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.969
 we go to the iPad we are going to start by px 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.119
 we click on it 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.889
 we give the icon that has the symbol 

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:38.300
 further up on the left 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.300
 we tell you to copy itunes 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.699
 we have here our document 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.699
 and we import it 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.190
 it gives us the notice of the fonts that 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.020
 could not care, come on 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.020
 and here we have our document 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.889
 converted from word 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.020
 that we've gone through itunes 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.020
 let's do the same for numbers 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.409
 we open the application we click on the 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.399
 more symbol 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.399
 copy from itunes 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.740
 click on the spreadsheet 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.620
 and we care about our ipad 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.980
 we already have here in this case the sheet does not 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:33.420
 contained no text but did 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.420
 it keeps the cells 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.540
 what's wrong with it 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.259
 now from movies 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.599
 a new document 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.009
 let's choose one of the ones that there are already 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.580
 here so that at least you see something 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.580
 of content 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.710
 we already have it we put documents to us 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.010
 appears here and we're going to click on the 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.010
 flechita 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.820
 send a copy 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.840
 we press the document and we say 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.840
 what itunes 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.650
 shows us the four formats in the 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:22.110
 that we can send this document to 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:24.030
 through itunes let's choose word 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.920
 because we're going to open it on a computer 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.700
 with windows and with office 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.700
 we enter here 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.850
 we come 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.419
 to the country and notice that we already have here 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.430
 modern report is simply with 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:47.030
 click it and drag it 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.490
 we already have it in our computer 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.250
 let's open it 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.900
 here we have the document that we just 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.900
 to create with combs 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.490
 this operation works for both movies 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.110
 as king or as numbers or any 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.000
 another type of application that is 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.690
 compatible 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.690
 as you see 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:17.409
 as you see on itunes we have a lot of 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.419
 Applications 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:21.099
 to which we can pass documents 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:24.519
 we have the reader we have and very well 

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.910
 We have everything we have Chinese numbers pages 

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:27.980
 anyway 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:31.840
 and many other applications that we can 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.840
 install to pass these documents
