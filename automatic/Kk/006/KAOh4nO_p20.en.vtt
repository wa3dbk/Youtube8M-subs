expansion<00:01:33.670> around<00:01:34.090> forward<00:01:34.600> peddling<00:01:34.960> out

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
expansion around forward peddling out

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.770 
expansion around forward peddling out
there<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.770> no<00:01:35.950> deformation<00:01:36.310> or<00:01:36.820> fragmentation

Hornady these rounds are definitely one

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.660 
Hornady these rounds are definitely one
of<00:01:45.160> my<00:01:45.250> top<00:01:45.310> favorites<00:01:45.820> as<00:01:45.940> well<00:01:50.610> shooting<00:01:51.610> a

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
little bit lower and hopefully to see

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.120 
little bit lower and hopefully to see
how<00:01:55.119> my<00:01:55.270> accuracy<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.900> this<00:01:56.020> thing<00:01:56.229> I<00:01:56.470> speak

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
how my accuracy is of this thing I speak

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.859 
how my accuracy is of this thing I speak
to<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> cool<00:01:57.520> though<00:01:57.670> either<00:01:57.850> way<00:01:59.130> here<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.250> go

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
to the cool though either way here we go

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.640 

we're<00:02:24.180> looking<00:02:24.390> at<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:24.570> maybe<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.930> half<00:02:25.140> inch

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we're looking at about maybe a half inch

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.430

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
for the critical event but not by much

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.000 
for the critical event but not by much
they're<00:02:30.570> flying<00:02:31.050> straight<00:02:31.350> consistent

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
about half inches of penetration which

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.840 
about half inches of penetration which
is<00:02:35.430> nice
