00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.240
 In 1937, the Oklahoma grocer invented 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.259
 grocery cart note that its 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.480
 customers stop picking up purchases 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450
 when the basket exit how becomes 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.660
 too heavy a cart has become 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.660
 symbol of modern trade 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.369
 In particular, this factory produces 50 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.480
 different models that 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.519
 made of durable steel 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.859
 wire 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.210
 for the manufacture of one trolley 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.669
 more than one hundred and fifty pieces are required 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.669
 wire 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 m 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.920
 machine tools automatic with wire 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 turning it into carriage parts 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 us to make a basket of carts 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.700
 the worker uses the fixtures 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 allowing to weave a grid of pieces 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 wire 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.860
 then special devices 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.680
 automatically welds their point 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 by welding 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.940
 the next machine developing pressure 20 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.200
 tons everywhere tales of vodka and gives it 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 basket shape 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.390
 boxes and knocks the side walls 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.650
 baskets 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.650
 excess wire is cut off 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.070
 machine tool strips piece 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.860
 wire in which will become a pen and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.860
 carts 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.949
 four meter segment 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.949
 metal tube shaped chassis 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.809
 robot weld chassis 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.260
 punching machine 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.429
 for wheels 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.199
 they are made of thick steel strips 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.449
 for extra strength and 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.199
 durability and welded us network 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.599
 everything 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.599
 f 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.199
 I drop the metal parts of the cart for 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.979
 cleaning in tanks with soapy water 

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.979
 boric acid 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.519
 then galvanized on a trolley 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.900
 the way to start your nickel 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900
 ang and then chrome 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.719
 now you can finally assemble the cart 

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.739
 wheels are attached to the chassis 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.739
 and rivets 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.629
 then installed 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.629
 bottom shelf 

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:53.009
 it is followed by a basket 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.809
 given need of reform 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.809
 reclining seats and baby and 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.149
 applied and instructions for 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.179
 application 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.500
 f then the seat is set 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.110
 finally into the handle of the trolley 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.110
 strip what is the name of the store and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.110
 attach it in the right place 

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:35.589
 after final adjustment check 

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:37.409
 qualities just made 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.809
 the trolley for goods is ready for operation 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.599
 until those goals she goes where you need another 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:43.749
 question
