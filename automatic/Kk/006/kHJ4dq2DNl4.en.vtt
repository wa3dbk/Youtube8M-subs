this is what it looks like it has a SPF
of<00:00:54.910> 10<00:00:55.179> so<00:00:55.420> that's<00:00:55.570> pretty<00:00:55.929> good<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.489> I<00:00:57.550> feel

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
of 10 so that's pretty good but I feel

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.970 
of 10 so that's pretty good but I feel
like<00:00:57.910> for<00:00:58.719> everyday<00:00:59.019> wear<00:00:59.350> if<00:00:59.589> you<00:00:59.710> guys<00:00:59.800> are

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
gonna be outside or whatnot it's always

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.810 
gonna be outside or whatnot it's always
nice<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.109> have<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.469> moisturizer<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.129> also<00:01:03.460> has

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
nice to have a moisturizer that also has

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.720 
nice to have a moisturizer that also has
an<00:01:03.969> SPF<00:01:04.120> because<00:01:04.809> 10<00:01:05.190> really<00:01:06.190> isn't<00:01:06.370> that<00:01:06.580> much

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
an SPF because 10 really isn't that much

linen and that's my color it's one of

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.550 
linen and that's my color it's one of
the<00:01:15.490> lightest<00:01:15.850> colors<00:01:16.240> because<00:01:16.630> I<00:01:16.659> am<00:01:17.020> quite

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560

the lightest colors because I am quite
light<00:01:18.810> I'm<00:01:19.810> rhyming<00:01:20.140> honestly<00:01:20.799> I<00:01:20.829> don't

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
light I'm rhyming honestly I don't

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
light I'm rhyming honestly I don't
really<00:01:21.460> like<00:01:21.909> this<00:01:22.119> shade<00:01:22.630> for<00:01:22.990> me<00:01:23.170> personally

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

I<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:25.149> it<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.360> right<00:01:25.600> now<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.560> also<00:01:26.740> have

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
I have it on right now but I also have

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.149 
I have it on right now but I also have
on<00:01:27.130> bronzer<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.020> powder<00:01:29.020> so<00:01:29.500> you<00:01:29.950> can't

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
on bronzer and powder so you can't

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.480 
on bronzer and powder so you can't
really<00:01:30.340> get<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.850> true<00:01:31.149> reading<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.899> this

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
really get a true reading of this

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.700 
really get a true reading of this
foundation<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:34.149> I<00:01:34.390> feel<00:01:34.689> like<00:01:34.840> for<00:01:35.140> me<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.500> has

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
foundation but I feel like for me it has

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.700 
foundation but I feel like for me it has
kind<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.280> yellow<00:01:36.670> tone<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:37.960> it's<00:01:38.350> kind<00:01:38.649> of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
kind of a yellow tone to it it's kind of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.980 
kind of a yellow tone to it it's kind of
yellowish<00:01:39.219> and<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:40.299> don't<00:01:40.450> really<00:01:40.689> like<00:01:40.960> that

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
yellowish and I don't really like that

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.010 
yellowish and I don't really like that
and<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:42.040> put<00:01:42.729> on<00:01:42.880> bronzer<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.420> stuff<00:01:43.600> like<00:01:43.810> that

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and I put on bronzer and stuff like that

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.789 
and I put on bronzer and stuff like that
just<00:01:44.049> so<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.710> kind<00:01:45.700> of<00:01:45.820> gives<00:01:46.000> me<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:47.320> different

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
just so it kind of gives me a different

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.719 
just so it kind of gives me a different
shade<00:01:48.280> but<00:01:49.140> yeah<00:01:50.140> so<00:01:50.439> don't<00:01:50.590> really<00:01:50.920> like<00:01:51.549> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
shade but yeah so don't really like the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.760 
shade but yeah so don't really like the
color<00:01:51.909> linen<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.079> like<00:01:53.350> about<00:01:53.500> this

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
color linen what I like about this

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.319 
color linen what I like about this
foundation<00:01:54.549> is<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:56.229> really<00:01:57.329> medium

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
foundation is that it is a really medium

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.660 
foundation is that it is a really medium
to<00:01:58.689> full<00:01:58.869> coverage<00:01:59.070> foundation<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.369> really

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
to full coverage foundation and I really

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.910 
to full coverage foundation and I really
like<00:02:00.909> that<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.450> seems<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.200> really<00:02:02.350> cover<00:02:02.680> up

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
like that it seems to really cover up

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.969 
like that it seems to really cover up
stuff<00:02:03.280> nicely<00:02:03.850> if<00:02:04.329> you<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.630> any<00:02:04.960> pimples<00:02:05.289> any

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
stuff nicely if you have any pimples any

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
a little bit around my face especially

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.920 
a little bit around my face especially
in<00:02:45.770> my<00:02:45.890> t-zone<00:02:46.160> because<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.970> get<00:02:47.120> kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> oily
