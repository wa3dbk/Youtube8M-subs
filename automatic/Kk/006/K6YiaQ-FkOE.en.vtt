day<00:01:06.720> challenge<00:01:07.189> I'm<00:01:08.189> used<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> having<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.299> large

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
day challenge I'm used to having a large

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
day challenge I'm used to having a large
touchscreen<00:01:10.170> display<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
touchscreen display and so it was just

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.330 
touchscreen display and so it was just
it<00:01:12.600> would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.869> easier<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.380> me<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> make<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
it would be easier for me to make the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.850 
it would be easier for me to make the
transition<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.030> blackberry<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
transition to blackberry you know to a

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.530 
transition to blackberry you know to a
blackberry<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> large<00:01:18.270> touchscreen

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
blackberry that has a large touchscreen

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
blackberry that has a large touchscreen
display<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.680> that's<00:01:19.860> why<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.070> picked<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> torch

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
display so that's why I picked the torch

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.149 
display so that's why I picked the torch
over<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> bold<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.770> know<00:01:22.860> some<00:01:23.130> of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.859 
this is how this works or you know this
is<00:01:45.960> how<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.170> system<00:01:46.710> works<00:01:47.390> that's<00:01:48.390> again

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
is how the system works that's again

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
is how the system works that's again
just<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.729> are

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
have to go here and then go to a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.649 
have to go here and then go to a
different<00:02:19.829> profile<00:02:20.519> which<00:02:21.060> isn't<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
different profile which isn't that

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.750 
different profile which isn't that
difficult<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.739> mean<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.159> know<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.549> turn

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
difficult I mean you know you just turn

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.850 
difficult I mean you know you just turn
on<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.970> screen<00:02:24.269> and<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.689> but<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.829> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
on the screen and do it but you have a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.069 
on the screen and do it but you have a
silence<00:02:26.489> button<00:02:26.790> right<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.599> mean<00:02:27.720> it

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
silence button right here I mean it

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.039 
silence button right here I mean it
would<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.620> simple<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.250> have<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.390> silence

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
would be so simple to have this silence

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.479 
would be so simple to have this silence
the<00:02:31.200> ringer<00:02:31.379> and<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.709> can't<00:02:31.920> tell<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.189> how<00:02:32.400> many

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
the ringer and I can't tell you how many

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.309 
the ringer and I can't tell you how many
times<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.970> was<00:02:33.090> pushing<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:33.629> was<00:02:33.750> like<00:02:33.900> is

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
times I was pushing and I was like is

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.780 
times I was pushing and I was like is
this<00:02:34.379> actually<00:02:34.680> doing<00:02:35.129> anything<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.700> it's

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
this actually doing anything and it's

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.580 
this actually doing anything and it's
not<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.629> to<00:02:36.689> me<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.170> makes

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
not and so to me that just makes

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.009 
not and so to me that just makes
absolutely<00:02:38.310> no<00:02:38.430> sense<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.900> small

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
absolutely no sense but it's a small

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.869 
absolutely no sense but it's a small
thing<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:40.799> can<00:02:41.189> definitely<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.640> used<00:02:41.760> to

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
thing so I can definitely get used to

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.890 
thing so I can definitely get used to
that<00:02:42.799> blackberry<00:02:43.799> app<00:02:43.980> world's<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:45.780> app

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
apps and it was something that I

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.020 
apps and it was something that I
expected<00:03:04.319> because<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:05.159> know<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.459> count<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.970> I

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
expected because I know the count and I

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.369 
expected because I know the count and I
know<00:03:06.120> how<00:03:06.299> many<00:03:06.359> apps<00:03:06.659> there<00:03:06.930> are<00:03:07.049> an<00:03:07.170> app

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
know how many apps there are an app

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.319 
know how many apps there are an app
world<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.859> came<00:03:08.069> from<00:03:08.250> Windows<00:03:08.760> Phone<00:03:09.030> where

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
world I came from Windows Phone where

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.599 
world I came from Windows Phone where
again<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.230> very<00:03:10.290> limited<00:03:11.040> there's<00:03:11.280> yeah<00:03:11.579> I

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
again it's very limited there's yeah I

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.849 
again it's very limited there's yeah I
think<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.879> just<00:03:12.030> hit<00:03:12.299> 60,000<00:03:13.079> apps<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.769> I'm

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
think it just hit 60,000 apps so I'm

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.879 
think it just hit 60,000 apps so I'm
expecting<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.549> have<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.000> limited<00:03:15.480> selection

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
expecting to have a limited selection

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.039 
expecting to have a limited selection
but<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.910> problem<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.449> not<00:03:18.599> just<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
but the problem is not just the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.619 
but the problem is not just the
selection<00:03:19.889> it's<00:03:20.040> also<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.760> quality<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.419> the

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
selection it's also the quality of the

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.089 
selection it's also the quality of the
