00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
awesome that looks so now if you build

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.690 
awesome that looks so now if you build
your<00:00:45.329> houses<00:00:45.570> are<00:00:46.200> your<00:00:46.620> house<00:00:46.770> rather<00:00:47.100> down

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

your houses are your house rather down
in<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.030> three<00:00:48.450> holes<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.289> say<00:00:49.559> build

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
in these three holes and you say build

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.619 
in these three holes and you say build
something<00:00:50.370> here<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> build<00:00:51.000> something<00:00:51.480> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
something here you build something and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
something here you build something and
the<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.949> then<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.460> build

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the other one and then you build

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.549 
the other one and then you build
something<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.170> connect

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
something in that one and you connect

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
something in that one and you connect
them<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.920> three<00:00:56.370> underground<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.360> would

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
them all three underground that would

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
them all three underground that would
just<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.989> awesome<00:00:58.199> idea<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> house

let's go ahead and go on to the last
area<00:02:53.080> of<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.530> seed<00:02:53.800> which<00:02:54.310> is<00:02:54.459> probably<00:02:54.670> one

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
area of the seed which is probably one

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.210
