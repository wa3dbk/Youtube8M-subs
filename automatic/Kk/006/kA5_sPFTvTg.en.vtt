00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi are the baskets at the corner of the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.810
 hearth and we are here in my kitchen 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.510
 for cooking once a month 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.509
 the last episode the special bet for 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.890
 dinner that one too close to once 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 in the month with the crawford then the cross 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.710
 of I had already mentioned a while ago is one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.410
 plethora of electric slow cooking 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 pretty much hurry on slow cooking 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.800
 or a little bit more who more caliber 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.440
 practically there is a eurolat in timer 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 queso then also a and non alzheimer are 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.239
 simply turned on spirit and by 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.910
 precisely kitchen and consuming very little to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.219
 electricity level is safe not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 we need to be able to mix it 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.010
 so we can leave for work and 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.289
 find dinner ready as a first home 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.109
 i love my croft i'm so happy to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 having taken it then thought why 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.510
 do not combine a kitchen with the crawford 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 with left-handed to the obvious as is done with 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 your own bot 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.549
 attention you cannot freeze the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:21.060
 things in the croft so you have to be 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 be careful if you have any idea 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.220
 buy it to start doing you too 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.860
 this type of kitchen to thaw 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.540
 things first in time before putting them 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:37.409
 in a croft because it has so much cooking 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.150
 then the bottom slow fire but bubbles 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.920
 however it is it is dangerous to risk that 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.509
 having it, he will see it in spite of so much 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.820
 obviously there are problems with 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.090
 bacteria that are generated and so on 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:57.270
 you must first thaw and maybe in the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.270
 how it's done and very easy 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.380
 then we start by taking the chicken that 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.689
 already in the bag you cut and sludge one 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.460
 head of garlic indeed we make two whole 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.060
 garlic heads and we put them in 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.730
 bag together with cut lemon 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 half in directly the stamp of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 rosemary cut fees 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.060
 we are also two other lemons though 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.180
 we squeeze and love everyone directly 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.180
 inside 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.599
 we close the bag well and this is 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.489
 my route accepted with the chicken da 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.950
 ferragosto 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.110
 let us pray the things done and let us begin 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.970
 with stew 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.660
 then we already have the radiato stew 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.640
 from the day before we carry ourselves inside 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.090
 be careful you don't mess up 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.090
 I did 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.080
 you always hear better clean work 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.080
 immediately 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.360
 yes it is that of a stew that will go 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.700
 cooked you see we see 8 ress and on 5 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.010
 hours you wrote on purpose so that 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.849
 if he wanted to throw himself my husband finds 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.220
 precisely all the indications 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.040
 then his bag directly 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 celery carrot onion already admitted 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.349
 mince two cans the day before 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.349
 I will give 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.319
 tightens 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.290
 but of wine you close it is also ready 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.890
 as a bag regarding it 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.890
 stew 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.380
 but when it was however from chrome it will be 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.110
 defrost system you will need to thaw 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.470
 all the night before and you just need to put 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.830
 in too much and cooking is giving 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.990
 directions 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.670
 this is a turkey cd here 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.080
 we have the small cut turkey 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.040
 small smaller than stew 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.790
 we put the onion we have fibulae on 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.070
 put the pumpkin the pumpkin pulp the flight 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.990
 put them these new political nos 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.370
 of course the spices with the exception 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.960
 of chili pepper factory 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.380
 our tastes and tasty ether 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.380

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.130
 it will be instead 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.320
 now pumpkin left out all upright 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.200
 the bag is the fault of the pumpkin at cost 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:28.340
 of the day before celery and onion 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.870

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.710
 I cooked today 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:39.020
 then we start with the croft with the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:40.550
 which I will cook the chicken with lemon and 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.450
 garlic 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:50.360

 who is not right as you can see 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.830
 they are all put in the know that this 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.140
 way to take up as little space as possible 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.590
 let's move on to things already cooked on 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.870
 meatloaf cut in half and put away 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:10.070
 with the baking paper so that it is 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.590
 easy to separate the baked radicchio 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.580
 perhaps born in two portions in so-called 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:19.340
 easy to pull off the broccoli to 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.680
 steam already cooled and ready to 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:28.690
 put away the omelettes with spinach 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:32.300
 and the cheese and the peppers yesterday 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.760
 in fact with the same mixture of the del 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.840
 meatloaf that so even more comfortable and 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.460
 then we move on to the boxes with the i 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:47.060
 mushrooms , mushrooms or chopped in this way 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:50.710
 you are even easier to eat the 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.710
 Provencal chicken 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:06.439

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:08.929
 vegetables that are healthy like this 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:12.349
 chicken broth for a day a 

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:14.029
 a little bit cold and here it was already 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.889
 actually half frozen this now 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:25.849
 we put it back in the freezer and immediately 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:30.519
