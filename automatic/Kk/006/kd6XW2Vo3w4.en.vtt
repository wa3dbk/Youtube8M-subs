think<00:03:11.920> of<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.220> trick<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.670> like<00:03:13.270> what

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
think of the trick to that like what

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.920 
think of the trick to that like what
utility<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:16.240> don't<00:03:16.360> want<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> get<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.750> pet

offseason like last year made a mistake

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.390 
offseason like last year made a mistake
it's<00:03:19.780> much<00:03:19.930> quicker<00:03:20.050> than<00:03:20.200> eight<00:03:20.830> teams<00:03:21.190> rise

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
a lot of stuff probably the other

for an area morning
now<00:03:29.819> splicing<00:03:30.150> set<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.720> clock<00:03:30.900> now<00:03:31.319> supposing

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
now splicing set the clock now supposing

no no we're not feeling really negative
why<00:03:36.420> don't<00:03:36.630> stop<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.930> clock<00:03:37.050> functions<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.770> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
why don't stop the clock functions and I

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.229 
why don't stop the clock functions and I
squeeze<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.459> every<00:03:38.700> last<00:03:38.819> bit<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.060> definition

squeeze it every last bit of definition

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.559 
squeeze it every last bit of definition
then<00:03:39.750> maybe<00:03:39.930> actually<00:03:40.230> begin<00:03:40.470> there

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
then maybe actually begin there
