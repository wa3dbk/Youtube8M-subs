useful<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.489> getting<00:00:59.610> started

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
useful as I was getting started

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.720 
useful as I was getting started
developing<00:01:00.989> phone<00:01:01.200> applications<00:01:01.920> I've

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
developing phone applications I've

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
developing phone applications I've
separated<00:01:03.060> the<00:01:03.510> video<00:01:03.750> lessons<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.320> 24<00:01:04.649> days

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
separated the video lessons in 24 days

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.730 
separated the video lessons in 24 days
as<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.390> suggested<00:01:06.390> serving<00:01:06.689> size<00:01:07.079> so<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> speak

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
as a suggested serving size so to speak

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
as a suggested serving size so to speak
and<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> most<00:01:09.060> cases<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.810> lessons<00:01:10.290> build<00:01:10.530> on

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and in most cases the lessons build on

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.160 
and in most cases the lessons build on
topics<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.490> were<00:01:11.640> discussed<00:01:11.670> previously<00:01:12.330> so

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
topics that were discussed previously so

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
topics that were discussed previously so
it'll<00:01:13.650> make<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> most<00:01:14.010> sense<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.370> you<00:01:14.550> if<00:01:14.670> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it'll make the most sense to you if you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
it'll make the most sense to you if you
work<00:01:15.000> through<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.450> order<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.260> feel<00:01:16.740> free

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
work through them in order but feel free

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.040 
work through them in order but feel free
to<00:01:17.490> skip<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.420> topics<00:01:18.840> that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
to skip around to those topics that

to skip around to those topics that
interest<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.530> most<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.580> each<00:01:20.760> day<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.090> going

then finally ease our way into windows
phone<00:03:53.790> seven<00:03:54.180> specific<00:03:54.390> topics<00:03:55.170> once<00:03:55.980> we

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
phone seven specific topics once we

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.670 
phone seven specific topics once we
finish<00:03:56.520> with<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> more<00:03:57.090> formal<00:03:57.680> instruction

in<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.820> first<00:04:00.060> three<00:04:00.390> days<00:04:00.540> then<00:04:00.780> I'm<00:04:00.900> going

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
in the first three days then I'm going

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.840 
in the first three days then I'm going
to<00:04:01.110> demonstrate<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.830> fourth<00:04:02.070> day<00:04:02.160> how<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
to demonstrate on the fourth day how to

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.699 
to demonstrate on the fourth day how to
create<00:04:03.060> a<00:04:03.209> more<00:04:03.360> full-featured<00:04:03.709> application

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
create a more full-featured application

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.460 
create a more full-featured application
that<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:05.700> combine<00:04:06.300> many<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> concepts

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
that will combine many of the concepts

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.110 
that will combine many of the concepts
that<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.709> discussed<00:04:08.160> earlier<00:04:08.550> in<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.820> video

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that I discussed earlier in this video

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.750 
that I discussed earlier in this video
series<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:10.010> application<00:04:11.010> will<00:04:11.130> allow<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> user

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
series the application will allow a user

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.440 
series the application will allow a user
to<00:04:11.940> jot<00:04:12.360> down<00:04:12.390> notes<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.560> phone<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.450> it'll

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
to jot down notes on the phone and it'll

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.270 
to jot down notes on the phone and it'll
save<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.930> retrieve<00:04:16.169> those<00:04:16.470> notes<00:04:16.830> from<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
save and retrieve those notes from the

save and retrieve those notes from the
phones<00:04:17.760> flash<00:04:18.209> drive<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.770> finally<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
phones flash drive and then finally it

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.550 
phones flash drive and then finally it
will<00:04:20.580> use<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.090> phone's<00:04:21.390> GPS<00:04:22.049> functionality

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
will use the phone's GPS functionality

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.010 
will use the phone's GPS functionality
to<00:04:23.100> determine<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.910> latitude<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.510> longitude

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
to determine the latitude and longitude

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.409 
to determine the latitude and longitude
where<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.130> user<00:04:26.310> actually<00:04:26.610> took<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.180> note

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
where the user actually took the note

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.350 
where the user actually took the note
and<00:04:27.660> will<00:04:28.530> use<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> web<00:04:29.070> service<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.820> retrieve

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
and will use a web service to retrieve

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.890 
and will use a web service to retrieve
the<00:04:31.080> city<00:04:31.800> state<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
the city state and

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.310 
the city state and
country<00:04:33.410> where<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:34.009> note<00:04:34.310> was<00:04:34.550> created<00:04:35.320> and

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
country where that note was created and

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.659 
country where that note was created and
then<00:04:36.710> we're<00:04:36.860> going<00:04:36.949> to<00:04:37.009> save<00:04:37.340> that

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
then we're going to save that

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.420 
then we're going to save that
information<00:04:37.910> into<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.810> note<00:04:39.139> as<00:04:39.350> well<00:04:39.430> that's

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
information into the note as well that's

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.730

another<00:05:09.590> year<00:05:10.010> building<00:05:10.639> all<00:05:10.880> these<00:05:11.030> ideas

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
another year building all these ideas

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.750 
another year building all these ideas
that<00:05:11.630> i<00:05:11.660> came<00:05:11.870> up<00:05:12.080> with<00:05:12.370> there's<00:05:13.370> a<00:05:13.430> lot<00:05:13.729> of

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
that i came up with there's a lot of

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.150 
that i came up with there's a lot of
opportunity<00:05:14.539> in<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:15.020> years<00:05:15.260> ahead<00:05:15.410> in<00:05:15.830> this

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160
