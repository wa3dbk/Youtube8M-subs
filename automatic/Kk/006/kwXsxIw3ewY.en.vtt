00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
color become detail so they're just

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819

plain<00:00:41.579> black<00:00:41.879> boots<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829

Turkish coat which is a bit lighter and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
Turkish coat which is a bit lighter and
everything<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.170> goes<00:00:49.260> together<00:00:49.590> because

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
everything just goes together because

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.930 
everything just goes together because
it's<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.760> similar<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.539> color

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
it's very similar in color

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
it's very similar in color
the<00:00:53.940> title<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.480> quite<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> good<00:00:55.260> quality<00:00:55.710> when

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the title is quite a good quality when

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.209 
the title is quite a good quality when
it<00:00:56.670> comes<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.059> pry<00:00:57.300> marks<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:58.289> yeah<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it comes to pry marks so yeah but they

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.900 
it comes to pry marks so yeah but they
are<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.609> thin<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.149> tight<00:01:00.510> because<00:01:01.079> I

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
are really thin and tight because I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.500 
are really thin and tight because I
guess<00:01:02.910> tights<00:01:03.239> are<00:01:03.449> tight<00:01:04.909> how<00:01:05.909> area<00:01:06.330> was

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
guess tights are tight how area was

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.570 
guess tights are tight how area was
quite<00:01:06.750> comfortable<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.830> see<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
quite comfortable as you can see it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.539 
quite comfortable as you can see it
looks<00:01:08.820> quite<00:01:09.000> nice<00:01:09.530> but<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.590> guess<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.220> would

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
looks quite nice but I guess I would

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.090 
looks quite nice but I guess I would
wonder<00:01:11.880> maybe<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> bit<00:01:12.570> thicker<00:01:13.020> because<00:01:13.740> when

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
wonder maybe a bit thicker because when

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.490 
wonder maybe a bit thicker because when
it<00:01:14.220> comes<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.580> winter<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:15.299> still<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it comes to winter I'm still going to be

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.749 
it comes to winter I'm still going to be
really<00:01:16.770> cold<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:19.110> second<00:01:19.560> part<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.860> Pi<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.729> a

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
really cold this second part of Pi has a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
really cold this second part of Pi has a
really<00:01:21.150> bright<00:01:21.390> red<00:01:21.810> color<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.100> really

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
really bright red color and I really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
really bright red color and I really
like<00:01:23.520> them<00:01:23.729> too<00:01:24.060> also<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.630> tight<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.869> your

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
like them too also really tight on your

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
like them too also really tight on your
legs<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.220> are<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.520> stretched

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
legs but they are a bit more stretched

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.230 
legs but they are a bit more stretched
out<00:01:27.390> than<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> last<00:01:28.020> bet

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
out than the last bet

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
out than the last bet
these<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.990> feel<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.100> quicker<00:01:32.340> than

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
these I also feel so much quicker than

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.590 
these I also feel so much quicker than
the<00:01:32.729> last<00:01:32.909> bear<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> don't<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.930> why<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.500> am

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the last bear I don't know why I am

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
the last bear I don't know why I am
signing<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.020> types<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.950> harder

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
signing these types it's a bit harder

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
signing these types it's a bit harder
than<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.640> last<00:01:38.789> birth<00:01:39.119> because<00:01:39.450> these<00:01:39.630> are

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
than the last birth because these are

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.779 
than the last birth because these are
obviously<00:01:39.899> bright<00:01:40.500> red<00:01:40.799> ones<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.220> would

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
obviously bright red ones I would

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.999 
obviously bright red ones I would
probably<00:01:42.179> just<00:01:42.329> sell<00:01:42.600> them<00:01:42.899> with<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> black

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009

trainers on these are high platforms but

like<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> said<00:02:10.069> really<00:02:10.489> easy<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.090> put<00:02:11.270> on<00:02:11.360> and

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
like I said really easy to put on and

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.570 
like I said really easy to put on and
really<00:02:12.080> tight<00:02:12.380> but<00:02:12.920> when<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.160> comes<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.459> this

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
really tight but when it comes to this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.170 
really tight but when it comes to this
whole<00:02:13.790> area<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.450> gets<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.840> bit<00:02:15.080> well<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.610> pie

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
whole area it gets a bit well to pie

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.770 
whole area it gets a bit well to pie
so<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.750> doesn't<00:02:18.020> come<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.470> buy<00:02:18.620> them<00:02:18.830> again<00:02:19.780> but

it okay they're warmer than the last
pair<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.569> think<00:02:23.810> I'll<00:02:23.930> survive<00:02:24.140> this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
that one pink type a very thin in shape

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.649 
that one pink type a very thin in shape
and<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:58.860> were<00:02:58.920> not<00:02:59.159> really<00:02:59.549> easy<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.970> put<00:03:00.239> on

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.780 
and they were not really easy to put on
they<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:01.049> really<00:03:01.440> feel<00:03:01.650> nice<00:03:02.159> Eva<00:03:02.310> they're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
they don't really feel nice Eva they're

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.460

not really comfortable for some reason

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.149 
not really comfortable for some reason

it<00:05:13.590> with<00:05:13.830> dark<00:05:14.400> blue<00:05:14.880> jacket<00:05:15.540> just<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.110> add<00:05:16.260> a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
it with dark blue jacket just to add a

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:39.240 
it with dark blue jacket just to add a
bit<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.560> color<00:05:16.860> in<00:05:17.160> the<00:05:17.310> whole<00:05:17.460> look

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.100 

the<00:05:39.790> toe<00:05:39.970> area<00:05:40.210> feels<00:05:40.690> really<00:05:40.930> comfortable

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
the toe area feels really comfortable

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.340 
the toe area feels really comfortable
but<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.370> back<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:42.760> just<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.120> bit<00:05:43.300> dodgy<00:05:43.480> it<00:05:44.080> just

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.350 
but the back is just a bit dodgy it just

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:46.170 
but the back is just a bit dodgy it just
looks<00:05:44.530> really<00:05:44.620> weird<00:05:45.010> because<00:05:45.700> it's<00:05:45.850> not<00:05:46.000> all

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
looks really weird because it's not all

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.480 
looks really weird because it's not all
straight<00:05:46.540> up<00:05:46.750> but<00:05:47.470> yes<00:05:47.620> this<00:05:47.890> will<00:05:48.130> be<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.370> end

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
straight up but yes this will be the end

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.550 
straight up but yes this will be the end
