 less to Jaén what atrocity not and 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.640
 maybe representing day hear is not a 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.460
 thing boys this this kind of rhythms 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.340

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.620
 they were going to use that they had already spent 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.180
 they were going out and it turns out that it is no longer 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.340
 current that it's never clear that if here 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.320

 likewise so to speak it is cooler 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.350
 more youthful for all the people and then 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.300
 good to change hip hop a little bit like 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.310
 very urban not what happens that is also 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.410

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:03.209
