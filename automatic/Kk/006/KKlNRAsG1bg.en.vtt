00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 and friends and today's video will 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 dedicated to the premise that came to me 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.410
 days I would like to share what 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.219
 It was recently the start of cooperation 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.320
 not stores it is called shop 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.670
 specializes in selling points made 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 from the tree I got two models they were 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.449
 each in such a box even 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 the box shows what she did, too, from 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 pure organic materials 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.539
 recently became very popular this 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.820
 trance people wear glasses from wood 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.410
 wooden accessories clothes from 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 natural fabrics such as but he 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.640
 cotton i am not even indifferent to this 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.040
 trend and still decided to order or 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 these beautiful glasses you ask me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.600
 why wooden glasses are better than others 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.520
 points first all points were made by hand 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 I will attach a link to the site below and you 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.539
 can see what each model 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.300
 it differs from the previous one 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.789
 their style of these points is the work of the master 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 second all points are made of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.690
 environmentally friendly and renewable 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.609
 materials 3 a right and shooting 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.280
 hypoallergenic and causes no 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.590
 allergic reactions fourth rim 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 made of wood much stronger than recovered 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.619
 plastic and other materials 5 they are very 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 light compared to other glasses 6 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.780
 plus which I liked the most 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.790
 these glasses do not sink in water 7 glasses made 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.770
 from the bottom of the tree cool in the cold and not 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.900
 keep warm in the summer so it is very 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.880
 big plus 8 on glasses is worth 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 navigation lenses that protect against 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 ultraviolet rays and I would like 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430
 start or what came to me 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.409
 show by 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.509
 first want to show you a box in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 which she gave me these glasses she 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.700
 very very cool here you can 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.860
 Mark 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.369
 what model do you have glasses what material 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.140
 rims which lenses also with side 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.220
 hand there is a code that can 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.409
 take a picture of mine 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 applications somewhere on the appstore and with 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.710
 opposite side written most 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.720
 the main advantage of these points are they 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 hypoallergenic they are environmentally friendly 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.010
 manually each pair is unique further we 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.350
 open the box and it is in it 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.750
 Here is such a rag this rag 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.460
 very well rub these glasses on them 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.710
 no speck left or 1 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.869
 polovinochki and generally if I somehow 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.230
 inadvertently hand over the left 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.570
 they just wipe and all on myself go to 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 glasses me poor eyesight and that is 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.410
 i had these kind of cloths but they 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.470
 some were very bad further 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:30.570
 The boxes are such a case too 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:33.000
 does not ask further account goes too 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.060
 a pack of glasses but this is exactly 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.570
 cheholchik which all normal people do not 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.390
 wear glasses so that they do not scratch so that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.100
 they do not spoil quickly and that well 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.880
 principle so that they just do not break 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.800
 I also want to point out that this one with 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.840
 Cheholchik also made from all 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.760
 environmental materials and cloud 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.959
 which tightens the case made of leather 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.850
 the case itself is made of wine in general just 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.130
 it shows exactly what all these 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.640
 glasses are perfect for people who 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.790
 don't like all sorts of chemicals 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.790
 inorganic materials 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.830
 then open the bag and get it yourself 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.870
 I liked these glasses more 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.519
 it seems to me that these glasses are very 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.290
 will look great with different 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.510
 sciences that have come up with their 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.239
 everybody knows that now 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.700
 the main trend is glasses glasses of different shapes 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.070
 different models the main thing than they are ordinary 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.780
 than my stylish your glasses so cool 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.420
 there will be your bow theme class not you 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.459
 look so i think that these glasses 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.680
 they are quite unusual such a form 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.260
 which directly attracts me and I 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.370
 Immediately ordered them also did not like 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.590
 that side engraved called and 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.629
 we are water mind is this model 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.420
 called block you can find and on 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.299
 site link will be lower here and so they 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.950
 they look at me and they all 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.750
 gave way and advise you and show because 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.390
 what seems to them just really 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.420
 very cool and second points they too 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.890
 were here in the same bags 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.099
 the box I generally showed it here 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:20.440
 such glasses are something they remind me 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:22.539
 collection of ray ban it's me they too 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.660
 really like it seems they are much 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.479
 cooler valid than ray ban and level 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.510
 I'm somehow rather tired of everything 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.760
 come out and somehow I don't know it in general not 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.949
 I really like it when cool real 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.870
 with my stream so i am more 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.000
 I prefer these glasses because 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.830
 the war did not come out today these glasses i 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.720
 ordered herself undoubtedly to 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.880
 Did I like these glasses? 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.729
 the fact that they have an unusual lens is not blue 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.530
 colors I already had similar glasses but 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.200
 or how they practically donâ€™t wear either 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.180
 I hang a habit though 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.940
 shorter glasses are also very cool 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.599
 I want to attach the link to exactly 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.820
 this model 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.070
 I'm really not very undermined 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.090
 I liked these glasses and I will definitely 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.760
 will wear 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.110
 so I am very pleased here again you 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.660

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.849
 Here I have a lot of bows idiot 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.250
