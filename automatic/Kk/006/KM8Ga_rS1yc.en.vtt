00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.550
 they give very good night they remember the 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.490
 tropical depression number 2 that you 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.710
 I mentioned this past Monday that he had 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.050
 developed well away from us more 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.299
 of three thousand miles to our east 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.550
 south west good continues to weaken 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.170
 now it's a simple tropical wave that 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.880
 nothing else will bring some rainfall 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.020
 towards the arch of the Lesser Antilles 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.359
 so that's good news 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.640
 remember this is the season that 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.980
 we must be well aware of something that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.930
 what happens in the 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.340
 tropics in our region we have to 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.830
 Being is very aware of this heat 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.050
 today the maximum temperature reached 95 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.780
 degrees but it felt like it was 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.489
 up to 108 degrees we continue with 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.949
 quite high temperatures to this 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.199
 night time 29 degrees Celsius or 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.299
 what is being 84 degrees fahrenheit 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.610
 at the intercontinental airport on 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.809
 wind is practically calm at 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.690
 throughout the region so the 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.239
 extremely humid hot conditions 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.369
 and also stagnant we had some 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.350
 precipitation during the course of 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.059
 afternoon from noon strong 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.369
 downpours towards the region of I went by 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.050
 here they accumulated a little more than three 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.540
 inches of rain even 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.640
 some strong gusts that derived 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.920
 some trees in the bay city region 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.390
 and we will continue with pretty conditions 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.520
 cloudy tonight notice how the 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.590
 cloudiness comes here for our skies 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.620
 and until now some showers entering 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.320
 to the northeast of the county harris all 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.760
 this is thanks to a disturbance a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.530
 front band but first one comes 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.390
 disturbance that promises to leave some 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.430
 downpours during the course of the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 early morning especially towards the area 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.720
 metropolitan so if you go out 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.220
 around 3 am you are 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.400
 sleeping a bit late but apart from 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.080
 that find is this umbrella is going to 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.030
 need tomorrow let's wake up with 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.040
 about 78 degrees went up a bit the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 minimum temperature due to cloud cover 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
 cloudiness is not going to allow all the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.770
 heat that we have accumulated during the day 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.780
 get away so we're left with one 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.790
 warm night for tomorrow a day 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 pretty hot again a 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.250
 maximum temperature and 97 degrees the index 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.260
 of heat will reach about 105 degrees 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.320
 Notice how the temperature of your car 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.040
 increases in just one hour after 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.290
 30 minutes we can reach more than 34 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.959
 degrees 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.030
 increasing and after an hour its 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.400
 car the interior of your car can 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.230
 increase about 40 degrees so much 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.109
 caution with pets elche that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.109
 extended forecast we will continue with 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.120
 a lot of heat and temperatures that we are going to 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.370
 be treading on the heels of the three 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.959
 digits but definitely the index 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.579
 of heat will continue to feel 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:46.069
 between 10 to 11 degrees beyond what 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.069
 that really marks the happy thermometer
