 3 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.820
 that left the today in ermelo to attend the result of the election 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.560
 swimming pool of the year 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 The result was announced in Calella, the greenest swimming pool in the Netherlands 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.169
 the tension was clearly felt by the delegates of the nominees 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.699
 swimming pools 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.689
 the professional jury had the difficult task of making a well-considered final judgment 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.820
 was therefore firmly debated 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 the number of votes was viewed but also the findings of the most league and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 items included in the final decision 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.840
 but after long deliberation 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.150
 jury did not agree 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.510
 as usual with election results 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.740
 many different people came 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.730
 really just know the result 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 first announce the winner of the silver starting blocks 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.560
 this price is for the pool with the most playful action the votes too 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.710

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 swimming pool de bongerd has won the silver starting blocks 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.230
 and then we will now announce which swimming pool is located 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.360
 swimming pool of the year 2010 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 that started carelessly in the game 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.940
 I myself also occasionally want to read uprooted these rules 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.510

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.250

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.160
 the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 if that would work 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.130
 pool in the pines has the golden starting block and the swimming pool title 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 brought in 2010 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.380

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.740
