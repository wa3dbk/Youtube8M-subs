00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.650 
first sounds awesome but at some point
you<00:01:46.130> kind<00:01:46.399> of<00:01:46.429> want<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:46.670> leave<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.179> party<00:01:47.569> and

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
you kind of want to leave that party and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
or take a breather or I don't know but

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.279 
or take a breather or I don't know but
there's<00:01:52.880> only<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:53.119> long<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.450> can<00:01:53.600> do<00:01:53.869> it<00:01:54.050> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
there's only so long you can do it and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.380 
there's only so long you can do it and
that's<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.979> problem<00:01:55.190> with<00:01:55.429> this<00:01:55.610> film<00:01:55.670> after

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
that's the problem with this film after

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.080 
that's the problem with this film after
a<00:01:56.420> while<00:01:56.720> it<00:01:57.020> gets<00:01:57.380> tiring<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.610> animation

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
a while it gets tiring the animation

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.790 
a while it gets tiring the animation
continues<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.630> impress<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.259> well<00:02:00.530> as<00:02:00.649> some

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
continues to impress as well as some

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.279 
continues to impress as well as some
really<00:02:01.130> good<00:02:01.520> live-action<00:02:02.270> mixing<00:02:02.630> but

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
really good live-action mixing but

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.749 
really good live-action mixing but
you're<00:02:03.440> just<00:02:03.740> sort<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.009> watching<00:02:04.280> people

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
you're just sort of watching people

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.730 
you're just sort of watching people
dance<00:02:05.119> most<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.720> time<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.259> for<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.500> few

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
dance most of the time and for a few

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.830 
dance most of the time and for a few
minutes<00:02:07.039> it's<00:02:07.190> fine<00:02:07.429> but<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:08.179> a<00:02:08.209> whole<00:02:08.390> second

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
minutes it's fine but for a whole second

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.419 
minutes it's fine but for a whole second
half<00:02:09.020> of<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.289> movie<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.979> gets<00:02:10.130> pretty<00:02:10.250> old

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
half of a movie it gets pretty old

pretty fast then we just cut to the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.410 
pretty fast then we just cut to the
three<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:12.980> acting<00:02:13.250> goofy<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.760> abstract

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
make it silly the only thing that's

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.680 
make it silly the only thing that's
consistently<00:03:01.580> good<00:03:01.820> as<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:01.970> said<00:03:02.240> before<00:03:02.360> is

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
consistently good as I said before is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.690 
consistently good as I said before is
the<00:03:02.900> animation<00:03:03.290> which<00:03:03.860> is<00:03:03.980> really<00:03:04.220> stylized

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
the animation which is really stylized

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.730 
the animation which is really stylized
and<00:03:04.940> fun<00:03:05.150> but<00:03:05.600> for<00:03:05.810> me<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:05.930> don't<00:03:06.230> think<00:03:06.470> that

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
and fun but for me I don't think that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.530 
and fun but for me I don't think that
holds<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.130> film<00:03:07.370> if<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.060> want<00:03:08.240> to<00:03:08.330> see<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
holds the film if you want to see it

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.760 
holds the film if you want to see it
just<00:03:08.570> for<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.050> motion<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.590> cool

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
just for the motion and the cool

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.980 
just for the motion and the cool
drawings<00:03:10.250> I'd<00:03:10.430> say<00:03:10.760> maybe<00:03:11.000> check<00:03:11.300> it<00:03:11.450> out<00:03:11.600> but

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
drawings I'd say maybe check it out but

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.510 
drawings I'd say maybe check it out but
even<00:03:12.230> then<00:03:12.350> that's<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.620> big<00:03:12.800> baby<00:03:13.040> there's

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
even then that's a big baby there's

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.130 
even then that's a big baby there's
other<00:03:13.700> Disney<00:03:14.090> films<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.450> do<00:03:14.570> animation

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
other Disney films that do animation

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.960 
other Disney films that do animation
better<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.950> they<00:03:16.190> have<00:03:16.310> good<00:03:16.520> story<00:03:16.820> and

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
better and they have good story and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.460 
better and they have good story and
characters<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.360> go<00:03:17.540> along<00:03:17.810> with<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.440> I

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
characters to go along with it so I

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.620 
characters to go along with it so I
probably<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.070> recommend<00:03:19.520> those<00:03:19.670> but<00:03:20.360> if

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
probably just recommend those but if

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.210 
probably just recommend those but if
you're<00:03:20.810> curious<00:03:21.110> enough<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.650> does<00:03:21.860> have<00:03:22.040> some

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
you're curious enough it does have some

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.800 
you're curious enough it does have some
good<00:03:22.340> moments<00:03:22.730> take<00:03:23.240> that<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:23.570> what<00:03:23.600> it's

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
good moments take that for what it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.960 
good moments take that for what it's
worth
