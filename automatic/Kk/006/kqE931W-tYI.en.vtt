 the teachers we agreed and in 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.770
 another two points because we need to raise 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.050
 some consultations to the education ministry and 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.800

 programmed was developed from 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.360
 satisfactory manner for the benefit of 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.399
 Teachers resumed five points that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 we discussed at the last meeting the 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.899
 first was the recognition of some 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.310
 specialization titles that do not 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.200
 they were considering for the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.710
 salary improvement to which the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.110
 secretary of education gives in favor this 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.750
 situation that we exposed the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.210
 second are all the teachers who 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.800
 they got the titles after they got 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.040
 enrolled in the evaluation of 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.280
 competences and that exceeded 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.720
 the equation secretariat had been claiming 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 this in second instance has been won 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.460
 but today the education secretary says 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 that open up the titles can be 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.700
 deliver until the last day review of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.520
 requirements established by law then 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.729
 is another situation that is in favor of 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 third was a situation that has to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.310
 see with delivering all the papers every 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.869
 teacher who had passed the evaluation 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.810
 of skills secretary of occasion 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.040
 they say they gave forward if it continues 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.970
 this process of evaluation of 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.870
 skills will simply pull out 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 the list of the single 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.820
 only leading to deliver papers to 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.740
 who carry the documents that do not 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.530
 they are in secretary of education because 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.820
 the both performance evaluations 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.310
 as the time of services should 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.590
 rest in the teachers' folders 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 only in cases of eventual and in the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.680
 case of the titles that if you have to 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.540

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.450
 issues related to recognition 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.299

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.700
 they were left unresolved these will get 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.560

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.530
