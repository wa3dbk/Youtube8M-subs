too rattled and just attacked him in the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.279 
too rattled and just attacked him in the
second<00:00:14.580> half<00:00:14.730> pia<00:00:15.179> came<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> half<00:00:15.780> time<00:00:16.020> and

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
second half pia came in a half time and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.200 
second half pia came in a half time and
you<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.190> wasn't<00:00:17.670> happy<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.029> our

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
you know wasn't happy with our

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.790 
you know wasn't happy with our
performance<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.050> knew<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.380> had<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.560> pick

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
performance and we knew we had to pick

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.179 
performance and we knew we had to pick
it<00:00:19.830> up<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> i<00:00:20.520> think<00:00:21.060> when<00:00:21.210> i<00:00:21.680> when<00:00:22.680> i<00:00:22.710> got<00:00:22.980> in

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
it up and i think when i when i got in

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
it up and i think when i when i got in
we<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:24.080> conceded<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.140> goal<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.590> obviously

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
we had just conceded a goal so obviously

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
we had just conceded a goal so obviously
we<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.849> needed<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> pick<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> energy<00:00:27.720> raise

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
we we needed to pick up the energy raise

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.599 
we we needed to pick up the energy raise
a<00:00:28.230> level<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.680> little<00:00:28.769> bit<00:00:28.980> we've<00:00:29.310> been<00:00:29.429> coming

a level a little bit we've been coming
out<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> little<00:00:30.119> slow<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> second<00:00:30.869> half<00:00:31.080> but

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.560 
out a little slow in the second half but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
give us that cushion it was amazing with

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.760 
give us that cushion it was amazing with
big<00:00:42.149> holes<00:00:42.360> like<00:00:42.629> these<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> black<00:00:43.530> out

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
big holes like these I kind of black out

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.750 
big holes like these I kind of black out
but<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.910> remember<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.640> giving<00:00:47.640> me<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
but I remember you know giving me a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.520 
but I remember you know giving me a
great<00:00:47.940> fall<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> line<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> think<00:00:49.440> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
great fall down the line and I think I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.850 
great fall down the line and I think I
took<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.640> too<00:00:50.820> many<00:00:50.910> touches<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.020> paid<00:00:52.739> out

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
took one too many touches but paid out

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
took one too many touches but paid out
in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.100> end<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.520> saw<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> keeper<00:00:54.120> kind

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
in the end because I saw the keeper kind

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.360 
in the end because I saw the keeper kind
of<00:00:54.420> lone<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> thought<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.410> tripped

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
of lone I thought that if I just tripped

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
of lone I thought that if I just tripped
it<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.850> bit<00:00:56.969> I'd<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.390> over<00:00:57.600> her

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it a little bit I'd get it over her

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860 
it a little bit I'd get it over her
which<00:00:58.469> happened<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.420> finally<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> just<00:01:00.539> scored

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
which happened and finally I just scored

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.529 
which happened and finally I just scored
my<00:01:00.989> first<00:01:01.020> goal<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:02.250> way<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> France<00:01:03.180> plays

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
my first goal the way that France plays

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
my first goal the way that France plays
I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.739> more<00:01:04.949> suited<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.280> my<00:01:05.489> defensive

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I think was more suited to my defensive

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
I think was more suited to my defensive
style<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.930> worked<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.229> really

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
style so I think that worked out really

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.580 
style so I think that worked out really
well<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:08.450> they<00:01:09.450> play<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> lot<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> front<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
well there they play a lot in front and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.100 
well there they play a lot in front and
it's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.490> movement<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> finding

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it's a lot about movement and finding

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.800 
it's a lot about movement and finding
passes<00:01:13.409> behind<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.100> stuff<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.909> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
passes behind and stuff like that so it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.240 
passes behind and stuff like that so it
was<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.259> suited<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.740> because<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
was more suited to me because I like to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.450 
was more suited to me because I like to
think<00:01:17.460> things<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:19.409> think<00:01:20.220> after<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
think things through and I think after I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.830 
think things through and I think after I
got<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> first<00:01:20.939> touch<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> maybe<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> first

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
got that first touch and maybe the first

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.240 
got that first touch and maybe the first
tackle<00:01:22.290> everything<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.920> settled<00:01:23.159> down

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
tackle everything kind of settled down

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
tackle everything kind of settled down
but<00:01:23.670> second<00:01:24.570> half<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.930> was<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> huge

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
but second half there was a huge

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
but second half there was a huge
momentum<00:01:25.619> shift<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:26.400> were<00:01:26.460> coming<00:01:27.270> at

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
momentum shift and they were coming at

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.410 
momentum shift and they were coming at
us<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> took<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.200> maybe<00:01:29.180> 15-20<00:01:30.180> minutes

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
us and it took about maybe 15-20 minutes

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
us and it took about maybe 15-20 minutes
before<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.840> finally<00:01:31.530> finally<00:01:31.860> started

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
before we finally finally started

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
before we finally finally started
getting<00:01:32.520> possession<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.780> starting<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> play

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
getting possession and starting to play

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
getting possession and starting to play
our<00:01:34.320> ball<00:01:34.470> again<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.369> after<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.729> goal

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
our ball again I think after that goal

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.219 
our ball again I think after that goal
went<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.270> realized<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.990> needed<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
went in we realized that we needed to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
identifying what the problem is and so

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.499 
identifying what the problem is and so
we<00:01:50.040> were<00:01:50.130> talking<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.579> okay<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.329> need<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we were talking about okay we need to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.480 
we were talking about okay we need to
regain<00:01:51.810> control<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.860> did<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> by

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
regain control and we did that by

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
regain control and we did that by
keeping<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> ball<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.600> giving<00:01:54.869> our

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
keeping the ball in the back giving our

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.469 
keeping the ball in the back giving our
attacking<00:01:55.649> players<00:01:55.890> better<00:01:56.880> ball<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.360> they

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
attacking players better ball so they

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
attacking players better ball so they
had<00:01:57.630> more<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.409> chance<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.950> create<00:01:59.520> something

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
had more of a chance to create something

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.450 
had more of a chance to create something
from<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.149> Japan<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.110> done<00:02:01.380> an<00:02:02.340> incredible

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

from that Japan has done an incredible
job<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.329> think<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.600> our<00:02:04.229> journey<00:02:04.560> has
