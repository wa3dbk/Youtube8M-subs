00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:05.059
 In today's video we are going to learn how to make the robot worm. 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.640
 We will learn how to assemble your mechanical band and the electric circuit. 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.039
 Let's see how it's done. 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.739
 The electric circuit of the robot worm is very simple. 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.919
 It consists of a battery of nine volts, a switch and a reducing engine, 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.600
 In this case I'm using 1kg of force 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.760
 and a speed of 100 revolutions per minute. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740
 For mechanical construction we will use two balso sticks 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
 more or less 20cm long. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 They were the same as we used for the spider robot. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 Remember that they should use a very light material. 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.619
 Otherwise we will not be able to move the robot worm. 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.679
 And another balsoid pole slightly wider. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.859
 We pierce the three masts of balso on one side 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.899
 to be able to cross an axis. 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 In this case I'm crossing it with a screw, but they can use a wire or any other material. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.859
 We look at it with a female. 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.780
 It does not have to be very tight because it allows movement. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 This will allow 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.299
 That the worm opens and closes. 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.159
 Then we cut a shorter piece, more or less than 7 cm 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.420
 to give firmness to both corners. 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.560
 We fix it 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.319
 Then at the ends we drilled two holes to install the rear wheels. 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.759
 We placed an axis that holds them and we cross them. 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 Let's place the other tire and fix it with a nut, 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 without stretching so much because of mobility. The two rear wheels were left. 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.740
 For the front wheels I did not have the same size as the rear wheels, so I used these larger ones 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.699
 and we will fix them with screws. 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.359
 The spindle should not be so tight, because the wheel spins freely. 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.260
 After placing the tires, we must install the brake. 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.859
 We will use a plastic strap of approximately 5 cm. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 We leave it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:25.299
 It should be installed in this way so that the tire can only move forward, and if you want to return it is braking. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.020
 Only allow this movement. Forward walk and back is braked. 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.659
 To fix two small screws are placed. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.219
 Thus the brake is installed. Only forwards and backwards it stops. 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.539
 We have just installed the four brakes, both in front and rear wheels. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.139
 This is the secret because the robot worm does not just open and close your legs 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 but move forward. 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.040
 This lever is approximately 9cm or 3.5 inches. 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.000
 We make the support point untethered without having to be fixed. 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 So that it can generate this movement. 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.819
 At the other end we place a screw to be able to fix it on the other leg of the robot. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.860
 The reducing motor we will use in this case is 1kg of force 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.080
 and a speed of 100 revolutions per minute. 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.000
 It is not a normal motor. If you buy a normal engine, 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.520
 You will not have enough force to move the robot worm. 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.120
 Let's say that this part is a normal DC motor, 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.840
 but at the top there is a rocket making the reduction 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 to decrease the speed and increase the force. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.320
 It is designed to work between 3- 12 volts. There are some six volts that will work very well, 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 With the battery of nine volts, for short periods. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.600
 We have to fix the engine well on the front legs. 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.640
 And tighten very well. 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 Then install the wheel or pulley. 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.680
 Remember that it is connected offshore. The double of this distance is going to give the displacement of the wheels. 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.759
 Let's look at the other end. 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.600
 This must allow movement like this one, 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.760
 so that the two sides of the motor are opening and closing. 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.299
 This is the displacement that the wheels generate. 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 They are opening and closing. 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.460
 After the engine is installed, 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.599
 On the other side we can install the battery of nine volts to balance the weight. 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.639
 It can be attached to a piece of tape. 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.799
 You are ready to make the battery connection 

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.939
 to the engine. 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.500
