the<00:01:55.970> idea<00:01:56.090> of<00:01:56.390> this<00:01:56.720> monster<00:01:57.560> performance<00:01:57.770> I

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the idea of this monster performance I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.160 
the idea of this monster performance I
mean<00:01:58.690> super<00:02:00.580> futuristic<00:02:01.750> technology<00:02:02.750> how

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
mean super futuristic technology how

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.470 
mean super futuristic technology how
does<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.500> meet<00:02:03.830> with<00:02:04.450> refinement<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
does that meet with refinement that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.570 
does that meet with refinement that
lexus<00:02:06.140> is<00:02:06.290> known<00:02:06.530> for<00:02:06.830> well<00:02:07.100> i<00:02:07.130> think<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
lexus is known for well i think in the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.889 
lexus is known for well i think in the
LFA<00:02:07.880> specifically<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.540> look<00:02:08.720> at<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
LFA specifically just look at the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.810 
LFA specifically just look at the
interior<00:02:09.110> right<00:02:09.680> i<00:02:09.710> mean<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.100> interior<00:02:10.460> shows

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
interior right i mean the interior shows

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.730 
interior right i mean the interior shows
it<00:02:11.180> reflects<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.780> i<00:02:11.810> think<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.200> other<00:02:12.350> place

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
it reflects it i think the other place

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.800 
it reflects it i think the other place
that<00:02:12.770> it's<00:02:13.040> reflected<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.640> LFA<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.660> amount

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
that it's reflected in LFA is the amount

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.810 
that it's reflected in LFA is the amount
of<00:02:14.900> attention<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.380> went<00:02:15.590> into<00:02:15.680> every<00:02:16.220> single

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
of attention that went into every single

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.640 
of attention that went into every single
detail<00:02:17.330> i<00:02:17.540> spent<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> lot<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.080> time<00:02:18.170> with<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
detail i spent a lot of time with the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
detail i spent a lot of time with the
with<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:18.980> engineering<00:02:19.460> staff<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.150> car

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
with the engineering staff on that car

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.300 
with the engineering staff on that car
and<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:21.080> ask<00:02:21.260> them<00:02:21.470> about<00:02:21.560> anything<00:02:21.980> big

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
and you can ask them about anything big

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
and you can ask them about anything big
or<00:02:22.430> small<00:02:22.550> on<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.820> product<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.630> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
or small on the product and you get a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.470 
or small on the product and you get a
story<00:02:24.220> much<00:02:25.220> longer<00:02:25.850> maybe<00:02:25.970> than<00:02:26.210> what<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
story much longer maybe than what you

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.820 
story much longer maybe than what you
want<00:02:26.690> to<00:02:26.810> hear<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:26.990> what<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.290> convinced<00:02:27.710> when

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
want to hear but what you convinced when

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.380 
want to hear but what you convinced when
you<00:02:27.920> walk<00:02:28.100> away<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.640> they've<00:02:29.120> thought<00:02:29.360> about

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you walk away is they've thought about

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.420 
you walk away is they've thought about
it<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.870> i<00:02:29.930> think<00:02:29.960> that's<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.680> hallmark<00:02:31.160> of

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
it and i think that's a hallmark of

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.460 
it and i think that's a hallmark of
lexus<00:02:31.910> nothing<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.390> random<00:02:32.600> everything<00:02:33.350> is

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
lexus nothing is random everything is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.110 
lexus nothing is random everything is
very<00:02:34.390> intentional<00:02:35.390> super<00:02:36.050> refined<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
very intentional super refined and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.090 
very intentional super refined and
actually<00:02:38.120> very<00:02:38.540> lightweight<00:02:38.900> for<00:02:39.650> its<00:02:39.830> size

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
actually very lightweight for its size

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually very lightweight for its size
from<00:02:40.880> your<00:02:41.060> way<00:02:41.270> well<00:02:41.870> under<00:02:42.470> yeah<00:02:43.040> i<00:02:43.070> mean

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
from your way well under yeah i mean

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.090 
from your way well under yeah i mean
3300<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.720> change<00:02:44.930> yeah<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.620> carbon<00:02:45.890> fiber

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
3300 and change yeah the carbon fiber

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.730 
3300 and change yeah the carbon fiber
you<00:02:46.460> know<00:02:46.520> its<00:02:46.670> carbon<00:02:46.850> fiber<00:02:47.650> you<00:02:48.650> know

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
you know its carbon fiber you know

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.680 
you know its carbon fiber you know
everything<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.340> yeah<00:02:50.180> we're<00:02:50.360> doing<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.630> in

people that the be the kind of the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.130 
people that the be the kind of the
origins<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.000> company<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.540> way<00:02:56.690> back<00:02:56.900> one

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
origins of the company in a way back one

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.590 
origins of the company in a way back one
was<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> loom<00:02:57.650> blooming<00:02:58.190> company<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.090> that

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
was a loom blooming company and that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.479 
was a loom blooming company and that
looming<00:03:00.110> expertise<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.890> will<00:03:01.010> enable<00:03:01.250> us<00:03:01.430> to

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
looming expertise is will enable us to

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.790 
looming expertise is will enable us to
make<00:03:01.730> carbon<00:03:01.940> fiber<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.480> house<00:03:02.660> now<00:03:03.650> its

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
make carbon fiber in a house now its

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.680 
make carbon fiber in a house now its
radar<00:03:04.010> controller<00:03:04.489> interesting<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:05.420> thought

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
radar controller interesting and thought

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.270 
radar controller interesting and thought
about<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:06.260> pretty<00:03:06.470> cool<00:03:06.680> yeah<00:03:07.010> yeah

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
about that that's pretty cool yeah yeah

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.250 
about that that's pretty cool yeah yeah
laser<00:03:07.550> controlled<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.360> very<00:03:08.540> precise<00:03:08.959> we

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
laser controlled it's very precise we

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.720 
laser controlled it's very precise we
can<00:03:09.380> do<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.530> in-house<00:03:09.770> so<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.520> know<00:03:10.610> i<00:03:10.640> think

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
can do it in-house so you know i think

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.400 
can do it in-house so you know i think
that<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.150> has<00:03:11.480> great<00:03:11.810> future<00:03:12.170> implications

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
that it has great future implications

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.430 
that it has great future implications
for<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:14.000> other<00:03:14.120> products<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.930> what<00:03:15.320> we're

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
for for other products so what we're

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.800 
for for other products so what we're
looking<00:03:15.680> at<00:03:15.770> is<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> halo<00:03:16.220> car<00:03:16.610> this<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.570> kind

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
looking at is a halo car this is a kind

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.620 
looking at is a halo car this is a kind
o<00:03:17.930> only<00:03:18.200> be<00:03:18.410> 500<00:03:19.160> room<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.670> what<00:03:20.000> does<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.600> to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
o only be 500 room so what does it do to

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.300 
o only be 500 room so what does it do to
your<00:03:20.930> lineup<00:03:21.500> would<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:21.770> talk<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.980> little<00:03:22.130> bit

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
your lineup would you talk a little bit

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.130 
your lineup would you talk a little bit
about<00:03:22.520> so<00:03:22.760> let's<00:03:23.330> let's<00:03:23.510> all<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.810> f<00:03:23.959> as<00:03:24.110> a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
about so let's let's all that f as a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.380 
about so let's let's all that f as a
family<00:03:24.560> right<00:03:24.770> so<00:03:25.040> we've<00:03:25.190> got<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.430> LFA<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.970> kind

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
family right so we've got to LFA it kind

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.910 
family right so we've got to LFA it kind
of<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.600> top<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.020> heap<00:03:27.200> we've<00:03:27.650> got<00:03:27.770> the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
of at the top of the heap we've got the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.920 
of at the top of the heap we've got the

is f that we launched it to lil over two

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.199 
is f that we launched it to lil over two
years<00:03:30.080> ago<00:03:30.290> right<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:31.010> another<00:03:31.520> pure

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
years ago right that is another pure

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.390 
years ago right that is another pure
