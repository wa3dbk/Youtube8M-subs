00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.270
 installation of this mini converter 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.970
 hdmi to rca because he gave me I gave myself to the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.790
 task of making this video well there are 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.010
 very few videos where they show us what 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.980
 does this apparatus what is its installation 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 how it works and how what is so 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 I'm dating the task of doing it for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 inform more than anything so good 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.620
 gentlemen as its name tells us this 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.780
 device will convert us the hdmi signal 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.360
 of some device that we have is a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.940
 xbox band a play station a bluray something 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.520
 that we want to convert from hdmi 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.200
 that air or component signal by 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.360
 components and hardening is the same as 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 are the cables by colors the white the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 red and yellow so good gentlemen 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 this is what this device does in my 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.350
 case I want to connect an xbox 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 one to a television that does not have 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.420
 hdmi inputs what this device does 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 is reconditioning this tv so you can 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
 connect 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.369
 in the hdmi cable of xbox one and take them out 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.220
 already rsa to connect them to my TV 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.990
 that does not have hdmi entries so 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
 I think it's pretty clear that so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.780
 good as you can see the apparatus account 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.380
 with its hdmi input and 3 rsa leave in addition 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.600
 to contain this USB input that is going 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 is going to be used to connect the cable 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.659
 mini usb that comes together with our 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.380
 device to be able to give him food and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.000
 in this way make this device 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.429
 work so good here in the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.239
 package that I bought so good was coming 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.350
 in its respective manual with 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.840
 descriptions about resolution and those 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.430
 things that more than anything the resolution goes 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.480
 to depend on your television in addition to 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.890
 contain the mini usb cable that good 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.290
 This is the one that is going to give you 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 power to our device so 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.260
 good gentlemen this is what it contains 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.209
 As you can see the device is very 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.290
 small so let's move on to our xbox 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.420
 one 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.980
 in your case it can be tell them you can 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.769
 It may be that you want this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 device to connect a blu-ray or some 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.930
 device in my case I'm doing it with 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.239
 a nexus one as you can check here 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.239
 I have connected the HDMI cable of our 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.480
 I have it connected to our console 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.970
 console the hdmi and the other end of the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.750
 hdmi I'll connect it to the mini 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.700
 converter 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.610
 and obviously in the only hdmi entry 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.710
 that has and I will connect later these 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.110
 mini cables 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.970
 converter us the other end of 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.470
 this rca cable is already connected to 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.900
 TV as you can see in the picture 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.760
 I already have them connected to the TV 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.490
 it's like they have to do an extreme 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 to the television and the other end goes to his 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.240
 mini converter as you can see now 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.410
 same I have connected the three are re 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.500
 be the hdmi cable and the mini usb goes to the 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.470
 console in this way I connect the cable 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.560
 mini usb to my xbox one in the usb input 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.800
 and in this way it gives you current so that 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.390
 our mini converter device can 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.980
 function 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.870
 you can also connect it 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.180
 for example if they are connecting it in a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.570
 donkey and this device and his bluray brings 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.530
 usb tickets that they normally bring 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.230
 Well can you connect this mini usb to your 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.330
 the device bluray whatever and this 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.880
 mode is the feed if you do not want it 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.550
 do so can for example connect to 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.000
 this USB usb mini cable to a 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.670
 charger like cell phones 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.560
 normally they use and in this way what 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.230
 they connect it to the power and its 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.480
 mini hdmi converter and rca already have 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.660
 sign now something more than adding gentlemen 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.150
 there is a cable out there that is from hdmi to 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.769
 rca but it is only the cable if 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.940
 what you want is to convert 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.440
 hdmi to rsa said cable does not serve them what 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.620
 what you need is this 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.370
 converter mini hdmi converter to 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.340
 rsa this is the one they need to 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.200
 convert the signal hd mini to rsa without more 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.419
 nothing to say, gentlemen, I hope there will be 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.340
 I hope I have helped someone and 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.340
 see you until next time
