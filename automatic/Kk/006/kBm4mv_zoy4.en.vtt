some<00:00:48.960> exquisite<00:00:49.590> chord<00:00:50.280> shapes<00:00:50.579> out<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
some exquisite chord shapes out of this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.689 
some exquisite chord shapes out of this
tuning<00:00:51.659> so<00:00:51.930> you'll<00:00:52.680> noticed<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.309> preview

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
tuning so you'll noticed on the preview

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
tuning so you'll noticed on the preview
that<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.000> only<00:00:54.149> runs<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> playthrough

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that it only runs the on a playthrough

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
that it only runs the on a playthrough
that<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.129> runs<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.519> a<00:00:56.550> couple<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.970> verses

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that it runs for a couple of verses

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.210 
that it runs for a couple of verses
that's<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:58.050> every<00:00:58.379> verse<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> exactly

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
that's because every verse is exactly

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's because every verse is exactly
the<00:00:59.399> same<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.850> once<00:01:00.000> you've<00:01:00.149> learned<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.479> play

the same so once you've learned to play

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
the same so once you've learned to play
one<00:01:00.899> verse<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.680> song<00:01:01.739> you've<00:01:02.220> learned

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
that's a tricky chord shape to make

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.659 
that's a tricky chord shape to make
first<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.650> all<00:04:48.740> let<00:04:48.860> me<00:04:48.889> give<00:04:48.949> you<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> tip<00:04:49.460> for

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
first of all let me give you a tip for

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.120 
first of all let me give you a tip for
making<00:04:49.790> it<00:04:50.090> it's<00:04:50.240> almost<00:04:50.449> an<00:04:51.050> E<00:04:51.229> chord<00:04:51.260> shape

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
making it it's almost an E chord shape

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.850 
making it it's almost an E chord shape
in<00:04:52.520> standard<00:04:53.000> tuning<00:04:53.150> except<00:04:53.900> this<00:04:54.229> finger<00:04:54.650> is

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
in standard tuning except this finger is

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.890 
in standard tuning except this finger is
on<00:04:54.979> the<00:04:55.040> sixth<00:04:55.430> string<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:56.180> if<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.360> feel<00:04:56.690> like

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
on the sixth string so if you feel like

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.960 
on the sixth string so if you feel like
you're<00:04:57.080> moving<00:04:57.320> into<00:04:57.440> E<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:58.550> get<00:04:58.729> pretty

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
you're moving into E you get pretty

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.020 
you're moving into E you get pretty
close<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.540> it<00:05:00.010> if<00:05:01.010> you<00:05:01.280> really<00:05:01.520> still<00:05:01.880> don't

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
close to it if you really still don't

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
close to it if you really still don't
like<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.419> then<00:05:02.540> just<00:05:02.690> play<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.990> original

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
like it then just play the original

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.680 
like it then just play the original
chord<00:05:03.650> shape<00:05:03.889> and<00:05:04.100> avoid<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:05.120> notes<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:05.600> the

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
chord shape and avoid the notes on the

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.420 
chord shape and avoid the notes on the
sixth<00:05:05.990> string<00:05:06.169> it'll<00:05:06.620> sound<00:05:06.830> fine<00:05:07.160> if<00:05:07.310> you

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
sixth string it'll sound fine if you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.200 
sixth string it'll sound fine if you
just<00:05:08.440> do<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.620> again<00:05:09.919> but<00:05:10.520> she<00:05:10.729> adds<00:05:10.970> this

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
just do that again but she adds this

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.060 
just do that again but she adds this
space<00:05:11.450> though<00:05:11.690> so<00:05:11.930> out<00:05:12.169> of<00:05:12.229> this<00:05:12.530> shape<00:05:12.830> now<00:05:13.010> we

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
space though so out of this shape now we

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.239 
space though so out of this shape now we
get<00:05:13.310> six<00:05:13.729> four<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.060> three<00:05:15.070> second<00:05:16.070> string

00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:17.249 
get six four and three second string
