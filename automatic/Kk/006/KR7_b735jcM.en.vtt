00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.800
 some corrupt politicians good for 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.510
 nothing that to vote 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.700

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.070
 they matter how that unleashed a 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.440
 citizen participation emergency 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.540
 how are they complaining about their 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.580
 rulers and their city but 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.920
 prefer to go for a walk until it's 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.030
 exercise their right to vote this is a 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 mission for the superior professor 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.710
 and the girls 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.490
 promptly to the are so hard to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.649
 fight for citizen power 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 I do not know why he explains his time maybe 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.670
 so do not listen we are young 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.920
 so that they interest those in politics and 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 see that every politician only serves to 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.350
 promise but at the time of governing it comes out 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.909
 with a spray of drool just look like no 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.100
 they have faith in the city all 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.580
 rulers a moment youngsters 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 you are making a serious mistake 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.299
 democratic but if the vote does not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.520
 compulsory teacher which error is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.830
 true is not mandatory but if you 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840
 does not attend the polls is being removed 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.269
 the right to participate and choose their 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.640
 rulers therefore is accepting the 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.340
 decision that others make, think that 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.560
 who calla grants and if he did not participate 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.200
 then with what face will you criticize the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 administration of its ruler the vote 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.060
 is the citizen's main weapon by 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.100
 that when they vote do it conscientiously 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.319
 for the candidate that you better 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.959
 consider, I propose something first 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.180

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.739
 the fish and we go for bread I know how 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.470

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.990
