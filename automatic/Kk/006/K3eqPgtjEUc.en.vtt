there's got to be 10,000 just from not
it's<00:00:31.400> got<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:31.609> be<00:00:31.670> hundreds<00:00:32.300> of<00:00:32.359> thousands

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's got to be hundreds of thousands

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.050 
it's got to be hundreds of thousands
still<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.140> no<00:00:33.290> one's<00:00:33.500> excavated<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:34.220> then

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.060 
still that no one's excavated and then

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.790 
still that no one's excavated and then
there's<00:00:35.300> tens<00:00:35.780> of<00:00:35.930> thousands<00:00:36.350> more<00:00:36.470> out<00:00:36.649> on

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
there's tens of thousands more out on

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.710 
there's tens of thousands more out on
the<00:00:36.920> prairies<00:00:37.310> and<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:37.700> think<00:00:38.480> when<00:00:38.690> people

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
the prairies and I think when people

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.080 
the prairies and I think when people
hear<00:00:39.140> those<00:00:39.440> numbers<00:00:39.770> they<00:00:39.920> they're<00:00:40.850> kind<00:00:41.030> of

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
hear those numbers they they're kind of

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.490 
hear those numbers they they're kind of
having<00:00:41.329> trouble<00:00:41.450> registering<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.260> but<00:00:42.410> you

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
having trouble registering this but you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.750 
having trouble registering this but you
have<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.710> put<00:00:42.860> it<00:00:42.950> in<00:00:43.040> this<00:00:43.130> context<00:00:43.670> that

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
have to put it in this context that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.420 
have to put it in this context that
people<00:00:44.660> were<00:00:44.750> here<00:00:44.930> for<00:00:45.079> almost<00:00:45.380> 6,000<00:00:46.219> years

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
people were here for almost 6,000 years

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.250 
people were here for almost 6,000 years
not<00:00:46.850> using<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:47.270> jump<00:00:47.480> all<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:47.870> time<00:00:48.050> there

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
not using the jump all that time there

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.310 
not using the jump all that time there
appears<00:00:48.500> to<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.649> gaps<00:00:48.980> but<00:00:49.640> nonetheless<00:00:49.880> a<00:00:50.390> lot

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
appears to be gaps but nonetheless a lot

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.840 
appears to be gaps but nonetheless a lot
of<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.649> time<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.129> that<00:00:52.190> there<00:00:52.790> were

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
of that time and that there were

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.130 
of that time and that there were
probably<00:00:53.120> times<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:53.750> there<00:00:53.870> were<00:00:53.989> they<00:00:54.110> were

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
probably times in there were they were

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.049 
probably times in there were they were
here<00:00:54.469> not<00:00:54.860> only<00:00:55.010> every<00:00:55.309> year<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:55.579> maybe<00:00:55.790> even

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
here not only every year but maybe even

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.060 
here not only every year but maybe even
several<00:00:56.390> times<00:00:56.660> in<00:00:56.870> one<00:00:57.050> year<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.800> at<00:00:57.920> any

several times in one year and at any
time<00:00:58.280> they<00:00:58.430> came<00:00:58.610> they<00:00:58.789> may<00:00:58.940> have<00:00:59.030> been

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
time they came they may have been

of the animals survived the fall had to
be<00:01:04.940> dispatched<00:01:05.330> off<00:01:05.570> at<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.810> bottom<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.170> many

be dispatched off at the bottom and many
of<00:01:06.830> them<00:01:06.950> might<00:01:07.369> have<00:01:07.490> taken<00:01:07.610> five<00:01:08.150> six<00:01:08.600> seven

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
animal at all and just went into the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.370 
animal at all and just went into the
ground<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.210> tips<00:01:14.690> broke<00:01:14.930> off<00:01:15.110> and<00:01:15.320> they

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170 
ground and the tips broke off and they
were<00:01:15.440> thrown<00:01:15.710> away<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:16.760> you<00:01:16.820> could<00:01:17.060> just

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
were thrown away and so you could just

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.960 
were thrown away and so you could just
picture<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.840> sheer<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.590> once<00:01:19.159> estimated<00:01:19.820> that

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
picture the sheer I once estimated that

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.030 
picture the sheer I once estimated that
maybe<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.869> hundred<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.260> fifty<00:01:21.590> thousand

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
maybe a hundred and fifty thousand

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.100 
maybe a hundred and fifty thousand
hundred<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.400> twenty<00:01:22.640> thousand<00:01:23.060> Buffalo<00:01:23.840> died

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
hundred and twenty thousand Buffalo died

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.350 
hundred and twenty thousand Buffalo died
here<00:01:24.500> over<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:24.950> time<00:01:25.220> it<00:01:25.369> was<00:01:25.490> used<00:01:25.640> very

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
here over the time it was used very

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.780 
here over the time it was used very
ballpark<00:01:26.689> figure<00:01:27.290> but<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:28.460> could<00:01:28.640> easily

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
ballpark figure but that could easily

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.210 
ballpark figure but that could easily
mean<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.360> lot<00:01:29.600> more<00:01:29.750> than<00:01:29.990> 120,000<00:01:30.890> arrowheads

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
mean a lot more than 120,000 arrowheads

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.219 
mean a lot more than 120,000 arrowheads
if<00:01:31.460> usually<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:32.330> could<00:01:32.479> be<00:01:32.600> a<00:01:32.630> million<00:01:33.020> you

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
if usually it could be a million you

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.719 
if usually it could be a million you
know<00:01:33.259> for<00:01:33.680> for<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.189> kind<00:01:34.400> of<00:01:34.490> numbers<00:01:34.820> yeah

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
know for for that kind of numbers yeah

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.340 
know for for that kind of numbers yeah
it's<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.850> staggering<00:01:38.119> site<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.750> that<00:01:38.869> sensor

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
it's a staggering site in that sensor

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.440 
it's a staggering site in that sensor
and<00:01:39.590> when<00:01:40.100> we<00:01:40.280> dug<00:01:40.490> out<00:01:40.670> there<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> thing<00:01:41.299> that

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
and when we dug out there the thing that

been like with the teepees lit up like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.970 
been like with the teepees lit up like
fires<00:02:28.390> inside<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.959> candle<00:02:29.380> or<00:02:29.500> something<00:02:29.560> and

people<00:02:30.850> out<00:02:31.150> there<00:02:31.480> probably<00:02:31.840> working<00:02:32.050> round

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
people out there probably working round

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.710 
people out there probably working round
the<00:02:32.470> clock<00:02:32.560> you<00:02:32.980> know<00:02:33.100> cooking<00:02:33.850> smashing<00:02:34.570> bone

the clock you know cooking smashing bone

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.960 
the clock you know cooking smashing bone
cutting<00:02:35.500> meat<00:02:35.770> up<00:02:35.920> because<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.520> think<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.820> be<00:02:36.940> a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
cutting meat up because I think to be a

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.550 
cutting meat up because I think to be a
considerable<00:02:37.510> incentive<00:02:37.959> to<00:02:38.050> getting<00:02:38.290> out<00:02:38.410> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
considerable incentive to getting out of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.949 
considerable incentive to getting out of
here<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:39.670> know<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.360> smell<00:02:40.600> has<00:02:40.630> now

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.590 
here you know that the smell has now
gotten<00:02:41.320> its<00:02:41.620> way<00:02:41.770> into<00:02:41.980> the<00:02:42.270> predator<00:02:43.270> world

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
gotten its way into the predator world

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.630 
gotten its way into the predator world
and<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:43.900> Grizzlies<00:02:44.320> and<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:45.190> all<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.340> birds

towards<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.510> think<00:02:50.020> people<00:02:50.140> probably

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
towards here I think people probably

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.350 
towards here I think people probably
said<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.070> think<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.790> was<00:02:51.970> kind<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.239> an

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
said I think this was kind of an

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.729 
said I think this was kind of an
industrial<00:02:52.570> site<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.080> think<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.709> that

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
industrial site I think of it in that

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.010 
industrial site I think of it in that
way<00:02:53.890> very<00:02:54.850> much<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> sacred<00:02:55.540> one<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.720> don't<00:02:55.900> want

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
way very much a sacred one I don't want

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.620 
way very much a sacred one I don't want
to<00:02:56.080> make<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.230> sound<00:02:57.000> mechanical<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.600> a

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
to make it sound mechanical it was a

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.330 
to make it sound mechanical it was a
very<00:02:58.660> sacred<00:02:59.050> place<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> lot<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.860> syrup<00:03:00.250> we

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
very sacred place and a lot of syrup we

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.430 
very sacred place and a lot of syrup we
know<00:03:00.550> great<00:03:01.030> ceremonies<00:03:01.510> were<00:03:01.660> steeped<00:03:02.230> in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
know great ceremonies were steeped in

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.270 
know great ceremonies were steeped in
here<00:03:03.360> along<00:03:04.360> with<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.350> see<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.070> very

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
here along with this but I see it very

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.100 
here along with this but I see it very
much<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.640> kind<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.060> an<00:03:07.180> industrial<00:03:07.420> site<00:03:07.930> in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
much as kind of an industrial site in

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.110 
much as kind of an industrial site in
that<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:09.010> know<00:03:09.040> there<00:03:09.280> was<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> process<00:03:09.730> they

that you know there was a process they

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
that you know there was a process they
went<00:03:10.330> through<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.690> they<00:03:11.110> they<00:03:11.500> knew<00:03:11.680> from<00:03:11.890> step

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
went through it they they knew from step

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.500 
went through it they they knew from step
to<00:03:12.370> step<00:03:12.400> what<00:03:12.790> they<00:03:12.880> were<00:03:12.940> going<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.120> do<00:03:13.299> and

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
to step what they were going to do and

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.090 
to step what they were going to do and
the<00:03:13.870> whole<00:03:13.989> idea<00:03:14.049> was<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.620> get<00:03:14.769> out<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.920> here

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
the whole idea was to get out of here

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.009 
the whole idea was to get out of here
with<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.459> proceeds<00:03:16.120> from<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.630> skill<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
with the proceeds from the skill and

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.440 
with the proceeds from the skill and
this<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.040> not<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> campsite<00:03:18.640> it's<00:03:19.090> not<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.209> place

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
this is not a campsite it's not a place

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.180 
this is not a campsite it's not a place
they<00:03:19.600> would<00:03:19.720> stay<00:03:19.959> very<00:03:20.200> long<00:03:20.380> for<00:03:20.920> many<00:03:21.070> of

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
they would stay very long for many of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.289 
they would stay very long for many of
the<00:03:21.280> reasons<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.670> are<00:03:22.150> easily

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
the reasons that are easily

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.840 
the reasons that are easily
understandable<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:24.100> would<00:03:24.220> not<00:03:24.430> be<00:03:24.610> a<00:03:24.640> very

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
understandable it would not be a very

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.460 
understandable it would not be a very
attractive<00:03:24.970> place<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.510> be<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.989> aftermath

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
attractive place to be in the aftermath

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.740 
attractive place to be in the aftermath
of<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.799> massive<00:03:27.220> buffalo<00:03:27.549> pill<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.269> think

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
of a massive buffalo pill so I think

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.539 
of a massive buffalo pill so I think
they<00:03:28.989> moved<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.350> out<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.530> here<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:30.130> can<00:03:30.280> call

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
they moved on out of here you can call

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.229 
they moved on out of here you can call
just<00:03:31.239> as<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:33.370> isn't<00:03:33.640> even<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:34.209> know

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
just as I can this isn't even you know

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.610 
just as I can this isn't even you know
when<00:03:34.480> you're<00:03:34.600> excavating<00:03:34.930> when<00:03:35.350> you've<00:03:35.470> got

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
