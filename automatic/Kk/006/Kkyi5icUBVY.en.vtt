00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
myself included as it always does

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
myself included as it always does
include<00:00:29.070> increase<00:00:29.960> explosive<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> score

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
include increase explosive and score

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.380 
include increase explosive and score
streak<00:00:31.830> damage<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:33.090> might

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
streak damage so that actually might

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.479 
streak damage so that actually might
make<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.840> even<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.680> know<00:00:34.800> better<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.309> use

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
make it even you know better to use

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
make it even you know better to use
people<00:00:35.820> might<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.570> extra

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
people might use it just for that extra

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.560 
people might use it just for that extra
scorestreak<00:00:37.530> damage<00:00:38.030> but<00:00:39.030> next<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
scorestreak damage but next of the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.450 
scorestreak damage but next of the
counter<00:00:39.930> we've<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.260> flak<00:00:40.680> jacket<00:00:41.190> which

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
counter we've got flak jacket which

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.060 
counter we've got flak jacket which
obviously<00:00:42.140> reduces<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> damage<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.770> kind

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
obviously reduces the damage that's kind

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.400 
obviously reduces the damage that's kind
of<00:00:44.160> hopefully<00:00:44.520> counters<00:00:45.170> danger<00:00:46.170> close

down by explosive damage you know how

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
down by explosive damage you know how
you<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.090> stopped<00:00:51.420> when<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.809> hit

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
whatever five seconds that means if you

whatever five seconds that means if you
pick<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.480> reset<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.780> another<00:01:03.960> five

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pick it up reset so you get another five

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
in that situation which doesn't come up

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
in that situation which doesn't come up
to<00:01:08.280> awesome<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.000> good<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.180> have

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to awesome but it's good to have

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359 
to awesome but it's good to have
nonetheless<00:01:09.740> next<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:10.890> lightweight

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
nonetheless next we have lightweight

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
nonetheless next we have lightweight
which<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.850> increases<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> movement<00:01:12.780> speed

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
which just increases the movement speed

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.440 
which just increases the movement speed
like<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.409> other<00:01:13.619> games<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.450> pretty

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like all other games a pretty

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
like all other games a pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:15.840> which<00:01:16.680> I've<00:01:17.159> seen<00:01:17.460> people

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
self-explanatory which I've seen people
move<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.060> fast<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.509> game<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> might

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
move pretty fast this game so it might

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
move pretty fast this game so it might
be<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.590> pretty<00:01:19.890> good<00:01:20.070> perk<00:01:20.420> next<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> low

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
be a pretty good perk next is low

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
threat grenade which I'm not entirely

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.190 
threat grenade which I'm not entirely
sure<00:03:26.250> what<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.730> either<00:03:27.060> but<00:03:27.480> we'll<00:03:27.989> see

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
sure what that is either but we'll see

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.509 
sure what that is either but we'll see
next<00:03:29.130> is<00:03:29.459> fast<00:03:29.910> hands<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.769> reload<00:03:32.280> while

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
next is fast hands you can reload while

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.310 
next is fast hands you can reload while
sprinting<00:03:32.970> kind<00:03:33.450> of<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.660> on<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.079> and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
sprinting kind of like on the go and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.580 
sprinting kind of like on the go and
ghost<00:03:34.730> swap<00:03:35.730> weapons<00:03:36.269> use<00:03:36.510> EXO<00:03:36.930> abilities<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
ghost swap weapons use EXO abilities and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.210 
ghost swap weapons use EXO abilities and
use<00:03:37.980> XO<00:03:38.519> launcher<00:03:38.970> faster<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.560> it's<00:03:41.070> pretty

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
use XO launcher faster so it's pretty

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.550 
use XO launcher faster so it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:41.610> except<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.170> reload

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
self-explanatory except for the reload

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.840 
self-explanatory except for the reload
while<00:03:43.769> sprinting<00:03:44.040> thing<00:03:44.280> that's<00:03:44.459> kind<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.730> an

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
while sprinting thing that's kind of an

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.150 
while sprinting thing that's kind of an
added<00:03:45.329> bonus<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.590> said<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.890> EXO

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
added bonus like I said the EXO

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.580 
added bonus like I said the EXO
abilities<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.790> said<00:03:47.970> before<00:03:48.530> I'm<00:03:49.530> not

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
abilities like I said before I'm not

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.440 
abilities like I said before I'm not
sure<00:03:49.920> how<00:03:50.070> some<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.370> them<00:03:50.549> will<00:03:50.730> work<00:03:50.850> faster

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
sure how some of them will work faster

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.680 
sure how some of them will work faster
but<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.989> you<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.350> like<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.620> hover<00:03:52.829> thing

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
but like you know like the hover thing

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.880 
but like you know like the hover thing
but<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.720> go<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.290> one<00:03:55.440> of<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.590> EXO<00:03:55.859> abilities

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
but I go and one of the EXO abilities

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.800 
but I go and one of the EXO abilities
you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.310> pull<00:03:56.579> out<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.880> riot<00:03:57.239> shield<00:03:57.390> type

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.199 
you can pull out like a riot shield type
of<00:03:57.959> thing<00:03:58.109> quickly<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.859> that'll<00:03:59.850> probably

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
of thing quickly so that'll probably

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.910 
of thing quickly so that'll probably
definitely<00:04:00.510> help<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.019> X<00:04:01.170> ability<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> lot<00:04:01.829> if

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
definitely help that X ability a lot if

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.170 
definitely help that X ability a lot if
you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.130> pull<00:04:02.340> your<00:04:02.370> shield<00:04:02.790> right<00:04:02.970> away

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
you can pull your shield right away

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.910 
you can pull your shield right away
which<00:04:03.420> you<00:04:03.660> know<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.810> kind<00:04:04.140> of<00:04:04.170> look<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.500> P<00:04:04.709> but

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
which you know I kind of look so P but

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.640 
which you know I kind of look so P but
we'll<00:04:05.040> see<00:04:05.190> how<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.310> turns<00:04:05.430> out<00:04:06.049> another<00:04:07.049> /<00:04:07.320> 2

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
we'll see how it turns out another / 2

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.250 
we'll see how it turns out another / 2
is<00:04:07.920> gung-ho<00:04:08.310> fire<00:04:09.180> while<00:04:09.480> sprinting<00:04:09.930> and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
sliding but the sprinting not on maybe

double jump you show up on the radar so
this<00:05:07.150> will<00:05:07.300> protect<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.720> from<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:07.930> which<00:05:08.200> is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
this will protect you from that which is

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
this will protect you from that which is
probably<00:05:08.650> going<00:05:08.830> to<00:05:08.920> be<00:05:10.650> like<00:05:11.650> a<00:05:11.860> perk<00:05:12.190> that's

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
probably going to be like a perk that's

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.430 
probably going to be like a perk that's
used<00:05:12.580> a<00:05:12.700> lot<00:05:12.730> because<00:05:13.090> if<00:05:13.360> you're<00:05:13.540> going<00:05:14.260> on

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
used a lot because if you're going on

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.720 
used a lot because if you're going on
the<00:05:14.530> radar<00:05:14.680> just<00:05:14.920> from<00:05:15.100> double<00:05:15.460> jumping

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
the radar just from double jumping

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.950 
the radar just from double jumping
obviously<00:05:16.180> want<00:05:16.330> to<00:05:16.390> be<00:05:16.450> able<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.660> use<00:05:16.810> this

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
obviously want to be able to use this

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.880 
obviously want to be able to use this
and<00:05:17.230> so<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.890> see<00:05:18.040> this<00:05:18.160> perk<00:05:18.400> being<00:05:18.610> used<00:05:18.820> a<00:05:18.910> lot

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
and so I see this perk being used a lot

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.710 
and so I see this perk being used a lot
hardwired<00:05:20.890> I<00:05:21.190> mean<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.880> system<00:05:22.240> hanky<00:05:22.630> and

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
hardwired I mean the system hanky and

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.420 
hardwired I mean the system hanky and
peeing<00:05:23.020> Nano<00:05:23.290> swarm<00:05:23.560> stun<00:05:23.980> grenades<00:05:24.280> and

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
peeing Nano swarm stun grenades and

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.160 
peeing Nano swarm stun grenades and
scramblers<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.390> know<00:05:25.480> kind<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.810> like<00:05:25.870> black

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
scramblers you know kind of like black

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.410 
scramblers you know kind of like black
ops<00:05:26.380> 2<00:05:26.560> how<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:26.890> was<00:05:27.010> but<00:05:27.700> it<00:05:27.760> helps<00:05:28.210> against

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
ops 2 how it was but it helps against

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.450 
ops 2 how it was but it helps against
Sun<00:05:28.600> grenades<00:05:28.900> to<00:05:29.020> so<00:05:29.350> kind<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.800> made<00:05:29.950> the<00:05:30.070> perk

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
Sun grenades to so kind of made the perk

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.659 
Sun grenades to so kind of made the perk
a<00:05:30.610> little<00:05:30.880> bit<00:05:31.000> better<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:33.100> next<00:05:33.280> perk<00:05:33.520> is

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
a little bit better and the next perk is

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.370 
a little bit better and the next perk is
hardline<00:05:34.030> decreased<00:05:34.450> forestry<00:05:34.900> costs<00:05:35.140> by<00:05:35.350> a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
hardline decreased forestry costs by a

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.290 
hardline decreased forestry costs by a
hundred<00:05:35.800> sub<00:05:36.040> it's<00:05:36.370> kind<00:05:36.760> of<00:05:36.820> like<00:05:36.940> all<00:05:37.180> the

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
hundred sub it's kind of like all the

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.150 
hundred sub it's kind of like all the
other<00:05:37.450> games<00:05:37.660> where<00:05:37.930> it's<00:05:38.020> one<00:05:38.410> less<00:05:38.590> kill<00:05:38.919> to

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
other games where it's one less kill to

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.770 
other games where it's one less kill to
get<00:05:39.310> except<00:05:39.669> for<00:05:39.820> black<00:05:39.970> ops<00:05:40.120> 2<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:40.540> was<00:05:40.630> like<00:05:40.750> a

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
get except for black ops 2 it was like a

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.200 
get except for black ops 2 it was like a
ten<00:05:41.080> percent<00:05:41.260> increase<00:05:41.830> so<00:05:42.640> it's<00:05:42.820> not<00:05:42.940> as<00:05:43.060> good

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
ten percent increase so it's not as good

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.150 
ten percent increase so it's not as good
at<00:05:43.300> the<00:05:43.390> black<00:05:43.570> ops<00:05:43.780> 2<00:05:43.960> hardline<00:05:44.440> it's

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
at the black ops 2 hardline it's

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.350 
at the black ops 2 hardline it's
basically<00:05:45.460> just<00:05:45.580> like<00:05:45.850> a<00:05:45.880> one<00:05:46.150> kill

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
basically just like a one kill

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540 
basically just like a one kill
difference<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.140> but<00:05:48.040> of<00:05:48.130> course<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.430> know

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
difference and but of course you know

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.860 
difference and but of course you know
you<00:05:48.610> get<00:05:48.790> points<00:05:49.150> for<00:05:49.300> other<00:05:49.510> stuff<00:05:49.720> like

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
you get points for other stuff like

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.150 
you get points for other stuff like
capturing<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.350> objective<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.860> stuff<00:05:51.010> like

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
capturing the objective and stuff like

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.210 
capturing the objective and stuff like
that<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.360> did<00:05:52.510> in<00:05:52.600> black<00:05:52.750> ops<00:05:52.960> 2<00:05:53.220> it's

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
that like you did in black ops 2 it's

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.330 
that like you did in black ops 2 it's
not<00:05:54.370> just<00:05:54.430> kills<00:05:54.820> but<00:05:55.150> yeah<00:05:55.330> you<00:05:55.390> get<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.690> idea

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
not just kills but yeah you get the idea

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.570 
not just kills but yeah you get the idea
another<00:05:57.340> perk<00:05:57.610> 3<00:05:57.910> scavenger<00:05:59.070> you<00:06:00.070> start<00:06:00.460> with

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
another perk 3 scavenger you start with

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.640 
another perk 3 scavenger you start with
extra<00:06:00.880> magazines<00:06:01.300> and<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.930> can<00:06:02.080> pick<00:06:02.230> up<00:06:02.440> and

pick up ammo from bit bodies so it's

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.800

loaded and scavenge together you start

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.409 
loaded and scavenge together you start
up<00:06:09.460> more<00:06:09.760> ammo<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:11.010> another<00:06:12.010> /<00:06:12.310> 23<00:06:12.820> /<00:06:12.910> case
