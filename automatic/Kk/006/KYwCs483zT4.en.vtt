electric thing the new technology that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.209 
electric thing the new technology that
it's<00:01:43.189> really<00:01:43.700> really<00:01:43.909> interesting

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
it's really really interesting

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.669

yes<00:01:48.250> about<00:01:49.250> sport<00:01:49.960> limousine<00:01:50.960> from<00:01:51.289> the<00:01:51.380> plant

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
yes about sport limousine from the plant

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.310 
yes about sport limousine from the plant
that<00:01:52.579> was<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.909> first<00:01:53.179> car<00:01:53.539> who's<00:01:53.869> running

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
that was the first car who's running

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.550 
that was the first car who's running
with<00:01:54.500> a<00:01:54.530> flow<00:01:54.829> battery<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:56.000> means<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:56.689> you

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
with a flow battery it means that you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.419 
with a flow battery it means that you
storage<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.280> energy<00:01:58.729> in<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.479> electrolytes

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
storage the energy in to electrolytes

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.359 
storage the energy in to electrolytes
positive<00:02:01.429> charge<00:02:01.759> negative<00:02:02.270> charge

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
positive charge negative charge

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.990 
positive charge negative charge
and<00:02:04.290> through<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.320> man<00:02:05.619> braun<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> flow<00:02:06.670> cell

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
and through a man braun in a flow cell

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.949 
and through a man braun in a flow cell
you<00:02:07.720> generate<00:02:08.259> two<00:02:08.649> different

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you generate two different

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.199 
you generate two different
electrochemical<00:02:10.959> processes<00:02:12.030> oxidation<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
electrochemical processes oxidation and

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.610 
electrochemical processes oxidation and
reduction<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.380> we<00:02:14.680> generate<00:02:15.160> current

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
reduction and so we generate current

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.030 
reduction and so we generate current
that's<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.800> branch<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.830> make<00:02:21.010> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's the branch so just to make it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.550 
that's the branch so just to make it
easier<00:02:21.580> for<00:02:21.610> everyone<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.300> understand<00:02:22.959> the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
easier for everyone to understand the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.070 
easier for everyone to understand the
the<00:02:24.160> problem<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.000> electric<00:02:25.690> car<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.050> that

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the problem of the electric car is that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.440 
the problem of the electric car is that
you<00:02:26.319> have<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.800> be<00:02:26.950> charged<00:02:27.310> every<00:02:27.610> time<00:02:28.120> and

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
you have to be charged every time and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.690 
you have to be charged every time and
every<00:02:28.569> time<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.160> one<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.670> don't

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
every time so with this one you don't

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.770 
every time so with this one you don't
have<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.540> worry<00:02:31.780> about<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:33.569> recharging<00:02:34.569> time

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
have to worry about it recharging time

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.460 
have to worry about it recharging time
it<00:02:35.200> will<00:02:35.470> be<00:02:35.620> finished<00:02:36.160> because<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:37.470> storage

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
it will be finished because you storage

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.370 
it will be finished because you storage
the<00:02:38.739> energies<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:39.819> these<00:02:40.120> two<00:02:40.540> electrolytes

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
the energies in these two electrolytes

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.430 
the energies in these two electrolytes
that's<00:02:42.720> negative<00:02:43.720> charged<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.370> this<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
that's negative charged so this is the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.979 
that's negative charged so this is the
next<00:02:47.650> step<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.340> electric<00:02:48.849> cars<00:02:48.880> yes<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.930> think

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
next step on electric cars yes I think

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.190 
next step on electric cars yes I think

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
people with the the fuel tank cells will

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.210 
people with the the fuel tank cells will
stay<00:03:22.359> in<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.170> middle<00:03:23.470> yes

so<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.350> few<00:03:26.590> things<00:03:26.829> cells<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:28.180> so

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
so this is the few things cells right so

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.559 
so this is the few things cells right so
