right<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.349> ever<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.979> choose

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
right now and if I ever want to choose

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.030 
right now and if I ever want to choose
to<00:02:11.459> go<00:02:11.610> back<00:02:11.879> natural<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.830> would

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
to go back natural I think I would

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.040 
to go back natural I think I would
transition<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.090> wouldn't<00:02:15.390> do<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> big<00:02:15.750> chop

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
transition I wouldn't do a big chop

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.199 
transition I wouldn't do a big chop
because<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.530> big<00:02:16.830> chop<00:02:17.099> just<00:02:17.370> isn't<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:18.000> my

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
because a big chop just isn't really my

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
because a big chop just isn't really my
style<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:19.019> would<00:02:19.500> like<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> know<00:02:20.069> at<00:02:20.280> least

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
style I would like to you know at least

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.850 
style I would like to you know at least
grow<00:02:20.730> my<00:02:20.940> hair<00:02:20.970> out<00:02:21.180> -<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.019> don't<00:02:22.170> think<00:02:22.349> if<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
grow my hair out - I don't think if it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
grow my hair out - I don't think if it
was<00:02:22.980> me<00:02:23.190> if<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.459> was<00:02:23.640> transitioning<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.299> would

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
was me if I was transitioning I would

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.539 
was me if I was transitioning I would
grow<00:02:24.629> it<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:24.870> -<00:02:25.049> around<00:02:26.720> what<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> this

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
grow it out - around what is this

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.130 
grow it out - around what is this
chin<00:02:29.549> length<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.030> would<00:02:30.209> feel<00:02:30.390> comfortable<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
chin length I would feel comfortable you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.869 
chin length I would feel comfortable you
know<00:02:31.170> chopping<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.860> off<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.580> would<00:02:32.700> grow

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
know chopping it off so it would grow

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.500 
know chopping it off so it would grow
somewhere<00:02:33.239> around<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:35.239> that's<00:02:36.239> when<00:02:36.420> I

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
somewhere around here that's when I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.860 
somewhere around here that's when I
would<00:02:36.690> chop<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.140> rest<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:37.590> ends<00:02:37.830> off<00:02:38.069> but

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
would chop the rest of my ends off but

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.809 
would chop the rest of my ends off but
as<00:02:39.870> far<00:02:40.079> as<00:02:40.110> me<00:02:40.380> going<00:02:40.560> natural<00:02:40.890> any<00:02:41.250> time<00:02:41.549> soon

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
as far as me going natural any time soon

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.539 
as far as me going natural any time soon
probably<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.780> maybe<00:02:43.319> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> future<00:02:43.980> future

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
probably not maybe in the future future

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.819 
probably not maybe in the future future
but<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.690> right<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:46.200> enjoying<00:02:46.349> my

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
but I'm right now I'm enjoying my

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.789 
but I'm right now I'm enjoying my
relaxed<00:02:47.310> hair<00:02:47.549> I'm<00:02:48.299> enjoying<00:02:48.750> reaching<00:02:49.680> the

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
relaxed hair I'm enjoying reaching the

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.890 
relaxed hair I'm enjoying reaching the
links<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.430> with<00:02:51.000> my<00:02:51.030> relaxed<00:02:51.660> hair

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
links that I have with my relaxed hair

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.979 
links that I have with my relaxed hair
um<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:53.459> being<00:02:54.030> relaxed<00:02:54.510> right<00:02:54.599> now<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.900> just

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
um so being relaxed right now it's just

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.640 
um so being relaxed right now it's just
the<00:02:55.140> style<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.650> choose<00:02:56.510> but<00:02:57.510> um<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the style that I choose but um the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.160 
the style that I choose but um the
reason<00:02:58.950> for<00:02:59.099> me<00:02:59.190> being<00:02:59.220> relaxed<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.420> really

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
reason for me being relaxed I really

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.140 
reason for me being relaxed I really
don't<00:03:01.349> have<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.620> reason<00:03:02.129> why<00:03:02.280> I'm<00:03:02.340> relaxed<00:03:02.790> tone

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
don't have a reason why I'm relaxed tone

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.830 
don't have a reason why I'm relaxed tone
because<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:05.340> know<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> was<00:03:06.180> relaxed<00:03:06.629> when<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
it's just always been this fine texture

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.270 
it's just always been this fine texture
and<00:03:41.579> what<00:03:41.700> I<00:03:41.730> mean<00:03:41.910> by<00:03:41.970> fine<00:03:42.769> texture<00:03:43.769> I'm<00:03:44.069> not

and what I mean by fine texture I'm not

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.949 
and what I mean by fine texture I'm not
gonna<00:03:44.430> even<00:03:44.519> call<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.849> texture<00:03:45.180> but<00:03:45.389> fine<00:03:45.660> it

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
gonna even call it texture but fine it

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.949 
gonna even call it texture but fine it
means<00:03:46.169> that<00:03:46.380> my<00:03:46.530> strands<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.609> not<00:03:48.209> thick<00:03:48.569> I

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
means that my strands are not thick I

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.830 
means that my strands are not thick I
don't<00:03:49.799> have<00:03:49.950> thick<00:03:50.310> strands<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.389> bolt<00:03:51.660> it's

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
don't have thick strands and bolt it's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.030 
don't have thick strands and bolt it's
like<00:03:51.959> they're<00:03:52.169> skinny<00:03:52.680> strands<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.810> um

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
like they're skinny strands and um

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.140 
like they're skinny strands and um
that's<00:03:56.040> how<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.310> would<00:03:56.430> say<00:03:56.760> that<00:03:57.000> because

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that's how I would say that because

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.089 
that's how I would say that because
people<00:03:57.510> will<00:03:57.630> thick<00:03:57.900> hair<00:03:58.109> their<00:03:58.290> strands<00:03:58.980> are

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
people will thick hair their strands are

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.159 
people will thick hair their strands are
thicker<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.389> I<00:04:01.280> don't<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.400> six<00:04:02.700> strands<00:04:03.169> my

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
thicker so I don't have six strands my

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.580 
thicker so I don't have six strands my
hair<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.799> don't<00:04:04.950> believe<00:04:05.340> it's<00:04:05.549> thin<00:04:05.880> due<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.450> a

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
hair I don't believe it's thin due to a

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.199 
hair I don't believe it's thin due to a
relaxing<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.829> do<00:04:07.980> know<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.519> if<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.000> were<00:04:09.180> a

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
relaxing but I do know that if I were a

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.479 
relaxing but I do know that if I were a
natural<00:04:09.480> it'll<00:04:09.900> be<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.319> a<00:04:10.500> tad<00:04:10.709> bit<00:04:10.769> thicker

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
natural it'll be just a tad bit thicker

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.390 
natural it'll be just a tad bit thicker
because<00:04:12.450> when<00:04:12.900> my<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.079> was<00:04:13.500> natural<00:04:14.099> my<00:04:14.190> hair

because when my I was natural my hair
was<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.879> little<00:04:15.540> bit<00:04:15.629> thicker<00:04:15.930> due<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.530> me
