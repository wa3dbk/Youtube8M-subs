00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.590
 hello, people, I'm 10 king, loquendo with 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.900
 a new criticism a long time ago that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.210
 I was doing a good deal of criticism 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.400
 about green flashlight the series 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.620
 animated good in this series it's about that 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.140
 a man who pilots planes called 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.300
 hal jordan is better said him 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.330
 they give a green ring and with it they can 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.460
 do whatever it is to fly do things to him 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.620
 he is not alone he is accompanied with a 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.309
 creature that was the first to know it 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.800
 when he arrived now and he is kilo watt them 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.719
 I'll be honest about him I do not know much I only know 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.360
 that he is unique in his kind because he 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.699
 they destroyed their planet is also going 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.829
 accompanied by a computer there 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.780
 own form she was from the ship in which 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.200
 they were traveling but she decided 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.600
 Having a body is also accompanied by 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.580
 ryder he is a red lantern that he 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.770
 got into the militia and when he came back 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.380
 he found his wife dead and thanks to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.990
 his life got the red lantern 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.270
 he joined the jordan after a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.100
 he fights against them and he decided to join 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.149
 because he was not comfortable with the reds 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.799
 but still he stayed with the ring x of 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.960
 good in the series it appears in that hal 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.970
 jordan already has the green ring so 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.740
 they did not do it from the beginning 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.560
 series is a war between the 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.869
 Green and red lanterns but they do not come out 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.329
 only the greens and reds also come out 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.670
 the roses and a good blue here in 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.130
 Latin America still does not really come out 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.799
 I recommend the series is very good in a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.720
 chapter came hawk men and with 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.899
 that tells you that more heroes are going to come out 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.970
 edf there in another chapter something appeared 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.490
 weird in that they gave a ring to a 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.890
 planet yes to a planet 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.840
 good in the USA they are doing something 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.660
 called death in action and let's hope 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.579
 when you leave here in good Latin 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.680
 I say goodbye with this statement although 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.200
 my superhero spiderman is in marvel 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360
 I must admit that in my opinion it is 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.440
 better than marvel and I say goodbye with this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.540
 Question 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.540
 Speaking of Marvel x who he
