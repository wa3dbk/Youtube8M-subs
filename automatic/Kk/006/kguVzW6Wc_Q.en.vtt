00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
so you don't have to put in it every

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.250 
so you don't have to put in it every
time<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.850> hit<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.180> unlock<00:02:12.420> button<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:13.140> will

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
via the tweak it's going to take you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.210 
via the tweak it's going to take you
back<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.300> settings<00:02:44.720> page<00:02:44.810> app<00:02:45.350> store<00:02:46.070> etc

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
back to the settings page app store etc

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.170 
back to the settings page app store etc
etc<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.480> confirm<00:02:48.110> time<00:02:48.380> overhead<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:49.190> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
etc the confirm time overhead is the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.080 
etc the confirm time overhead is the
same<00:02:50.480> thing<00:02:50.810> but<00:02:50.840> this<00:02:51.230> one<00:02:51.500> doesn't<00:02:51.830> work

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
same thing but this one doesn't work

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.610 
same thing but this one doesn't work
independently<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.360> looks<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.110> depends

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
independently it looks like it depends

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.140 
independently it looks like it depends
on<00:02:54.710> this<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.040> don't<00:02:55.280> think<00:02:55.490> that's<00:02:55.670> supposed<00:02:55.850> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
on this I don't think that's supposed to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.480 
on this I don't think that's supposed to
happen<00:02:56.240> so<00:02:56.570> if<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.810> go<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.740> hit<00:02:57.950> respring

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
happen so if I go out and I hit respring

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.950 
happen so if I go out and I hit respring
it's<00:02:58.730> going<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> respring<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.570> not<00:02:59.720> going<00:02:59.900> to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
it's going to respring it's not going to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.500 
it's going to respring it's not going to
ask<00:03:00.110> me<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.410> confirm<00:03:00.890> because<00:03:01.190> as<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:02.120> said<00:03:02.180> they

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
ask me to confirm because as I said they

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.150 
ask me to confirm because as I said they
depend<00:03:02.930> on<00:03:03.080> each<00:03:03.110> other<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:04.010> not

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
depend on each other so if this is not

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.280 
depend on each other so if this is not
on<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:05.030> will<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.450> work<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:05.750> now<00:03:05.930> my<00:03:06.110> turn

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
on that will not work so now my turn

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.680 
on that will not work so now my turn
that<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.950> now<00:03:07.460> I<00:03:07.490> hit<00:03:07.790> respring<00:03:08.270> this

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
that on and now I hit respring this

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.660 
that on and now I hit respring this
message<00:03:09.140> comes<00:03:09.440> up<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.800> think<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.310> bug<00:03:10.520> i'm

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.990 
message comes up I think it's a bug i'm
not<00:03:10.730> too<00:03:11.060> sure<00:03:11.090> I'm<00:03:11.330> just<00:03:11.570> speculating<00:03:13.000> light

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
not too sure I'm just speculating light

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.570 
not too sure I'm just speculating light
