easy<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.000> has<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> knob<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
easy to use all it has is that knob I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
knob and you're just good to go and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
knob and you're just good to go and then
the<00:00:50.969> cons<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.829> boss

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
the cons is just and now that boss

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.529 
the cons is just and now that boss
doesn't<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.550> these<00:00:53.699> anymore<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.270> harder

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
doesn't make these anymore it's harder

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
doesn't make these anymore it's harder
to<00:00:54.629> find<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.379> makes<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:55.860> more

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to find so which makes it a little more

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
to find so which makes it a little more
expensive<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.690> some<00:00:58.320> people

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
expensive and also that some people

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
expensive and also that some people
might<00:00:58.770> find<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> little<00:00:59.489> limiting<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
might find it a little limiting that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
might find it a little limiting that
only<00:01:00.750> has<00:01:00.960> two<00:01:01.199> knobs<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.070> wouldn't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
only has two knobs but I wouldn't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.549 
only has two knobs but I wouldn't
disagree<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.199> makes<00:01:04.350> up

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
disagree it because it just it makes up

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.590 
disagree it because it just it makes up
for<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.920> its<00:01:05.070> sound<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.760> let's<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> look

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:25.910 

you
