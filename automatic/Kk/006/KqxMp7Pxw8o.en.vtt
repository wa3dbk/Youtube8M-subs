me because the feathers chickens

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.430 
me because the feathers chickens
feathers<00:02:26.100> are<00:02:26.250> protein<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.140> an<00:02:28.290> egg

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
feathers are protein and so is an egg

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.330 
feathers are protein and so is an egg
and<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.940> when<00:02:30.510> she<00:02:30.840> eats<00:02:31.260> every<00:02:31.710> day<00:02:31.860> she's

it's which is transmitted transmitted
through<00:03:11.360> mosquitoes<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.340> this<00:03:13.340> year<00:03:13.580> was<00:03:13.730> a

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
through mosquitoes and this year was a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.540 
through mosquitoes and this year was a
real<00:03:14.120> big<00:03:14.660> mosquito<00:03:15.230> year<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:15.890> part<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
real big mosquito year and part of the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.850 
real big mosquito year and part of the
reason<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.910> I've<00:03:17.150> started<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.660> put<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.590> mall

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
reason that I've started to put the mall

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.300 
reason that I've started to put the mall
it's<00:03:19.070> pretty<00:03:19.400> much<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.880> over<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.360> yard

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it's pretty much all over the yard

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.190 
it's pretty much all over the yard
because<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.610> side<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> yard<00:03:23.510> here<00:03:23.990> when

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
because this side of the yard here when

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.770 
because this side of the yard here when
it<00:03:24.320> rains<00:03:24.530> real<00:03:24.830> hard<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.940> ground<00:03:26.300> underneath

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
it rains real hard the ground underneath

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.800 
it rains real hard the ground underneath
is<00:03:27.230> pretty<00:03:27.470> hard<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.040> water<00:03:28.250> doesn't

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
is pretty hard and the water doesn't

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.620 
is pretty hard and the water doesn't
drain<00:03:29.810> quickly<00:03:30.110> enough<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:32.090> I've<00:03:32.210> given

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
drain quickly enough and so I've given

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.330 
drain quickly enough and so I've given
up<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.870> idea<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:33.320> grass<00:03:33.560> over<00:03:33.950> here<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.250> I'm

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
up the idea of grass over here and I'm

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.130 
up the idea of grass over here and I'm
going<00:03:34.550> with<00:03:34.760> mulch<00:03:35.000> so<00:03:35.270> as<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.570> help<00:03:35.780> keep<00:03:35.960> down

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.140 
could say the chicken if they got that
and<00:06:04.930> then<00:06:04.960> it<00:06:05.200> can<00:06:05.380> infect<00:06:05.890> your<00:06:06.130> flock<00:06:06.370> do<00:06:07.090> you

and then it can infect your flock do you

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.180 
and then it can infect your flock do you

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
pox a couple of weeks ago and I had very

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.159 
pox a couple of weeks ago and I had very
very<00:06:14.740> young<00:06:15.070> chicks<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.729> know<00:06:15.760> vales<00:06:16.300> you

very young chicks you know vales you

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.900 
very young chicks you know vales you
know<00:06:17.289> the<00:06:17.410> word<00:06:17.590> spokes<00:06:17.979> your<00:06:18.310> hands<00:06:18.520> who<00:06:18.700> had

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
know the word spokes your hands who had

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.490 
know the word spokes your hands who had
it<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.210> I<00:06:19.240> had<00:06:19.389> no<00:06:19.539> idea<00:06:19.570> what<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.200> health

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
it and I had no idea what the health

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.290 
it and I had no idea what the health
impact<00:06:20.919> is<00:06:21.070> gonna<00:06:21.250> be<00:06:21.460> on<00:06:21.729> those<00:06:21.880> things<00:06:22.120> well

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
impact is gonna be on those things well

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.290 
impact is gonna be on those things well
I<00:06:22.330> think<00:06:22.930> if<00:06:23.229> they<00:06:23.860> get<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.550> and<00:06:24.789> survived

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
I think if they get it and survived

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.629 
I think if they get it and survived
they'll<00:06:25.780> be<00:06:25.840> immune<00:06:26.260> to<00:06:26.289> it<00:06:26.680> because<00:06:27.039> once<00:06:27.310> a

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
they'll be immune to it because once a

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.580 
they'll be immune to it because once a
chicken<00:06:28.090> goes<00:06:28.240> through<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.840> palms<00:06:29.080> then<00:06:29.470> they

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
chicken goes through the palms then they

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.770 
chicken goes through the palms then they
have<00:06:29.740> an<00:06:29.860> immunity<00:06:30.250> to<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.700> you<00:06:31.330> know<00:06:31.479> what<00:06:31.690> the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
have an immunity to it you know what the

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.750 
have an immunity to it you know what the
symptoms<00:06:32.020> are<00:06:32.350> for<00:06:32.620> a<00:06:32.650> chick<00:06:32.979> who<00:06:33.280> gets<00:06:33.610> the

on them and it looks like a black looks
like<00:06:40.419> a<00:06:40.450> blackboard<00:06:41.110> if<00:06:41.289> it's<00:06:41.560> the<00:06:41.740> wet

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
like a blackboard if it's the wet

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
because the wet parks which

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.950 
because the wet parks which
unfortunately<00:06:44.830> baby<00:06:45.400> chicks<00:06:45.729> are<00:06:45.940> like<00:06:46.240> fowl

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
unfortunately baby chicks are like fowl

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.180 
unfortunately baby chicks are like fowl
pox<00:06:47.350> can<00:06:47.650> be<00:06:47.770> dry<00:06:48.010> or<00:06:48.039> wet<00:06:48.550> right<00:06:48.910> in<00:06:49.150> the<00:06:49.810> same

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
pox can be dry or wet right in the same

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.640 
pox can be dry or wet right in the same
round<00:06:51.600> they'll<00:06:52.600> have<00:06:52.870> like<00:06:53.080> the<00:06:53.229> asthma

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
round they'll have like the asthma

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.710 
round they'll have like the asthma
affection<00:06:54.220> you<00:06:54.340> might<00:06:54.520> live<00:06:54.700> them<00:06:54.940> within<00:06:55.120> 24

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
affection you might live them within 24

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.080 
affection you might live them within 24
hours<00:06:55.979> they<00:06:56.979> might<00:06:57.250> show<00:06:57.639> no<00:06:57.880> signs<00:06:58.210> at<00:06:58.419> all

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
hours they might show no signs at all

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.380 
hours they might show no signs at all
so<00:07:01.090> it<00:07:02.610> baby<00:07:03.610> chicks<00:07:03.850> are<00:07:03.970> much<00:07:04.180> more

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
so it baby chicks are much more

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.110 
so it baby chicks are much more
susceptible<00:07:04.950> so<00:07:05.950> that's<00:07:06.310> why<00:07:06.490> I<00:07:06.520> keep<00:07:06.880> the

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
susceptible so that's why I keep the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.310
