00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.490 
storage this is the t-rex react attack
one<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.449> scientific<00:00:30.960> name

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
one or you know the scientific name

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
one or you know the scientific name
would<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:32.120> Tyrannosaurus<00:00:33.120> Rex<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> think

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
