felt that it wasn't completely done and
I<00:01:38.130> felt<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.729> still<00:01:38.909> missing<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> lot

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
I felt that it was still missing a lot

6.0<00:01:43.740> point<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.100> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> helps<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.909> out<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
6.0 point one kind of helps that out and
