reactions<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.130> don't<00:02:37.400> just<00:02:37.640> feel<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.600> drop

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
reactions so you don't just feel it drop

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
reactions so you don't just feel it drop
in<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.110> push<00:02:39.230> yourself<00:02:39.350> over<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.890> bars<00:02:40.069> I

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
in and push yourself over the bars I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.100 
in and push yourself over the bars I
feel<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.849> going<00:02:41.420> over<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.720> bars<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.080> just

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
feel it going over the bars and just

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.660 
feel it going over the bars and just
drop<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:42.500> back<00:02:42.680> end<00:02:42.890> it<00:02:43.069> just<00:02:43.250> takes<00:02:43.459> time

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
drop your back end it just takes time

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.900 
drop your back end it just takes time
and<00:02:43.880> practice<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:45.530> if<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.340> sit<00:02:46.549> to<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.700> key

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
points and keep on practicing you should

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
points and keep on practicing you should
pick<00:02:48.620> more<00:02:48.799> soon<00:02:48.980> enough
