 it is safe to be really tasty 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:36.480
 tries the scientific background that is, initially 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:43.579
 even before when you take out such lies there 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 got paste in here and 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.430
 special legs

 already some kind of straight space device that 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.220
 is fixed . 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.739
 it is necessary astronaut set is copper 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.540

 many have laid here and non-specific 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.789
 fan builds are needed for this 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.539
 to regulate the fire, I realized what 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.840
