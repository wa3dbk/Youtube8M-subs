of course you give it a home and then
find<00:02:24.230> its<00:02:24.440> own<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.150> probably<00:02:26.150> gonna<00:02:26.240> be

find its own so probably gonna be
removing<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.020> piece<00:02:27.200> of<00:02:27.500> PVC<00:02:27.800> I'll<00:02:28.550> do<00:02:28.760> a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
removing that piece of PVC I'll do a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.170 
removing that piece of PVC I'll do a
close-up<00:02:29.510> of<00:02:29.690> everything<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.740> bit

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
close-up of everything in a little bit

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260 
close-up of everything in a little bit
but<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:33.860> thing<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.160> guys<00:02:34.340> probably<00:02:34.850> do

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
but one thing you guys probably do

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.470 
but one thing you guys probably do
notice<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.850> lighting<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.450> a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
notice is that the the lighting is a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.580 
notice is that the the lighting is a
little<00:02:38.840> different

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
little different

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.330 
little different
well<00:02:39.950> there's<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.310> good<00:02:40.610> story<00:02:40.880> for<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:42.340> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
well there's a good story for that the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.320 
well there's a good story for that the
3/8<00:02:44.150> watt<00:02:44.950> 14<00:02:45.950> K<00:02:46.220> skylights

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
3/8 watt 14 K skylights

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.830 
3/8 watt 14 K skylights
I<00:02:47.360> had<00:02:48.260> above<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.709> tank<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.720> experienced<00:02:50.720> an

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
I had above the tank I experienced an

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.009 
I had above the tank I experienced an
issue<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.560> them<00:02:52.390> shooting<00:02:53.390> all<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.630> videos

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
issue with them shooting all the videos

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.650 
issue with them shooting all the videos
it<00:02:54.380> was<00:02:54.500> really<00:02:54.800> hard<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.160> tell<00:02:55.489> but<00:02:55.820> once<00:02:56.420> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
it was really hard to tell but once the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.330 
it was really hard to tell but once the
video<00:02:56.900> camera<00:02:57.290> went<00:02:57.500> off<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.250> know

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
video camera went off and I you know

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.680 
video camera went off and I you know
would<00:02:58.550> sit<00:02:58.760> down<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.209> take<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.360> look<00:02:59.510> at<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
would sit down and take a look at the

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.370 
would sit down and take a look at the
tank<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.250> started<00:03:01.250> noticing<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
tank I started noticing that the the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.990 
tank I started noticing that the the
lights<00:03:03.590> were<00:03:03.769> kind<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:06.880> basically<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
lights were kind of the basically the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.660 
lights were kind of the basically the
color<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.450> lights<00:03:08.660> were<00:03:08.870> inconsistent

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
color of the lights were inconsistent

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.940 
color of the lights were inconsistent
one<00:03:10.670> side<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> tank<00:03:11.390> would<00:03:11.959> be<00:03:11.989> more<00:03:12.500> white

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
one side of the tank would be more white

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.120 
one side of the tank would be more white
in<00:03:13.130> color<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.820> other<00:03:13.850> side<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.360> tank

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
in color and the other side of the tank

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.640 
in color and the other side of the tank
was<00:03:16.130> more<00:03:16.430> had<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.030> more<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.720> bluish<00:03:17.959> tint<00:03:18.110> to

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
was more had a more of a bluish tint to

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.140 
was more had a more of a bluish tint to
it<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.340> know<00:03:19.400> at<00:03:19.549> first<00:03:19.579> I<00:03:19.880> thought<00:03:20.030> it

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
it now you know at first I thought it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.970 
it now you know at first I thought it
might<00:03:20.299> be<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.510> LEDs<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.290> know<00:03:21.380> some<00:03:21.709> are<00:03:21.860> on

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
might be the LEDs you know some are on

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.600 
might be the LEDs you know some are on
some<00:03:22.250> are<00:03:22.370> off<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.320> blue<00:03:24.320> LEDs<00:03:24.799> but<00:03:25.160> check

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
some are off the the blue LEDs but check

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.110 
some are off the the blue LEDs but check
the<00:03:25.730> lights<00:03:25.940> everything<00:03:26.390> was<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.750> know

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
the lights everything was you know

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
the lights everything was you know
everything<00:03:29.120> was<00:03:29.209> everything<00:03:30.170> was<00:03:30.290> on<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:32.140> you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
everything was everything was on so you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.020 
everything was everything was on so you
had<00:03:33.290> tried<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.799> with<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:33.980> blue<00:03:34.370> LEDs<00:03:34.790> on<00:03:35.000> and

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
had tried it with the blue LEDs on and

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.930 
had tried it with the blue LEDs on and
with<00:03:35.600> them<00:03:35.750> off<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.980> results<00:03:37.430> were<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.670> same

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
with them off the results were the same

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.240 
with them off the results were the same
so<00:03:38.299> I<00:03:38.750> end<00:03:39.049> up<00:03:39.110> calling<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.680> bought<00:03:39.980> grief

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
so I end up calling a bought grief

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.530 
so I end up calling a bought grief
supply<00:03:40.610> telling<00:03:41.030> them<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.450> know

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
there's a inconsistent in consistencies

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.050 
there's a inconsistent in consistencies

so<00:05:42.419> yeah<00:05:42.570> this<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:42.780> what<00:05:43.050> I<00:05:43.110> changed<00:05:43.380> I<00:05:43.820> used<00:05:44.820> to

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
so yeah this is what I changed I used to

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.300 
so yeah this is what I changed I used to
be<00:05:44.970> just<00:05:45.180> one<00:05:45.419> hole<00:05:45.449> now<00:05:45.870> it's<00:05:46.050> two<00:05:46.860> little

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
be just one hole now it's two little

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.980 
be just one hole now it's two little
holes<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.909> think<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.419> looks<00:05:48.570> a<00:05:48.659> little<00:05:48.780> cooler

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990

holes I think it looks a little cooler
that<00:05:49.349> way<00:05:49.940> gives<00:05:50.940> a<00:05:51.030> little<00:05:51.180> more<00:05:51.270> depth
