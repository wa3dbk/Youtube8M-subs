00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
icons that represent things and there's

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.290 
icons that represent things and there's
the<00:00:19.109> usual<00:00:19.830> mode<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> use<00:00:20.609> right

with<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.760> few<00:00:48.300> things<00:00:48.480> around<00:00:48.750> first

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.310 

there<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.289> go

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.500 

and<00:00:55.740> we<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:56.040> lay<00:00:56.130> the<00:00:56.310> whole<00:00:56.490> room<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:57.030> in

and we can lay the whole room out in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.570 
and we can lay the whole room out in
this<00:00:58.230> fashion<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> create<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> nice<00:01:00.660> little

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
this fashion and create a nice little

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.370 
this fashion and create a nice little
angular<00:01:02.580> setup

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.190 

you<00:01:09.380> can<00:01:09.850> also<00:01:12.549> make<00:01:13.549> what's<00:01:14.000> called<00:01:14.090> Styles<00:01:14.900> I

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
you can also make what's called Styles I

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.730 
you can also make what's called Styles I
haven't<00:01:15.619> looked<00:01:15.710> into<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.130> much<00:01:16.490> myself

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
haven't looked into that much myself

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.530 
haven't looked into that much myself
I've<00:01:18.740> only<00:01:18.890> had<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.310> while<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:19.759> course<00:01:20.390> it's

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
I've only had it a while as course it's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.030 
I've only had it a while as course it's
only<00:01:20.659> been<00:01:20.840> out<00:01:20.990> for<00:01:21.200> a<00:01:21.259> while<00:01:21.380> but<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.830> can

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
only been out for a while but you can

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
only been out for a while but you can
change<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:23.650> textures<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.159> designs<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
change the textures and designs and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.999 
change the textures and designs and
fabrics<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:27.100> absolutely<00:01:28.100> everything<00:01:30.009> very

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
fabrics of absolutely everything very

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.550 
fabrics of absolutely everything very
few<00:01:31.310> exceptions<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:32.869> you<00:01:32.930> can<00:01:33.259> make

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
few exceptions to this so you can make

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.850 
few exceptions to this so you can make
every<00:01:34.070> surface<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:34.610> your<00:01:34.729> house<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.899> know<00:01:36.050> red

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
every surface in your house you know red

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.700 
every surface in your house you know red
plaid<00:01:37.310> or<00:01:38.200> polka-dots<00:01:39.200> if<00:01:39.410> you'd<00:01:39.590> like<00:01:41.710> that's

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
plaid or polka-dots if you'd like that's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.389 
plaid or polka-dots if you'd like that's
really<00:01:42.979> useful<00:01:43.130> for<00:01:43.580> creating<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:44.270> very<00:01:45.399> match

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
really useful for creating a very match

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.050 
really useful for creating a very match
II<00:01:46.840> place<00:01:47.840> let's<00:01:48.530> take<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:48.950> fabric<00:01:49.850> on<00:01:49.970> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
II place let's take this fabric on the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.880 
II place let's take this fabric on the
couch<00:01:50.240> prescence<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.050> can<00:01:51.229> make<00:01:51.380> our<00:01:51.530> table

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
couch prescence we can make our table

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.550 
couch prescence we can make our table
match<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.390> won't<00:01:53.509> goes<00:01:53.869> it's<00:01:54.530> silly

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.040 

now<00:02:02.160> here<00:02:02.520> we<00:02:02.670> also<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.790> build<00:02:05.790> mode<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
now here we also have the build mode and

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.380 
now here we also have the build mode and
it's<00:02:07.200> set<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.280> icons<00:02:08.700> represent

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it's set up so that the icons represent

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.530 
it's set up so that the icons represent
each<00:02:09.690> part<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.320> emails<00:02:10.770> over<00:02:10.979> them<00:02:11.250> they

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
each part of it emails over them they

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.930 
each part of it emails over them they
can<00:02:12.540> everything<00:02:12.870> from<00:02:13.170> trees<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.280> ponds<00:02:14.520> and

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
can everything from trees and ponds and

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.900 
can everything from trees and ponds and
things<00:02:15.320> will<00:02:16.320> make<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> pond<00:02:16.740> here<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:17.850> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
things will make a pond here now you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.699 
things will make a pond here now you
have<00:02:19.459> different<00:02:20.459> gradients<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.410> your<00:02:22.410> brush

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
have different gradients of your brush

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.610 
have different gradients of your brush
texture<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.420> very<00:02:24.630> nice<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.470> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
texture which is very nice for if you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.850 
texture which is very nice for if you
want<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> get<00:02:25.980> very<00:02:26.220> specific<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:27.860> grass

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
want to get very specific with grass

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.820 
want to get very specific with grass
texturing<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.730> whatnot<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.680> almost

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
texturing and whatnot so it's almost

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.120 
texturing and whatnot so it's almost
like<00:02:32.010> painting<00:02:32.520> even<00:02:33.209> worser<00:02:33.630> than<00:02:33.660> before

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.910 

and<00:02:38.450> now<00:02:39.450> I'm<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> show<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.470> very
