hi<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.560> Nico<00:00:01.740> Rosberg<00:00:01.949> hi<00:00:02.700> I'm<00:00:03.000> Lewis

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hi I'm Nico Rosberg hi I'm Lewis

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.179 
hi I'm Nico Rosberg hi I'm Lewis
Hamilton<00:00:03.720> it's<00:00:04.049> time<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.380> get<00:00:04.470> street<00:00:04.740> smart

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.190 

so<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.250> know<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.849> testing<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.630> found<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
so you know the testing I found the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.860 
so you know the testing I found the
optimum<00:00:10.620> line<00:00:10.830> for<00:00:11.519> top<00:00:11.910> 5<00:00:12.120> i'm<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.750> show

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
optimum line for top 5 i'm going to show

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.010 
optimum line for top 5 i'm going to show
you<00:00:13.460> we<00:00:14.460> catch<00:00:14.639> up<00:00:14.670> on<00:00:14.969> ketchup<00:00:15.509> no<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> don't

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
you we catch up on ketchup no I don't

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.230 
you we catch up on ketchup no I don't
like<00:00:16.109> ketchup<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:16.680> place<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> corners

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
like ketchup on my place so the corners

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.420 
like ketchup on my place so the corners
like<00:00:18.330> this<00:00:18.390> that's<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> apex<00:00:19.859> right<00:00:20.189> there

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
like this that's the apex right there

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.090 
like this that's the apex right there
she's<00:00:21.270> got<00:00:21.359> quite<00:00:21.720> wide<00:00:21.960> ok<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:22.439> Abby<00:00:22.680> that's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
she's got quite wide ok then Abby that's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.950 
she's got quite wide ok then Abby that's
enough<00:00:23.369> that's<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.939> office<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.420> life<00:00:24.660> who<00:00:24.900> you

understand that that's great I don't you

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.820 
understand that that's great I don't you
like<00:00:27.720> ketchup<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.289> some<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.650> want

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
like ketchup I want some I just want

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
like ketchup I want some I just want
some<00:00:28.949> might<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.340> tried<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> not<00:00:29.939> because

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
some might have you tried it not because

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
some might have you tried it not because
I<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.140> try<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.769> look<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.369> how's

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I don't like it try that look what how's

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.819 
I don't like it try that look what how's
that<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> idea<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.300> line<00:00:33.450> right<00:00:33.660> there

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
that for the idea of line right there

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
that for the idea of line right there
huh<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:35.130> turn<00:00:35.460> four<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
huh that's turn four that's if I make a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.530 
huh that's turn four that's if I make a
breaking<00:00:36.870> mistake<00:00:37.910> no<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.180> always<00:00:39.329> make

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
breaking mistake no I don't always make

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.790 
breaking mistake no I don't always make
them<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:39.840> that's<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.440> happens

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
them but that's what that's what happens

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.830 
them but that's what that's what happens
when<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.190> tried<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.910> tires<00:00:42.120> my<00:00:42.360> no<00:00:42.510> flats

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
when I tried your tires my no flats

in<00:00:48.770> motor<00:00:49.040> racing<00:00:49.130> the<00:00:50.090> lines<00:00:50.360> we<00:00:50.570> take<00:00:50.780> are

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
in motor racing the lines we take are

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.660 
in motor racing the lines we take are
absolutely<00:00:51.290> critical<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:51.770> produce<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.640> best

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
absolutely critical to produce the best

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
lap time the way the driver enters a

corner goes through the apex the middle
of<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.250> corner<00:00:58.540> exits<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.690> corner<00:01:00.080> is<00:01:00.260> what

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
of the corner exits the corner is what

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.190 
of the corner exits the corner is what
makes<00:01:01.100> a<00:01:01.340> fast<00:01:01.580> lap<00:01:01.850> time<00:01:02.150> and<00:01:02.870> all<00:01:02.990> we're

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
makes a fast lap time and all we're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.870 
makes a fast lap time and all we're
interested<00:01:03.410> in<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:03.980> racing<00:01:04.400> is<00:01:04.550> the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
interested in and in racing is the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.760 
interested in and in racing is the
fastest<00:01:05.360> possible<00:01:05.570> lap<00:01:05.960> time<00:01:06.200> I'm<00:01:06.530> really

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
fastest possible lap time I'm really

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.050 
fastest possible lap time I'm really
driving<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.160> car<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.580> limit<00:01:07.820> all<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
driving the car on the limit all the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.300 
driving the car on the limit all the
time<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:08.450> it<00:01:08.540> can<00:01:08.690> happen<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.410> misjudge<00:01:09.920> or

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
time so it can happen that I misjudge or

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.310 
time so it can happen that I misjudge or
just<00:01:10.580> make<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:10.970> little<00:01:11.150> mistake<00:01:11.300> and<00:01:11.810> go<00:01:12.170> off

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
just make a little mistake and go off

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.110 
just make a little mistake and go off
the<00:01:12.470> racing<00:01:12.770> line<00:01:12.800> and<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.640> lose<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.910> lot<00:01:14.090> of

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
the racing line and then I lose a lot of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.880 
the racing line and then I lose a lot of
time<00:01:14.360> straight<00:01:14.630> away<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.080> think<00:01:15.680> for<00:01:15.830> us

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
time straight away I think for us

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.010 
time straight away I think for us
drivers<00:01:16.160> as<00:01:16.460> as<00:01:16.640> we<00:01:17.090> have<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.510> experience<00:01:17.630> of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
drivers as as we have the experience of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.499 
drivers as as we have the experience of
racing<00:01:18.350> for<00:01:18.500> years<00:01:18.729> we<00:01:19.729> generally<00:01:20.180> know<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
racing for years we generally know the

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.780 
racing for years we generally know the
optimal<00:01:20.930> curve<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.860> think<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.250> just<00:01:22.280> comes<00:01:22.550> to

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
optimal curve I think it just comes to

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.490 
optimal curve I think it just comes to
you<00:01:22.820> when<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:23.180> enter<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.479> corner<00:01:23.780> now<00:01:24.290> on<00:01:24.410> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
you when you enter the corner now on the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.580 
you when you enter the corner now on the
road<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.550> should<00:01:25.759> be<00:01:25.880> focused<00:01:26.300> on<00:01:26.450> safety<00:01:27.080> not

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
road you should be focused on safety not

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.109 
road you should be focused on safety not
only<00:01:27.880> performance<00:01:30.640> gonna<00:01:31.640> be<00:01:31.729> able<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.030> you

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
only performance gonna be able to you

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.700 
only performance gonna be able to you
