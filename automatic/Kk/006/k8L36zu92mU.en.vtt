00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.220

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.200
 we know about him we know he is a pokémon 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.300
 adorable and protector of the forest according to 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.940
 the pokédex or information on pages 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.530
 but tell me what would happen if this pokemon 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.900
 was a demon that came out of hell 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.509
 think that this pokemon can cause 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.769
 pain and suffering to others then 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.839
 rub it on your face until you're 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.579
 on the brink of madness that's what 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.489

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.559
 the year 2011 the pokémon had left 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.449
 black and white for that in Spanish I 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.519
 very happy I downloaded it and went to the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.010
 list of chats to start the game 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:46.940

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.310
 then start the chip hunt 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 on a very strange page where there was a 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.540
 infinite money chat rare candies 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.640

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 interested was the geek of hell 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.840
 elche a consisted of a brilliant celebration 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.960
 with some very strange attacks in my opinion 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.660
 his attacks were death bell 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.460
 rain and hell's bell 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.680
 eruption 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.420
 seeing this I was frozen in fear 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 but I do not think I left them a big 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 impact like me since it was everything 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 a fan of the franchise of the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.970
 Pokémon games knew that it came to him 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 had those strange 'attacks after 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 analyze the celebrity was going to fight against 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 a coach but he had already won 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 all then I had to go for a 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.600
 wild pokémon to try this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 thriller and then I went to the grass and I 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.800
 I found a captain on the initial route 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 you know is where the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.550
 Pokemon from the previous regions 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.410
 think that I saw my faith from the time 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.539
 dance and here starts the horrible thing had 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.550
 planned to use the bell attack of the 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.440
 death when using it sounded a bell 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.479
 just like normal ones after that the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.280
 pipita began to say his words 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 only in a tone of suffering and very 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.480
 Really scared me a lot after school 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.700
 it started to bleed and then they screamed 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.650
 strong his eyes went out the field he 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.720
 put red total saying puppy tara 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.760
 dead must have said puppy tar has been 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.320
 weakened then it showed up in all the 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.390
 screen the image of the puppy is 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.550
 bleeding and without eyes that the chat of the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.190
 game after he got in all the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.110
 screen the image turn off my pc and I kept 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.470

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.580

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.770
 torment in my dreams I do not think that I 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.830
 it's been a long time so I write this 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.450
 so they know the cause of my death 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.700
 for those who like to make the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.380
 easy life in these games with chats les them 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.840
 clean as it may happen to them what 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.840
