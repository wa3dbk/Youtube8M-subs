need to take this out of the juicer to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.460 
need to take this out of the juicer to
do<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> spare<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.170> going

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
do this but I have a spare so I'm going

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.160 
do this but I have a spare so I'm going
to<00:00:25.500> make<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.859> easy<00:00:26.220> by<00:00:27.150> showing<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.990> this

on and a small hole ring in the top now

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
on and a small hole ring in the top now
if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> lift<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:59.100> piston<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
if you lift out the piston and the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
if you lift out the piston and the
o-ring<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.430> notice<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:04.589> piston

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
o-ring you will notice that the piston

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
o-ring you will notice that the piston
goes<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> small<00:01:06.000> end<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.930> return

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
goes in the small end of the return

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.270 
goes in the small end of the return
spring<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:09.049> there's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> dogleg<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> top

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
spring and there's a dogleg at the top

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
spring and there's a dogleg at the top
that<00:01:11.670> fits<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> holes<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that fits into one of the holes at the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.370 
that fits into one of the holes at the
top<00:01:15.439> inside<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.680> reservoir<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.939> one

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
top inside the reservoir there is one

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.950 
top inside the reservoir there is one
large<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.799> ring<00:01:19.920> at<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> very<00:01:20.400> bottom<00:01:20.960> on

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
large little ring at the very bottom on

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.100 
large little ring at the very bottom on
which<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.880> bottom<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> piston<00:01:24.869> chamber

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
which the bottom of the piston chamber

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.030 
which the bottom of the piston chamber
fits<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> put<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.729> back<00:01:26.790> in

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
fits so I'm going to put this back in

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.350 
fits so I'm going to put this back in
but<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.159> gonna<00:01:29.400> lift<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.970> piston

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but I'm gonna lift out the piston

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.200 
but I'm gonna lift out the piston
chamber<00:01:31.880> to<00:01:32.880> inspect<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.350> spring<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.060> do

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
chamber to inspect the spring you can do

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.609 
chamber to inspect the spring you can do
it<00:01:36.329> visually<00:01:36.780> they're<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.470> either

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
it visually they're looking and either

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.280 
it visually they're looking and either
end<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> see<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.369> scrunched<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.079> if<00:01:40.079> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
end to see if it's scrunched up if it's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
end to see if it's scrunched up if it's
hanging<00:01:40.530> outside<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.130> bottom<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:42.000> bit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
hanging outside the bottom a little bit

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260 
hanging outside the bottom a little bit
it's<00:01:42.360> probably<00:01:42.990> still<00:01:43.290> good<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> replace

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it's probably still good now to replace

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's probably still good now to replace
the<00:01:46.670> spring<00:01:48.140> if<00:01:49.140> sometimes<00:01:49.740> difficult<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.310> get

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the spring if sometimes difficult to get

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.679 
the spring if sometimes difficult to get
up<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.060> try<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.659> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
up but you can try it out with a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.069 
up but you can try it out with a
screwdriver<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:53.299> with<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> channel<00:01:54.899> lock

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.580 
screwdriver or with a channel lock
spring<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> we're<00:01:57.479> gonna<00:01:57.600> take<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> chamber

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
spring and we're gonna take the chamber

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.880 
spring and we're gonna take the chamber
out<00:01:58.619> leave<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> piston<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.960> sometimes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
out leave the piston in now sometimes

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.580 
out leave the piston in now sometimes
the<00:02:02.729> spring<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.299> very<00:02:03.360> difficult<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.380> out

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the spring is very difficult to get out

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.069 
the spring is very difficult to get out
but<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.159> pry<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:06.049> with<00:02:07.049> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
but you can pry it out with a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.199 
but you can pry it out with a
screwdriver<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.890> putting<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.459> screwdriver<00:02:08.849> in

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

coil<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:12.530> flying<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.099> as<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.430> just<00:02:13.670> did

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
coil and flying it out as I just did

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.449 
coil and flying it out as I just did
here<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:17.390> will<00:02:17.599> reveal<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.920> spring<00:02:19.250> now

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
here and this will reveal the spring now

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.809 
here and this will reveal the spring now
this<00:02:19.640> spring<00:02:19.849> looks<00:02:20.180> pretty<00:02:20.510> good<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.020> me<00:02:21.819> it's

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
this spring looks pretty good to me it's

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.320 
this spring looks pretty good to me it's
probably<00:02:23.270> still<00:02:23.510> functional<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.700> replace<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
probably still functional to replace the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
of these holes in the top and you have

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.979 
of these holes in the top and you have
to<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.819> very<00:02:44.090> careful<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:44.930> don't

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
to be very careful because you don't

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.660 
to be very careful because you don't

chamber<00:02:49.780> there<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:50.930> go

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
chamber there we go

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.500 
chamber there we go
this<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.590> easy<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.250> time<00:02:52.489> it's<00:02:52.700> not<00:02:52.940> always

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
this is easy this time it's not always

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.490 
this is easy this time it's not always
this<00:02:53.750> easy<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.610> small<00:02:55.910> end<00:02:56.180> goes<00:02:57.170> at<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
this easy so the small end goes at the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:05.559 
this easy so the small end goes at the
bottom<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.010> dogleg<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.640> at<00:02:58.819> the<00:02:58.940> top

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.780 

and<00:03:06.049> we're<00:03:06.200> going<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.500> put<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.980> top<00:03:07.189> back<00:03:07.250> on

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
and we're going to put the top back on

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.020 
and we're going to put the top back on
and<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.769> want<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.040> seat<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.430> top<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and you want to seat the top of the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.399 
and you want to seat the top of the
piston<00:03:14.030> chamber<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.110> inner<00:03:15.950> groove<00:03:16.700> and

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
piston chamber in that inner groove and

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.039 
piston chamber in that inner groove and
if<00:03:18.409> that<00:03:18.590> oring<00:03:19.340> drops<00:03:20.180> out<00:03:20.390> just<00:03:20.659> put<00:03:20.810> a<00:03:20.840> drop

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
if that oring drops out just put a drop

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.509 
if that oring drops out just put a drop
of<00:03:21.170> oil<00:03:21.409> in<00:03:21.680> there<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.099> there's<00:03:22.310> enough

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
of oil in there so there's enough

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.720 
of oil in there so there's enough
surface<00:03:22.760> tension<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.450> hold<00:03:23.599> it<00:03:24.579> you're<00:03:25.579> gonna

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
surface tension to hold it you're gonna

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.910 
surface tension to hold it you're gonna
get<00:03:26.000> yes<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.900> are<00:03:27.079> sold<00:03:28.450> twist<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.599> until<00:03:29.920> the

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
get yes we are sold twist it until the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.839 
get yes we are sold twist it until the
small<00:03:31.190> ring<00:03:31.640> goes<00:03:31.879> past<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.450> piston<00:03:33.640> as<00:03:34.640> I'm

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
small ring goes past the piston as I'm

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.699 
small ring goes past the piston as I'm
doing<00:03:35.090> here<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.819> replace<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.440> six

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
doing here and then replace the six

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:48.100 
doing here and then replace the six
bolts

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.320 

so<00:03:48.680> I'm<00:03:48.860> not<00:03:49.040> gonna<00:03:49.190> tighten<00:03:49.670> all<00:03:49.820> those<00:03:50.030> no

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
so I'm not gonna tighten all those no

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.160 
so I'm not gonna tighten all those no
because<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.260> a<00:03:51.440> spare<00:03:51.740> part<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:53.170> hope
