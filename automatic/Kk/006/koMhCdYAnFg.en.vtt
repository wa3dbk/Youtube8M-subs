 ultrabook tablet transformation 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.620
 happens in an unusual way when

 located between them 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.119
 but just raising the screen a little and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.140
 spring loaded mounting plate will lift

 mounting plate such a design 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.189
 implies strict position fixation

 screen relative to the housing at an angle 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.210

 used keyboard island 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.360
 with increased distance between

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.490
 no complaints she almost not bend and

 keys 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.330
 do not click a serious flaw 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.940
 the keyboard is not that there are no 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.310
 palm rest when printing palm rests 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.410
 on the edge of the case in ultrabooks 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.720
 used to click on something with imitation 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.460
 keystrokes size working 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.590
 surface click through to too small 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.410
 therefore, it is inconvenient to use 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.850
 this disadvantage is partly compensated 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.430
 touch screen which can replace 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.580

 colors and excellent color coverage angles 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.650
 good reviews 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.540
 bundled with the device comes 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.190
 stylus digitizer which is designed in 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.440
 the first place to work in mode 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.600
 but it can be used in 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.670
 Ultrabook mode retractable 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.580
 Stand the stylus is located on 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.710
 right side ultrabook sony vaio duo 13 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.170
 categorized as very quiet 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.940
 in fact, it is never heard 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.650
 device battery is enough for 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.720
 watching movies for three s 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.020
 half hours or for work within 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.540
 all-day benefits sony vaio duo 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.820
 13 are light weight and compact 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.010
 long battery life and 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.690
 good performance however 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.210
 strict screen fixation mode 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.340
 ultrabook lack of palm rest when 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.530
 typing on the keyboard and uncomfortable click pad 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.550
 allow us to conclude that sony vaio 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.620
 duo 13 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.300
 This is primarily a tablet that when 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.610
 need you can use in 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.470
 ultrabook mode but the main drawback 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.050
 device is its high 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.810
 cost of 70 thousand minimum 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.180
 configurations and 100,000 at maximum for 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.220
 this money you get a hard tablet 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.220
 and not very convenient ultrabook
