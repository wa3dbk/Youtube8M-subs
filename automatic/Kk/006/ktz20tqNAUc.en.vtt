00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
copper rivet it gradually wears off and

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.610 
copper rivet it gradually wears off and
it<00:02:13.580> adds<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.880> little<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.270> copper<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:15.470> your

soil which is a central micronutrient
just<00:02:20.210> over<00:02:20.480> time<00:02:20.750> using<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:22.210> that<00:02:23.210> wears<00:02:23.540> off

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
just over time using it that wears off

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.020 
just over time using it that wears off
and<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.390> provides<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.610> copper<00:02:28.910> you
