 maps and addition for battlefield 4 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.489
 so we prepared two specials 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.489
 issues in new format 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.590

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.420
 and from personalization weapons about the game 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.500
 join and welcome to 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 battlefield 2 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.700
 hi alone introduce yourself please 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.470
 my name is Alan Hertz I'm a leading designer 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.570
 gameplay we answer with the team 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.720
 for everything that moves flies and shoots 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.149
 battlefield 4 and so what is the main 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.270
 philosophy embedded in the design of weapons in 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.340
 new game of Mairubi each brand weapon 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.289
 battlefield 4 you could meet 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.630
 in battlefield3 has undergone complete 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.220
 rebalancing we wanted to give 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.659
 true depth settings and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.700
 focused their efforts on 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.920
 weapon personalization as visual 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.960
 that sense of gameplay it and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 shaped our approach to personalization 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:47.299
 and balance weapons battlefield 4 you can 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.959
 show us different variations 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.580
 personalization that affect the game 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.819
 of course now I play the storm map on 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.530
 a couple of strengths Iâ€™ll go to the customization menu 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:01.220
 I have a basic Chinese army machine here 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.939
 gizizi 95 1 sarah fool's rider bize and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.190
 but that's how simple it looks like 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.670
 Only you unlocked it option 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.280
 bunawan 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.290
 let's say I want to engage in melee I 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.730
 I play on a couple of villages in the destruction mode 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 while on the central island 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.580
 so it will be hot and we cop me 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.709
 I go to the equipment menu set 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.670
 Chinese collimator it allows you to clearly 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.620
 sees the target and aim quickly except 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.269
 In addition, I will install a laser sight that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:36.650
 speed up aiming in motion also i 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.900
 screw the machine to the new Chinese 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.030
 silencer he will hide me on the minimap 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.500
 it complicates the detection of me by enemies 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.580
 which will be nearby 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.379
 fomin scoop fanovy and finally it's time 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.030
 decide on the front handle I 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.890
 I will install a new handle rg 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.030
 she will help shoot more accurately as in 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.030
 aiming such from the hip 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.719
 a began each weapon has its own 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.640
 strengths but personalization 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.569
 will allow to shift them towards accuracy 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.340
 or mobility 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.709
 let's make a configuration for large 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.670
 distances on the same weapon gizizi 95 1 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.989
 the first thing we need is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.030
 optical zoom 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's set dj's 4 this 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.389
 Chinese 4-fold sight 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.099
 he will give us enough approximation 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.209
 case if we have to get involved in 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.489
 melee we further 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.560
 set the fly so we 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.689
 we can tilt the weapon at 45 degrees 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.129
 though we lose the increase but we will 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.470
 mobile enough for neighbors 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.269
 distance and of course you are classic 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.459
 for sure want to install heavy 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.319
 the barrel on the machine that is important in the selection 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.909
 accessories you see a chart which 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.829
 instantly reflects their impact on 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.750
 characteristics of weapons of change 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.000
 range of fire rate and so 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.560
 further heavy barrel improve accuracy but 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.810
 greatly worsen his mobility 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.939
 make it harder to shoot and increase recoil 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.129
 finally my new favorite grip 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.590
 angular it gives excellent accuracy 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.900
 first shot and reduces recoil in 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.459
 the beginning of the queue if you attack with 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.280
 long distance and shoot solo 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.389
 shots corner handle increases 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.389
 effectiveness of such shooting
