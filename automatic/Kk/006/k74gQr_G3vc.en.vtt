point one five inch handle overall

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.789 
point one five inch handle overall
weight<00:01:10.009> is<00:01:10.310> only<00:01:11.030> three<00:01:11.600> point<00:01:11.900> four<00:01:12.170> ounces

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799

for the blade but 4.2 ounces if you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.050 
for the blade but 4.2 ounces if you're

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.020 
using the carry Heath the steel type is
154cm<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.840> definitely<00:01:24.289> a<00:01:24.350> great<00:01:24.829> steel<00:01:25.219> he's

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
154cm so definitely a great steel he's

154cm so definitely a great steel he's
not<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:27.100> moderate<00:01:28.100> reach<00:01:28.609> sharpening

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
not to moderate reach sharpening

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.779 
not to moderate reach sharpening
abilities<00:01:29.840> needed<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:30.979> definitely<00:01:31.399> it<00:01:31.520> keeps

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
abilities needed but definitely it keeps

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.340 
abilities needed but definitely it keeps
holds<00:01:32.119> an<00:01:32.210> edge<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.600> keeps<00:01:32.810> an<00:01:32.929> edge<00:01:33.079> so

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
holds an edge and keeps an edge so

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.639 
holds an edge and keeps an edge so

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
about is I'm ambidextrous so I tend to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.430 
about is I'm ambidextrous so I tend to
use<00:02:52.040> my<00:02:52.250> blades<00:02:52.819> right<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.270> left-handed<00:02:53.780> my

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
use my blades right and left-handed my

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.350 
use my blades right and left-handed my
problem<00:02:54.830> with<00:02:54.920> that<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.280> if<00:02:55.670> you're<00:02:55.940> trying<00:02:56.120> to

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
problem with that is if you're trying to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.440 
problem with that is if you're trying to
deploy<00:02:56.600> this<00:02:56.959> blade<00:02:57.230> left-handed<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:59.030> cannot

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
deploy this blade left-handed you cannot

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.240 
deploy this blade left-handed you cannot
just<00:02:59.780> deploy<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.230> like<00:03:00.410> this<00:03:00.620> because<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.040> just

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
just deploy it like this because it just

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.830 
just deploy it like this because it just
gets<00:03:01.459> caught<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.880> your<00:03:01.970> hand<00:03:02.209> you'd<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
gets caught in your hand you'd have to

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.410 
gets caught in your hand you'd have to
actually<00:03:02.900> flip<00:03:03.380> the<00:03:03.590> knife<00:03:03.739> over<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:05.090> deploy

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
actually flip the knife over to deploy

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.990 
actually flip the knife over to deploy
and<00:03:05.780> use<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.739> button<00:03:07.040> from<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> bottom<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
and use the button from the bottom I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.290 
and use the button from the bottom I
don't<00:03:08.450> really<00:03:08.600> like<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.310> also<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.790> clip<00:03:11.090> is

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.100 
don't really like that also the clip is
only<00:03:11.600> one<00:03:11.989> sided<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:14.209> that's<00:03:14.600> kind<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.019> a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
only one sided so that's kind of a

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.900 
only one sided so that's kind of a
