to make it very very scratch resistant

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
to make it very very scratch resistant
and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.780> did<00:00:51.989> find<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> case<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.299 
and I did find that to be the case it
doesn't<00:00:53.789> scratch<00:00:54.030> very<00:00:54.329> easily<00:00:55.070> now<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> does

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
doesn't scratch very easily now it does

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
doesn't scratch very easily now it does
have<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> thin<00:00:56.910> clear<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.690> as<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.140> kind

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.349 
have a thin clear back as you can kind
of<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.440> right<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.280> each<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.879> does<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
of see right here and each one does have

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.420

that<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.410> about<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.829> it's

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that and what I like about that is it's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.369

not<00:01:02.699> noticeable<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.930> does<00:01:04.170> add

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
not noticeable and it does add

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
not noticeable and it does add
protection<00:01:04.559> unlike<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> bumper<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.150> does<00:01:06.330> add

these cases for about a week and a half

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
thinnest cases and that is not the truth

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.660

thin and this case these cases are point

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.990 
thin and this case these cases are point
five<00:02:42.780> millimeters<00:02:43.440> thin<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.160> still<00:02:44.550> extremely

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.520 
hear it so let's take a look at the
white<00:02:59.490> one<00:03:00.000> right<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.170> them<00:03:01.380> are

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
white one right now so all of them are

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
the same except for one difference is

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.360 
the same except for one difference is
what<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.990> difference<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.440> noticed<00:03:04.860> so

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
what one difference that I noticed so

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.740 
what one difference that I noticed so
I'll<00:03:05.910> take<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> look<00:03:06.270> at<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.390> difference

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
I'll take a look at the difference

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.610 
I'll take a look at the difference
actually<00:03:06.870> right<00:03:07.230> now<00:03:07.520> so<00:03:08.520> on<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.840> white<00:03:10.410> and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
actually right now so on the white and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.800 
actually right now so on the white and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
the clear they both offer teeth and but

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.140 
the clear they both offer teeth and but
what<00:03:12.990> I<00:03:13.020> mean<00:03:13.170> by<00:03:13.260> teeth<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.830> in<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.820> little

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
what I mean by teeth is in the little

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.330 
what I mean by teeth is in the little
30-pin<00:03:15.780> dock<00:03:15.810> connector<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.740> little<00:03:17.100> flap

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
30-pin dock connector that little flap

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.400 
30-pin dock connector that little flap
that<00:03:17.550> goes<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.570> offers<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.080> little<00:03:19.320> bit

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
that goes in it it offers a little bit

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.570 
that goes in it it offers a little bit
of<00:03:19.500> teeth<00:03:19.800> as<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.070> can<00:03:20.160> kind<00:03:20.310> of<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.400> like

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
of teeth as you can kind of see like

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.520 
of teeth as you can kind of see like
that<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.630> does<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.930> White<00:03:22.110> they<00:03:22.380> both

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
that and so does the White they both

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.800 
that and so does the White they both
offer<00:03:22.740> that<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> black<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.600> just

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
offer that but on the black it's just

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.170 
offer that but on the black it's just
one<00:03:25.200> solid<00:03:25.800> line<00:03:26.070> just<00:03:26.610> like<00:03:26.700> that<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.150> can

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
one solid line just like that as you can

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.360 
one solid line just like that as you can
kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.450> see<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:28.110> they<00:03:28.740> all<00:03:28.890> work<00:03:29.070> very<00:03:29.130> well

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
kind of see so they all work very well

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.790 
kind of see so they all work very well
but<00:03:30.030> as<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.900> kind<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.080> see<00:03:31.140> also<00:03:31.620> right

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
but as you can kind of see also right

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.130 
but as you can kind of see also right
here<00:03:31.830> i<00:03:32.280> have<00:03:33.270> been<00:03:33.300> using<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.690> black<00:03:33.870> one<00:03:34.110> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
here i have been using the black one a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.630 
here i have been using the black one a
little<00:03:34.230> bit<00:03:34.410> more<00:03:34.560> because<00:03:34.800> my<00:03:35.130> iphone<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
little bit more because my iphone is

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.510 
little bit more because my iphone is
black<00:03:36.000> I've<00:03:36.240> used<00:03:36.390> all<00:03:36.510> three<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.080> but<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.100> use

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
black I've used all three but but I use

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.650 
black I've used all three but but I use
the<00:03:38.880> black<00:03:39.090> one<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.300> little<00:03:39.450> bit<00:03:39.540> longer

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
the black one a little bit longer

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.360 
the black one a little bit longer
because<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.110> do<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> black<00:03:40.650> iphone<00:03:41.130> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
because I do have the black iphone and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.790 
because I do have the black iphone and
they<00:03:42.300> actually<00:03:42.450> started<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.900> bend<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.560> little

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
they actually started to bend the little

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.010 
they actually started to bend the little
rubberized<00:03:44.220> line<00:03:44.520> just<00:03:44.850> like<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.209> not<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.930> lot

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
rubberized line just like that not a lot

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.530 
rubberized line just like that not a lot
but<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.590> did<00:03:46.740> start<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.040> bend<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.430> alright<00:03:48.420> so

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
but it did start to bend it alright so

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.060 
but it did start to bend it alright so
let's<00:03:48.660> put<00:03:48.720> an<00:03:48.870> iphone<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.560> white<00:03:49.800> version

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
let's put an iphone in the white version

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.130 
let's put an iphone in the white version
in<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.850> white<00:03:51.060> version<00:03:51.209> right<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.020> let's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
in the white version right now so let's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.170 
in the white version right now so let's
just<00:03:52.200> put<00:03:52.440> these<00:03:52.590> two<00:03:52.770> aside<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.400> i'll<00:03:53.910> show

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
just put these two aside and i'll show

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.850 
just put these two aside and i'll show
you<00:03:54.240> the<00:03:54.480> ports<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.230> cutouts<00:03:55.440> and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
you the ports and the cutouts and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.320 
you the ports and the cutouts and
everything<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.370> away<00:03:56.970> on<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.120> table

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
everything like that away on the table

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.810 
everything like that away on the table
design<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.440> putting<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.130> extremely<00:03:59.790> easy

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
design so putting in is extremely easy

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.150 
design so putting in is extremely easy
because<00:04:00.360> it<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.570> really<00:04:01.170> flexible<00:04:01.440> not<00:04:02.010> too

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
because it is really flexible not too

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.190 
because it is really flexible not too
flexible<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.760> silicon<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.750> extremely

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
flexible like silicon but extremely

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.740 
flexible like silicon but extremely
flexible<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.640> do<00:04:05.700> like<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.540> it

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
flexible and I do like that and it

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.449 
flexible and I do like that and it
doesn't<00:04:07.650> seem<00:04:07.770> like<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:07.980> going<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.160> come<00:04:08.280> off

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
doesn't seem like it's going to come off

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.760 
doesn't seem like it's going to come off
okay<00:04:08.880> it's<00:04:09.060> it's<00:04:09.570> it's<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.290> feels<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:10.709> a

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
okay it's it's it's it feels like a

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.670 
okay it's it's it's it feels like a
thermoplastic<00:04:11.310> elastomer<00:04:12.180> kind<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.480> tpe<00:04:13.230> kind

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
thermoplastic elastomer kind of tpe kind

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.949 
thermoplastic elastomer kind of tpe kind
of<00:04:13.740> material<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.459> it's<00:04:14.640> not<00:04:14.850> and<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.570> like

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
of material but it's not and I I do like

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.360 
of material but it's not and I I do like
the<00:04:16.049> material<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.500> lot<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.830> feels<00:04:17.010> really<00:04:17.250> good

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
the material a lot it feels really good

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.180 
the material a lot it feels really good

extremely pretty and if this was on a
white<00:04:34.130> iphone<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.760> would<00:04:35.090> look<00:04:35.180> even<00:04:35.330> better

so<00:04:36.290> let's<00:04:36.440> take<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.590> look<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:36.830> cutouts<00:04:37.190> on<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
so let's take a look here cutouts on the

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.570 
so let's take a look here cutouts on the
bottom<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.780> do<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.170> a<00:04:39.380> single<00:04:40.070> cut<00:04:40.220> out<00:04:40.340> for

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
bottom you do have a single cut out for

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.880 
bottom you do have a single cut out for
your<00:04:40.730> microphone<00:04:41.210> a<00:04:41.600> single<00:04:42.410> cut<00:04:42.560> out<00:04:42.650> for

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
your microphone a single cut out for

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.710 
your microphone a single cut out for
your<00:04:43.010> speaker<00:04:43.310> and<00:04:43.490> then<00:04:44.090> you<00:04:44.360> do<00:04:44.510> have<00:04:44.540> the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
your speaker and then you do have the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.750 
your speaker and then you do have the
flap<00:04:45.200> right<00:04:45.440> here<00:04:45.680> for<00:04:46.220> your<00:04:46.370> 30-pin<00:04:46.730> dock

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
flap right here for your 30-pin dock

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.120 
flap right here for your 30-pin dock
connector<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:48.140> does<00:04:48.260> cover<00:04:48.560> like<00:04:48.890> this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
connector and it does cover like this

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.400 
connector and it does cover like this
and<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:50.180> works<00:04:50.330> pretty<00:04:50.540> well<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.900> does<00:04:51.020> keep<00:04:51.260> it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
and it works pretty well it does keep it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.770 
and it works pretty well it does keep it
does<00:04:51.800> keep<00:04:51.980> dust<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.610> lint<00:04:52.820> and<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.330> whatever

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
does keep dust and lint and and whatever

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.510 
does keep dust and lint and and whatever
kind<00:04:54.170> of<00:04:54.200> particles<00:04:54.680> that<00:04:54.830> can<00:04:54.950> get<00:04:55.130> in<00:04:55.310> there

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
kind of particles that can get in there

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.220 
kind of particles that can get in there
it<00:04:55.940> does<00:04:56.120> keep<00:04:56.270> them<00:04:56.450> out<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.870> because<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.200> is

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
it does keep them out and because it is

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.990 
it does keep them out and because it is
pretty<00:04:57.530> thin<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:58.220> shouldn't<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:58.550> too<00:04:58.910> much

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
pretty thin you shouldn't have too much

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.220 
pretty thin you shouldn't have too much
of<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.210> problem<00:04:59.450> docking<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.170> you

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
of a problem docking it and you

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.090 
of a problem docking it and you
shouldn't<00:05:00.410> have<00:05:00.470> any<00:05:00.560> problem<00:05:00.950> actually

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
shouldn't have any problem actually

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.550
