00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
expansion are no different from the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860 
expansion are no different from the
actual<00:00:40.860> main<00:00:41.820> game<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> battlefield<00:00:42.570> bad

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
actual main game a battlefield bad

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
actual main game a battlefield bad
company<00:00:43.050> 2<00:00:43.410> they<00:00:44.129> didn't<00:00:44.370> change<00:00:44.520> anything

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
company 2 they didn't change anything

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
company 2 they didn't change anything
dramatically<00:00:45.480> for<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.930> mechanics<00:00:46.559> at<00:00:46.680> least

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
dramatically for the mechanics at least

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
dramatically for the mechanics at least
nothing<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> I've<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.579> seen<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.390> far

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
nothing that I've actually seen so far

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.959 
nothing that I've actually seen so far
it<00:00:49.230> plays<00:00:49.530> pretty<00:00:49.920> much<00:00:50.100> exactly<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it plays pretty much exactly like the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.369 
it plays pretty much exactly like the
original<00:00:51.390> game<00:00:51.420> which<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.020> least<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.260> my

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
original game which at least in my

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.580 
original game which at least in my
opinion<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> good<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.590> really

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
opinion is a good thing because I really

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
opinion is a good thing because I really
really<00:00:55.860> enjoyed<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.579> original<00:00:56.969> game<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.420> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
really enjoyed the original game and I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.450 
really enjoyed the original game and I
would<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.750> hated<00:00:58.379> if<00:00:58.680> they<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:59.190> change

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
would have hated if they actually change

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.090 
would have hated if they actually change
any<00:00:59.850> large<00:01:00.510> mechanic<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> actual<00:01:01.680> game<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
any large mechanic to the actual game so

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
any large mechanic to the actual game so
you're<00:01:02.280> still<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.699> able<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.059> run<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you're still going to be able to run and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.539 
you're still going to be able to run and
reload<00:01:04.019> at<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> same<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.159> still<00:01:05.400> have

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
reload at the same time you still have

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
reload at the same time you still have
infinite<00:01:05.939> sprints<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:07.049> character<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
infinite sprints and your character is

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
infinite sprints and your character is
still<00:01:07.950> slightly<00:01:08.310> clunky<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.540> say<00:01:09.720> this

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
still slightly clunky and I say this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
still slightly clunky and I say this
because<00:01:09.900> I've<00:01:10.290> been<00:01:10.320> I've<00:01:10.799> been<00:01:10.860> playing<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
because I've been I've been playing a

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
because I've been I've been playing a
lot<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> black<00:01:12.060> ops<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.470> also<00:01:13.650> took<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.950> month

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
lot of black ops and I also took a month

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.890 
lot of black ops and I also took a month
break<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.670> battlefield<00:01:15.030> bad<00:01:15.150> company<00:01:15.299> 2<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
break from battlefield bad company 2 so

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.380 
break from battlefield bad company 2 so
I'm<00:01:15.990> kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> used<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.920> fast<00:01:17.700> pace<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.270> not

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
I'm kind of used to the fast pace or not

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.240 
I'm kind of used to the fast pace or not
really<00:01:18.509> fast<00:01:18.780> paced<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
really fast paced but the the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
really fast paced but the the
super-soldier<00:01:20.850> aspect<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> call<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.350> duty

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
super-soldier aspect of the call of duty

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
super-soldier aspect of the call of duty
series<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.700> back<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
series and going back to this it's a

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
series and going back to this it's a
little<00:01:25.170> different<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.700> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> get

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
little different but it you kind of get

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
little different but it you kind of get
used<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> after<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> couple<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.590> couple<00:01:29.070> of

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
used to it after a couple of a couple of

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.219 
used to it after a couple of a couple of
matches<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.630> weapons<00:01:30.750> they've

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
matches but as for the weapons they've

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.289 
matches but as for the weapons they've
added<00:01:31.710> only<00:01:31.860> weapons<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> game<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> i

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
added only weapons to the game and i

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.789 
added only weapons to the game and i
must<00:01:33.479> say<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.689> I've<00:01:34.140> been<00:01:34.350> very<00:01:34.590> impressed

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799

must say that I've been very impressed
by<00:01:35.159> how<00:01:35.340> balanced<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.909> feel<00:01:36.119> I've<00:01:36.810> played<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
by how balanced they feel I've played I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
by how balanced they feel I've played I
think<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.890> played<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> all

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
think all are played with all of the all

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
think all are played with all of the all
of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> weapons<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.009> far<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> haven't

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
of the weapons and so far I haven't

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.200 
of the weapons and so far I haven't
noticed<00:01:42.030> any<00:01:42.210> large<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:43.670> balance<00:01:44.670> issues<00:01:44.970> all

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
noticed any large I balance issues all

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.539 
noticed any large I balance issues all
the<00:01:45.360> weapons<00:01:45.630> seem<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.619> even<00:01:47.009> no

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the weapons seem to be pretty even no

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.639 
the weapons seem to be pretty even no
weapon<00:01:48.000> seems<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> be<00:01:48.689> completely<00:01:49.049> dominating

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
weapon seems to be completely dominating

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
weapon seems to be completely dominating
the<00:01:49.710> battlefield<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.090> hard

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the battlefield but that's kind of hard

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.030 
the battlefield but that's kind of hard
to<00:01:51.299> say<00:01:51.479> because<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.320> like<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to say because this is just like the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
to say because this is just like the
very<00:01:53.159> first<00:01:53.460> day<00:01:53.549> I've<00:01:53.729> played<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.240> I'm

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
very first day I've played it and I'm

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050 
very first day I've played it and I'm
sure<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.649> couple<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.189> weapons<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:56.670> reign

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
sure a couple of weapons will reign

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
sure a couple of weapons will reign
supreme<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.810> end<00:01:58.070> but<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.189> happens<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
supreme in the end but that happens to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.069 
supreme in the end but that happens to
all<00:01:59.640> games<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.390> far<00:02:00.570> I've<00:02:00.780> been<00:02:00.810> very

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
all games but so far I've been very

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.590 
all games but so far I've been very
impressed<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.610> weapon<00:02:02.939> selection<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
impressed with the weapon selection and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.289 
impressed with the weapon selection and
also<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> weapon<00:02:04.079> balance<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.310> dices<00:02:05.939> also

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
also the weapon balance so dices also

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
also the weapon balance so dices also
brought<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.810> their<00:02:07.140> specialization<00:02:07.860> or<00:02:08.280> class

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
brought in their specialization or class

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.360 
brought in their specialization or class

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
customization system you have you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.580 
customization system you have you
or<00:02:11.659> your<00:02:12.659> perks<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.110> whatever<00:02:13.349> you<00:02:13.409> want<00:02:13.560> to

call them that allow you to enhance your
soldier<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.709> think<00:02:16.860> they've<00:02:17.220> actually

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459

also got rid of the ACOG scopes and the
red<00:02:40.829> dot<00:02:40.980> sight<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.400> you're<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.579> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.790> be

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
red dot sight so you're not going to be

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.180 
red dot sight so you're not going to be
able<00:02:41.879> to<00:02:42.209> actually<00:02:42.510> put<00:02:42.930> scopes<00:02:43.859> on<00:02:44.040> your

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
able to actually put scopes on your

weapons<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.700> only<00:02:45.030> weapons<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.420> believe<00:02:45.690> that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
weapons the only weapons I believe that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.300 
weapons the only weapons I believe that
actually<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.440> these<00:02:46.680> scopes<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.129> these

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
actually have these scopes are these

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.550 
actually have these scopes are these
sniper<00:02:47.549> rifles<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.540> if<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.930> don't<00:02:49.140> like<00:02:49.290> iron

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
sniper rifles so if you don't like iron

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.530 
sniper rifles so if you don't like iron
sights<00:02:49.829> then<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.459> game<00:02:50.849> may<00:02:51.060> not<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.329> for<00:02:51.480> you

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
sights then this game may not be for you

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.319 
sights then this game may not be for you
but<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:52.019> would<00:02:52.319> not<00:02:52.440> let<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.680> deter<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.040> from

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
but I would not let that deter you from

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.149 
but I would not let that deter you from
getting<00:02:54.329> this<00:02:54.420> game<00:02:54.629> because<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.950> iron

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
getting this game because all the iron

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.619 
getting this game because all the iron
sights<00:02:56.400> seem<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.760> very<00:02:56.790> manageable<00:02:57.329> and

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
sights seem to be very manageable and

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.750 
sights seem to be very manageable and
also<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.099> they<00:02:59.250> don't<00:02:59.340> really<00:02:59.579> get<00:02:59.670> in

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
also you know they don't really get in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.430 
also you know they don't really get in
the<00:02:59.819> way<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.659> least<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> my<00:03:01.049> opinion<00:03:01.140> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
the way so at least in my opinion the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.460 
the way so at least in my opinion the
iron<00:03:01.650> sights<00:03:01.799> are<00:03:02.010> pretty<00:03:02.700> snazzy<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:04.290> as<00:03:04.440> for

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
iron sights are pretty snazzy but as for

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.380 
iron sights are pretty snazzy but as for
the<00:03:04.769> graphics<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.340> game<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.909> know<00:03:06.209> I'm

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the graphics in this game I I know I'm

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.699 
the graphics in this game I I know I'm
kind<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.659> talking<00:03:06.840> fast<00:03:07.140> guys<00:03:07.319> but<00:03:07.590> that's

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
kind of talking fast guys but that's

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.050 
kind of talking fast guys but that's
just<00:03:07.799> because<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.159> don't<00:03:08.549> have<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.730> lot<00:03:09.030> of

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
just because I don't have a lot of

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.199 
just because I don't have a lot of
gameplay<00:03:09.480> left<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.769> as<00:03:10.980> as<00:03:11.549> for<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.819> graphics

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
gameplay left but as as for the graphics

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.520 
gameplay left but as as for the graphics
i<00:03:12.329> must<00:03:12.540> say<00:03:12.659> that<00:03:12.690> they<00:03:12.930> are<00:03:12.959> absolutely

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
i must say that they are absolutely

able<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.349> bog<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.680> down<00:03:52.739> because<00:03:53.129> there's

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
able to bog you down because there's

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.530 
able to bog you down because there's
just<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:53.730> many<00:03:53.819> different<00:03:53.940> ways<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.329> can

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
just so many different ways you can

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.900 
just so many different ways you can
actually<00:03:54.889> attack<00:03:55.889> a<00:03:56.099> certain<00:03:56.489> objective

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
actually attack a certain objective

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.640 
actually attack a certain objective
which<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.419> also<00:03:57.690> really<00:03:57.959> good<00:03:58.049> because<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.530> I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
which is also really good because I I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.309 
which is also really good because I I
just<00:03:59.160> hate<00:03:59.340> when<00:03:59.720> battles<00:04:00.720> get<00:04:00.959> bogged<00:04:01.169> down

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.930 
just hate when battles get bogged down
in<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.650> certain<00:04:01.829> place<00:04:02.129> where<00:04:02.519> it's<00:04:02.760> just

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
in a certain place where it's just

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.670 
in a certain place where it's just
people<00:04:03.419> throwing<00:04:03.780> grenades<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.530> forth

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680
