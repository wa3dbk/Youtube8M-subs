hey guys it's crypsis Aaron today I have
for<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.130> another<00:00:08.400> 14<00:00:08.910> WotC<00:00:09.690> snapshot

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
for you another 14 WotC snapshot

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.490 
for you another 14 WotC snapshot
tutorial<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> get<00:00:12.990> arrows

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
tutorial and that is how to get arrows

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
tutorial and that is how to get arrows
with<00:00:13.920> effect<00:00:14.429> on<00:00:14.610> them<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.940> basically<00:00:15.120> I've

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
with effect on them so basically I've

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
with effect on them so basically I've
come<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> system<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.460> allows<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
come up with a system that allows you to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
come up with a system that allows you to
shoot<00:00:18.750> an<00:00:18.869> arrow<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.289> then<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.590> will<00:00:19.710> do

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
shoot an arrow and then it will do

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.620 
shoot an arrow and then it will do
something<00:00:20.490> or<00:00:20.760> cause<00:00:21.180> something<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.600> happen

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
something or cause something to happen

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.950 
something or cause something to happen
wherever<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.199> Lance<00:00:22.699> so<00:00:23.699> there's<00:00:24.390> quite<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.810> few

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
wherever I Lance so there's quite a few

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
wherever I Lance so there's quite a few
practical<00:00:25.439> uses<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.630> some

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
practical uses for this you can do some

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
practical uses for this you can do some
things<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> adventure<00:00:28.619> maps<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.099> minigames

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
things in adventure maps or minigames

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.479 
things in adventure maps or minigames
and<00:00:29.609> stuff<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.050> useful<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and stuff so it is really useful so I

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.340 
and stuff so it is really useful so I
guess<00:00:32.790> I'll<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.090> show<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.170> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
guess I'll just show you that now so in

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.370 
guess I'll just show you that now so in
my<00:00:34.469> inventory<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.130> can<00:00:35.160> see<00:00:35.460> I've<00:00:35.610> got<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
my inventory you can see I've got a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
my inventory you can see I've got a
multi-purpose<00:00:37.380> bow<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> five<00:00:38.550> spawn<00:00:39.239> eggs

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
multi-purpose bow and five spawn eggs

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.910 
multi-purpose bow and five spawn eggs
one<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.809> called<00:00:40.020> regular<00:00:40.200> arrows<00:00:40.649> one

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
one is called regular arrows one

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.799 
one is called regular arrows one
explosive<00:00:41.370> arrows<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.239> his<00:00:42.360> chest<00:00:42.629> drop

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
explosive arrows when his chest drop

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.590 
explosive arrows when his chest drop
arrows<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.829> arrows<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.309> one<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.820> fire

arrows on is into arrows and one is fire

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.690 
arrows on is into arrows and one is fire
arrows<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:47.190> should<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.520> pretty

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
arrows so all those should be pretty

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
arrows so all those should be pretty
obvious<00:00:47.789> especially<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.170> explosive<00:00:49.710> arrow

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
obvious especially the explosive arrow

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.920 
obvious especially the explosive arrow
since<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> see<00:00:50.579> I've<00:00:51.120> used<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.660> quite<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
since you can see I've used that quite a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.459 
since you can see I've used that quite a
bit<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.390> I'm<00:00:54.390> gonna<00:00:54.510> just<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
bit here so I'm gonna just use that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.439 
bit here so I'm gonna just use that
spawn<00:00:55.829> egg<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> also<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.910> selected

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
spawn egg and also have selected

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.869 
spawn egg and also have selected
explosive<00:00:58.199> arrows<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
explosive arrows and then I can just

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
explosive arrows and then I can just
shoot<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.329> hair<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.719> wherever<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.170> lands<00:01:01.440> there

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you can do that now was one of the first

things<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.810> kind<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.200> popped<00:01:16.409> into<00:01:16.590> my<00:01:16.770> head

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
things that kind of popped into my head

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
things that kind of popped into my head
when<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> found<00:01:18.600> out<00:01:18.720> what<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
when I found out what you can do in the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.039 
when I found out what you can do in the
14<00:01:19.650> wo<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> see<00:01:20.610> snapshot<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.360> yeah<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
14 wo to see snapshot so yeah that is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
14 wo to see snapshot so yeah that is
very<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.500> cool<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.729> could<00:01:23.850> also<00:01:24.000> do

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
very very cool you could also do

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.200 
very very cool you could also do
something<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.659> chest<00:01:25.049> repairers<00:01:25.560> which<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
something like chest repairers which is

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.160 
something like chest repairers which is
basically<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.420> shoot<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> ground

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
basically you shoot out of the ground

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.530 
basically you shoot out of the ground
and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.759> takes<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.060> place<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then it just takes the place of the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
and then it just takes the place of the
error<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.229> some<00:01:32.159> supplies<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
error and it has some supplies in that

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
error and it has some supplies in that
so<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.630> know<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.770> do<00:01:34.860> those<00:01:34.979> some<00:01:35.310> sort

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
so I know you could do those some sort

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100 
so I know you could do those some sort
of<00:01:35.549> reward<00:01:35.759> system<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
of reward system or something in the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.210 
of reward system or something in the
venture<00:01:37.380> map<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> mini<00:01:38.070> game<00:01:40.040> now<00:01:41.040> we've

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
venture map or a mini game now we've

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
venture map or a mini game now we've
also<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.970> arrows<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.750> basically<00:01:43.200> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
also got in the arrows so basically you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
also got in the arrows so basically you
shoot<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> arrow<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.369> wherever<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> arrow

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
shoot the arrow and wherever the arrow

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.090 
shoot the arrow and wherever the arrow
lands<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> are<00:01:45.960> teleported<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
lands you are teleported and the are it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
lands you are teleported and the are it
was<00:01:47.250> killed<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> goes<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.840> these

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
was killed in that goes for all of these

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.580 
was killed in that goes for all of these
as<00:01:49.290> well<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> obviously<00:01:51.049> pretty<00:01:52.049> obvious<00:01:52.439> one

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
as well and obviously pretty obvious one

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
as well and obviously pretty obvious one
fires<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.970> could<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.540> errors<00:01:54.720> as

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
fires and or you could do what errors as

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.179 
fires and or you could do what errors as
well<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.229> basically<00:01:55.350> wherever<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.070> arrow

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
well but basically wherever the arrow

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.959 
well but basically wherever the arrow
lands<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.060> replaced<00:01:57.360> by<00:01:57.680> fire<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.100> how

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
lands it will be replaced by fire so how

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.580 
lands it will be replaced by fire so how
does<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> work<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.780> I'll<00:02:01.140> show<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
does this work well I'll show you in a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.740 
does this work well I'll show you in a
second<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.340> here's<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> system<00:02:03.030> here<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
second so here's a system here and you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.539 
second so here's a system here and you
can<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> complex<00:02:05.219> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
can see that it's not that complex so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.280 
can see that it's not that complex so
basically<00:02:05.850> what's<00:02:06.119> going<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.750> this

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
basically what's going on is this

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.990 
basically what's going on is this
faster<00:02:07.860> clapping<00:02:08.250> health<00:02:08.460> which<00:02:08.850> is

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
faster clapping health which is

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.070 
faster clapping health which is
constantly<00:02:09.420> powering<00:02:09.810> these<00:02:09.930> two

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
constantly powering these two

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.600 
constantly powering these two
Commandments<00:02:10.650> which<00:02:10.770> both<00:02:11.010> have<00:02:11.190> testable

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
Commandments which both have testable

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
Commandments which both have testable
commands<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.090> them<00:02:12.240> when<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> criteria<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
commands in them when the criteria of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.720 
commands in them when the criteria of
these<00:02:13.380> tests<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.680> commands<00:02:14.070> at<00:02:14.220> man<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.640> will

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
these tests for commands at man it will

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.670 
these tests for commands at man it will
heal<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.600> activate<00:02:15.930> our<00:02:16.080> clock<00:02:16.320> on<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
heal it will activate our clock on the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.160 
heal it will activate our clock on the
other<00:02:16.920> side<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> side<00:02:18.630> which<00:02:18.870> does

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
other side this is the side which does

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.810 
other side this is the side which does
the<00:02:19.350> Eric<00:02:19.620> selection<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.700> one

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the Eric selection and this is the one

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.910 
the Eric selection and this is the one
which<00:02:20.970> actually<00:02:21.450> does<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> air<00:02:21.900> effect<00:02:22.320> so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
which actually does the air effect so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860 
which actually does the air effect so
I'm<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.880> by<00:02:24.210> showing<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
I'm going to start by showing you the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.750 
I'm going to start by showing you the
our<00:02:25.020> selection<00:02:25.560> side<00:02:25.770> that<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.070> se<00:02:26.340> easier

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
our selection side that is se easier

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.660 
our selection side that is se easier
side<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.720> this<00:02:28.260> man<00:02:28.560> book<00:02:28.800> has<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> command

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
side so this man book has a command

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.520 
side so this man book has a command
which<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.820> test<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:30.420> nearest<00:02:30.870> planets<00:02:31.200> core

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
which is test for nearest planets core

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.630 
which is test for nearest planets core
egman<00:02:32.070> equals<00:02:32.430> 1<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.770> basically<00:02:34.770> are<00:02:35.070> using

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
egman equals 1 so basically are using

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.300 
egman equals 1 so basically are using
the<00:02:35.730> 1.7<00:02:36.480> scoreboard<00:02:37.050> criteria<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.890> creating

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the 1.7 scoreboard criteria of creating

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.610 
the 1.7 scoreboard criteria of creating
the<00:02:38.370> objective<00:02:38.790> which<00:02:39.090> goes<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.840> by<00:02:39.990> 1<00:02:40.410> every

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
the objective which goes up by 1 every

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.950 
the objective which goes up by 1 every
time<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.070> use<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> spawn<00:02:41.760> ink<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.300> then

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
time you use a spawn ink and then

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.630 
time you use a spawn ink and then
that'll<00:02:43.320> activate<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.860> clock<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
that'll activate this clock and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.490 
that'll activate this clock and
basically<00:02:45.390> what<00:02:45.600> these<00:02:45.750> tests<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.230> commands

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
basically what these tests for commands

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
basically what these tests for commands
do<00:02:46.680> is<00:02:46.860> test<00:02:47.460> for<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.850> nearest<00:02:48.090> planet<00:02:48.270> with

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
do is test for the nearest planet with

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.470 
do is test for the nearest planet with
selected<00:02:49.410> items<00:02:49.770> slot<00:02:50.100> 1<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.420> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
selected items slot 1 so that's going to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.470 
selected items slot 1 so that's going to
be<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.520> hot<00:02:53.520> bar<00:02:53.730> slot<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.180> I've<00:02:54.300> got

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
be the hot bar slot that I've got

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.840 
be the hot bar slot that I've got
selected<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.200> present<00:02:55.620> time<00:02:55.710> or<00:02:56.460> at<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
selected at the present time or at the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.949 
selected at the present time or at the
time<00:02:57.060> when<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:58.190> activated<00:02:59.190> so<00:02:59.910> as<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
time when this is activated so as you

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.500 
time when this is activated so as you
can<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:02.100> I<00:03:02.280> had<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> first<00:03:02.730> one<00:03:02.880> activated

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
can see if I had the first one activated

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.230 
can see if I had the first one activated
gonna<00:03:04.290> activate<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:06.120> to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
gonna activate this one I just have to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.030 
gonna activate this one I just have to
right-click<00:03:06.510> on<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.900> ground<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:07.860> I've

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
right-click on the ground and if I've

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280 
right-click on the ground and if I've
got<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.400> slot<00:03:08.730> selected<00:03:09.240> at<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.600> time<00:03:09.810> when

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
got this slot selected at the time when

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890 
got this slot selected at the time when
this<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.770> powered<00:03:11.480> then<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.630> will<00:03:12.720> go<00:03:12.840> through

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
this is powered then it will go through

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.960 
this is powered then it will go through
this<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.590> had<00:03:13.770> this<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.190> selected<00:03:14.610> this

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
this one if I had this one selected this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150 
this one if I had this one selected this
would<00:03:15.239> happen<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.810> would<00:03:16.050> activate<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.130> like

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
would happen this would activate it like

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.570 
would happen this would activate it like
that<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:19.080> happens<00:03:19.410> after<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.130> goes

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
that but what happens after it goes

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.340 
that but what happens after it goes
through<00:03:20.820> this<00:03:20.910> carburetor<00:03:21.330> well<00:03:21.810> as<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.170> can

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
through this carburetor well as you can

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.670 
through this carburetor well as you can
see<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:23.489> has<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> say<00:03:24.690> command<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.230> each<00:03:25.530> of

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
see it has a say command on each of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.810 
see it has a say command on each of
these<00:03:25.800> which<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.250> say<00:03:26.430> you've<00:03:26.640> selected

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
these which is say you've selected

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.570 
these which is say you've selected
regular<00:03:27.510> or<00:03:27.750> explosive<00:03:28.320> before<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:29.160> know<00:03:29.310> and

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
regular or explosive before you know and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.949 
regular or explosive before you know and
hours<00:03:30.860> then<00:03:31.860> also<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.360> bottom<00:03:33.600> here<00:03:33.780> we've

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
hours then also on the bottom here we've

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.600 
hours then also on the bottom here we've
got<00:03:34.110> school<00:03:34.500> board<00:03:34.680> player<00:03:34.860> set<00:03:35.160> nurse<00:03:35.340> plan

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
got school board player set nurse plan

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.030 
got school board player set nurse plan
egg<00:03:35.880> zero<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.810> it'll<00:03:36.989> set<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.290> score<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.800> egg

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
egg zero so it'll set the score of egg

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.280 
egg zero so it'll set the score of egg
to<00:03:38.310> zero<00:03:38.550> and<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.030> clock<00:03:39.269> will<00:03:39.480> turn<00:03:39.690> off<00:03:39.900> I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
to zero and this clock will turn off I

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.420 
to zero and this clock will turn off I
just<00:03:40.920> get<00:03:41.040> some<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> up<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.250> we've

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
just get some of that and up here we've

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.340 
just get some of that and up here we've
got<00:03:44.550> scoreboard<00:03:45.030> player<00:03:45.300> set<00:03:45.600> nearest<00:03:45.989> by<00:03:46.140> our

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
got scoreboard player set nearest by our

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.199 
got scoreboard player set nearest by our
time<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.860> zero<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.400> then<00:03:47.580> we've<00:03:47.760> got<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
time to zero and then we've got you

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.850 
time to zero and then we've got you
could<00:03:48.390> have<00:03:48.570> one<00:03:48.840> two<00:03:49.519> three<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.790> four<00:03:51.860> so

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
could have one two three and four so

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.560 
could have one two three and four so
zero<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.489> real<00:03:53.610> air<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.000> one<00:03:54.239> explosive

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
zero is for real air is one explosive

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.509 
zero is for real air is one explosive
j3ster<00:03:55.440> up<00:03:55.650> three<00:03:55.940> endo<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:56.970> four<00:03:57.480> for<00:03:58.140> fire

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
j3ster up three endo and four for fire

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.420 
j3ster up three endo and four for fire
so<00:03:59.519> that's<00:04:00.180> all<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.720> this<00:04:01.290> sign<00:04:01.950> has<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.190> do

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
so that's all the this sign has to do

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.370 
so that's all the this sign has to do
then<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.330> side<00:04:03.390> we<00:04:03.540> recommend<00:04:04.140> okay

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
then on this side we recommend okay

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.530 
then on this side we recommend okay
which<00:04:04.560> has<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.739> test<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.430> command<00:04:06.330> which<00:04:06.510> is

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
which has a test for command which is

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.160 
which has a test for command which is
test<00:04:06.930> for<00:04:07.050> @e<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.400> testing<00:04:09.239> for<00:04:09.390> an<00:04:09.450> entry<00:04:09.840> type

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
test for @e so testing for an entry type

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.160 
test for @e so testing for an entry type
equals<00:04:10.620> error<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.580> ground<00:04:11.850> eight<00:04:12.090> is<00:04:12.750> one

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
equals error and in ground eight is one

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.309 
equals error and in ground eight is one
be

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
be

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.409 
be
obviously<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.189> bee<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.730> needed<00:04:16.060> because<00:04:16.180> it

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
obviously the bee is needed because it

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.599 
obviously the bee is needed because it
is<00:04:16.510> abiding<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.019> there's<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.380> bug<00:04:18.190> right<00:04:18.220> now

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
is abiding and there's a bug right now

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.710 
is abiding and there's a bug right now
that<00:04:19.199> makes<00:04:20.199> you<00:04:20.350> have<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:20.769> yeah<00:04:21.720> lettuce

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
that makes you have to put yeah lettuce

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.600 
that makes you have to put yeah lettuce
you<00:04:22.750> know<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.800> probably<00:04:24.070> know<00:04:24.220> about<00:04:24.460> that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
you know you probably know about that

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.760 
you know you probably know about that
already<00:04:24.669> so<00:04:25.419> then<00:04:25.630> that<00:04:26.199> activates<00:04:26.590> this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
already so then that activates this

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.010 
already so then that activates this
clock<00:04:27.040> which<00:04:27.280> activates<00:04:27.790> these<00:04:28.300> four<00:04:28.690> command

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
clock which activates these four command

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.129 
clock which activates these four command
blocks<00:04:29.199> which<00:04:29.380> all<00:04:29.530> have<00:04:29.710> testable<00:04:30.370> commands

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
blocks which all have testable commands

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.029 
blocks which all have testable commands
so<00:04:32.139> I'm<00:04:32.229> just<00:04:32.470> going<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.650> show<00:04:32.800> you<00:04:32.860> the

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
so I'm just going to show you the

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.370 
so I'm just going to show you the
explosive<00:04:33.669> errors<00:04:33.940> as<00:04:34.150> an<00:04:34.300> example<00:04:34.630> it's<00:04:35.289> all

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
explosive errors as an example it's all

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.920 
explosive errors as an example it's all
ready<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.530> go<00:04:35.590> those<00:04:35.800> selected<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:37.210> basically

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
ready to go those selected so basically

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.689 
ready to go those selected so basically
what<00:04:38.110> happens<00:04:38.410> is<00:04:38.590> once<00:04:38.919> the<00:04:39.039> criteria<00:04:39.580> is<00:04:39.639> met

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
what happens is once the criteria is met

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.520 
what happens is once the criteria is met
which<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> test<00:04:40.720> for<00:04:40.870> nearest<00:04:41.199> player<00:04:41.350> with

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
which is a test for nearest player with

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.379 
which is a test for nearest player with
score<00:04:41.800> arrow<00:04:42.010> type<00:04:42.280> minimum<00:04:42.789> equals<00:04:43.120> at<00:04:43.240> one

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
score arrow type minimum equals at one

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.430 
score arrow type minimum equals at one
and<00:04:43.660> score<00:04:43.930> arrow<00:04:44.139> type<00:04:44.380> one<00:04:46.139> will<00:04:47.139> activate

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
and score arrow type one will activate

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.110 
and score arrow type one will activate
this<00:04:47.590> comparator<00:04:48.100> which<00:04:48.220> shows<00:04:48.400> into<00:04:48.760> this

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
this comparator which shows into this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.270 
this comparator which shows into this
command<00:04:49.449> book<00:04:49.570> which<00:04:49.750> summons<00:04:50.050> primed<00:04:50.590> TNT<00:04:51.130> is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
command book which summons primed TNT is

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.760 
command book which summons primed TNT is
75<00:04:51.789> blocks<00:04:52.000> up<00:04:52.300> with<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.449> fuse<00:04:52.750> of<00:04:52.960> zero<00:04:53.440> and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
75 blocks up with a fuse of zero and

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.250 
75 blocks up with a fuse of zero and
then<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:54.880> the<00:04:55.000> same<00:04:55.180> tick<00:04:55.479> but<00:04:55.780> just<00:04:56.020> slightly

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
then in the same tick but just slightly

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.950 
then in the same tick but just slightly
after<00:04:56.740> not<00:04:57.340> sure<00:04:57.520> why<00:04:57.699> but<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.300> command<00:04:58.810> book

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
after not sure why but this command book

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.980 
after not sure why but this command book
will<00:04:59.139> teleport<00:04:59.830> that<00:05:00.330> that<00:05:01.330> prime<00:05:01.570> Chanti

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
will teleport that that prime Chanti

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.580 
will teleport that that prime Chanti
that<00:05:02.139> I<00:05:02.169> just<00:05:02.410> summoned<00:05:02.770> to<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:04.590> youngest

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
that I just summoned to the youngest

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.050 
that I just summoned to the youngest
error<00:05:05.889> so<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.460> latest<00:05:06.729> arrow<00:05:06.940> fires<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:09.430> that

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
error so the latest arrow fires and that

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.360 
error so the latest arrow fires and that
will<00:05:10.210> just<00:05:10.389> blow<00:05:10.510> up<00:05:10.750> and<00:05:10.990> then<00:05:11.110> this<00:05:11.979> repeater

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
will just blow up and then this repeater

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.510 
will just blow up and then this repeater
powers<00:05:12.760> these<00:05:13.590> sorry<00:05:14.590> then<00:05:14.919> this<00:05:15.130> repeater

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
powers these sorry then this repeater

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.779 
powers these sorry then this repeater
now<00:05:16.060> as<00:05:16.210> these<00:05:16.389> which<00:05:16.780> does<00:05:17.229> kill<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.250> error

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
now as these which does kill the error

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.770 
now as these which does kill the error
and<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:20.229> changes<00:05:20.889> the<00:05:21.039> block<00:05:21.280> data<00:05:21.550> of<00:05:21.849> this<00:05:22.360> to

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
and it changes the block data of this to

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.500 
and it changes the block data of this to
success<00:05:23.560> count<00:05:23.800> zero<00:05:24.220> which<00:05:24.669> turns<00:05:25.180> off<00:05:25.330> this

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
success count zero which turns off this

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.089 
success count zero which turns off this

you<00:05:56.919> can<00:05:57.070> see<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:57.310> because<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:59.349> chest

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
you can see that because the chest

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.250 
you can see that because the chest
spawns<00:06:00.070> underneath<00:06:00.550> this<00:06:00.789> so<00:06:01.300> if<00:06:01.900> I<00:06:02.050> show<00:06:02.229> you

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
spawns underneath this so if I show you

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.320 
spawns underneath this so if I show you
that

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.550 

one<00:06:06.330> spawns<00:06:06.870> down<00:06:07.139> there

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
one spawns down there

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.540 
one spawns down there
sorry<00:06:09.259> one<00:06:10.259> goes<00:06:10.440> there<00:06:10.590> but<00:06:10.740> one<00:06:10.889> also<00:06:11.099> spawns

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
sorry one goes there but one also spawns

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.300 
sorry one goes there but one also spawns
down<00:06:11.849> there<00:06:12.240> and<00:06:12.539> then<00:06:12.870> it<00:06:13.470> suddenly<00:06:13.650> gets

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
down there and then it suddenly gets

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.210 
down there and then it suddenly gets
broken<00:06:14.810> so<00:06:15.810> this<00:06:16.080> has<00:06:16.229> been<00:06:16.349> a<00:06:16.500> sort<00:06:17.039> of<00:06:17.099> a

broken so this has been a sort of a

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.529 
broken so this has been a sort of a
