00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.680 
pretty cool-looking music and I think he
looks<00:04:19.039> like<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.310> good<00:04:19.519> minecraft<00:04:20.030> dragon<00:04:20.539> and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
he fits pretty well I think you know

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
they're pretty rare spawning it drops

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.529 
they're pretty rare spawning it drops
right<00:04:27.110> now<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.530> supposed<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.800> be<00:04:28.300> our<00:04:29.300> just

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
right now is supposed to be our just

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.879 
right now is supposed to be our just
loud<00:04:29.690> there<00:04:29.870> but<00:04:30.080> they're<00:04:30.320> supposed<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.770> get

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
loud there but they're supposed to get

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.500 
loud there but they're supposed to get
better<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.280> think<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.639> might<00:04:31.760> drop<00:04:32.000> diamond

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
better I think it might drop diamond

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.960 
better I think it might drop diamond
actually<00:04:33.039> which<00:04:34.039> i<00:04:34.220> think<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.550> pretty

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
actually which i think is pretty

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.080 
actually which i think is pretty
appropriate<00:04:35.419> for<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.110> dragon<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.430> it's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
appropriate for a dragon and it's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.930 
appropriate for a dragon and it's
supposed<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.389> be<00:04:38.570> rare<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.410> they<00:04:40.250> shoot<00:04:40.520> fire

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
supposed to be rare and they shoot fire

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.460 
supposed to be rare and they shoot fire
at<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.639> well<00:04:43.639> each<00:04:44.030> fire<00:04:44.510> has<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.050> chance

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
at you and well each fire has a chance

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.770 
at you and well each fire has a chance
of<00:04:45.590> exploding<00:04:46.220> as<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.460> one<00:04:46.729> out<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.030> 50<00:04:47.479> chance

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
of exploding as a one out of 50 chance

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.820 
of exploding as a one out of 50 chance
so<00:04:48.139> it's<00:04:48.289> not<00:04:48.440> ridiculous<00:04:49.210> but<00:04:50.210> is<00:04:50.419> a<00:04:50.450> chance

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
so it's not ridiculous but is a chance

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.200 
so it's not ridiculous but is a chance
and<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.979> can<00:04:53.099> explode<00:04:55.250> pretty<00:04:56.250> cool<00:04:56.639> my<00:04:56.819> guys
