didn't know if it was a well if it was

from sympathic comm you can see that the

only 31 bullets in the magazine which is

only 31 bullets in the magazine which is
hard<00:01:36.830> when<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.340> l86a2<00:01:38.150> had<00:01:38.540> 40<00:01:38.870> bullets<00:01:39.050> back

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.950 
hard when the l86a2 had 40 bullets back
in<00:01:39.680> battlefield<00:01:40.130> 3<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:41.510> will<00:01:41.750> have

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
in battlefield 3 and I will have

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.240 
in battlefield 3 and I will have
preferred<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.830> same<00:01:43.010> in

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
preferred it to be the same in

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.370 
preferred it to be the same in
battlefield<00:01:43.640> 4<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.060> don't<00:01:44.450> know<00:01:44.540> why<00:01:44.690> I<00:01:44.720> sided

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
battlefield 4 I don't know why I sided

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.830 
battlefield 4 I don't know why I sided
to<00:01:45.470> change<00:01:45.680> that<00:01:45.950> but<00:01:46.300> that's<00:01:47.300> just<00:01:47.510> how<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.750> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
to change that but that's just how it is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.230 
to change that but that's just how it is
I<00:01:48.020> guess<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:49.070> recoil<00:01:49.460> pattern<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.120> other

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I guess the recoil pattern on the other

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.330 
I guess the recoil pattern on the other
hand<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.570> actually<00:01:50.990> quite<00:01:51.200> good<00:01:51.230> and<00:01:51.650> easy<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
hand is actually quite good and easy to

and<00:02:28.609> while<00:02:29.299> moving<00:02:29.719> as<00:02:29.840> well<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.469> that's<00:02:30.650> what

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
and while moving as well so that's what

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.500 
and while moving as well so that's what
I<00:02:30.859> decided<00:02:31.219> to<00:02:31.340> customize<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:31.939> for<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
I decided to customize it for so I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.509 
I decided to customize it for so I
slapped<00:02:32.780> an<00:02:33.019> ergot<00:02:33.409> rebounded<00:02:33.859> and<00:02:33.980> that's

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
slapped an ergot rebounded and that's

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.099 
slapped an ergot rebounded and that's
because<00:02:34.969> they<00:02:35.090> tend<00:02:35.299> to<00:02:35.359> move<00:02:35.540> around<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.959> lot

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
because they tend to move around a lot

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.080 
because they tend to move around a lot
when<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.319> fire<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.129> when<00:02:37.310> I'm<00:02:37.430> up<00:02:37.549> close<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.969> the

positive<00:02:40.549> aspect<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:42.349> you're<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> type

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:42.889

to<00:02:43.040> stand<00:02:43.280> still<00:02:43.459> then<00:02:43.639> go<00:02:43.819> with<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.030> stubby

to stand still then go with the stubby
grip<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.870> that's<00:02:45.349> really<00:02:45.620> for<00:02:45.950> customizing

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
grip and that's really for customizing

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.429 
grip and that's really for customizing
the<00:02:46.669> weapon<00:02:46.999> besides<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.719> red<00:02:47.870> dot<00:02:48.049> side<00:02:48.290> of

more<00:03:14.930> or<00:03:14.989> less<00:03:15.019> an<00:03:15.319> assault<00:03:15.739> rifle<00:03:15.799> but<00:03:16.400> for

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
more or less an assault rifle but for

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.670 
more or less an assault rifle but for

the support cast of course but narrowly
I<00:03:18.799> prefer<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.489> m249<00:03:20.480> because<00:03:21.169> it's<00:03:21.439> really

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
even running and gunning you're gonna be

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.180 
even running and gunning you're gonna be
doing<00:05:17.180> well<00:05:17.390> with<00:05:17.570> it<00:05:17.720> it's<00:05:18.080> easy<00:05:18.350> to<00:05:18.620> use<00:05:18.830> and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
doing well with it it's easy to use and

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.160 
doing well with it it's easy to use and
adds<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.940> broad<00:05:20.210> variety<00:05:20.360> of<00:05:20.810> range

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
adds a broad variety of range

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.650 
adds a broad variety of range
engagements<00:05:21.410> and<00:05:21.950> tactics<00:05:22.550> just<00:05:22.760> make<00:05:23.450> sure

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
engagements and tactics just make sure

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.930 
engagements and tactics just make sure
always<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.200> reload<00:05:24.560> with<00:05:24.890> one<00:05:25.100> bullet<00:05:25.340> left<00:05:25.580> in

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
always to reload with one bullet left in

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.260 
always to reload with one bullet left in
a<00:05:26.060> Mac<00:05:26.240> I<00:05:27.040> think<00:05:28.040> that<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.340> reload<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:28.940> a<00:05:29.000> bit

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
a Mac I think that the reload is a bit

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.790 
a Mac I think that the reload is a bit
too<00:05:29.480> long<00:05:29.660> for<00:05:29.720> this<00:05:29.900> weapon<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.410> be<00:05:30.530> honest

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
too long for this weapon to be honest

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.860 
too long for this weapon to be honest
but<00:05:31.010> if<00:05:31.670> it<00:05:31.970> would<00:05:32.150> have<00:05:32.270> been<00:05:32.300> sure<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:32.810> the

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
but if it would have been sure that the

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.720 
but if it would have been sure that the
name<00:05:33.020> would<00:05:33.140> be<00:05:33.350> okay<00:05:33.830> when<00:05:34.250> you<00:05:34.340> think<00:05:34.550> about

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
name would be okay when you think about

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.640 
name would be okay when you think about
the<00:05:34.970> amount<00:05:35.330> of<00:05:35.510> bullets<00:05:35.870> in<00:05:36.260> the<00:05:36.620> magazine

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
the amount of bullets in the magazine

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.550 
the amount of bullets in the magazine
but<00:05:37.310> with<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.270> long<00:05:38.540> reload<00:05:38.840> like<00:05:39.050> this<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.380> would

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
but with a long reload like this I would

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.860 
but with a long reload like this I would
have<00:05:39.650> preferred<00:05:39.980> it<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.130> be<00:05:40.460> 40<00:05:41.000> or<00:05:41.030> 60<00:05:41.390> bullets

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
have preferred it to be 40 or 60 bullets

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.130 
have preferred it to be 40 or 60 bullets
in<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.080> magazine<00:05:42.130> is<00:05:43.130> Lee<00:05:43.310> so<00:05:44.210> yeah<00:05:44.780> that's

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140
