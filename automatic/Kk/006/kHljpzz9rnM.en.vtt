00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello I am clearly and will be if the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.400
 original sogeres and today I'm going 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.630
 explain to you the different points of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.340
 bodywork that must be looked at on the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.990
 vehicle have at first this 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.199
 that we are looking at the general aspect of 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.650
 vehicle whose bodywork to have 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.090
 like small scratches with small bumps 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 when we want to look at ourselves and the weft 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.230
 but it is to position oneself along 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.189
 see along the vehicle see if she 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.320
 is small bump or elbows for 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.820
 do this stuff then this 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.920
 that we have to try to identify these if 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.739
 some elements was repainted so we 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.250
 can spot them by looking at the level 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.020
 joints 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 much more most of the time because when 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.290
 she goes back to painting in bodywork 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.300
 the kind of things the joints are the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.710
 most of the time pretty badly hidden and we 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.760
 can spot joints with a little bit of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.190
 painting which means that the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 elements were europe 1 what we can 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 also spot these if there are any 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.740
 differences in alignment between 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.340
 elements what can 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.940
 to mean mild is changed 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.550
 may be badly repositioned either 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.350
 it was repaired and poorly repaired if 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.730
 has small bumps if there are small 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 bumps or that kind of things it can 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.470
 mean a lot of things the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.210
 most of the time it's the shots 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.500
 door 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.170
 after that can go a little bit more 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.300
 far away if at big sinkings big 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.760
 big shift that can say that the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.230
 vehicle was shocked in which case must 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.670
 really really really do 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.490
 attention to what you can also 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.900
 check that's all that is joins 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.100
 at the door level so all the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.210
 small seal that are here on this 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.440
 vehicle what is it particular 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 it's a coupÃ© that does not have my time 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.340
 here otherwise it causes a sound 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.540
 in the water with the road speed 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.040
 especially on the highway 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.410
 you will hear whistles with 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.660
 which are very unpleasant it is also 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:43.010
 it can also be a way to see that 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.990
 the vehicle was rolled in Swiss he 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.260
 try to spot these splinters 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.310
 on windshields the small impacts to 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.140
 know that when it's in the field of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.400
 vision can not be repaired there 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.750
 must change the windshield immediately 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.289
 it's the loire to do if it's the little ones 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.300
 impacts 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.950
 most of the time can fix them 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.539
 must also spot the attacks on 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.890
 on the lights the lighthouses siassia the 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.210
 small tits paca most of the time 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.560
 can be taken care of by the insurance 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.060
 in the case of an ice break then 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.690
 then you have to check it's the state 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.910
 tires 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.140
 because it's parts that cost 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.590
 relatively expensive depending on the types of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 vehicles 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.100
 so how to control a tire whose 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.360
 we're going around the wheels really 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.560
 outside left side to right side 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.660
 no matter 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.010
 and we look at the wear indicators 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.720
 you have them here you have them pretty much 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.040
 close every 20 to 30 cm you have some 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.690
 little witness between the bands of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.670
 rolling and if the tread 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.030
 reached the witness is that the tire and has 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.390
 exchange 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.330
 in general when there are only 2 left 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.069
 mm 3 mm we consider that the tires are 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.140
 to change the discs very soon 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.490
 brake to control them it takes 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.290
 absolutely the vehicle is cold 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.580
 that it is not rolled that it is a piece 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.240
 who heats up a lot and silently 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.670
 burn your fingers 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.830
 so to control we pass the finger the 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.260
 along the disc up to the top 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.540
 and you have all the supervision of the 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.040
 disc that protects if there is no 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.720
 difference if it's completely smooth 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.180
 it is that the disc is in very good condition 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.130
 if it starts to hang on the taste 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.590
 on the end of 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.080
 10 at the encirclement level he's going 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.090
 have to think about changing the disc you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.950
 also have the brake pads on 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.120
 can do a visual check for the 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.380
 see that they do not reach the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640
 scrap when one is scrapped there 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.920
 it's like you have to change must 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.400
 change the brake pads at 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.400
 see you again and see you soon
