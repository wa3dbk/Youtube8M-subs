00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
don't know anyway so let's look what

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
don't know anyway so let's look what
I've<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.559> using<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> em1

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I've got here so I'm using the em1

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.209 
I've got here so I'm using the em1
quantum<00:00:51.149> now<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> quantum<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
quantum now the quantum that was just a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
quantum now the quantum that was just a
bonus<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.360> gave<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
bonus that they gave out all the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
bonus that they gave out all the
pre-orders<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.190> think<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.550> part<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> day<00:00:57.539> 0

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
pre-orders I think a part of the day 0

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.979 
pre-orders I think a part of the day 0
package<00:00:58.850> there's<00:00:59.850> really<00:01:00.180> no<00:01:00.449> difference<00:01:00.480> if

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
package there's really no difference if

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.510 
package there's really no difference if
there<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> difference<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.340> no<00:01:02.489> idea

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
there is a difference I have no idea

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.369 
there is a difference I have no idea
what<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> color

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
what it is I think it's just the color

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.020 
what it is I think it's just the color
on<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:05.670> e-m1<00:01:06.060> i<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.650> quick-draw<00:01:08.159> not<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
on this e-m1 i have the quick-draw not a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
on this e-m1 i have the quick-draw not a
quick-draw<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.720> allows<00:01:09.990> me<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.439> hold<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.950> gun

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
quick-draw just allows me to hold a gun

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
quick-draw just allows me to hold a gun
up<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:12.090> faster<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.930> click<00:01:13.530> someone<00:01:13.830> out<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
up a lot faster and click someone out of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
up a lot faster and click someone out of
the<00:01:14.040> game<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.460> lot<00:01:14.760> faster<00:01:15.299> no<00:01:16.259> secondary

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the game a lot faster no secondary

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530 
the game a lot faster no secondary
weapon<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.280> reason<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
weapon the reason why I don't have a

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320 
weapon the reason why I don't have a
secondary<00:01:19.049> weapon<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.670> because<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.000> em1

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
secondary weapon is because the em1

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.499 
secondary weapon is because the em1
never<00:01:22.320> runs<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> ammo<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
never runs out of ammo it's just

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.240 
never runs out of ammo it's just
constant<00:01:24.990> energy<00:01:25.409> running<00:01:25.860> through<00:01:25.979> this

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
constant energy running through this

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.289 
constant energy running through this
thing<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.759> does<00:01:27.030> overheat<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.460> kill

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
thing it does overheat but I can kill

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
thing it does overheat but I can kill
four<00:01:30.600> people<00:01:30.630> before<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.560> ever<00:01:31.680> overheats

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.720 

as<00:01:35.910> far<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.510> perks<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:37.130> perkone<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.400> got

as far as the perks go perkone I got

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.440 
as far as the perks go perkone I got
lightly<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.260> to<00:01:40.830> move<00:01:41.040> faster<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lightly this is just to move faster you

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.200 
lightly this is just to move faster you
know<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.670> mix<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.820> gives<00:01:45.030> me<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
know it's it's a mix it gives me a

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.630 
know it's it's a mix it gives me a
lighter<00:01:45.479> load<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.080> i<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.410> run<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.460> map

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
lighter load so i can run around the map

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.540 
lighter load so i can run around the map
longer<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.510> faster<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.190> moving

XO ability I've got XO hover this it's
all<00:02:52.780> personal<00:02:53.050> preference<00:02:53.530> i<00:02:53.920> think<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> EXO

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
all personal preference i think the EXO

abilities and the XO launchers are all
personal<00:02:56.530> preference<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:57.190> I<00:02:57.730> probably<00:02:58.210> change

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
personal preference I I probably change

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.040 
personal preference I I probably change
both<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.710> those<00:02:59.970> every<00:03:00.970> match<00:03:01.390> every<00:03:01.930> other

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
both of those every match every other

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.440 
both of those every match every other
match<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:03.370> hover<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.700> kind<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.000> cool<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.210> was

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
match the hover is kind of cool I was

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.810 
match the hover is kind of cool I was
just<00:03:04.510> testing<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.200> out<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.710> like<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.790> lot

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
just testing it out I like it a lot

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.890 
just testing it out I like it a lot
actually<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:08.640> would<00:03:09.640> say<00:03:09.820> my<00:03:10.030> favorite<00:03:10.450> one<00:03:10.630> so

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
actually I would say my favorite one so

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.220 
actually I would say my favorite one so
far<00:03:11.110> is<00:03:11.590> either<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.040> shield<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.990> coats

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
far is either the shield the coats

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.320 
far is either the shield the coats
really<00:03:14.590> cool<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.100> once<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.700> fire<00:03:15.910> your<00:03:15.940> gun

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
really cool but once you fire your gun

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.690 
really cool but once you fire your gun
it<00:03:16.510> shuts<00:03:16.720> off<00:03:17.310> hovers<00:03:18.310> cool<00:03:18.520> though

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
it shuts off hovers cool though

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.090 
it shuts off hovers cool though
especially<00:03:18.940> with<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.420> quantum<00:03:19.630> because<00:03:20.260> you

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
especially with the quantum because you

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.890 
especially with the quantum because you
can<00:03:21.250> hover<00:03:21.459> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.700> air<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.540> can<00:03:22.690> take<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
can hover in the air and you can take a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
can hover in the air and you can take a
couple<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.350> people<00:03:23.650> out<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:23.830> mean<00:03:24.190> especially

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
couple of people out I mean especially

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.250 
couple of people out I mean especially
if<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.820> jump<00:03:25.060> off<00:03:25.209> something<00:03:25.480> really<00:03:25.930> high<00:03:26.080> in

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
if you jump off something really high in

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.540 
if you jump off something really high in
your<00:03:26.290> hovering<00:03:26.620> really<00:03:27.130> really<00:03:27.459> high<00:03:27.640> up<00:03:27.670> here

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
your hovering really really high up here

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.000 
your hovering really really high up here
as<00:03:30.550> far<00:03:30.880> as<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.600> XO<00:03:31.900> launcher<00:03:32.320> right<00:03:32.650> now<00:03:32.830> I've
