00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.849
 every 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.070
 it was time 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:13.110
 Herrera Sierra This was him it was year by the way 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.719
 a mobile 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.769
 an outcome until they die 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.759
 all right 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.079
 between four walls 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.079
 is he the the perfect laboratory now they investigate 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.140
 He expressed that within us that perfect machine 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.440
 because it works as an official 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.150
 that is the first motivation 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.260
 He assured that ee uu 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.750
 for almost all of us who dedicate ourselves to this of medicine and surgery uu 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.990
 the surgery guided by the image 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.920
 what is an intellectual revolution 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.510
 in the search for less invasive and less aggressive treatment methods 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.740
 of surgical pathologies 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
 Surgical therapy surgery has always been based 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.620
 and the need to create 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.130
 large incisions that is a pressure 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.360
 to the organism 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.620
 that made 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.920
 that patients had complications as a consequence their 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.130
 of the aggression that involves cutting the tissues 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.880
 we have another media 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.980
 today 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.950
 we can 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.460
 through the tissues 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.140
 what happens is that she is not yet aware 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.510
 the vision that would be the relationship 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.440
 with fixing energy that would be traditional surgery 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.900
 sas the vision 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.190
 perform surgical procedures 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 without invading the patient 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 until now fundamentally radiological and measurement techniques 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.350
 creation 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.220
 used for the part 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.400
 preoperative 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.930
 to identify injuries 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.400
 before operating 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.610
 image-guided surgery we not only have models 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.190
 preoperative that let us know 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.750
 is not the injury but during the same surgical act we are 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 sending 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.069
 in the clinical hospital san carlos surgery service 1 this hospital 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.309
 early 90s 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.499
 we made a pioneering center in the introduction of surgery 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:19.719
 laparoscopic 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.589
 at the national level 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.899
 There are different techniques to be able to visually access areas that do not 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.049
 other hikes 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.749
 with the laparoscopic technique you can access to take it 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:33.209
 between viral load 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.449
 that exceeds in two dimensions on the screen 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.809
 from three dimensions as we are used to and movements are 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.879
 inverses if I under the hand 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.839
 the super track 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.219
 if his aft 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.559
 However, this 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:51.009
 is edited using the da vinci robbery system 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.729
 with the da vinci system that is a telemarketer 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.859
 manipulating statistics 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.859
 very complex movements are executed 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.510
 what we can do now is little compared to what we can think of 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.589
 the future 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 that's what we're in a scenario 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.049
 there are probably few people who are willing 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.229
 the greatest human suffering that the hospital 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.569
 i that's an emotional charge 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.919
 the same business body 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.149
 the support of the hobby to the ex-hundred hundred percent sure and we are continuously 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.789
 more experimental news 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.929
 in need a week ago the insecurity 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.869
 the knowledge that we have 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.569
 you feel nothing 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.569
 to the objectives of the organization 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.629
 run 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.049
