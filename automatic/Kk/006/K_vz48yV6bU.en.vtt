00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 hello hello how are you welcome once 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.860
 more and let's go back to this section that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.759
 had opened a while ago on the channel 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.070
 that's called we weave and in this case I'm going 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.560
 to teach them how to make a little flower 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.289
 crochet that is very very easy what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 let's do is the loop of the beginning 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.379
 let's take the thread the yarn or wool what 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.860
 that you use and we are going to do 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.010
 like an X 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.190
 that we are going to introduce and we are going to take 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.090
 to make a knot that can be adjusted 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:55.490
 at the end we are going to make this this circle 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.559
 which we will fill with 12 in 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:01.040
 stockings and as stockings 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.020
 we go to the beginning of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:10.100
 this first round let's do 2 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.229
 two chains to give the height after 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.390
 let's take a loop and go to 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.640
 introduce the needle in the circle let's go 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.310
 to have three points and we will pass the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.859
 three points that would be a half vareta 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.539
 of these we are going to do 12 to cover 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.539
 the whole circle 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.610
 i 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.729
 very well once we have 12 in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 the circle what we are going to do is 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.420
 just with the little thread that we had left 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.750
 let's throw to adjust and stay 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.440
 the closed circle 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.890
 and that is going to be the center of our flower 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.700
 and to close it we are going to make a point 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.270
 passed then we will have a 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:11.120
 little circle with 12 half-ribs 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.849
 what follows we are going to do 1 2 3 chains 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.790
 let's jump a base point and in the 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.150
 that we continue to introduce then in the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.420
 second vareta in the second point 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.640
 we have 2 and we passed that would be in the middle 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.549
 point and now we will continue to do 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.459
 but nothing else with 2 chains we are going to 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.430
 jump one and in the next we're going to 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.269
 make a half point like this until completing 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.269
 the circle 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.000
 well this way we will stay 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.849
 six openings where we're going to do 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.739
 our petals in the third round what 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.500
 what we are going to do is fill in these 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.689
 little bridges that we have left and we are going to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.349
 do the following we are going to take a 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:20.680
 lazada go through the center of the 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:23.200
 little bridge that we have we have 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.989
 three points and we close we make a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.409
 half a crochet after we have laced 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.340
 we put out we have three and we do 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.340
 a vareta 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 when we have the fifth point we return 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.299
 to take lasso and we make the last point 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.450
 it's going to be another half twists then 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.730
 we are going to have a half four 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.080
 fins and a half-trot at the end 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.390
 as well 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.550
 to mark the petal well what we're going 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.620
 to do is enter at the half point 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.910
 of the previous round and we're going to make a 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.070
 past point this we will repeat 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:17.200
 around the whole circle to form 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.200
 so the six petals of the flower 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.180
 well we have five petals I'm going to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.660
 start the last tome the loop I'll 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.260
 make the half-crochet and then four 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.280
 trotters and the dwarf point and we would have 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.280
 our little flower 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.150
 there are so many ways to make flowers and 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.909
 I wanted to share this because I 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.520
 it seemed pretty simple fast of 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:06.250
 do we can do a lot of quantity and 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.139
 this can be a scarf are very 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.090
 very pretty we can make flowers of 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.300
 different colors and make a pretty 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.009
 scarf alone today I wanted to show you how 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.599
 make this little flower you put them 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.300
 they talk about how applying it can be 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.969
 hair accessories I tell you 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.699
 scarves endings of some sweater 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.729
 I thought it was a nice idea to share 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:31.000
 with you and resume our section 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.370
