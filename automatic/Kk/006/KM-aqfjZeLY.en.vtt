00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.920 
and to just enhance the shine of the
hair<00:05:45.860> if<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:47.160> starts<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.550> get<00:05:47.730> dry<00:05:47.940> on<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.390> just

some good tender loving care and it

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.290 
some good tender loving care and it

should be really good lease mine that's

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.260 
should be really good lease mine that's
what<00:05:57.450> happened<00:05:57.930> for<00:05:58.140> me<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.640> think<00:06:00.090> the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
what happened for me and I think the

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.870 
what happened for me and I think the
hair<00:06:00.450> could<00:06:00.720> last<00:06:00.960> longer<00:06:01.290> if<00:06:01.650> well<00:06:02.610> I<00:06:02.640> think

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
hair could last longer if well I think

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.240 
hair could last longer if well I think
I'm<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.870> could<00:06:04.080> probably<00:06:04.350> wear<00:06:04.770> this<00:06:04.920> hair<00:06:05.100> for

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
I'm I could probably wear this hair for

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.220 
I'm I could probably wear this hair for
three<00:06:05.430> or<00:06:05.550> four<00:06:05.580> months<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.390> think<00:06:06.720> before<00:06:06.990> it

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
three or four months I think before it

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.170 
three or four months I think before it
started<00:06:07.440> to<00:06:07.560> irritate<00:06:07.950> me<00:06:08.030> probably<00:06:09.030> could

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
started to irritate me probably could

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.030 
started to irritate me probably could
last<00:06:09.390> longer<00:06:09.480> if<00:06:09.930> you<00:06:09.960> don't<00:06:10.140> heat<00:06:10.560> style<00:06:10.860> your
