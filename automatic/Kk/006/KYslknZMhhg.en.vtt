so<00:00:06.919> afternoon<00:00:07.370> we're<00:00:07.669> going<00:00:07.819> to<00:00:08.000> look<00:00:08.330> at

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
so afternoon we're going to look at

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.420 
so afternoon we're going to look at
making<00:00:08.750> a<00:00:09.200> zipped<00:00:10.010> box<00:00:10.610> cushion<00:00:11.420> cover<00:00:12.430> the

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
making a zipped box cushion cover the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.490 
making a zipped box cushion cover the
reason<00:00:13.760> we<00:00:13.879> say<00:00:14.059> boxed<00:00:14.690> is<00:00:14.930> because<00:00:15.350> we're

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
reason we say boxed is because we're

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.890 
reason we say boxed is because we're
talking<00:00:15.650> about<00:00:15.920> cushions<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:17.359> are<00:00:17.480> not<00:00:17.660> just

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
talking about cushions that are not just

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.880 
talking about cushions that are not just
two<00:00:18.529> sides<00:00:18.920> sewn<00:00:19.490> together<00:00:19.960> but<00:00:20.960> they<00:00:21.320> have<00:00:21.619> a

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
two sides sewn together but they have a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.079 
two sides sewn together but they have a
boxing<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:24.130> rim<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.159> goes<00:00:25.579> around<00:00:25.789> the

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:26.089 
boxing and a rim that goes around the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.790 
boxing and a rim that goes around the
edge<00:00:26.240> of<00:00:26.509> a<00:00:26.599> cushion<00:00:26.839> and<00:00:27.289> edge<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
edge of a cushion and edge to the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.470 
edge of a cushion and edge to the
cushion<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.539> so<00:00:29.539> it's<00:00:29.810> two<00:00:30.050> sides<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.480> an

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
cushion and so it's two sides and an

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.139 
cushion and so it's two sides and an
edge<00:00:32.780> called<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.770> boxing<00:00:34.280> normally<00:00:34.940> on<00:00:35.120> a

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
edge called the boxing normally on a

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:37.960 
edge called the boxing normally on a
cushion<00:00:35.800> cushion<00:00:36.800> I'm<00:00:37.040> going<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.489> make<00:00:37.940> a

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
cushion cushion I'm going to make a

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.180 
cushion cushion I'm going to make a
cover<00:00:38.360> for<00:00:38.720> this<00:00:38.900> afternoon<00:00:39.470> is<00:00:39.800> a<00:00:39.830> feather

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
cover for this afternoon is a feather

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.840 
cover for this afternoon is a feather
cushion<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.630> it's<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.900> soft<00:00:42.230> cushion<00:00:42.560> and<00:00:43.100> that

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
cushion so it's a soft cushion and that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.780 
cushion so it's a soft cushion and that
means<00:00:44.180> that<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.050> outer<00:00:45.410> cover<00:00:46.040> will<00:00:46.760> be

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
means that the outer cover will be

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.690 
means that the outer cover will be
slightly<00:00:47.300> smaller<00:00:47.570> than<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.800> cushion<00:00:49.310> itself

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
slightly smaller than the cushion itself

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.560 
slightly smaller than the cushion itself
so<00:00:50.450> that<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:50.660> fits<00:00:50.960> snugly<00:00:51.440> inside<00:00:51.710> its<00:00:52.160> cover

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
so that it fits snugly inside its cover

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.470 
so that it fits snugly inside its cover
if<00:00:53.570> I<00:00:53.840> were<00:00:54.020> making<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.680> onto<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.670> block<00:00:56.000> foam

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
if I were making this onto a block foam

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.950 
if I were making this onto a block foam
cushion<00:00:57.170> or<00:00:57.380> a<00:00:57.440> firm<00:00:58.370> cushion<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.210> wouldn't

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
cushion or a firm cushion I wouldn't

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.570 
cushion or a firm cushion I wouldn't
make<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.320> smaller<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.890> would<00:01:01.070> make<00:01:01.280> it<00:01:01.460> the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
make it smaller I would make it the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.259 
make it smaller I would make it the
correct<00:01:01.790> size<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:04.159> size<00:01:04.460> of<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.850> cushion

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
correct size I the size of the cushion

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.249 
correct size I the size of the cushion
plus<00:01:06.020> seam<00:01:06.680> allowance<00:01:07.570> in<00:01:08.570> this<00:01:08.780> instance

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
plus seam allowance in this instance

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.280 
plus seam allowance in this instance
it's<00:01:09.770> going<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.310> be<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:11.000> size<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.870> cushion

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
it's going to be the size of the cushion

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.540 
it's going to be the size of the cushion
and<00:01:12.880> no<00:01:13.880> seam<00:01:14.210> allowance<00:01:14.780> top<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.770> bottom

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
and no seam allowance top and bottom

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.990 
and no seam allowance top and bottom
only<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> seam<00:01:17.659> allowance<00:01:18.260> on<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.280> boxing<00:01:19.790> and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
only a seam allowance on the boxing and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.210 
only a seam allowance on the boxing and
I'll<00:01:20.600> show<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.810> how<00:01:21.050> that<00:01:21.229> works<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.740> cushion

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
I'll show you how that works the cushion

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.420 
I'll show you how that works the cushion
that<00:01:22.670> we're<00:01:22.820> going<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.229> make<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.260> cover<00:01:24.620> for<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
that we're going to make a cover for the

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.300 
that we're going to make a cover for the
actual<00:01:25.880> measurements<00:01:26.450> are<00:01:27.010> twenty<00:01:28.010> four<00:01:28.159> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
a three and a half inch boxing we're

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.310 
a three and a half inch boxing we're
cutting<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.610> pieces<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.450> have<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.840> bear<00:01:36.290> in

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
cutting the pieces you have to bear in

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.580 
cutting the pieces you have to bear in
mind<00:01:36.500> any<00:01:37.070> pattern<00:01:37.630> that's<00:01:38.630> on<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:39.140> fabric

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
mind any pattern that's on your fabric

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.320 
mind any pattern that's on your fabric
in<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:40.760> instance<00:01:41.360> I've<00:01:41.630> chosen<00:01:42.080> a<00:01:42.820> stripe<00:01:43.820> or

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
in this instance I've chosen a stripe or

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.380 
in this instance I've chosen a stripe or
checked<00:01:44.900> fabric<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.310> there's<00:01:46.850> quite<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.120> bit<00:01:47.299> of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
checked fabric so there's quite a bit of

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.170 
checked fabric so there's quite a bit of
pattern<00:01:47.600> matching<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.440> do<00:01:48.650> in<00:01:49.640> some<00:01:49.909> ways<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
pattern matching to do in some ways a

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.600 
pattern matching to do in some ways a
stripe<00:01:50.659> can<00:01:50.990> be<00:01:51.229> helpful<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.340> lining

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
stripe can be helpful to you in lining

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.149 
stripe can be helpful to you in lining
up<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.090> fabric<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.590> could<00:01:54.710> also<00:01:54.830> be<00:01:55.010> a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
up the fabric but it could also be a

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.060 
up the fabric but it could also be a
hindrance<00:01:55.580> in<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.240> matching<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:57.770> this

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
hindrance in in matching in this

hindrance in in matching in this
instance<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.670> first<00:01:58.909> thing<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.270> had<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.630> do<00:01:59.810> was

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
instance the first thing I had to do was

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.590 
instance the first thing I had to do was
choose<00:02:00.440> which<00:02:01.190> was<00:02:01.549> going<00:02:01.760> to<00:02:01.880> be<00:02:02.030> my<00:02:02.240> center

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
choose which was going to be my center

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.330 
choose which was going to be my center
stripe<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:04.220> light<00:02:04.460> or<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.510> dark<00:02:06.130> now<00:02:07.130> if<00:02:07.220> I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
stripe the light or the dark now if I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.210 
stripe the light or the dark now if I
wanted<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.939> fit<00:02:08.269> both<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.500> front<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.030 
arthritic I'm using one of our scissors
our<00:02:31.880> special<00:02:32.330> scissors<00:02:32.540> which<00:02:32.960> in<00:02:33.230> fact<00:02:33.470> can

touch and it will cut through several
layers<00:02:39.440> in<00:02:39.740> fact<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.130> have<00:02:40.340> used<00:02:40.610> this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
layers in fact I have used this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.850 
layers in fact I have used this

leather and it's not a problem I'll need

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.110 
leather and it's not a problem I'll need
to<00:02:49.370> cut<00:02:49.580> out<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.360> zip<00:02:51.080> section<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:52.430> my<00:02:52.670> cushion

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
to cut out the zip section of my cushion

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.050 
to cut out the zip section of my cushion
this<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.260> two<00:02:54.500> parts<00:02:54.740> where<00:02:55.190> our<00:02:55.340> solar<00:02:55.670> zip

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this is two parts where our solar zip

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.830 
this is two parts where our solar zip
into<00:02:56.270> it

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
into it

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.800 
into it
and<00:02:57.050> into<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.500> boxing<00:02:57.980> before<00:02:58.190> I<00:02:58.690> put<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
and into the boxing before I put the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.649 
and into the boxing before I put the
boxing<00:03:00.320> on<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.860> cushion

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.819 

we<00:03:06.659> don't<00:03:06.900> we're<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.260> pipe<00:03:07.530> this

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
we don't we're going to pipe this

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.280 
we don't we're going to pipe this
cushion<00:03:08.159> and<00:03:08.579> we're<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.140> on

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
cushion and we're going to put it on

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.649 
cushion and we're going to put it on
three<00:03:10.620> sides<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.159> front<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.969> sides<00:03:12.239> but

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
three sides the front and the sides but

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.750 
three sides the front and the sides but
not<00:03:12.719> on<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.260> back<00:03:13.439> or<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.950> bottom<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.549> it

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
not on the back or the bottom if it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.589 
not on the back or the bottom if it
worked<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:15.329> instance<00:03:15.659> a<00:03:15.810> back<00:03:16.319> cushion

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
worked for instance a back cushion

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.000 
worked for instance a back cushion
because<00:03:18.599> when<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.049> hidden<00:03:19.260> sometimes<00:03:19.560> it's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
because when it's hidden sometimes it's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.220 
because when it's hidden sometimes it's
not<00:03:20.129> necessary<00:03:20.700> at<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.030> area<00:03:21.569> so<00:03:21.959> it'll<00:03:22.109> be

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
not necessary at that area so it'll be

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.780 
not necessary at that area so it'll be
basically<00:03:22.469> the<00:03:22.859> zip<00:03:23.069> side<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.579> we're<00:03:23.700> not

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
basically the zip side that we're not

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.319 
basically the zip side that we're not
piping<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> worked<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.920> how<00:03:26.459> much<00:03:26.670> piping

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
piping so I worked out how much piping

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.009 
piping so I worked out how much piping
we<00:03:28.260> would<00:03:28.379> actually<00:03:28.739> need<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:30.150> also<00:03:30.629> you

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
we would actually need and then also you

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.649 
we would actually need and then also you
need<00:03:31.409> to<00:03:31.590> work<00:03:31.829> out<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.340> width<00:03:32.579> of<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.150> piping

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
need to work out the width of the piping

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.869 
need to work out the width of the piping
that<00:03:33.689> you<00:03:33.959> need<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:38.129> way<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.700> do

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
that you need and the way you can do

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.030 
that you need and the way you can do
that<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.419> unique<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.150> our<00:03:42.480> zip<00:03:43.409> sections

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
that is unique this is our zip sections

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.119 
that is unique this is our zip sections
and<00:03:44.819> as<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.239> see<00:03:45.480> again<00:03:45.780> I've<00:03:46.319> marked<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
and as you can see again I've marked the

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.059 
and as you can see again I've marked the
center<00:03:47.609> and<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.840> made<00:03:49.049> these<00:03:49.230> long<00:03:49.500> enough<00:03:49.799> so

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
center and I made these long enough so

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.159 
center and I made these long enough so
that<00:03:50.099> obviously<00:03:50.400> they'll<00:03:50.909> go<00:03:51.120> round<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.959> back

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
that obviously they'll go round the back

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.860 
that obviously they'll go round the back
of<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> cushion<00:03:53.189> and<00:03:53.430> slightly<00:03:53.939> upside<00:03:54.450> so

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
of the cushion and slightly upside so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.899 
of the cushion and slightly upside so
that<00:03:55.079> the<00:03:55.200> mayor<00:03:55.379> the<00:03:55.829> cushion<00:03:56.219> opens<00:03:56.669> in<00:03:56.819> a

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
that the mayor the cushion opens in a

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.849 
that the mayor the cushion opens in a
mouth<00:03:57.120> fashion<00:03:57.719> rather<00:03:57.930> than<00:03:58.319> just<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.680> end

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
mouth fashion rather than just the end

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.160 
mouth fashion rather than just the end
to<00:03:59.129> get<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> cushioning

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
to get the cushioning

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.790 
to get the cushioning
now<00:04:01.680> it's<00:04:02.580> reasonably<00:04:03.360> well<00:04:03.540> matched<00:04:03.840> this

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
now it's reasonably well matched this

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.680 
now it's reasonably well matched this
point<00:04:05.190> here<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.880> see<00:04:06.060> I'm<00:04:06.270> matching<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
point here you can see I'm matching the

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.740 
point here you can see I'm matching the
stripes<00:04:07.140> if<00:04:07.830> not<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.300> not<00:04:09.450> totally

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
stripes if not it was not totally

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.510 
stripes if not it was not totally
necessary<00:04:10.110> to

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.770 

we're<00:04:14.520> now<00:04:14.670> going<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.000> serve<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.570> main

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
we're now going to serve the main

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.199 
we're now going to serve the main
section<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> boxing<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.220> as<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.820> can<00:04:17.970> see

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
section of the boxing on as you can see

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.800 
section of the boxing on as you can see
I've<00:04:18.720> got<00:04:18.930> my<00:04:18.959> central<00:04:19.680> marks<00:04:20.310> in<00:04:20.640> my<00:04:21.060> boxing

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
I've got my central marks in my boxing

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.210 
I've got my central marks in my boxing
and<00:04:22.230> my<00:04:22.680> central<00:04:23.160> mark<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.730> my<00:04:24.680> cushion<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
and my central mark on my cushion the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.960 
and my central mark on my cushion the
zipping<00:04:27.770> actually<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.920> slide<00:04:29.250> goes<00:04:29.580> under<00:04:29.910> a

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
zipping actually the slide goes under a

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.810 
zipping actually the slide goes under a
little<00:04:30.060> tuck<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:31.770> we'll<00:04:31.920> put<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.220> same<00:04:32.430> tuck

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
little tuck and we'll put the same tuck

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.590 
little tuck and we'll put the same tuck
in<00:04:33.530> now<00:04:34.530> I'll<00:04:34.710> need<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.190> sew<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.910> around<00:04:36.270> on

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
in now I'll need to sew that around on

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.080 
in now I'll need to sew that around on
the<00:04:36.780> same<00:04:37.020> machine<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:39.770> over<00:04:40.770> lock<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.760> seams

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the same machine and over lock the seams

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.440 
the same machine and over lock the seams
so<00:04:42.510> that<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.590> doesn't<00:04:43.920> fray<00:04:44.190> on<00:04:45.060> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
so that it doesn't fray on the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.650 
so that it doesn't fray on the
overlocker<00:04:45.870> here<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.760> then<00:04:47.760> our<00:04:48.120> cushion<00:04:48.510> is
