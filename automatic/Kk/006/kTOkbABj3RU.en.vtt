00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Alright kittens. Here is a fairytale for you!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.980
It's called The Three Billy Goats Gruff.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.320
Baaa!

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.860
So one time, there were three billy goats,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.520
There was Billy Sr.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.440
His son, Billy Jr.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.220
And his grandson, Billy III

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.520
Three generations of billy goats named Billy!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.480
And their last name was Gruff.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.320
Being billy goats, they LOVED to eat grass.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.620
They even ate the dandelions in the grass,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.080
which I personally find kind of yucky.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.740
Well, one day

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.340
they had finally eaten all the grass in their small field.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
Which was okay for about fifteen minutes...

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.620
Then, they were hungry again!

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.620
Well, wouldn't you know

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.080
across the way, over a very large canyon, was a beautiful field,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.580
tall, lush grass just blowing in the wind.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.460
The only way to get there

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.180
was to travel across a very,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.060
very,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.460
VERY long bridge.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.060
A wobbly bridge.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.640
And it was dangling

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.960
100,000 feet above a gulch!

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.660
It was quite terrifying.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.220
But the Billys were hungry, and so they decided to try and cross  it.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.040
Billy Jr, why don't you go first? For you are much lighter than I am,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
and we need to make sure the bridge is safe.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.240
Baaa

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.800
Well, Billy III is much smaller than ME.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.040
Why don't YOU go across first?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.200
Ba!

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.260
NARRATOR: Billy III was a good son, and a GREAT grandson.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.480
Well, actually a very good grandson

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.360
because a great grandson means something else.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.260
But anyway, he agreed.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.860
The bridge was long and treacherous,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.480
which means scary, because it was very wobbly.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.460
But, he did pretty well.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.960
Until he got right in the middle,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.520
where he met a troll!

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.840
And as we all know,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.700
trolls LOVE to eat goats!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.780
Especially goats named Billy.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.320
Uh, hey... are you a goat?

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.060
Is your name Billy?

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.740
Why yes it is!

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.060
There's 3 of us: Billy Sr, Billy Jr, and me! Billy 3.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.420
Mmm, I'm gonna eat you now, okay?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.340
Hold on! I'm just a wee little goat with barely any meat on my bones!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.520
If you wait, I can go across the bridge and eat some grass for a few weeks and get BIG and juicy!

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.200
Then, I'll be even MORE delicious!

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.580
Uh...

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.280
Ok!

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.380
NARRATOR: And so, the troll let Billy III across the bridge,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.880
AND waited for the next goat because we all know that trolls are very greedy...

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.740
and not very smart.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.960
Once wee Billy III got to the meadow,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.320
he knew he had to warm his dad and grandpa about the troll!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.920
So, he flew a paper airplane back across the canyon to Billy Jr.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.880
It said:

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.320
NARRATOR: [sighs] Little wee Billy III didn't know how to spell "troll"

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.200
So, he tried drawing one.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.560
Oof.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.760
Keep your day job, little Billy...

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.320
Billy Jr. was unsure what he supposed to look out for.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.020
So, he decided to be extra careful when he crossed.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.660
Hey! Are you a goat named Billy too?

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.360
I'm gonna eat YOU now, okay?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.100
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second...

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800
You should know something first:

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.040
The next goat comin' across is REALLY big and REALLY tasty.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.480
If you eat me, you'll be too full!

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.800
Why don't you let me go ahead, and while you're eating the next goat,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.280
I'll eat some grass and get big and tasty as him!

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.380
Um... okay!

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.180
NARRATOR: And so, the troll let him across to the big field,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.180
where he was reunited with his son,

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.860
and they sent a paper airplane over the gulch to Billy Sr.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900
And it only said one word

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.420
(which Billy Jr. fortunately knew how to spell):

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.580
Grandpa Billy Sr. knew what he had to do...

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.380
He crossed the bridge,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.220
and then he got to the troll.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.520
Oh no! You're TOO big!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.140
NARRATOR: And he was right!

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.860
Billy Sr. was much bigger and stronger than the troll!

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.020
Um, I'd like to try and eat you?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.680
If, uh, that's okay...

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.600
I don't think so.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.460
Baaa!

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.580
NARRATOR: Billy Sr. took his horns

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.200
and launched the troll off the bridge

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.400
and all the way up into outer space!

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.400
Where he could no longer bother anymore goats.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.580
Especially goats named Billy.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.680
And the three Billy Goats Gruff ate endless grass and dandelions for the rest of their days.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.360
You might say the moral of the story is,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.700
If you're a goat, don't name your son Billy!

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.880
And if you're a troll, well, get an education!

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.360
And if that doesn't work, invest in a rocket ship.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.220
The End.
