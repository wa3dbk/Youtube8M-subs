00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
that we're going to use now this is a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
that we're going to make is pretty much

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.630 
that we're going to make is pretty much
gonna<00:00:30.570> work<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.050> all<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.710> previous<00:00:32.130> nanos

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
gonna work with all the previous nanos

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
gonna work with all the previous nanos
so<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.030> two<00:00:33.149> five

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so one two five

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.180 
so one two five
the<00:00:33.899> sixth<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.410> which<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the sixth one which is out right now is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.680 
the sixth one which is out right now is
a<00:00:35.219> lot<00:00:35.399> smaller<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.850> has<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> clip<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.600> no

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
a lot smaller it has a clip on it you no

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
a lot smaller it has a clip on it you no
need<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.899> worry<00:00:37.050> about<00:00:37.140> making<00:00:37.500> something

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
need to worry about making something

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.869 
need to worry about making something
like<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.340> has<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.640> clip

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
like this because it has that clip

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
like this because it has that clip
pretty<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> shuffles<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.469> Clips

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
pretty much all the shuffles have Clips

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.840 
pretty much all the shuffles have Clips
so<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.129> need<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> worry<00:00:41.430> about<00:00:41.520> those

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
so you don't need to worry about those

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
so you don't need to worry about those
if<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.570> making<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.649> an<00:00:43.739> iPod

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
if you are making this for an iPod

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
if you are making this for an iPod
Classic<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.879> sure<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> guys<00:00:45.239> know<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.450> iPod

Classic I'm sure you guys know when iPod

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
Classic I'm sure you guys know when iPod
Classic<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> little<00:00:46.590> bit<00:00:46.770> bigger<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
Classic it's it's a little bit bigger a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
Classic it's it's a little bit bigger a
lot<00:00:47.460> thicker<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.149> lot<00:00:48.329> heavier<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.930> would

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
lot thicker and a lot heavier I would

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.260 
lot thicker and a lot heavier I would
suggest<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.950> modify<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.460> accordingly

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
suggest that you modify this accordingly

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.090 
suggest that you modify this accordingly
make<00:00:51.570> sure<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.930> add<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.110> lot<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.410> tape<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
make sure you add a lot more tape to it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.380 
make sure you add a lot more tape to it
because<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.550> want<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.210> your

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because you don't want you know your

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
because you don't want you know your
iPod<00:00:54.840> Classic<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.440> fall<00:00:56.010> out<00:00:56.219> when<00:00:56.699> you're

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
iPod Classic to fall out when you're

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.099 
iPod Classic to fall out when you're
jogging<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.329> whatever<00:00:57.570> activity<00:00:58.050> you're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
jogging or whatever activity you're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.810 
jogging or whatever activity you're
doing<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.100> definitely<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
doing you definitely want you know to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
doing you definitely want you know to
reinforce<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.660> make<00:01:00.840> sure<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.020> it's<00:01:01.230> not

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
reinforce it and make sure that it's not

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
reinforce it and make sure that it's not
going<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.649> anywhere<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.430> are<00:01:02.579> using

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
going to go anywhere so if you are using

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
going to go anywhere so if you are using
a<00:01:02.969> classic<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.510> would<00:01:03.660> suggest<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.739> through<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
a classic I would suggest go through the

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.990 
a classic I would suggest go through the
time<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.280> make<00:01:05.430> sure<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.850> secure

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
time to make sure that it's secure

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
time to make sure that it's secure
because<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.689> jogging<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.229> bouncing

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
because if you're jogging it's bouncing

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
because if you're jogging it's bouncing
all<00:01:07.710> around<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.460> want<00:01:08.610> your<00:01:08.760> iPod<00:01:09.060> to

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
all around you don't want your iPod to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.539 
all around you don't want your iPod to
to<00:01:09.869> fly<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.320> ground<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> nanos

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to fly to the ground so with the nanos

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.950 
to fly to the ground so with the nanos
they're<00:01:11.729> pretty<00:01:12.000> small<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> they're<00:01:12.689> pretty

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
they're pretty small and they're pretty

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.660 
they're pretty small and they're pretty
a<00:01:13.110> thin<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.860> don't<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.250> worry<00:01:14.430> too<00:01:14.640> much

going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.360> using<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> iPod<00:01:19.200> fifth

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to be using the iPod fifth

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.850 
going to be using the iPod fifth
generation<00:01:20.220> Nano<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.509> tutorial<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.710> our

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
generation Nano in this tutorial so our

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.289 
generation Nano in this tutorial so our
first<00:01:23.040> step<00:01:23.280> we're<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> cut<00:01:24.210> out

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
first step we're going to do is cut out

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
first step we're going to do is cut out
two<00:01:24.600> strips<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.990> tape<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.320> 15<00:01:25.860> inches

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
two strips of tape that are 15 inches

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.010 
two strips of tape that are 15 inches
long<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.759> 15<00:01:27.119> inches<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.810> overkill

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
long and 15 inches is a bit of overkill

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
long and 15 inches is a bit of overkill
even<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:28.979> have<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> pretty<00:01:29.579> pretty

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
even if you do have a pretty pretty

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.990 
even if you do have a pretty pretty
large<00:01:30.450> arm<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.140> we're<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> be

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
large arm so we're going to be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.310 
large arm so we're going to be
overshooting<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.450> bit<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.900> it's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
overshooting a little bit here but it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.390 
overshooting a little bit here but it's
just<00:01:34.500> gonna<00:01:34.590> mean<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.829> there's<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> much

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
just gonna mean that there's that much

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.149 
just gonna mean that there's that much
more<00:01:35.700> room<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.960> try<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.680> curl<00:01:38.009> them

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
more room when you do try to curl them

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.469 
more room when you do try to curl them
all<00:01:38.220> together<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.820> take<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> little<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.360> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
all together and take a little bit of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
all together and take a little bit of
velcro<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.020> which<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.560> up<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
velcro on which you can see up here so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
velcro on which you can see up here so
you're<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.820> take<00:01:42.119> your<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:43.020> 15<00:01:43.470> inch

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you're going to take your two 15 inch

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.490 
you're going to take your two 15 inch
strips<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.640> you're<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.500> apply

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
strips here and you're going to apply

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.170 
strips here and you're going to apply
them<00:01:46.799> directly<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.310> top<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> each<00:01:47.729> other<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
them directly on top of each other it

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.520 
them directly on top of each other it
can<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> little<00:01:48.540> difficult<00:01:49.049> because<00:01:49.140> these

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
can be a little difficult because these

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
can be a little difficult because these
strips<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.040> very<00:01:50.430> long<00:01:50.759> but<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> should<00:01:51.659> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
strips are very long but you should be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.359 
strips are very long but you should be
able<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.020> without<00:01:52.200> much<00:01:52.380> trouble<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.890> now

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
able to do without much trouble so now

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069 
able to do without much trouble so now
you<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.700> our<00:01:54.000> back<00:01:54.299> band<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:54.960> we're

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
you have our back band and now we're

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.499 
you have our back band and now we're
going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> work<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> actual<00:01:56.369> pod<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
going to work on the actual pod that the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
going to work on the actual pod that the
iPod<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> gonna<00:01:58.469> slip<00:01:58.740> into<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.219> let's<00:01:59.280> work<00:01:59.520> on

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
iPod is gonna slip into so let's work on

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.480 
iPod is gonna slip into so let's work on
that<00:01:59.729> next<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.229> next<00:02:01.500> step<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> pod<00:02:02.250> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
that next the next step for the pod that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
that next the next step for the pod that
the<00:02:02.579> iPod<00:02:02.850> goes<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> cut<00:02:04.110> out

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the iPod goes in we're going to cut out

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.959 
the iPod goes in we're going to cut out
four<00:02:04.469> strips<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.890> tape<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.070> are<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.579> little

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
four strips of tape that are a little

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
four strips of tape that are a little
over<00:02:06.149> three<00:02:06.360> inches<00:02:06.630> long<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.500> see

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
over three inches long and you can see

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.100 
over three inches long and you can see
that's<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.280> kind<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.000> leaving<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.989> bit

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
that's just kind of leaving a little bit

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
that's just kind of leaving a little bit
of<00:02:10.229> room<00:02:10.679> here<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.979> top<00:02:11.250> which<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> just

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of room here at the top which is just

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.210 
of room here at the top which is just
fine<00:02:12.420> these<00:02:12.959> might

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
fine these might

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040 
fine these might
you're<00:02:13.460> gonna<00:02:13.550> work<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:13.970> pretty<00:02:14.240> much<00:02:14.330> all<00:02:14.600> of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
you're gonna work for pretty much all of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.740 
you're gonna work for pretty much all of
the<00:02:15.380> nanos<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.100> are<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.370> market<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.030> the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the nanos that are on the market and the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.690 
the nanos that are on the market and the
the<00:02:18.050> newer<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.500> ya<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.980> older<00:02:19.280> ones<00:02:19.490> were

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the newer with ya the older ones were

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.840 
the newer with ya the older ones were
kind<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.060> thick<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:21.110> probably<00:02:21.850> expand

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
kind of thick so you can probably expand

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.700 
kind of thick so you can probably expand
these<00:02:22.970> measurements<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.510> little<00:02:23.780> bit<00:02:23.960> but

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
these measurements a little bit but

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.770 
these measurements a little bit but
there<00:02:24.830> should<00:02:25.010> work<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.310> the<00:02:25.370> newer<00:02:25.550> ones<00:02:25.850> and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
there should work for the newer ones and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.940 
there should work for the newer ones and
once<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.290> those<00:02:27.380> two<00:02:27.590> stuck<00:02:27.800> together

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
once we have those two stuck together

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.340 
once we have those two stuck together
you're<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.090> line<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.570> up<00:02:29.780> here<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.290> you

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
you're going to line it up here and you

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.500 
you're going to line it up here and you
want<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.620> come<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.070> about<00:02:31.460> three<00:02:32.060> inches<00:02:32.090> maybe

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
want to come to about three inches maybe

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.540 
want to come to about three inches maybe
a<00:02:32.570> little<00:02:32.720> less<00:02:32.900> than<00:02:33.050> three<00:02:33.290> inches<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.830> the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
a little less than three inches on the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.030 
a little less than three inches on the
you<00:02:34.610> know<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.760> width<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> side<00:02:35.990> I'm<00:02:36.830> going

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you know the width on the side I'm going

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.850 
you know the width on the side I'm going
to<00:02:37.100> flip<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.370> over<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.110> get<00:02:39.500> ready<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.740> cut

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
to flip that over and get ready to cut

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.260 
to flip that over and get ready to cut
out<00:02:39.950> four<00:02:40.310> more<00:02:40.580> strips<00:02:40.940> because<00:02:41.150> you're

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
out four more strips because you're

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.640 
out four more strips because you're
gonna<00:02:41.360> be<00:02:41.450> doing<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:41.720> exact<00:02:42.020> same<00:02:42.230> thing<00:02:42.500> so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
gonna be doing the exact same thing so

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.840 
gonna be doing the exact same thing so
once<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.010> those<00:02:43.250> four<00:02:43.520> stuck<00:02:43.730> together

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
once you have those four stuck together

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
little trickier for the screen because

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.020 
little trickier for the screen because
you<00:04:21.289> want<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.680> piece<00:04:22.010> if<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.580> have<00:04:22.820> velcro

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
on it to come down and stick it on but

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.890 
on it to come down and stick it on but
you<00:04:25.610> can<00:04:25.789> do<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.270> mean<00:04:26.599> a<00:04:26.630> lot

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
you can do it I mean a lot

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.810 
you can do it I mean a lot
like<00:04:27.169> I<00:04:27.260> said<00:04:27.440> don't<00:04:27.680> change<00:04:28.160> their<00:04:28.460> their

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
like I said don't change their their

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.490 
like I said don't change their their
tunes<00:04:29.300> while<00:04:29.660> they're<00:04:29.900> jogging<00:04:30.169> or

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
tunes while they're jogging or

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.230 
tunes while they're jogging or
exercising<00:04:31.130> they<00:04:31.220> usually<00:04:31.400> have<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:31.760> playlist

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
exercising they usually have a playlist

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.580 
exercising they usually have a playlist
and<00:04:32.330> that's<00:04:32.449> what<00:04:32.570> most<00:04:32.720> people<00:04:32.990> do<00:04:33.169> that's

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and that's what most people do that's

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.750 
and that's what most people do that's
why<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.740> shuffle<00:04:34.160> became<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:34.610> popular

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
why the shuffle became so popular

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.370 
why the shuffle became so popular
because<00:04:35.389> it<00:04:35.660> doesn't<00:04:35.930> even<00:04:35.990> doesn't<00:04:36.260> even

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
because it doesn't even doesn't even

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.590 
because it doesn't even doesn't even
have<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.560> screen<00:04:36.830> so<00:04:37.580> that's<00:04:37.880> talking<00:04:38.360> about

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
thing all the time in this case does a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.090 
thing all the time in this case does a
great<00:05:22.639> job<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:23.180> protecting<00:05:23.810> it<00:05:24.139> so<00:05:24.169> if<00:05:24.770> you<00:05:24.919> do

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
great job of protecting it so if you do

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.469 
great job of protecting it so if you do
have<00:05:25.280> something<00:05:25.580> like<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:25.760> on<00:05:25.880> your<00:05:26.150> iPod<00:05:26.449> I

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
have something like that on your iPod I

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.210 
have something like that on your iPod I
would<00:05:26.690> recommend<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.139> leave<00:05:27.380> it<00:05:27.500> in<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.949> and

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
would recommend you leave it in that and

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.490 
would recommend you leave it in that and
then<00:05:28.669> just<00:05:28.940> slip<00:05:29.150> that<00:05:29.419> into<00:05:29.840> this<00:05:29.930> pouch<00:05:30.229> all

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
then just slip that into this pouch all

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.900 
then just slip that into this pouch all
by<00:05:30.620> itself<00:05:30.919> so<00:05:31.099> not<00:05:31.280> only<00:05:31.370> will<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.700> pouch

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
by itself so not only will the pouch

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.730 
by itself so not only will the pouch
like<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.479> duct<00:05:32.660> tape<00:05:32.810> protect<00:05:33.200> it<00:05:33.349> if<00:05:33.470> it<00:05:33.590> does

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
like the duct tape protect it if it does

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.650 
like the duct tape protect it if it does
happen<00:05:33.950> to<00:05:34.099> fall<00:05:34.310> out<00:05:34.520> or<00:05:34.940> fall<00:05:35.180> off<00:05:35.300> your<00:05:35.510> arm

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
happen to fall out or fall off your arm

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.420 
happen to fall out or fall off your arm
you<00:05:36.020> will<00:05:36.289> definitely<00:05:36.530> have<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.830> hard<00:05:37.220> case

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
you will definitely have that hard case

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.950 
you will definitely have that hard case
of<00:05:37.580> that<00:05:37.669> soft<00:05:37.940> case<00:05:38.180> on<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.419> inside<00:05:38.720> so<00:05:38.930> that

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
of that soft case on the inside so that

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.930 
of that soft case on the inside so that
should<00:05:39.260> protect<00:05:39.440> your<00:05:40.190> iPod<00:05:40.520> from<00:05:40.729> anything

you're exercising so now let's talk
about<00:05:44.539> you<00:05:44.690> know<00:05:44.810> sticking<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.740> velcro<00:05:45.919> on

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
about you know sticking the velcro on

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.379 
about you know sticking the velcro on
and<00:05:46.430> putting<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.910> on<00:05:46.970> your<00:05:47.120> arm

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
and putting it on your arm

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.629 
and putting it on your arm
all<00:05:48.169> right<00:05:48.260> so<00:05:48.410> as<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.680> saw<00:05:48.889> my<00:05:49.099> original<00:05:49.490> one

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
all right so as you saw my original one

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.820 
all right so as you saw my original one
that's<00:05:50.030> where<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.479> the<00:05:51.080> fabric<00:05:51.500> part<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.770> the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
that's where the the fabric part of the

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.500 
that's where the the fabric part of the
velcro<00:05:51.979> is<00:05:52.400> and<00:05:52.639> this<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.760> where<00:05:53.090> the<00:05:53.360> hooks

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
velcro is and this is where the hooks

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.779 
velcro is and this is where the hooks
are<00:05:53.810> basically<00:05:54.620> this<00:05:54.770> is<00:05:54.919> how<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.160> works<00:05:55.370> it's

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
are basically this is how it works it's

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.719 
are basically this is how it works it's
very<00:05:55.880> simple<00:05:56.479> you<00:05:57.169> just<00:05:57.199> line<00:05:58.070> this<00:05:58.250> on<00:05:58.520> your

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
very simple you just line this on your

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.490 
very simple you just line this on your
arm<00:05:58.760> and<00:05:59.240> then<00:05:59.660> you<00:05:59.750> stick<00:05:59.960> it<00:06:00.080> down<00:06:00.199> like<00:06:00.380> this

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
arm and then you stick it down like this

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.659 
arm and then you stick it down like this
it<00:06:00.710> usually<00:06:00.949> takes<00:06:01.130> a<00:06:01.190> little<00:06:01.310> bit<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.580> a

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:01.669 
it usually takes a little bit of a

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.460 
it usually takes a little bit of a
helper<00:06:01.970> to<00:06:02.060> get<00:06:02.210> it<00:06:02.330> on<00:06:02.479> but<00:06:02.750> once<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.080> comes<00:06:03.320> on

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
helper to get it on but once it comes on

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.560 
helper to get it on but once it comes on
that's<00:06:03.650> pretty<00:06:03.770> tight<00:06:04.250> around<00:06:04.699> my<00:06:04.820> arm<00:06:05.060> it

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
that's pretty tight around my arm it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.330 
that's pretty tight around my arm it
should<00:06:05.840> go<00:06:05.960> pretty<00:06:06.229> much<00:06:06.349> above<00:06:06.740> your<00:06:06.949> your

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
should go pretty much above your your

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.860 
should go pretty much above your your
arm<00:06:07.520> muscles<00:06:07.789> so<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.270> your<00:06:08.419> arm<00:06:08.570> muscles

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
arm muscles so that your arm muscles

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.150 
arm muscles so that your arm muscles
should<00:06:08.960> kind<00:06:09.260> of<00:06:09.349> prevent<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.800> from<00:06:09.830> falling

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
should kind of prevent it from falling

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.010 
should kind of prevent it from falling
off<00:06:10.460> but<00:06:10.940> you<00:06:11.120> do<00:06:11.270> want<00:06:11.479> to<00:06:11.539> make<00:06:11.630> sure<00:06:11.780> that<00:06:11.900> it

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
off but you do want to make sure that it

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.659 
off but you do want to make sure that it
is<00:06:12.080> you<00:06:12.289> know<00:06:12.410> nice<00:06:12.590> and<00:06:12.770> tight<00:06:12.949> on<00:06:12.979> there<00:06:13.310> not

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
is you know nice and tight on there not

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:14.830 
is you know nice and tight on there not
so<00:06:13.849> tight<00:06:14.150> that<00:06:14.180> it<00:06:14.330> cuts<00:06:14.570> off<00:06:14.690> your

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
so tight that it cuts off your

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.330 
so tight that it cuts off your
circulation<00:06:14.990> of<00:06:15.500> course<00:06:15.710> but<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.010> do<00:06:16.130> want<00:06:16.310> to

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
circulation of course but you do want to

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.189 
circulation of course but you do want to
make<00:06:16.490> sure<00:06:16.520> that<00:06:16.729> it<00:06:16.849> stays<00:06:17.090> on<00:06:17.389> and<00:06:17.810> obviously

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
make sure that it stays on and obviously

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.930 
make sure that it stays on and obviously
I<00:06:18.470> have<00:06:18.620> a<00:06:18.650> hole<00:06:18.919> cut<00:06:19.190> out<00:06:19.220> for<00:06:19.490> the<00:06:19.580> bottom

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
I have a hole cut out for the bottom

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.719 
I have a hole cut out for the bottom
because<00:06:20.120> that's<00:06:20.330> where<00:06:20.660> the<00:06:20.990> iPod<00:06:21.800> headphone

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
because that's where the iPod headphone

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.279 
because that's where the iPod headphone
jack<00:06:22.970> is<00:06:23.210> on<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:23.599> Nano<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:24.139> fit

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
jack is on the Nano and the fit

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:26.439 
jack is on the Nano and the fit
generation<00:06:24.740> and<00:06:25.099> so<00:06:25.490> I<00:06:25.520> have<00:06:25.699> that<00:06:25.880> part<00:06:26.180> cut

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:26.449 
generation and so I have that part cut

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:28.900 
generation and so I have that part cut
out<00:06:26.570> right<00:06:26.780> there<00:06:27.139> so<00:06:27.830> if<00:06:27.979> you<00:06:28.099> want<00:06:28.340> to<00:06:28.460> do

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
that for you know this one right here

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.800 
that for you know this one right here
I'll<00:06:30.949> put<00:06:31.160> the<00:06:31.280> velcro<00:06:31.490> over<00:06:31.820> here<00:06:32.120> on<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.930 
I'll put the velcro over here on the
back<00:06:32.990> here<00:06:33.380> and<00:06:33.530> then<00:06:34.520> just<00:06:34.699> stick<00:06:34.820> it

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
back here and then just stick it

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.550 
back here and then just stick it
together<00:06:35.240> just<00:06:35.510> like<00:06:35.960> this<00:06:36.110> and<00:06:36.289> you'll<00:06:36.409> have

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
together just like this and you'll have

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.080 
together just like this and you'll have
a<00:06:36.590> little<00:06:36.830> piece<00:06:37.039> of<00:06:37.070> velcro<00:06:37.370> up<00:06:37.669> here<00:06:37.909> which

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
a little piece of velcro up here which

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.180 
a little piece of velcro up here which
you<00:06:38.270> can<00:06:38.419> stick<00:06:38.719> down<00:06:39.260> like<00:06:39.440> that<00:06:39.620> so<00:06:39.800> that's

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
you can stick down like that so that's

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.520
