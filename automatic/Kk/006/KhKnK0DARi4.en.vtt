the analog stick when I'm tilted right

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
the analog stick when I'm tilted right
to<00:00:47.070> start<00:00:47.280> circling<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.239> doing<00:00:48.899> this

you are looking to get a lot of pills
doing<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> circle<00:01:02.399> strafing<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:03.390> not

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
doing this circle strafing it's not

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
doing this circle strafing it's not
going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> happen<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.040> mainly

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
going to happen because this is mainly

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
going to happen because this is mainly
required<00:01:06.110> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.260> mainly<00:01:07.470> for

so your main job is not to get thousands

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.219 
so your main job is not to get thousands
of<00:01:25.410> kills<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.190> as<00:01:26.700> you'd<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.300> some<00:01:27.660> video

at you can see right there Iron Man
breaking<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.900> walls<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> be

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
breaking all those walls so it can be

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.440 
breaking all those walls so it can be
the<00:01:47.400> most<00:01:47.580> exposed<00:01:48.030> target<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> mobileme

the most exposed target in the mobileme

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.490 
the most exposed target in the mobileme
you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.110> through<00:01:52.350> there

it down and another tip I have is not

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
it down and another tip I have is not
the<00:01:58.770> circle<00:01:59.160> straight<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.729> whole<00:01:59.910> time<00:02:00.180> see

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
the circle straight the whole time see

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590 
the circle straight the whole time see
right<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.140> honest<00:02:01.759> basically<00:02:02.759> stall<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.330> even

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
right be honest basically stall and even

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.479 
right be honest basically stall and even
friend<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.020> me<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.369> some<00:02:05.430> kills<00:02:05.789> but

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
friend to me so I can get some kills but

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.040 
friend to me so I can get some kills but
circle<00:02:08.489> strafing<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:09.000> probably<00:02:09.509> most<00:02:09.869> helpful

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
circle strafing is probably most helpful

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.220 
circle strafing is probably most helpful
when<00:02:13.050> you're<00:02:13.610> doing<00:02:14.610> good<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.060> Gunners<00:02:15.840> good

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
when you're doing good and Gunners good

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.170 
when you're doing good and Gunners good
and<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:17.340> sound<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> nice<00:02:18.030> little

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and just sound like a nice little

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.240 
and just sound like a nice little
connection<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.930 

another<00:02:21.910> tip<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.300> have<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:24.220> watch<00:02:24.640> where

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
another tip I have is to watch where

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.420 
another tip I have is to watch where

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
your Gunners looking as you can see at

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.970 
your Gunners looking as you can see at

big<00:02:33.130> rectangle<00:02:33.480> that's<00:02:34.480> where<00:02:34.780> your<00:02:34.930> gunner

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
big rectangle that's where your gunner

big rectangle that's where your gunner
is<00:02:35.380> looking<00:02:35.770> as<00:02:35.920> opposed<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.640> what<00:02:36.670> you're

valco 3 has added to the game so you can
just<00:02:56.100> see<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.489> all<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.120> stuff<00:02:58.300> what<00:02:58.810> they've

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
just see and all that stuff what they've

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.320 
just see and all that stuff what they've
been<00:02:59.080> is<00:02:59.230> listen<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.940> attack

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
been is listen and in the attack

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.960 
been is listen and in the attack
helicopters<00:03:02.080> I<00:03:02.350> don't<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.489> recommend

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
helicopters I don't really recommend

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.240 
helicopters I don't really recommend
going<00:03:04.330> out<00:03:04.660> into<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.050> outside<00:03:05.590> view<00:03:05.620> of<00:03:06.070> them

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
going out into the outside view of them

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.960 
going out into the outside view of them
because<00:03:06.690> i<00:03:07.690> think<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:08.800> easy<00:03:08.980> to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.130 

maneuver<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.239> helicopter<00:03:13.390> when<00:03:14.020> you're

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
maneuver in the helicopter when you're

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.260 
maneuver in the helicopter when you're
in<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.290> combat<00:03:14.739> view<00:03:15.010> then<00:03:15.310> else<00:03:15.730> i<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.000> i

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
in the combat view then else i do i

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.449 
in the combat view then else i do i
think<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.600> might<00:03:16.690> even<00:03:16.930> be<00:03:17.050> easier<00:03:17.650> because

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
think it might even be easier because

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.490 
think it might even be easier because
when<00:03:19.090> you're<00:03:19.239> on<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.420> outside<00:03:19.810> view<00:03:19.870> you

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
when you're on the outside view you

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.090 
when you're on the outside view you
can't<00:03:20.770> see<00:03:20.980> any<00:03:21.100> enemies<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:23.860> kind

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
can't see any enemies and it's just kind

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.250 
can't see any enemies and it's just kind
of<00:03:24.130> harder<00:03:24.459> but<00:03:24.640> as<00:03:24.910> opposed<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.660> Jets<00:03:26.049> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
of harder but as opposed to the Jets the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.590 
of harder but as opposed to the Jets the
Jets<00:03:26.290> as<00:03:26.739> much<00:03:26.980> easier<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.549> maneuver<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.239> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
Jets as much easier to maneuver in the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.030 
Jets as much easier to maneuver in the
outside<00:03:29.290> view<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> combat<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:32.040> that's

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
outside view in the combat you that's

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.890 
outside view in the combat you that's
about<00:03:33.280> all<00:03:33.340> i<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:34.000> circle<00:03:34.420> strafing<00:03:34.600> and
