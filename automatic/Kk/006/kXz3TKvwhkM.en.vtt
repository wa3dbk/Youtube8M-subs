even and powerful from you know the
entire<00:02:38.189> range<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> instrument<00:02:38.819> there<00:02:39.359> no

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
entire range of the instrument there no

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.629 
entire range of the instrument there no
real<00:02:39.629> dead<00:02:39.870> spots<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.129> know<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.340> lowest

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
real dead spots so you know the lowest

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.780 
real dead spots so you know the lowest
note<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.239> violin<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.689> low

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.270 

there's<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.970> sort<00:02:49.240> of<00:02:49.330> sound<00:02:49.600> and<00:02:49.900> then<00:02:50.590> all

the way up the entire range of the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.810 
the way up the entire range of the
instrument<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.280> same<00:02:54.490> sort<00:02:54.730> of

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
instrument you get that same sort of

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.260 
instrument you get that same sort of
focus<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.600> intensity<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.910> really

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
focus and intensity that is really

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.330 
focus and intensity that is really
unheard<00:02:58.630> of<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:59.020> mean<00:02:59.140> most<00:02:59.380> violins<00:02:59.830> or<00:03:00.010> most

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
unheard of I mean most violins or most

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.860 
unheard of I mean most violins or most
acoustic<00:03:00.790> instruments<00:03:01.300> as<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.510> know<00:03:01.630> have

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
acoustic instruments as you know have

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.750 
acoustic instruments as you know have
some<00:03:02.140> sort<00:03:02.350> of<00:03:02.410> dead<00:03:02.740> areas<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.520> just

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
some sort of dead areas it's just

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.420 
some sort of dead areas it's just
physics<00:03:04.350> somehow<00:03:05.350> he<00:03:05.410> was<00:03:05.620> able<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:05.950> always

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
physics somehow he was able to always

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.010 
physics somehow he was able to always
get<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.820> you<00:03:07.090> know<00:03:07.210> light<00:03:07.510> or<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.810> best

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
get it you know light or the best

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.930 
get it you know light or the best
instruments<00:03:08.500> are<00:03:08.650> just<00:03:09.100> incredibly<00:03:09.490> even<00:03:09.820> and

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
instruments are just incredibly even and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:18.270 
instruments are just incredibly even and
easy<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.240> play

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.770 

I<00:03:20.670> mean<00:03:21.670> if<00:03:21.760> you're<00:03:21.880> standing<00:03:22.270> next<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.570> an

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
I mean if you're standing next to an

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.270 
I mean if you're standing next to an
idiot's<00:03:23.260> not<00:03:23.410> translating<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.070> it's

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
idiot's not translating but it's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.180 
idiot's not translating but it's
incredibly<00:03:24.880> loud<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.480> actually<00:03:26.130> when<00:03:27.130> you

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
incredibly loud it's actually when you

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.330 
incredibly loud it's actually when you
playing<00:03:27.430> something<00:03:27.700> very<00:03:27.850> fast<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:30.130> notes

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
playing something very fast the notes

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.100 
playing something very fast the notes
just<00:03:30.580> kind<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.910> pop<00:03:31.090> out

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.930 

it<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.380> goes<00:03:38.830> you<00:03:39.190> know<00:03:39.310> or<00:03:39.430> if<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.670> playing

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
it just goes you know or if you playing

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:49.020 
it just goes you know or if you playing
separate<00:03:40.480> nodes<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.590> notes<00:03:47.830> just<00:03:48.070> tumble<00:03:48.910> out

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
separate nodes the notes just tumble out

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.780 
separate nodes the notes just tumble out
without<00:03:49.270> having<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.750> really<00:03:50.020> you<00:03:50.260> know<00:03:50.790> again

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
without having to really you know again

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.280 
without having to really you know again
that<00:03:52.060> branch<00:03:52.450> right<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.020> makes<00:03:53.170> it

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
that branch right that makes it

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.100 
that branch right that makes it
tremendous<00:03:53.739> difference
