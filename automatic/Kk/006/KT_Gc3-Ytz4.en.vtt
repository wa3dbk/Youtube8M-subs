little bit about Glen show paintings

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.149 
little bit about Glen show paintings
some<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.030> Glen<00:00:48.330> completed<00:00:49.050> last<00:00:49.230> fall<00:00:49.680> extra

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159

some that Glen completed last fall extra
for<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.400> show<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:51.479> a<00:00:51.600> group<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.989> twelve

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
for the show there's a group of twelve

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.899 
for the show there's a group of twelve
few<00:00:52.589> things<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.920> total<00:00:53.339> we're<00:00:53.519> showing<00:00:53.729> a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
few things in total we're showing a

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.119 
few things in total we're showing a
fewer<00:00:55.220> selection<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.960> basically<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
fewer selection and basically it is a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.030 
fewer selection and basically it is a
body<00:00:59.400> of<00:00:59.550> work<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.210> came<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:01.739> hole

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
body of work that came out of the hole

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.410 
body of work that came out of the hole
this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> four<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.820> five<00:01:06.000> years<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.720> work<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
this is a four or five years of work and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.600 
this is a four or five years of work and
Glen's<00:01:09.420> start<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:10.049> abstract<00:01:10.680> painter<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Glen's start as an abstract painter and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.270 
Glen's start as an abstract painter and
then<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> last<00:01:12.200> six<00:01:13.200> years<00:01:13.440> has<00:01:13.740> worked<00:01:13.979> more

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
then the last six years has worked more

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
then the last six years has worked more
and<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.120> fees<00:01:15.420> referential

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and more with kind of fees referential

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.640 
and more with kind of fees referential
geometric<00:01:16.950> forms<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> finals<00:01:18.150> oh<00:01:18.380> yeah<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> was

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
geometric forms and finals oh yeah I was

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980 
geometric forms and finals oh yeah I was
noticing<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:21.060> noticing<00:01:21.390> also<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.900> he

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
noticing I was noticing also that he

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.290 
noticing I was noticing also that he
sort<00:01:22.230> of<00:01:22.320> got<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.710> perspective<00:01:23.340> plane<00:01:24.000> so

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
sort of got this perspective plane so

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.880 
sort of got this perspective plane so
we've<00:01:24.390> got<00:01:24.600> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> horizon<00:01:25.170> line<00:01:25.440> there

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
we've got kind of a horizon line there

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.780 
we've got kind of a horizon line there
and<00:01:26.610> also<00:01:27.620> it<00:01:28.620> seems<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.130> he's<00:01:29.280> gotten<00:01:29.640> more

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
and also it seems like he's gotten more

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
and also it seems like he's gotten more
decorative<00:01:30.210> yes<00:01:31.020> he's<00:01:31.290> breaking<00:01:31.770> away<00:01:31.890> from

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
decorative yes he's breaking away from

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.540 
decorative yes he's breaking away from
symmetry<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.290> these<00:01:34.710> pictures<00:01:35.160> a<00:01:35.190> little<00:01:35.460> bit

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
symmetry and these pictures a little bit

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.330 
symmetry and these pictures a little bit
more<00:01:35.760> than<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.090> has<00:01:36.300> in<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.750> last<00:01:37.130> couple<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
more than he has in the last couple of

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.170 
more than he has in the last couple of
years

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
years

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
years
they're<00:01:39.360> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.690> these<00:01:39.870> almost<00:01:40.620> geometric

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
they're kind of these almost geometric

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.880 
they're kind of these almost geometric
into<00:01:41.580> place<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:42.270> he<00:01:42.450> has<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:43.320> confined

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
into place where he has very confined

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
into place where he has very confined
spaces<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:44.850> breaks<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.480> with<00:01:45.720> these

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
spaces and then breaks it up with these

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.620 
spaces and then breaks it up with these
natural<00:01:46.320> forms<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.920> new<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.240> flowers<00:01:48.240> or

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
natural forms that are new to flowers or

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.380 
natural forms that are new to flowers or
kind<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.080> feel<00:01:49.320> natural<00:01:49.620> growth<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.210> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
kind of feel natural growth and it's a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
kind of feel natural growth and it's a
balance<00:01:52.140> between<00:01:52.320> kind<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> biomorphic

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
balance between kind of biomorphic

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
balance between kind of biomorphic
shapes<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.330> geometric<00:01:54.930> shapes<00:01:55.260> but<00:01:55.440> all<00:01:55.650> in

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
shapes and geometric shapes but all in

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.880 
shapes and geometric shapes but all in
this<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.340> kind<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.680> captured<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
this very kind of captured in this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.969 
this very kind of captured in this
delineated<00:01:59.490> mannerism<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:01.080> he<00:02:01.140> does<00:02:01.470> kind<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
delineated mannerism now he does kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.650 
delineated mannerism now he does kind of
a<00:02:02.160> I<00:02:02.190> guess<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> would<00:02:03.360> call<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
a I guess what I would call a

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.590 
a I guess what I would call a
pointillism<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.300> looking

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
pointillism but the more I was looking

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.449 
pointillism but the more I was looking
at<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.780> realized<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.770> his<00:02:07.860> dots<00:02:08.190> are

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
at I realized that all of his dots are

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.229 
at I realized that all of his dots are
just<00:02:08.640> black<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:08.910> white<00:02:10.940> pointillism<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
just black and white pointillism in the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.000 
just black and white pointillism in the
sense<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.570> is<00:02:12.720> trying<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> describe<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.620> form

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
sense that is trying to describe a form

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.250 
sense that is trying to describe a form
that's<00:02:14.310> more<00:02:14.610> like<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.910> rhythm<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's more like a rhythm I like to

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.000 
that's more like a rhythm I like to
think<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.770> almost<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.070> syncopation<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
think of it almost like syncopation and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.410 
think of it almost like syncopation and
it's<00:02:20.010> also<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.580> it's<00:02:20.850> referencing

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it's also you know it's referencing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
it's also you know it's referencing
weaving<00:02:21.959> maybe<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.620> remaining<00:02:23.400> structures

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
weaving maybe and remaining structures

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.000 
weaving maybe and remaining structures
together<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.540> kind<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.020> brings<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.890> were

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
together so kind of brings in we were

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.590 
together so kind of brings in we were
talking<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> little<00:02:26.459> bit<00:02:26.610> about<00:02:26.820> outsider<00:02:27.330> art

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
talking a little bit about outsider art

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.570 
talking a little bit about outsider art
and<00:02:27.810> some<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.200> kind<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.950> obsessive

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
and some of the kind of obsessive

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.840 
and some of the kind of obsessive
acident<00:02:30.510> practices<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.590> those<00:02:32.310> artists

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
acident practices that those artists
