myself well what could be more
interesting<00:00:45.329> than<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.050> exactly<00:00:46.500> which

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
interesting than to see exactly which

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
interesting than to see exactly which

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
accurate that is but it does give some

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.949 
accurate that is but it does give some
indication<00:04:17.860> as<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.430> how<00:04:18.550> closely<00:04:19.090> match<00:04:19.660> these

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959
