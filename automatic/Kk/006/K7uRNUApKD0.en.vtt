00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
listed differently but the microphone is

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.580 
listed differently but the microphone is
easy<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.060> find<00:03:40.270> it's<00:03:40.450> usually<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.900> pink<00:03:41.320> color

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
easy to find it's usually a pink color

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.960 
easy to find it's usually a pink color
and<00:03:41.680> usually<00:03:42.160> has

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and usually has

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.590

but<00:03:45.190> what<00:03:46.190> else<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.490> there<00:03:46.640> let's<00:03:47.420> say<00:03:47.540> you

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
but what else is there let's say you

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.830 
but what else is there let's say you
have<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> guitar<00:03:48.290> amp<00:03:48.530> like<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.840> ridiculously

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
have a guitar amp like this ridiculously

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.480 
have a guitar amp like this ridiculously
low<00:03:51.080> cost<00:03:52.840> micro<00:03:53.840> cube

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
low cost micro cube

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.730 
low cost micro cube
now<00:03:55.490> the<00:03:55.550> micro<00:03:55.940> cube<00:03:56.240> is<00:03:56.840> recording<00:03:57.410> mono

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
now the micro cube is recording mono

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.160 
now the micro cube is recording mono
signals<00:03:58.250> from<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.430> guitar<00:03:58.730> so<00:03:59.660> what<00:03:59.840> you<00:03:59.960> end

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
signals from the guitar so what you end

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.500 
signals from the guitar so what you end
up<00:04:00.350> needing<00:04:00.530> for<00:04:00.890> that<00:04:02.140> is<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.290> single<00:04:03.680> plug

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
up needing for that is a single plug

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.880 
up needing for that is a single plug
you'll<00:04:05.510> notice<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.050> the<00:04:06.200> output<00:04:08.890> says

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
you'll notice that the output says

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.170 
you'll notice that the output says
record<00:04:10.310> out<00:04:10.520> slash<00:04:10.880> bones<00:04:12.760> that's<00:04:13.760> also<00:04:14.150> a

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
record out slash bones that's also a

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.259 
record out slash bones that's also a
quarter-inch<00:04:14.600> cable

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
quarter-inch cable

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.509 
quarter-inch cable
so<00:04:16.810> since<00:04:17.019> we<00:04:17.139> only<00:04:17.289> need<00:04:17.590> one<00:04:17.859> quarter-inch

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
so since we only need one quarter-inch

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.839 
so since we only need one quarter-inch
cable<00:04:18.759> because<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:19.299> mono<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.669> what<00:04:21.819> our

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
cable because it's mono this is what our

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.370 
cable because it's mono this is what our
cable<00:04:22.210> is<00:04:22.270> gonna<00:04:22.389> look<00:04:22.569> like<00:04:22.780> well<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.259> is

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
cable is gonna look like well this is

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.749 
cable is gonna look like well this is
the<00:04:23.440> one<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:23.740> have<00:04:24.009> you<00:04:24.160> may<00:04:24.310> be<00:04:24.370> able<00:04:24.639> to

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
the one that I have you may be able to

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.540 
the one that I have you may be able to
get<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.120> quarter<00:04:25.479> inch<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.050> bit<00:04:26.470> but<00:04:27.310> what<00:04:27.520> I

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
get the quarter inch to a bit but what I

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.120 
get the quarter inch to a bit but what I
end<00:04:27.759> up<00:04:27.880> having<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.330> do<00:04:28.569> is<00:04:28.889> getting<00:04:29.889> one<00:04:30.099> of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
end up having to do is getting one of

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.480 
end up having to do is getting one of
these<00:04:30.449> little<00:04:31.449> adapters<00:04:32.139> that<00:04:32.250> fits<00:04:33.250> right

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
these little adapters that fits right

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.309 
these little adapters that fits right
over<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.759> quarter<00:04:34.120> inch<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:36.900> first<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.110> to

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
over the quarter inch and first it to

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.900 
over the quarter inch and first it to
1/8<00:04:38.530> inch<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.009> that<00:04:39.190> way<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.520> plug<00:04:39.759> this

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
1/8 inch and that way you can plug this

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.020 
1/8 inch and that way you can plug this
into<00:04:40.120> your<00:04:40.240> computer<00:04:40.860> let's<00:04:41.860> talk<00:04:42.039> about<00:04:42.160> DJ

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
into your computer let's talk about DJ

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.249 
into your computer let's talk about DJ
mixers<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:45.520> you<00:04:45.789> have<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> DJ<00:04:46.599> mixer

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
mixers so you have a DJ mixer

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.510 
mixers so you have a DJ mixer
maybe<00:04:47.770> your<00:04:47.979> DJ<00:04:48.280> mixer<00:04:48.639> has<00:04:49.590> XLR<00:04:50.590> outs<00:04:50.830> but

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
maybe your DJ mixer has XLR outs but

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.930 
maybe your DJ mixer has XLR outs but

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
adapting where the heck is it

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.950 
adapting where the heck is it
it's<00:05:10.030> simple<00:05:10.360> on<00:05:10.479> one<00:05:10.690> side<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.110> have<00:05:11.139> the<00:05:12.960> two

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
it's simple on one side you have the two

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.040 
it's simple on one side you have the two
RCA<00:05:14.199> channels<00:05:14.919> and<00:05:15.130> then<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.310> other<00:05:15.430> side<00:05:16.050> and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050

here's one of those cheapo preamps works

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.110 
here's one of those cheapo preamps works
fairly<00:05:33.490> well

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
fairly well

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.770 
fairly well
the<00:05:34.780> output<00:05:35.200> is<00:05:35.470> XLR<00:05:36.280> XLR<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.420> highest

the<00:06:25.660> good<00:06:25.810> news<00:06:25.960> is<00:06:26.140> that<00:06:26.290> these<00:06:26.440> cables<00:06:26.890> are

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
the good news is that these cables are

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.440 
the good news is that these cables are
fairly<00:06:27.580> cheap<00:06:28.140> of<00:06:29.140> course<00:06:29.460> they<00:06:30.460> cost<00:06:30.760> more<00:06:31.120> if

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
fairly cheap of course they cost more if

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
fairly cheap of course they cost more if
they're<00:06:31.810> longer<00:06:32.800> in<00:06:33.070> length

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.780 

but<00:06:36.130> you<00:06:36.280> know<00:06:36.400> probably<00:06:36.970> a<00:06:37.120> 10-foot<00:06:38.640> you<00:06:39.640> know

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
but you know probably a 10-foot you know

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.360 
but you know probably a 10-foot you know
quarter<00:06:40.240> and<00:06:40.330> maybe<00:06:41.020> do<00:06:41.200> a<00:06:41.230> head<00:06:41.380> of<00:06:41.500> it<00:06:41.560> so<00:06:42.220> now

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
quarter and maybe do a head of it so now

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.910 
quarter and maybe do a head of it so now
that<00:06:42.430> you<00:06:42.640> figured<00:06:43.150> out<00:06:43.300> how<00:06:43.720> to<00:06:43.780> plug<00:06:44.440> your
