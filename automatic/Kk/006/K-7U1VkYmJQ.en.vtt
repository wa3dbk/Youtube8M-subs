00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 do you have 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.820
 there are very good boys and girls good and 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.650
 more than two months ago the last 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.480
 important update of your profile in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.950
 clash of plants that was that in the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.970
 which put the skills to the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.470
 heroes then yes it is true that 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.630
 they did some small 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.700
 update in which they changed their 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.620
 behavior or they reduced their lives and 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.240
 that kind of thing but really 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.400
 important since more than two months ago 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.950
 we do not have anything new in the game like this 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.170
 how well both yesterday and today have gone 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.080
 posting various updates that 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.580
 are going to put in brief is to assume by 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.230
 what I have been told is going to be 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.210
 this week but if it's not this week it 's 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.430
 the one that comes very sure although I trust 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.640
 which has to be this surely between 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.400
 on Wednesday and Friday so good 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.370
 first of all yesterday they published that they were going 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.650
 to put a new feature in the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.930
 walls that is that now as of 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.159
 level 6 will not only be able to climb with 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.450
 gold but they will also be able to 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.790
 come up with elixir this good in my opinion 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.799
 in naturalization not precisely 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 necessary but that does not really come 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.320
 bad because a lot of people 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.940
 especially from City Hall 8 it 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.340
 it requires a lot of gold to upload them 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.930
 to the maximum and to climb the wall to the maximum 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.970
 then there comes a point at which 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.190
 you have everything of elixir butt and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.510
 let's say you're just looking for gold because there is 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.010
 over there is when the people to the best 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.530
 you start to create armies of dragons 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.210
 to farmar directly well then now 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.340
 And this is not going to be like that , we're going to have 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.290
 both resources to go up the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.600
 wall which will do us much more 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.850
 comfortable our progress at the time of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.160
 level up town hall taking 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.660
 everything to the maximum included the wall by 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.450
 another side we will also be able to 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.130
 select a row of blocks of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.010
 wall as we did before at the time of 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.050
 edit to move them in our village 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.660
 but we will also be able to upload all 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.160
 that line of wall at the same time that is 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.960
 we will not have to go block by 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.940
 blocks if for example we have five 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.170
 blocks and it's going to cost us a million 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.060
 we do not spend a million and we raise the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.050
 five flip blocks instead of going 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 one after the other well more things are this 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.100
 you can see on your social networks in 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.140
 facebook on twitter the officers of 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 clash of plants but a little thing that only 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.860
 can be seen in the forum or that I do not 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.160
 I usually find the forum is the following 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 from now replays 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.890
 attacks and 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.620
 so it also puts the replays 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 live that is to say I suppose in which 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.230
 they do in clan war that can 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.599
 enter certain amount of people to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.459
 see them now it's not just going to show 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.170
 how they release the troops but also 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.569
 let's see the army that has 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.129
 the attacker so we can see if there 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.690
 some troop that releases us some 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.629
 spell that does not loose if castle arrives 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.549
 yes no no I to castle this in at the time 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.319
 to see him in war and clans is fine 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.480
 especially if you are going to record a video 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.459
 because so you can see if the player 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.409
 does one hundred percent without using all the 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.590
 spells or all the troops or me that I know 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.140
 or they attack you and you see that they make you a 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.609
 49% ceases because the game is won as a 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.140
 It is the best the player can spare you 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.269
 troops and has not wanted to release the no 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.549
 then from now on we will be able to see 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.440
 those things that is unnecessary yes that 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.200
 is cool to me too at least 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.030
 like not to say you do not lose anything and then 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.030
 it's additional information that the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.329
 game well last update that 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.829
 I just saw a ratillo in his 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.019
 facebook official act immediately I've gone 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.629
 to the class forum classes and also 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.120
 was there is they are going to draw archers 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.519
 and level barbarians 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.349
 because this good I think it's more 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.120
 necessary to put in a new troop that 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.069
 level up those that already exist but not 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.260
 They are not bad, it's not bad because 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.940
 the barbarians with the update of the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.459
 kings in which the rival's rage or 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.890
 of affects the king to the barbarians too 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.629
 they are used quite and the archers 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.790
 also because for farmers they are fast 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.040
 are cheap and are effective then a 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.930
 level 7 of goalkeepers can be a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.930
 very important change when it comes to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.790
 form in the game yes it is true that 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.310
 as much value as it acquires can be 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.930
 a city hall 9 to the maximum level 6 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.250
 therefore I consider that this 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.410
 update is going to make it just 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.440
 can go up to level 7 with City Hall 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.569
 10 but it's a suppose I think it's going to 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.430
 be like that then let's do a little 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.799
 of spoiler and I'm going to comment on two little things 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.239
 this yes we sure worth in 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.650
 what I have said so far is very safe 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.389
 that will come out in the future 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.550
 update but what can you say 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.570
 now they are rather rumors that have 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.380
 arrived but what happens is that they have 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.120
 come from pretty reliable people and well 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.919
 one of them is that they are going to get a 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.580
 new troop more than a new troop and 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.139
 surely it will be this month 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 I did not know what was going on the update 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.379
 as soon as they told me then 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.960
 it may fall in this new 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.530
 update or maybe not 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.330
 simply another thing that I have thought 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.710
 is that this new troop of which I 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.849
 they talked were the barbarians and the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.550
 archers that until today have not done 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.879
 public healthy as another dish with 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.860
 troop but yes as a new level 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.689
 then that may be for a real side 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.750
 then another thing and it 's already so I 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.610
 it seems pretty much more fictional is 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.159
 that finally they are going to take out the long-awaited 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.259
 level 11 city ​​hall do not go to 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.090
 google and look for city ​​hall level 11 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.039
 you're all going to see the typical one is in black 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.539
 with that is the city hall 10 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.650
 but instead of having lava, it has 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:18.419
 like blue lava I do not know a bit it's like very 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.610
 but instead like the colors 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.770
 I think those are just fun art the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.259
 people super fan of clash oakland will 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.919
 and dedicated to draw up stuff 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.960
 to the internet and we should not ignore 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.430
 one hundred percent of those things but good 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.650
 this is already doing a little more than 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.180
 spoiler I do not know if this is going to be true 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.099
 It will be a lie but if it comes out I have 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.870
 understood that it will be already more face 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.420
 November of December is to say end of 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.190
 year and beginning of next 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.600
 that does not concern the update that 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.630
 let's see throughout this week 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.460
 that comes in clans classes but to me 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.960
 they like it does not sound better so 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.140
 important as those that got into 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.450
 July but yes they are quite 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:00.600
 curious not especially the fact of power 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:03.510
 see in the repetitions what the 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.010
 player who attacks you leads is not maybe 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.450
 for me it is even more important than 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.920
 take them and the one simply because 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.180
 I think they will put it to 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.970
 City Hall says and as I do not have 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.950
 City Hall 10 is not exactly 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.810
 important but good I understand that for 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.300
 those that do have it is a 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.010
 cool update and what good 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.530
 start saving elixir just in case 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.660
 come out this week to upload it so 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.160
 I hope you have helped 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.170
 video any questions threaten in 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.850
 comments and see you in the next 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.850
 video 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.850
 subscribe 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.820
