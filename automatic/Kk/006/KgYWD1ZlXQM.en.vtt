 or the aussies with base welcome to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.529
 another new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.480
 big title auto 5 online new cars 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.990
 analysis of the dlc 1.25 and 1.27 about the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.340
 dlc the golden game and this was something that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 I wanted to bring you from yesterday 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 because as you can remember in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 the page of what the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.220
 angers web in rockstar games have 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.590
 revealed some photos of this new dlc 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.170
 and 1 and today I'm going to talk to you a little 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 approach these vehicles here as 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.340
 come we find the first 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.790
 image that would be the pegas and osiris that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.440
 this vehicle in real life could 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 represent a lamborghini although the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 more similar model and that its imitation 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.160
 is the pagani huayra is a name 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 quite weird and how they see it is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 exactly the same vehicle because 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 we can mount it by the doors now 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.120
 let's go with the benefactor string link gt 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.680
 this vehicle we already know what vehicle is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.230
 since this image and we had not been 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 represented just before is neither more nor 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 less than a mercedes benz 300 sl the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.299
 which is a classic of the Mercedes 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.609
 it is known as with the name of 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.740
 mercedes gull wings which is 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.929
 perfect now we find this 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.179
 elegant vehicle which is a vehicle 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:21.479
 black with a pretty attractive painting 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.539
 and this vehicle is neither more nor less than 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.569
 a rolls royce ok a classic vehicle 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.039
 that the truth is I do not know is impressive 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.009
 inside I think it's a vehicle 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.990
 of luxury and it is also very executive now 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 we find the following 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.090
 vehicle that this is the album and virgo ok 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.819
 this is a classic car is not a car 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 of these years since if we represent it 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.969
 to real life this would be a cadillac 68 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.829
 which could look pretty good and 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.840
 could be competition against another type 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.579
 of vehicles the truth that this one of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.829
 I'm getting very excited 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.719
 since it looks pretty good and if you already 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.579
 we take some things into account a lot 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.259
 people also told me hey but the clothes 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.569
 what are you going to do and all this clothes 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.270
 surely it is a representation of what 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.160
 which is in real life the designs of 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.619
 louis vuitton because here as you can 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.680
 be doing and appreciating I'm 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.750
 teaching a louis vuitton bag and how 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.659
 you may be noticing if we do not compare 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.430
 that with what the vehicle brings and little 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.739
 thing else we can notice that they are the 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.659
 very similar symbols and we can do 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.430
 reference that would be a louis vuitton 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.230
 it is also very possible that they leave 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.909
 some kind gus and that the truth 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.620
 they would look pretty good and I think that 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.810
 it's pretty good to add all this 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.060
 since they would give a fashionable touch to 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 game and it would be like more turned on not the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.030
 I'm really attracted to all this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.340
 because I can not imagine you go to the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.200
 beverly hills boutique there in what 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.579
 is doing the game and there are only sell 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.049
 that kind of clothes I do not know would be very 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.480
 selective to see that it would look pretty 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.430
 realistic and it would look great because if 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.919
 you know in beverly hills there's the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.689
 better clothes that are very expensive and that that 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.000
 It would give a perfect touch and I do not know 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.650
 imagine that the shirt was very expensive 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.389
 and it costs you that if I what it costs you 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.340
 a repair of a car and it would be 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.780
 pretty realistic so kids are still 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.639
 in his opinion in the comments but 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.069
 they like this video say the one that has 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.919
 seemed all this dlc the date very 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.659
 be sure the 9th of this month since 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.370
 they told us that the next week and 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.840
 they usually always do it on Tuesday 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.480
 so I hope you like this video 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.769
 I say in your opinion in the comments 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.480
 and for people who wonder where 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.640
 removed all this information I have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.870
