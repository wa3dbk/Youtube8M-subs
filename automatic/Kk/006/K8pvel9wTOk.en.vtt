00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi sweeties and here I am with a new one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.150
 video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.090
 today I have to see my glazes 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 favorite for the 2013 summer season 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.580
 I must admit I must admit that I 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.430
 I use all colors all year 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.420
 so I can use more glazes 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 very bright enamels even in winter 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.019
 like enamels or even dark black parks 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 even in the stables there are some colors 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.530
 which I prefer to use in the summer 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.290
 in short, that I often put in fact 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.230
 start right away and show you mine 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.180
 beloved bitters can not miss i 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.730
 glitter for the summer season me 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.610
 I like them a lot and I'll show you 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.370
 the four glitter in the pupal thumb 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 that I love the first smart the nail 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.090
 polish number 824 a blue with glitter 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 beautiful pink and second enamel 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 invasion classic silver but really 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 I work a lot and the number 800 17 on 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.130
 third very particular enamel 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.189
 because there are glitter areas in red 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.700
 already very bright and pink glitter is 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.729
 the number 800 21 the last glitter nail 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 polish is the number 800 25 and is a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.909
 really fantastic turquoise now there 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 I show the combinations instead 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.790
 I will do on hands and pines then the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.930
 first pairing is by laila I will use 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.470
 on the feet the seramik f number 79 which has 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 a beautiful green literate while 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.580
 on the nails of the hands 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.020
 I will use to be friends 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 the number 83 a fantastic milk the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.240
 second pairing instead it is of them on 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.640
 orange tones then on the feet I have 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.690
 thought to use a color 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.030
 light orange number 221 a while 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.900
 on the hands a darker orange more 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.210
 turned on the number 210 to the third 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.490
 indeed, it concerns sugar 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.040
 matte of kiko and I thought of 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.340
 use on toenails the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.250
 number 640 that a glittery orange 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.020
 with beautiful yellow reflections and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.959
 while on the hands I thought of 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.230
 use the number 631 always sugar 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.990
 amat which has a light salmon color is 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.820
 really very very nice and these 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.100
 will be the drag that I will use 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.930
 more this summer I tell you I do not put 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.030
 often the same color enamel 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 on the hands on the feet 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.030
 I like to play with colors in the sense 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.680
 that maybe I put glitter on my hands and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.480
 on the feet I put the same color 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.730
 satin or park in short, I like it a little 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 the contrast or vice versa 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.080
 and now I'll show you the fluorescent colors 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.900
 that I prefer 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.420
 then obviously the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.810
 first is of the weak of the priests apart from the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.200
 number 43 a fluo fuchsia is really 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.880
 fantastic I tell myself advise of 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.550
 apply it only on artificial nails 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.269
 I honestly have already used it 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.340
 several times also last summer and 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.920
 What does a public enamel base do one 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.470
 white enamel and then apply the color 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.269
 fluo and I have never had any problems 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.459
 my natural nails the second color 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.120
 fluorescent that I love is plaid and b 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.550
 number 5 is a fantastic green and the 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.390
 third very particular color because 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.110
 besides being fluo and also 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 a pastel color so it's great is 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.730
 dell'astra and number 502 I do 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.110
 see the last two colors that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.069
 I will use this summer 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.920
 the first has been used all year long all along 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.760
 and it is the color taupe my color 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.550
 favorite 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.330
 I will see two in particular 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:00.900
 the first of the kiko and in the number 319 lo 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.950
 I adore and according to a newcomer it is 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.110
 of the rimmel the number 710 this color 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.360
 I like it on both hands and feet 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.250
 here is if I have to use the same color 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.010
 on the sepia mario and use the color 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.010
 dove gray or another 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.489
 the color I love on my feet is burgundy 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.760
 I really like this burgundy 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:27.300
 here of the rimmel rises in the number 400 three 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.390
