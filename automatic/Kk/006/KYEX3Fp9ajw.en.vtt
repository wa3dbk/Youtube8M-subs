that I think is available is that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
that I think is available is that
there's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> switch<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:43.020> switch<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> back

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and forth and it basically does it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.289

between auto mode and a program mode the
auto<00:01:48.450> mode<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> scenery<00:01:49.710> and

detrimental<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:38.070> if<00:04:38.250> you're<00:04:38.430> gonna<00:04:38.550> be

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
detrimental to you if you're gonna be

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.420 
detrimental to you if you're gonna be
snapping<00:04:39.360> photos<00:04:39.810> very<00:04:40.650> quickly<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.400> very

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
snapping photos very quickly and very

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.820 
snapping photos very quickly and very
often<00:04:42.060> around<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.900> town<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.500> might<00:04:43.710> need

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
often around the town so you might need

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.650 
often around the town so you might need
to<00:04:43.980> pick<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.190> an<00:04:44.430> extra<00:04:44.760> battery<00:04:44.940> to<00:04:45.270> take<00:04:45.450> with

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
to pick up an extra battery to take with

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.660 
to pick up an extra battery to take with
you<00:04:45.780> because<00:04:46.230> for<00:04:46.620> me<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.920> hundred<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.430> seventy

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
you because for me a hundred and seventy

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.380 
you because for me a hundred and seventy
shots<00:04:47.970> is<00:04:48.270> an<00:04:48.660> average<00:04:49.290> maybe<00:04:49.980> hour<00:04:50.340> of<00:04:50.790> shots

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
shots is an average maybe hour of shots

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.680 
shots is an average maybe hour of shots
that<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.600> take<00:04:51.990> so<00:04:52.410> you<00:04:52.950> might<00:04:53.220> need<00:04:53.460> to<00:04:53.520> buy<00:04:54.390> an

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
that I take so you might need to buy an

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.780 
that I take so you might need to buy an
extra<00:04:55.050> battery<00:04:55.260> or<00:04:55.650> keep<00:04:56.070> something<00:04:56.370> around

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
extra battery or keep something around

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.450 
extra battery or keep something around
to<00:04:56.970> keep<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.420> battery<00:04:57.840> charged<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.280> let's

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
to keep that battery charged so let's

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.460 
to keep that battery charged so let's
get<00:04:59.610> down<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.060> bottom<00:05:00.240> line<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:01.080> camera

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
get down to the bottom line the camera

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.800 
get down to the bottom line the camera
is<00:05:01.620> lightweight<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:02.610> small<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.510> take

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
is lightweight it's small it can take

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140 
is lightweight it's small it can take
great<00:05:04.080> pictures<00:05:04.590> for<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.310> relative<00:05:05.760> size

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
great pictures for the relative size

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.020 
great pictures for the relative size
that<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.020> camera<00:05:07.410> is<00:05:07.470> at<00:05:07.680> yes<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.640> battery

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
that the camera is at yes the battery

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.700 
that the camera is at yes the battery
life<00:05:09.210> may<00:05:09.540> be<00:05:09.600> a<00:05:09.720> little<00:05:09.900> bit<00:05:10.110> detrimental<00:05:10.650> to

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
life may be a little bit detrimental to

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.260 
life may be a little bit detrimental to
you<00:05:10.890> but<00:05:11.130> depending<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:11.670> what<00:05:11.850> you're<00:05:12.000> doing

on a daily basis and using the camera
for<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.630> 170<00:05:15.630> shots<00:05:15.870> is<00:05:16.050> going<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.320> be

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
for that 170 shots is going to be

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.960 
for that 170 shots is going to be
absolutely<00:05:17.100> fine

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
absolutely fine

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.450 
absolutely fine
it<00:05:18.210> takes<00:05:18.510> SD<00:05:19.020> cards<00:05:19.410> which<00:05:19.560> is<00:05:19.680> great<00:05:20.100> almost

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
it takes SD cards which is great almost

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.390 
it takes SD cards which is great almost
everybody<00:05:21.030> these<00:05:21.240> days<00:05:21.480> has<00:05:22.050> SD<00:05:22.680> cards<00:05:23.040> takes

everybody these days has SD cards takes
full<00:05:23.760> 1080p<00:05:24.479> video<00:05:24.990> that's<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.830> main<00:05:26.010> reason

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
full 1080p video that's the main reason

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
full 1080p video that's the main reason
why<00:05:26.430> I<00:05:26.550> got<00:05:26.850> this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
why I got this

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.059 
why I got this
cameras<00:05:27.600> I<00:05:27.720> want<00:05:27.870> to<00:05:27.930> use<00:05:28.050> as<00:05:28.229> a<00:05:28.350> vlog<00:05:28.680> camera

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
cameras I want to use as a vlog camera

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.219 
cameras I want to use as a vlog camera
and<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.729> works<00:05:29.910> great<00:05:30.000> for<00:05:30.449> that<00:05:30.509> it's<00:05:30.690> easy<00:05:30.990> as

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
and it works great for that it's easy as

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.499 
and it works great for that it's easy as
lightweight<00:05:31.500> its<00:05:31.889> handheld<00:05:32.160> has<00:05:32.550> an<00:05:32.759> ultra

lightweight its handheld has an ultra
wide-angle<00:05:34.199> lens<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.370> don't<00:05:35.550> need<00:05:35.669> any

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
wide-angle lens so I don't need any

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.180

attachments<00:05:36.599> or<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.020> hold<00:05:37.169> it<00:05:37.319> out<00:05:37.410> too<00:05:37.800> far

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
attachments or to hold it out too far

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.100 
attachments or to hold it out too far
from<00:05:38.400> me<00:05:38.610> when<00:05:39.090> I<00:05:39.120> want<00:05:39.389> to<00:05:39.479> speak<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.750> it<00:05:39.990> the

from me when I want to speak to it the

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.080 
from me when I want to speak to it the
audio<00:05:40.500> is<00:05:40.680> crisp<00:05:41.250> as<00:05:41.490> well<00:05:41.729> when<00:05:41.970> you're

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
audio is crisp as well when you're

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.089 
audio is crisp as well when you're
relatively<00:05:42.630> close<00:05:42.900> to<00:05:43.139> it<00:05:43.229> so<00:05:43.620> it's<00:05:43.770> a<00:05:43.800> great

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
relatively close to it so it's a great

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.950 
relatively close to it so it's a great
overall<00:05:44.550> video<00:05:45.150> camera<00:05:45.599> as<00:05:45.660> well<00:05:45.780> if<00:05:45.870> you're

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
overall video camera as well if you're

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.620 
overall video camera as well if you're
gonna<00:05:46.050> be<00:05:46.229> doing<00:05:46.500> some<00:05:46.740> casual<00:05:47.370> amateur<00:05:48.270> video

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
gonna be doing some casual amateur video

gonna be doing some casual amateur video
so<00:05:49.229> if<00:05:49.860> you<00:05:50.520> should<00:05:50.729> buy<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:50.910> sure<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.199> know<00:05:52.590> that

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
so if you should buy it sure I know that

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.950 
so if you should buy it sure I know that
the<00:05:52.979> 130<00:05:53.610> is<00:05:53.789> out<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.330> reason<00:05:54.690> why<00:05:54.810> it

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
the 130 is out and the reason why it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.339 
the 130 is out and the reason why it
went<00:05:55.050> over<00:05:55.319> the<00:05:55.410> 110<00:05:55.949> is<00:05:56.190> that<00:05:56.789> it<00:05:57.060> does<00:05:57.539> 1080p

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
went over the 110 is that it does 1080p

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.980 
went over the 110 is that it does 1080p
video<00:05:58.620> has<00:05:59.099> more<00:05:59.400> megapixels<00:05:59.699> and<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.599> using

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
video has more megapixels and is using

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.070 
video has more megapixels and is using
the<00:06:01.139> digit<00:06:01.710> 5<00:06:02.300> processor<00:06:03.300> if<00:06:03.690> you<00:06:03.780> look<00:06:03.960> at

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
the digit 5 processor if you look at

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.080 
the digit 5 processor if you look at
something<00:06:04.259> like<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.680> Canon<00:06:05.009> 130<00:06:05.849> it's

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
something like the Canon 130 it's

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.659 
something like the Canon 130 it's
actually<00:06:06.360> using<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.750> digit<00:06:07.110> 4<00:06:07.470> processor<00:06:08.220> so

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:08.669 
actually using the digit 4 processor so

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:10.730 
actually using the digit 4 processor so
what<00:06:09.270> it's<00:06:09.389> supposed<00:06:09.720> to<00:06:09.840> be<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.139> successor

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
what it's supposed to be the successor

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.950 
what it's supposed to be the successor
to<00:06:10.889> this<00:06:11.009> camera<00:06:11.460> is<00:06:11.610> actually<00:06:12.090> a<00:06:12.300> step<00:06:12.690> back

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
to this camera is actually a step back

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.200 
to this camera is actually a step back
in<00:06:13.229> many<00:06:13.740> ways<00:06:14.070> so<00:06:14.610> if<00:06:14.699> you're<00:06:14.849> considering

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
in many ways so if you're considering

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.990 
in many ways so if you're considering
getting<00:06:15.449> the<00:06:15.870> 110<00:06:16.380> over<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.770> 130<00:06:17.220> consider

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
getting the 110 over the 130 consider

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.879 
getting the 110 over the 130 consider
getting<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.300> 110<00:06:18.750> just<00:06:19.289> because<00:06:19.530> of<00:06:19.680> the

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
getting the 110 just because of the

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.670 
getting the 110 just because of the
advanced<00:06:20.250> technology<00:06:21.150> inside<00:06:21.720> again<00:06:22.590> it
