00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.519
 back with amazon business in this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.920
 second block we'll know how they are 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 made from liqueurs 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 the first part of the process I cabral 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 well the first part is when people 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.640
 receives the fruit 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 it is washed separately or 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 I just think that they are healthy that they are 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.700
 used 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.469
 they are brought after hygiene already 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.200
 We do not bring here beyond the factory. 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.840
 where they are cut right are 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.770
 put in a generation I do not lose the pain 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.570
 this is what they are macerating 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.660
 depending upon the amount is more 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.120
 generating a week three weeks 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.730
 Do you depend on the fruit or does it 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.160
 depending on the fruit mainly 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.010
 some fruits is the time of a generation 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.300
 is faster and another in time is a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 little longer 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.369
 The advantage of this process is that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 people can make the most of 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:23.040
 ingredients that time is once made 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.479
 this is in this process is that we already 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.630
 did before 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.970
 the genomic extract is obtained here 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.689
 I was working with jenipapo that was 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 a demonstration of genipapo that is me 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.360
 I genipap status here is this 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.490
 chat stadium is 2009 is the opposite of 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.680
 has an indefinite period of time 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.979
 value go to validity 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 so the only one is basically some fruit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.659
 in the form of the extract 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:59.500
 alcohol and sugar that I've stopped 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:03.490
 here on this path the pain I've stopped 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.620
 the amount of sugar sufficient to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.350
 the call that I already spoke about now maybe 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.140
 sure that's the case there jenipapo 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.630
 how much time is in the case of baggage is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.880
 most memorable is that you have 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.250
 leaves up to a longer time up to six 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.640
 months of a generation you extract all 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.640
 all is estimated the properties of the 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.970
 genipap is a fruit that it is 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.640
 spoils with is with difficulty that the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.459
 People see Jenipap Do not spoil you have 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.070
 one of his uncle Pope gave it lasts much longer 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.800
 time off the refrigerator because a 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.690
 other fruit is basically what I need 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.430
 then the fruit is the target and the sugar 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.160
 so I think I already made the tail is here 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.520
 inside right 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.170
 Look 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:59.860
 basically it is simply the dissolution 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:03.310
 of sugar in water and pinto will mix 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.350
 The essence of liqueur is the 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:10.239
 so I already have the quantity here 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.720
 required for this one. 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.720
 demonstration, we will simply 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.720
 add 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.370
 I already measured tcu the amount of 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.500
 alcohol that we need and I'm going to 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.530
 add a pass here just to give a 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.680
 washed in takes pleasure in wasting 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:42.530
 nothing because the extract is concentrated and 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.310
 every drop is worth a lot 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.380
 of fruit 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.800
 accuracy is a very important detail 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.300
 so your cabral is yours has to be 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.100
 I need because otherwise you can not 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.709
 repeat the process in these 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.870
 processes your cabral right now 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.220
 from the arrival of the fruit the extract is 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.360
 ready until the end we will 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.910
 arrive soon call you already 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.910
 there is some bottling it requires 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.120
 a little more care that requires a 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.400
 little more attention 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.230
 depending on the flower of the fruit because it has 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.500
 fat, right? 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.540
 some fruits are fat as steel 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.940
 Have Genipina Own Fist 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.210
 The genipapo itself has a bit of 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.640
 fat little else has in the future 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:34.729
 so what happens is that if people 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.289
 Do not let it get old, clear it 's a while. 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.150
 bigger 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:45.890
 he will rush or he will leave it like this 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.810
 the rise will goes and this will flow 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.130
 material that is suspended then the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.840
 people are careful to see people have to 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.600
 is to eliminate as much as possible the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 that stuff get registration through 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.250
 filtration efficiency 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.790
 This action mix I'm doing here 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.070
 in this small amount 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.220
 in reality in the day to day of the 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.020
 factory when I make 300 liters of 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.050
 mix action is done on that in that 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.380
 milk mixture is here because it is 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.480
 Of course it does not even fit in there to do 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.320
 this exploration can already do with a 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.550
 Spoon 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.500
 but in practice it is made in the mixer 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.620
 your cabral after all this process 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.950
 we just see the cast is ready 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.920
 no he is not quite ready 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:44.270
 lack is the rainy season and 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:48.550
 aging process where the 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:52.790
 fruit aroma is the avaÃ­ will stand out 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:55.760
 to the smell not the aroma of the alcohol that remains 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.010
 in the only newly developed 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.570
 only for you who are at home understand 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.330
 what your cabral just explained 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.130
 This is the liquor he just finished. 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.930
 make it to show us the 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.630
 manufacturing process and not yet 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.060
 has undergone this process of 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.670
 this one is the liquor after you rush 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.070
 you notice that the color is more intense 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.410
 that the lico that has just been made and the 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.240
 It smells so much smoother you do not feel it. 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.700
 smell of alcohol you only smell 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.880
 of the fruit is what makes the liquor so 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.340
 appreciated and so striking its cabral a 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:34.730
 aging what is the next step 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:45.830
 the next step is to filter after 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:49.070
 filtered got bottled out and he 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:51.190
 then it is bottled and after 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:58.490
 to bottle you he will be power 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:07:05.120
 pasteurized boils 75 degrees by 15 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:09.380
 20 minutes once we go through 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:10.820
 next step is the labeling and then 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.590
 is ready for the end consumer and 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.440
 can make the inspection to see if it has 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.800
 some 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.980
 with defects is there any precipitate 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.470
 something everything that happened in the 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.420
 quality of quality we do 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:27.360
 also the ideal test to see if the 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:30.390
 alcohol is what it is to write the 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:34.950
 label and passed in these tests the people 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.720
 pack the letters you said 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.800
 after bottling will still be 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.690
 pasteurized 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.850
 even with all this process all this 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.070
 care we see here in preparation 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:48.030
 it still goes through pasteurizing this 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.790
 the Pacha because it is a more assurance in 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.470
 quality 

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.720
 this was the second block of business 

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:57.240
 the process of manufacturing the 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.930
 liqueurs do not leave there that we come back already 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.930
 for the third block
