00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.430
 hello everyone this is fabien I you 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.280
 found today for a video 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.830
 tutorial so it's a glitch or a hack 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.530
 you thought what you want for 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.839
 do your custom classes in 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.320
 color so it's really very simple 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.809
 to achieve 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.480
 it will take you just by itself against a 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.040
 android phone is an iphone so there 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.960
 you see well that my classes multi 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.050
 gaming and czech know how to do it myself 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 corentin cham and jb so are white 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.079
 quite simply 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.960
 so I modified them via the app 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.220
 call of duty elite on mobile so this 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.449
 that you're going to have to do that's all 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.440
 simply go to the app store 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.000
 iphone either on the playsport of android 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.820
 to be able to download the application 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.590
 call of duty elite mobile then we get 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.479
 so find on my samsung galaxy s 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.640
 iii so I frankly galley for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.320
 door or film because I had to road and my 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.660
 phone that I was not really for 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.540
 but good to be able to use android 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.330
 to then be able to film my screen 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.590
 so you see there but five classes and 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.060
 well just what are you going 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.610
 do you go click on your classes 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.590
 so sorry, it never reams a bit because that 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.909
 use the wi fi it does it transcribed 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.290
 the image of my phone where I am 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.490
 sorry it never trains but good 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 should be understandable to all 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.060
 then you edit the titles of your 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.820
 places by clicking on it you put a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.189
 hat and a so a hat going from 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.869
 one to nine to put your classes in 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.740
 color so there I put reality gaming 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 with hat 1 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.930
 access leach make hat 2 and so and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.310
 so the hat is not 4 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.280
 terrible since it's dark blue 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 agree very badly with the fund that 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.210
 are behind your classes and so 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 the name of your class will not be very 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.660
 very legible so if that for that happen 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.030
 to the class corentin cham so instead 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.750
 to put hat 4 jimmy hat 5 everything 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.940
 simply to shift one rank and 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.500
 so at each color every hat 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.300
 corresponds to a color so I you 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.280
 put all that in the description 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.930
 story you know a little bit 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 color meters and do not test them a 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.920
 by one because it's still quite long 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.210
 bath never even it's not good 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.800
 complicated is still quite long 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.600
 so here you see that every time 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.330
 that you do saved on your class to 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.260
 sending to your ps3 and so is well the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.310
 only thing you have to do game 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 but you are already in the menu of 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.840
 black ops you squarely leave the menu 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.570
 you go to the main menu and you 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.830
 come back and so tuba once you 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.660
 are going to arrive on your ps3 you are going 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.120
 see what's going to happen so we're going to re 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.310
 switch on my PS3 I hope this 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.230
 tutorial via my phone will please you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.800
 and that will be understandable from a maximum 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.320
 people 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.720
 there you see I click on create a 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.000
 class that puts me as elite classes 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.130
 are available makes you yes a little 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.190
 loading will therefore appear and adam 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.630
 so your your classes will be in color 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.959
 so it's really a very very good 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.220
 glitch wac or little hacks you 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.520
 call it anything you want 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.390
 way but in any case here is a tutorial 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.130
 done by me I would have 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.380
 frankly spent a sacred end of time 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.930
 to make it between road and my 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.740
 phone 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.840
 download the necessary software 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.070
 order while it filmed me 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.150
 frankly ask for a little bit of 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.500
 time to make hacks but I 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.810
 do it with pleasure and I hope this 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.550
 tutorial will have pleased you so well my 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.230
 faith never this tutorial will have helped you 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.670
 do not hesitate to let go a like on the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.990
 video as well as commented on the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.030
 sharing it makes me extremely happy 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.250
 so his ruin oriane multiplayer it's 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.780
 just for your personal pleasure of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.690
 way to customize your game a 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.000
 maximum risk of ban is never to 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.550
 0 but that would surprise me frankly the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.140
 treyarch's part of banning people 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.820
 have put classes in colors 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.930
 knowing that it's not really a glitch 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.160
 never you can not do it 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.110
 on the call of duty elite website 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.550
 computer and that you can do it 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.110
 only through the application this is 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.700
 maybe a little flaw or forgetfulness 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.620
 from them but in all cases 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.880
 here are your classes in colors I hope 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.290
 that tutorial will have you more people and 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.510
