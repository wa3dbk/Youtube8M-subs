those holes right the piece of tape
around<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> depth<00:01:16.920> gauge<00:01:17.330> you<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
around here for a depth gauge you just

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.160 
around here for a depth gauge you just
it<00:01:18.900> however<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> want<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:21.659> way<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> make<00:01:22.020> sure

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
it however you want that way I make sure

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.359 
it however you want that way I make sure
it's<00:01:22.320> deep<00:01:22.500> enough<00:01:22.650> without<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.310> through

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's deep enough without going through

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's deep enough without going through
the<00:01:23.580> outside<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> casing<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:25.140> gotta<00:01:25.290> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the outside of the casing you gotta be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780 
the outside of the casing you gotta be
some<00:01:25.530> screws<00:01:25.830> from<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.040> hardware<00:01:26.430> store<00:01:26.759> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
some screws from the hardware store and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
some screws from the hardware store and
there's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.270> bit<00:01:27.360> long<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.840> going

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there's a little bit long so I'm going

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
there's a little bit long so I'm going
to<00:01:28.020> clip<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.560> half<00:01:28.740> remember<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.670> just

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
to clip them in half remember it's just

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.789 
to clip them in half remember it's just
a<00:01:29.939> plastic<00:01:30.150> post<00:01:30.600> before<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.380> short

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a plastic post before so this short

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.770 
a plastic post before so this short
little<00:01:31.950> screw<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.640> fine

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.210 

just<00:01:41.780> kind<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:41.990> hold<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.380> straight<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:43.010> keep

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
just kind of hold that straight to keep

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.940 
just kind of hold that straight to keep
it<00:01:43.400> in<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.550> center<00:01:43.880> down<00:01:44.000> there<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:50.950> think

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
it in the center down there I think

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.150 
it in the center down there I think
those<00:01:52.100> screws<00:01:52.460> will<00:01:52.970> last<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.540> lot<00:01:53.690> better<00:01:54.160> than

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
those screws will last a lot better than

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.680 
those screws will last a lot better than
those<00:01:55.250> little<00:01:55.460> plastic<00:01:55.910> pins<00:01:56.180> did<00:01:56.420> from<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
those little plastic pins did from the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.080 
those little plastic pins did from the
factory<00:01:57.080> setup<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:58.250> one's<00:01:58.490> seen<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.700> bit<00:01:58.940> of

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
factory setup this one's seen a bit of

this around a bit and it's going to put
pressure<00:02:43.160> up<00:02:43.459> here<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.970> screwing<00:02:47.420> next<00:02:53.590> all

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
pressure up here that screwing next all

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.840 
pressure up here that screwing next all
right<00:02:54.650> once<00:02:55.010> those<00:02:55.220> are<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.489> they're<00:02:55.640> loose
