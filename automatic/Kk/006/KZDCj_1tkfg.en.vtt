00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.859
 it means the video response from the elephant 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 regarding the addition of facades decoding 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.990
 of how I suggest doing it means 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 now there is a facade wide 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.960
 custom 586 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.510
 and the template is not configured here 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.320
 stop 32 persists throughout the kitchen this 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 corner we do not touch offer stop to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.430
 set the pitch of the notes in May this problems 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:42.110
 something about offer 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.110
 fix and here 586 nod32 554 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.660
 we also fix this whole structure 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.180
 the last pillars in the overall project 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.070
 soullessness into action now from 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.070
 operator practical nothing depends 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.380
 can be drilled 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 notice he's not both hands busy 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.920
 a drill 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:37.340
 immediately drill the soup without hands to 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.759
 Unfortunately, it does not work at all 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.759
 spring 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:58.990
 Giza begins to rotate in the window I drill 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.990
 ten 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.620
 I will go there for fun 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 therefore we will be bred and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:28.010
 removing fasteners inserto 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:39.520
 so I have some for by 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:39.520
 compared with the professional put the child 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.110
 1c from ready 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.960
 now the most interesting this facade 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.730
 another height so i have to 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:08.720
 make a bunch of any actions to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:08.720
 reconfigure the pattern i loosen the supports 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.300
 again I do it precisely because 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.230
 I have to control this 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.230
 system groups grandfather next satan 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.070
 everything 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.120
 but actually you and there were two facades 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.120
 so we will consider 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.640
 on the map suddenly ended instead of and 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.900
 so all my final actions or 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.270
 judgments have sunk into oblivion so take two 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.470
 In general, the facade I have not even disassemble 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:38.419
 I will mean what problems were in the course 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:42.060
 all the action problems with native severe 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.830
 as soon as we start in any diameter 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.360
 drill into a small recess 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:50.700
 you have to push this thing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.310
 spring due to which the calf is much 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.760
 more tightly walking already when we are up 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.860
 drill to the end here is the final position 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:07.320
 here she is just trying to break free 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:11.900
 Well, what's going on with MDF and the ten can be seen 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.570
 even yawned a wedge in my sleeve 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:18.240
 more dense there just 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:22.470
 even the back of the drill started 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.450
 walk with touch but because it seems 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.680
 here a little bit more diameter 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:32.060
 on some kind of mesh there so now i'm with 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.550
 original sleeves and so this is after ru by 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:39.320
 of this instruction 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.120
 if you clean the facade to the support and on the table and 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.780
 stomach pressure on the line in general from 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.310
 these pieces can be disposed of and it turns out 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.640
 work with passion speed 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:56.479
 that is, roughly speaking, first process 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:06:01.260
 45 cabinets then 60 unchanged height 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:04.350
 box in any case, everything fits in 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:08.880
 system either we drill with offset 37 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.979
 either 3716 well then offset 30 is that 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.640
 concerns fastening the facade rails all 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.660
 stacked there in 64 steps that is nothing 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:22.240
 don't change here just look 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.070
 he hole numbers well these offsets 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.750
 are inserted elementary rather it 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.020
 Does not touch it at all 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.210
 elementary and again for 45 and 60 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.410
 The cabinets just remember two numbers and 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:39.570
 write them yourself in the mirror all 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:43.630
 the rest is trivial so that's what 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.500
 it may not be clear but a fact 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.690
 remains a fact 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:52.630
 it is very real for the facade he drill 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:54.240
 and it will be delivered that is, all without cheating 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.640
 the technique works 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:01.810
 take a piece of paper consider draw 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:04.150
 everything is fine so that it all works we 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.790
 we lower the facade of the lower part by 5 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:12.130
 millimeters below the guide it 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:14.050
 rule for all boxes any distance 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.870
 between guides can be 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.380
 vertical we adjust its height 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:23.790
 faÃ§ade general everything is considered possible 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.790
