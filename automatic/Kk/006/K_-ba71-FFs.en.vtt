something<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.900> as<00:00:28.080> well<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.380> Amazon

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
something like that as well as Amazon

but nice to have impact protection so to
install<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.540> on<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.720> phone<00:03:19.900> you're<00:03:20.080> simply

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
install it on the phone you're simply

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.350 
install it on the phone you're simply
going<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.590> go<00:03:20.709> ahead<00:03:20.830> put<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.489> top<00:03:21.940> first

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
going to go ahead put it in top first

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.440 
going to go ahead put it in top first
and<00:03:22.750> then<00:03:23.260> kind<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.530> slip<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.890> inside<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.970> TPU

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
and then kind of slip it inside the TPU

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.620 
and then kind of slip it inside the TPU
liner<00:03:25.930> here<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:27.010> like<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:27.550> and<00:03:27.820> then<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.450> found

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
liner here just like so and then I found

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.990 
liner here just like so and then I found
the<00:03:28.840> easiest<00:03:28.989> way<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.440> install<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.820> to

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the easiest way to install it was to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.940 
the easiest way to install it was to
simply<00:03:31.360> set<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.989> bottom<00:03:32.350> first<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
simply set it in the bottom first and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.510 
simply set it in the bottom first and
then<00:03:33.430> kind<00:03:33.730> of<00:03:33.880> slip<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> top<00:03:34.420> edge<00:03:34.720> up<00:03:34.989> and

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
then kind of slip the top edge up and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.449 
then kind of slip the top edge up and
over<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.610> phone<00:03:36.850> just<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.890> or<00:03:39.070> over<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
over the phone just like so or over the

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.390 
over the phone just like so or over the
liner<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:40.720> like<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.709> it<00:03:41.860> does<00:03:42.010> require<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
liner just like so it does require a

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.890 
liner just like so it does require a
little<00:03:42.670> bit<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.970> massaging<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.630> get<00:03:43.750> into

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
little bit of massaging to get into

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.060 
little bit of massaging to get into
place<00:03:44.110> because<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.590> does<00:03:44.709> have<00:03:44.860> these

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
place because it does have these

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.830 
place because it does have these

built-in port protectors built into the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.600 
built-in port protectors built into the
case<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.650> you're<00:03:50.830> going<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> need<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.220> massage

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
case so you're going to need to massage

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.210 
case so you're going to need to massage
it<00:03:51.880> into<00:03:52.720> place<00:03:52.989> a<00:03:53.019> little<00:03:53.260> bit<00:03:53.650> there<00:03:53.950> we<00:03:53.980> go

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it into place a little bit there we go

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.850 
it into place a little bit there we go
we<00:03:54.550> got<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:55.209> now<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:56.560> bottom

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
we got it going now and the bottom

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.250 
we got it going now and the bottom
pretty<00:03:56.950> much<00:03:57.130> lines<00:03:57.400> up<00:03:57.640> as<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.600> install<00:03:58.989> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
pretty much lines up as you install it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.949 
pretty much lines up as you install it
but<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.709> didn't<00:04:00.040> quite<00:04:00.280> get<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.580> right<00:04:00.880> so<00:04:01.269> go

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
but I didn't quite get it right so go

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.320 
but I didn't quite get it right so go
ahead<00:04:02.080> do<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.380> little<00:04:02.590> massaging<00:04:03.040> here<00:04:03.519> get

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
ahead do a little massaging here get

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.830 
ahead do a little massaging here get
that<00:04:04.540> into<00:04:04.810> place<00:04:05.080> just<00:04:06.239> like<00:04:07.239> so<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:09.840> bingo

screen shield on the device as don't

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.960 
screen shield on the device as don't
know<00:04:32.040> if<00:04:32.100> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.310> be<00:04:32.430> able<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.610> pick<00:04:32.730> this<00:04:32.820> up

know if you can be able to pick this up

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.970 
know if you can be able to pick this up
on<00:04:33.180> video<00:04:33.480> but<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.200> does<00:04:34.350> not<00:04:34.500> cover<00:04:34.830> the

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
on video but it does not cover the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.570 
on video but it does not cover the
entire<00:04:35.850> front<00:04:36.690> of<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.710> screen<00:04:38.070> from<00:04:38.430> what<00:04:38.550> I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
entire front of the screen from what I

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.610 
entire front of the screen from what I
understand<00:04:39.120> this<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.360> quite<00:04:39.600> common<00:04:40.080> with

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
understand this is quite common with

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.310 
understand this is quite common with
screen<00:04:41.040> shields<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.330> Galaxy<00:04:42.810> Note<00:04:43.050> 2

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
screen shields for the Galaxy Note 2

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.890 
screen shields for the Galaxy Note 2
because<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.490> edges<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.300> glass<00:04:45.420> on<00:04:45.840> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
because the edges of the glass on the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.430 
because the edges of the glass on the
note<00:04:46.140> 2<00:04:46.380> are<00:04:46.890> somewhat<00:04:47.400> curved<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.900> if<00:04:49.200> they<00:04:49.320> go

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
note 2 are somewhat curved so if they go

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.480 
note 2 are somewhat curved so if they go
right<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.830> edge<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.160> glass<00:04:50.310> the

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
right to the edge of the glass the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.430 
right to the edge of the glass the
screen<00:04:50.730> shield<00:04:50.940> tends<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.300> lift<00:04:51.510> itself<00:04:51.840> up<00:04:52.110> I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
screen shield tends to lift itself up I

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.320 
screen shield tends to lift itself up I
guess<00:04:52.650> so<00:04:53.280> I<00:04:53.340> just<00:04:53.490> kind<00:04:53.670> of<00:04:53.730> cover<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> main

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
guess so I just kind of cover the main

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.810 
guess so I just kind of cover the main
screen<00:04:54.750> area<00:04:55.350> with<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> screen<00:04:56.400> shield<00:04:56.640> but<00:04:56.730> it

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
screen area with a screen shield but it

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.120 
screen area with a screen shield but it
doesn't<00:04:57.150> go<00:04:57.240> right<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.230> edges<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.980> is

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
doesn't go right to the edges this is

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.890 
doesn't go right to the edges this is
pretty<00:04:59.310> common<00:04:59.550> from<00:05:00.240> what<00:05:00.390> I<00:05:00.420> understand

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
pretty common from what I understand

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.150 
pretty common from what I understand
this<00:05:01.050> is<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.290> first<00:05:01.320> one<00:05:01.590> I've<00:05:01.680> tried<00:05:01.920> but

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
this is the first one I've tried but

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.800 
this is the first one I've tried but
I'll<00:05:02.310> definitely<00:05:02.400> let<00:05:02.670> you<00:05:02.790> guys<00:05:02.940> know<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.720> a

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
I'll definitely let you guys know in a

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.590 
I'll definitely let you guys know in a
future<00:05:04.140> videos<00:05:04.530> if<00:05:04.830> I<00:05:05.250> find<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.180> bunch<00:05:06.330> more

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
it for my review on the OtterBox

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.190 
it for my review on the OtterBox
Commuter<00:06:58.020> case<00:06:58.530> for<00:06:59.430> the<00:06:59.730> Samsung<00:06:59.940> Galaxy<00:07:00.690> s2

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
Commuter case for the Samsung Galaxy s2

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.830 
Commuter case for the Samsung Galaxy s2
how<00:07:01.950> the<00:07:02.010> galaxy<00:07:02.490> s2<00:07:02.610> is<00:07:02.970> a<00:07:03.000> fairly<00:07:03.450> large

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
how the galaxy s2 is a fairly large

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.520 
how the galaxy s2 is a fairly large
device<00:07:04.350> and<00:07:04.830> yes<00:07:05.430> this<00:07:05.760> does<00:07:06.030> add<00:07:06.389> some<00:07:07.080> bulk

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
device and yes this does add some bulk

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.370 
device and yes this does add some bulk
to<00:07:07.860> it<00:07:08.010> but<00:07:08.700> I<00:07:08.970> think<00:07:09.600> it's<00:07:09.720> a<00:07:09.810> good<00:07:10.020> trade-off

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
to it but I think it's a good trade-off

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.719 
to it but I think it's a good trade-off
with<00:07:10.889> the<00:07:11.010> community<00:07:11.400> because<00:07:11.610> you're

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
with the community because you're

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:13.219 
with the community because you're
getting<00:07:11.790> a<00:07:11.940> quite<00:07:12.240> a<00:07:12.270> bit<00:07:12.450> of<00:07:12.540> protection<00:07:12.690> here

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
getting a quite a bit of protection here

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.530 
getting a quite a bit of protection here
for<00:07:13.770> your<00:07:13.889> Galaxy<00:07:14.070> s2<00:07:14.460> without<00:07:15.060> adding<00:07:15.450> a

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
for your Galaxy s2 without adding a

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.990 
for your Galaxy s2 without adding a
whole<00:07:15.750> ton<00:07:16.139> of<00:07:16.220> bulk<00:07:17.220> it<00:07:17.460> does<00:07:17.610> add<00:07:17.760> a<00:07:17.790> little

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
whole ton of bulk it does add a little

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.719 
whole ton of bulk it does add a little
bit<00:07:18.120> of<00:07:18.210> bulk<00:07:18.419> yes<00:07:18.660> but<00:07:18.900> not<00:07:19.080> a<00:07:19.320> grossly<00:07:19.770> huge

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:20.729 
bit of bulk yes but not a grossly huge

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:23.120
