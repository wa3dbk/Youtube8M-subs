that<00:01:04.019> adding<00:01:04.589> shea<00:01:04.799> butter<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.970> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that adding shea butter is just going to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
that adding shea butter is just going to
make<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> greasy<00:01:06.750> ER<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.369> actually<00:01:08.549> going

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
make it greasy ER so I'm actually going

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.740 
make it greasy ER so I'm actually going
to<00:01:08.939> add<00:01:09.060> more<00:01:09.390> aloe<00:01:09.689> vera<00:01:10.080> gel<00:01:10.430> big<00:01:11.600> bottle<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to add more aloe vera gel big bottle of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.460 
to add more aloe vera gel big bottle of
aloe<00:01:13.049> vera<00:01:13.350> gel<00:01:14.720> also<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> substance<00:01:16.290> has

aloe vera gel also the substance has

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.270 
aloe vera gel also the substance has
actually<00:01:17.009> thickened<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:18.049> which<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:20.040> quite

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually thickened up which is quite

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
actually thickened up which is quite
surprising<00:01:20.520> um<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.170> thickened<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:22.590> so
