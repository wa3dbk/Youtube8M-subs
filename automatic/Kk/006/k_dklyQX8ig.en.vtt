 go well today we find ourselves 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.830
 for a short video I'll go 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 show how to make barley sugar this 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.570
 you're going to need it 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.440
 very minimal it is sugar of the cream 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 tartar 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 if you do not know what's not me 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.189
 the more I did not know the first time 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.550
 I was asking me to the employee of 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.060
 the grocery store it was in the row of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 Tips to fall and pipes alone 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.000
 so you can ask what I have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.529
 do and take on dyes 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.170
 I have red food 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.910
 I already here prepare my words what 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.000
 you must know is that it takes me 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.140
 swan mussels she ignores me - early to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 plastic warehouse laws nor upside down 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 do not take this plastic 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.030
 because the mix has to be so 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 hot that you - are going to melt so we 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.890
 so settles to start his 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:02.120
 frank or drome with a fake and done 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.120
 then you are going to need 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.290
 Then it takes you two-thirds of both 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.180
 of things I heat them 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.180
 previously damask in the kettle 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.740
 then it takes me 1 2 cup of sugar 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:35.039
 then know no spoons yet 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.329
 tea or clairac most preferred course of 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.329
 your cream of tartar 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 There you go 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.270
 there as you can see your 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.010
 mixture is very opaque what you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:03.110
 must do is turn on your shadow 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.110
 between two and three and you mix 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.060
 during this stage the water forms and for 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.550
 animate all the time you need 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 to do is stir until late 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 the sugar is dissolved so when 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.760
 stops does the mix must be everything 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.209
 club me I stir and I'll come back to you 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 close and that's how my bike can see 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.630
 and transparent 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.600
 now what we will do is we 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.850
 wants to set the table on our 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.640
 cauldron and we increase the temperature 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:40.019
 during a maximum until 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.190
 it's beautiful and now that's it 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:48.060
 Lugovoi is that we need 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.060
 of internment and abandonment and you have to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.030
 raise the temperature up to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.700
 150 degrees not 150 degrees celsius or 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.440
 300 Â° farhan haq 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 during this step loeb not need the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.880
 all arm is like you can 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.730
 see more than we have the milk mixture 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.660
 hot more than the mixture must and pc 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.660
 it's perfectly normal 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.860
 that's the time we mix gets to the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.630
 temperature required what am I doing it 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.580
 and I will let him rest a whole 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.790
 little bit a few seconds and I'm going 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.100
 come to witness the food coloring 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.420
 I can not tell you the exact amount 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.420
 because it's really a lot 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.050
 if you have it most bother you - if 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.260
 you want but darker to put 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.260
 more and you brave select 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.940
 then have to be quick why 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.600
 let it sit because the mixture 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.070
 I will quote rat turning what I'm going 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.280
 to do now is that I want to come 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.690
 put it in my bubble 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.380
 this very careful because it's 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.380
 very very hot 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.959
 you can have shaped moles in 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.840
 uniform but I have paulel gpo limoux 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:27.750
 the fact that I put them in soho so 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.110
 here are my mussels with mons crudup 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.420
 now everything the staff has redone 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.940
 to be all in the fridge for 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.410
 refrigerators is very careful me 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.300
 I put a plate underneath because 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.910
 that you can not handle the molds 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.890
 like that it's really too hot 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.080
 so go burn yourself with a plate 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.620
 underneath that your pupil I put them to 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.440
 fridge 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.150
 and when will they be ready when who 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.740
 will be hardened 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.230
 all I have to do if it is 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.060
 broken so it was my little recipe 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.590
 I hope you will love him and me 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.130
