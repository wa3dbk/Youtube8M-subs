four on the UK and up here is Turkey I
think<00:06:01.009> that's<00:06:01.160> also<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.520> same<00:06:01.550> one<00:06:01.820> for

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
think that's also the same one for

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.770 
think that's also the same one for
Africa<00:06:02.650> but<00:06:03.650> it<00:06:04.310> works<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:05.330> works<00:06:05.449> at<00:06:05.720> the

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
Africa but it works it works at the
