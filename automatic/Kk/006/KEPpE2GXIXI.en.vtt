00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.720
 today we are going to talk a bit about cultivation 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.460
 of nerves for 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.660
 we will use as food for our 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 hollows or reptiles anything birds 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 and else 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.189
 pets or animals that we have at home 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.189
 well here as you can see we have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.430
 always try to separate 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.590
 the cockroaches of the worms when 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.140
 the worms are born 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.230
 now let's use it as food in 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.870
 When pupa are made, we separate them 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.789
 in another container which 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.789
 here it tells a lot to look back 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.269
 and within approximately of what I 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.120
 You have cockroaches in about two 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.090
 months or something like that two months two months and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.160
 peak you will already have 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 your rings good to me if they have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.610
 a month and a peak and will gusanitos 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.390
 small but well let's say not 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.390
 we can use them 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 well, until two and a half months 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.259
 we have an adequate size will not be 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.440
 adults here you see there are a lot of 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.200
 they 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.420
 a lot of them 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.110
 and well this would be let's say the second 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.369
 phase the first one opens buy the rings 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.219
 feed the tendons to a good 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.990
 temperature about twenty degrees degrees 28 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.810
 degrees would be fine 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.380
 and then they come to be this let's say 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.079
 here they do their little things to lay their eggs 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.320
 and born in a huge amount of having 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.690
 it's worth 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 then the next phase because you know 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.850
 the rings here you have 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.909
 you pick 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.310
 this is already adult worms 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.659
 I like adults 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.490
 this is already eaten by 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.330
 As you can see they are not very active 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.640
 quite 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.700
 it is almost impossible for them to escape or anything 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.630
 there is a little bit left here in this box 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.350
 that just a little bit of 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.880
 lettuce and a little bread 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.800
 then here we have another one where that unemployed 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.970
 I like cigars and hard that no more 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.970
 that worms with a little bit the fact 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:31.290
 what is a lot of worms 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.670
 It's worth a trick or a recommendation 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.370
 this is a normal worm as you see 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.549
 the color 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.159
 a worm with his molt with his we go with 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.250
 let's say with its shell with its coverage 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.349
 of chitin that is said to always try 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.560
 at the time of feeding your a 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.480
 your pets choose the whitest 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.599
 those who are white all 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.000
 here I have already separated some to give 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.580
 then to my friends 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.690
 I'm going to show you how you can check 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.060
 here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.510
 these are white worms just 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.180
 move 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.790
 they have much less 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.790
 to much less load of chitin 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.079
 it is a thing that is not very beneficial 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.920
 with these things because they do the 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:24.350
 digestions more 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:28.460
 heavier then whenever you can 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.530
 within this of your cultivation 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.250
 select 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.560
 the white worms look at the difference 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.150
 the whites to the left the others to 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 the right one sees the color difference 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.040
 do not 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.750
 as long as you can give it the most 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.630
 possible of white worms that you can 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 Tiernitos are more high than if the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.420
 you touch are are soft they are very tender 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.620
 little children and let's say they are going to sit 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.000
 better to your holes 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.600
 and then nothing else 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.140
 feed correctly on these worms 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:07.890
 I give them flour oatmeal and from time to time 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.480
 when some bread and some vegetables or 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.030
 fruits after 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.870
 the more balanced the diet of 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.019
 the worms 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.209
 and then all that remains inside let's say 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.310
 that the diet of your eyes is also going 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.610
 to be more balanced 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.210
 to more varied is the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.070
 the diet better then 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.980
 for your rich 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.230
 and here you have 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.630
 the crop that I have 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.230
 for the last time I hope you have them 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.270
 served for something is very simple is very 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.680
 very very simple to do a crop was 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.960
 to be barely to be ignored 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.960
 and good, thank you so much for watching
