that it's two feet tall this poses a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.260 
that it's two feet tall this poses a
problem<00:00:21.140> because<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.320> lawnmower<00:00:22.970> cannot<00:00:23.970> mow

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
clogged up in the discharge chute I've

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.719 
clogged up in the discharge chute I've
tried<00:00:41.159> to<00:00:41.280> help<00:00:41.429> this<00:00:41.989> by<00:00:42.989> tying<00:00:43.319> this<00:00:43.729> safety

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
tried to help this by tying this safety

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.899 
tried to help this by tying this safety
cover<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.600> out<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.139> the<00:00:46.229> way<00:00:46.609> so<00:00:47.609> that<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
cover up out of the way so that the

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.419 
cover up out of the way so that the
spent<00:00:48.210> grass<00:00:48.530> can<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.559> discharged<00:00:50.190> more

spent grass can be discharged more

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.719 
spent grass can be discharged more
easily<00:00:50.729> but<00:00:51.299> the<00:00:51.420> grass<00:00:51.659> still<00:00:52.399> gets<00:00:53.399> clogged

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
easily but the grass still gets clogged

00:00:53.729 --> 00:01:24.930 
easily but the grass still gets clogged
up<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.179> this<00:00:54.329> hole

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.359 

my<00:01:25.940> proposed<00:01:26.390> solution<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:27.170> this<00:01:27.320> other<00:01:28.100> than

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
my proposed solution to this other than

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.810 
my proposed solution to this other than
mowing<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.790> grass<00:01:28.820> or<00:01:29.450> regularly<00:01:30.550> is<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
mowing the grass or regularly is to

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.160 
mowing the grass or regularly is to
enlarge<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:33.290> discharge<00:01:33.800> hole<00:01:34.990> this<00:01:35.990> will

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
enlarge the discharge hole this will

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.440 
enlarge the discharge hole this will
make<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:36.409> easier<00:01:36.740> for<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.400> lawnmower<00:01:37.610> to

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
make it easier for the lawnmower to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.530 
make it easier for the lawnmower to
expel<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.110> cut<00:01:39.320> grass<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.030> hopefully<00:01:41.030> keep

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
expel the cut grass and hopefully keep

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.990 
expel the cut grass and hopefully keep
the<00:01:41.750> grass<00:01:41.960> from<00:01:42.440> getting<00:01:42.680> clogged<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.159> in<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the grass from getting clogged up in the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.280 
the grass from getting clogged up in the
discharge<00:01:44.210> chute<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.540> spirit<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:47.960> saving

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
discharge chute in the spirit of saving

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.340 
discharge chute in the spirit of saving
time<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:49.280> going<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> use<00:01:49.820> this<00:01:50.060> angle<00:01:50.930> grinder

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
time I'm going to use this angle grinder

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.999 
time I'm going to use this angle grinder
to<00:01:51.880> enlarge<00:01:52.990> discharge<00:01:53.990> chute<00:01:54.409> of<00:01:54.680> the

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
to enlarge discharge chute of the

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:15.700 
to enlarge discharge chute of the
lawnmower

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:03:58.780 

use<00:02:16.710> your<00:02:16.920> goggles

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.449 

I'm<00:03:59.790> elongating<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.720> hole<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.860> towards<00:04:02.310> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
I'm elongating the hole more towards the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.220 
I'm elongating the hole more towards the
front<00:04:02.819> than<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.720> back<00:04:03.989> because<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:05.190> don't<00:04:05.250> want

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
front than the back because I don't want

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.790 
front than the back because I don't want
excess<00:04:07.230> grass<00:04:08.220> and<00:04:08.610> debris<00:04:09.380> to<00:04:10.380> be<00:04:10.530> shot

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
excess grass and debris to be shot

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.710 
excess grass and debris to be shot
toward<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.760> driver<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.620> I've<00:04:13.739> cut<00:04:14.040> out<00:04:14.720> two

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
toward the driver so I've cut out two

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.780 
toward the driver so I've cut out two
inches<00:04:17.239> forward<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:19.230> mower<00:04:19.410> deck<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.040> now

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
inches forward of the mower deck and now

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.099 
inches forward of the mower deck and now
I'm<00:04:20.970> just<00:04:21.000> going<00:04:21.239> to<00:04:21.329> tune<00:04:21.540> it<00:04:21.690> up<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.900> little

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
I'm just going to tune it up a little

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.340 
I'm just going to tune it up a little
bit<00:04:22.560> here<00:04:23.310> in<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> back<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.840> not<00:04:24.990> too<00:04:25.200> much

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
bit here in the back but not too much

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.780 
bit here in the back but not too much
because<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.800> don't<00:04:25.950> want<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.220> be<00:04:26.550> bombarded

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
because I don't want to be bombarded

00:04:26.790 --> 00:05:37.940 
because I don't want to be bombarded
with<00:04:27.240> rocks<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.780> twigs<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.919> grass

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.470 

that's<00:05:38.950> how<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.160> port<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.760> polish<00:05:40.150> a

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
that's how you port and polish a

00:05:40.480 --> 00:06:55.050 
that's how you port and polish a
lawnmower<00:05:45.060> now<00:05:46.060> let's<00:05:46.300> try<00:05:46.600> it<00:05:46.630> out

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.140 

as<00:06:56.140> you<00:06:57.140> can<00:06:57.290> see<00:06:57.590> it<00:06:58.070> really<00:06:58.370> resists

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 
as you can see it really resists

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.970 
as you can see it really resists
clogging<00:07:00.310> when<00:07:01.310> it<00:07:01.430> does<00:07:01.610> start<00:07:01.790> to<00:07:02.030> clog<00:07:02.980> it

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:03.980 
clogging when it does start to clog it

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.180 
clogging when it does start to clog it
doesn't<00:07:04.610> hold<00:07:05.360> up<00:07:05.570> the<00:07:05.810> chute<00:07:06.110> the<00:07:06.680> excess

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
doesn't hold up the chute the excess

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.880 
doesn't hold up the chute the excess
grass<00:07:07.430> just<00:07:07.790> kind<00:07:08.000> of<00:07:08.090> falls<00:07:08.360> out<00:07:08.660> and<00:07:08.890> clears

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
grass just kind of falls out and clears

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.650 
grass just kind of falls out and clears
itself<00:07:10.280> out<00:07:10.490> so<00:07:10.700> I<00:07:10.730> think<00:07:10.850> this<00:07:11.150> is<00:07:11.210> a<00:07:11.390> really

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
itself out so I think this is a really

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.740 
itself out so I think this is a really
good<00:07:11.900> design<00:07:12.290> and<00:07:12.890> should<00:07:13.670> help<00:07:13.850> me<00:07:14.150> in

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
good design and should help me in

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.790 
good design and should help me in
clearing<00:07:16.150> my<00:07:17.150> jungle<00:07:18.140> of<00:07:18.530> grass<00:07:20.650> thanks<00:07:21.650> for
