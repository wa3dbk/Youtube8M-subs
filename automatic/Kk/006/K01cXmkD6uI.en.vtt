00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
going to start with the blend knob set

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.330 
going to start with the blend knob set
at<00:00:13.019> noon<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.500> I'm<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> go<00:00:13.860> through<00:00:14.160> the

start over we're gonna push the blend
knob<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> bit<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.570> bring<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.899> more

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
knob up a bit which will bring in more

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
knob up a bit which will bring in more
of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.440> compressed<00:00:52.949> signal<00:00:53.250> let's<00:00:54.149> hear<00:00:54.329> how

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
of the compressed signal let's hear how

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
of the compressed signal let's hear how
it<00:00:54.420> sounds<00:00:59.690> low<00:01:00.690> compression<00:01:06.619> mid

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it sounds low compression mid

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.090 
it sounds low compression mid
compression

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:23.540 

and<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.670> compression<00:01:21.230> okay<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:23.190> pretty<00:01:23.340> nice

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
and my compression okay it's pretty nice

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.770 
and my compression okay it's pretty nice
I<00:01:23.730> like<00:01:23.910> it<00:01:23.940> you<00:01:24.120> can<00:01:24.240> really<00:01:24.390> hear<00:01:24.630> the

this pedal can be used as a really nice

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.900 
this pedal can be used as a really nice
clean<00:02:03.869> boost<00:02:04.080> too<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.340> let's<00:02:05.580> hear<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
clean boost too so let's hear the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.469 
clean boost too so let's hear the
original<00:02:06.000> guitar<00:02:06.780> tone

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
original guitar tone

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.660 
original guitar tone
and<00:02:09.280> right<00:02:10.280> around<00:02:10.399> there<00:02:10.789> it's<00:02:10.970> unity<00:02:11.390> game

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:46.500 

now<00:02:17.670> let's<00:02:17.909> push<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.810> volume<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.590> way<00:02:19.739> up

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.970 

yeah<00:02:47.510> really<00:02:47.810> makes<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.260> ant<00:02:48.439> break<00:02:48.769> up

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
yeah really makes the ant break up

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.589 
yeah really makes the ant break up
nicely<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:49.849> can<00:02:49.970> make<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.120> really<00:02:50.390> nice

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
nicely so it can make a really nice

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.509 
nicely so it can make a really nice
clean<00:02:51.409> boost<00:02:51.680> for<00:02:51.920> pushing<00:02:52.189> your<00:02:52.280> end<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.430> it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
clean boost for pushing your end of it

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920 
clean boost for pushing your end of it
to<00:02:52.609> overdrive<00:02:53.030> or<00:02:53.329> just<00:02:53.510> kicking<00:02:53.810> up<00:02:53.900> your

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
to overdrive or just kicking up your

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.379 
to overdrive or just kicking up your
volume<00:02:54.349> a<00:02:54.440> little<00:02:54.650> bit<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.120> really<00:02:56.299> nice

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
volume a little bit it's a really nice

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.670 
volume a little bit it's a really nice
compressor<00:02:56.900> check<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.319> out

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
