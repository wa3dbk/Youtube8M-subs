00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a training camp of the Russian national team.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.500
This is where we prepare for all international competitions

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.500
as well as Russian Championship and Russian Cup.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.000
Currently we are preparing specifically for the European Championship.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.500
At the moment the national and pre-elite teams are training together

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.500
and on 5th May 2012 we will be heading off to the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.500
European Championships that will take place in Belgium.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.800
After that we will start preparing for the Olympic Games.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.500
All relevant activities and events that we have

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
all take place here in 'Ozero Krugloe'.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.000
We are sponsored by the Ministry of Sports and VTB Bank

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500
that supports us financially

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.000
by purchasing gym equipment and paying bonuses etc. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is our treatment and diagnosis block.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
We can measure the functional state, electrocardiography

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.000
and also perform physiotherapeutic treatment.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
We mainly use electrical impulse therapy

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
which is what we are doing for the gymnast now.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:14.500
It is being used for the treatment of musculoskeletal system.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.000
It’s all quite simple to use. The doctor will diagnose the issue

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.100
after which we input the requirements into the system

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.000
 – rehabilitation mode, which is quite often used for gymnasts.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.000
The electrodes are put in place, the specific mode is set,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.000
after which the system will run the serial of procedures.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100
At this stage of preparing for the European Championships,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
gymnasts experience an extremely heavy workload.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.500
The main points of pressure are legs – used on many apparatus.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We always have the set the goals

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.000
which are to win the gold medals.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.000
We used to have the situation when we were not winning enough medals,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
however it has improved now.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.500
The competition is fierce – especially now in the Olympic year.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We’ve got the information that the Romanian team is very strong.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
Therefore in order to win we need to work hard

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.100
which is what we are doing now.
