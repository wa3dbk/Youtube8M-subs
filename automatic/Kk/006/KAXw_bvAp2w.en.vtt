00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
puzzles are repeated but they are

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.920 
puzzles are repeated but they are
tougher<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:49.120> start<00:01:49.330> off<00:01:49.390> myself<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.870> a

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
tougher so you start off myself in a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.360 
tougher so you start off myself in a
three-ring<00:01:50.320> puzzle<00:01:50.650> me<00:01:50.740> later<00:01:51.010> sheet<00:01:51.250> as<00:01:51.340> a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
three-ring puzzle me later sheet as a

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.100 
three-ring puzzle me later sheet as a
four<00:01:51.670> ring<00:01:51.850> well<00:01:52.000> known<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.330> five<00:01:52.600> ring<00:01:52.900> one

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
four ring well known in a five ring one

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.260 
four ring well known in a five ring one
so<00:01:53.350> once<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.820> know<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:54.970> get<00:01:55.180> the

so once you you know you get the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.060 
so once you you know you get the
concepts<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:56.080> needa<00:01:56.290> be<00:01:56.440> else<00:01:56.560> you'll<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:56.979> all

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
concepts you needa be else you'll be all

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.649 
concepts you needa be else you'll be all
set<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.550> but<00:01:57.820> you<00:01:57.970> know<00:01:58.060> all<00:01:58.120> these<00:01:58.210> puzzles
