00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
as you can see this map is just

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.760 
as you can see this map is just
extremely<00:03:17.730> impressive<00:03:18.290> there's<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.500> much<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
extremely impressive there's so much to

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.100 
extremely impressive there's so much to
do<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.250> spent<00:03:20.880> a<00:03:20.970> couple<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.300> hours<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.870> map

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
do I spent a couple of hours in this map

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.199 
do I spent a couple of hours in this map
and<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.380> just<00:03:22.620> didn't<00:03:22.920> get<00:03:23.040> bored<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:24.000> I

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and I just didn't get bored and then I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.510 
and I just didn't get bored and then I
finally<00:03:24.450> decided<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.410> make<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> video<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.250> I

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
finally decided to make a video and I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.170 
finally decided to make a video and I
was<00:03:26.700> allowed<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.940> surprisingly<00:03:29.940> this

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
was allowed to do so surprisingly this

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.250 
was allowed to do so surprisingly this
map<00:03:30.390> actually<00:03:30.630> has<00:03:30.959> limits<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:33.180> dome<00:03:33.690> goes

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
map actually has limits this dome goes

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.130 
map actually has limits this dome goes
all<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.530> way<00:03:34.800> around<00:03:35.540> there's<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.660> few<00:03:36.930> stuff

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
all the way around there's a few stuff

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.020 
all the way around there's a few stuff
out<00:03:37.320> of<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.620> map<00:03:37.860> but<00:03:38.310> there<00:03:38.490> isn't<00:03:38.790> much

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
out of this map but there isn't much

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.170 
out of this map but there isn't much
beyond<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:40.110> map<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.430> easily<00:03:41.640> just

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
beyond the map so you can easily just

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.949 
beyond the map so you can easily just
play<00:03:42.810> inside<00:03:43.320> as<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:44.940> survival<00:03:45.720> games

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
play inside as this is survival games

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.930 
play inside as this is survival games
you<00:03:46.350> know<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.500> don't<00:03:46.950> want<00:03:47.130> people<00:03:47.400> running

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
you know you don't want people running

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
you know you don't want people running
away<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:49.260> never<00:03:49.470> came<00:03:49.680> back

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
away and never came back

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.060 
away and never came back
you<00:03:50.640> know<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.600> kind<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:52.740> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
you know so this is kind of like the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.980 
you know so this is kind of like the
limit<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.910> survival<00:03:54.330> games<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.660> goes<00:03:54.780> all

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
limit of the survival games it goes all

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.730 
limit of the survival games it goes all
the<00:03:55.020> way<00:03:55.230> round<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:58.350> quite<00:03:58.590> surprising
