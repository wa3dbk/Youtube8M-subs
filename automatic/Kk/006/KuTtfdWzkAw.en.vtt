something<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> found<00:01:29.490> this

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
something like that and so I found this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.700 
something like that and so I found this
was<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:29.939> good<00:01:30.060> value<00:01:30.509> for<00:01:30.540> money<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> so

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
was quite good value for money and so

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
was quite good value for money and so
I've<00:01:31.979> really<00:01:32.009> enjoyed<00:01:32.220> using<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.180> I

really lovely and it was only 12 pounds

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.729 
really lovely and it was only 12 pounds
which<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.150> pretty<00:03:28.600> good<00:03:28.810> from<00:03:29.140> my<00:03:29.380> next<00:03:29.620> thing

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
which is pretty good from my next thing

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.740 
which is pretty good from my next thing
I<00:03:29.799> picked<00:03:29.980> up<00:03:30.130> was<00:03:30.370> from<00:03:30.700> zara<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:31.480> this

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
I picked up was from zara and it's this

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.410 
I picked up was from zara and it's this
skirt<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:33.639> print<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.180> gorgeous

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
skirt and the print is just gorgeous

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.140 
skirt and the print is just gorgeous
although<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.109> does<00:03:35.290> remind<00:03:35.590> me<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.519> cipher

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
although it does remind me of a cipher

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.610 
although it does remind me of a cipher
that<00:03:37.180> we<00:03:37.329> used<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:37.690> in<00:03:37.870> my<00:03:37.989> house<00:03:38.170> when<00:03:38.500> I

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
that we used to have in my house when I

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.400 
that we used to have in my house when I
was<00:03:38.739> little<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.780> yeah<00:03:40.780> I<00:03:40.840> just<00:03:41.079> really<00:03:41.380> really

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
was little and yeah I just really really

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.960 
was little and yeah I just really really
loved<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:41.950> was<00:03:41.980> around<00:03:42.160> 30<00:03:42.400> pounds<00:03:42.760> which<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
loved it it was around 30 pounds which I

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.340 
loved it it was around 30 pounds which I
think<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:43.239> reasonable<00:03:43.600> for<00:03:43.930> a<00:03:44.079> skirt<00:03:44.319> and

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
think it's reasonable for a skirt and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.190 
think it's reasonable for a skirt and
Zara<00:03:44.889> and<00:03:45.190> it's<00:03:45.940> quite<00:03:46.209> high<00:03:46.420> way<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.810> comes<00:03:46.959> I

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
Zara and it's quite high way it comes I

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.780 
Zara and it's quite high way it comes I
can<00:03:47.470> make<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.709> quite<00:03:47.889> high<00:03:48.010> wasted<00:03:48.370> on<00:03:48.459> me<00:03:48.609> and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
can make it quite high wasted on me and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.340 
can make it quite high wasted on me and
then<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.940> comes<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.239> reasonable<00:03:49.810> length<00:03:50.109> and

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
then it comes to a reasonable length and

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.099 
then it comes to a reasonable length and
not<00:03:51.130> too<00:03:51.459> short<00:03:51.850> but<00:03:52.150> doesn't<00:03:52.630> come<00:03:52.840> anywhere

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
not too short but doesn't come anywhere

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.599 
not too short but doesn't come anywhere
near<00:03:53.260> my<00:03:53.590> knees<00:03:53.769> which<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.430> good

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
near my knees which is really good

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.340 
near my knees which is really good
because<00:03:54.670> that's<00:03:54.910> not<00:03:55.120> flattering<00:03:55.810> length<00:03:55.989> all

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
because that's not flattering length all

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.530 
because that's not flattering length all
for<00:03:56.590> me<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.889> so<00:03:57.579> just<00:03:57.609> when<00:03:57.940> this<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.269> really

over the past few weeks and I just found

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.860 
over the past few weeks and I just found
it<00:05:05.160> just<00:05:05.490> doesn't<00:05:05.880> do<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.120> job<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.419> same<00:05:06.630> so

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
it just doesn't do the job the same so

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.060
