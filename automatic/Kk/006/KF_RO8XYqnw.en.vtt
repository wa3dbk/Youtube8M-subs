some money into this and try to fix the
lag<00:00:57.420> issues<00:00:57.809> somehow<00:00:59.000> now<00:01:00.000> another<00:01:00.359> thing<00:01:00.480> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.240 
me I know they annoy other players I've
been<00:01:51.899> looking<00:01:52.259> around<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> internet<00:01:52.860> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
been looking around the internet and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880 
been looking around the internet and
I've<00:01:53.340> been<00:01:53.490> seeing<00:01:53.790> forms<00:01:54.299> what<00:01:55.290> weapons<00:01:55.770> are

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I've been seeing forms what weapons are

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.399 
I've been seeing forms what weapons are
node<00:01:56.070> you're<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> most<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.689> say<00:01:57.899> weapon<00:01:58.320> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
node you're the most and I say weapon it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.990 
node you're the most and I say weapon it
was<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:58.890> attachment<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.820> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
was more of an attachment but the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
was more of an attachment but the
grenade<00:02:00.270> launcher<00:02:00.780> shouldn't<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.500> available

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
grenade launcher shouldn't be available

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
grenade launcher shouldn't be available
as<00:02:02.219> an<00:02:02.399> attachment<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> should<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
as an attachment I think it should be a

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.950 
as an attachment I think it should be a
launcher<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> weapon<00:02:05.189> because<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.570> powerful

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
launcher a weapon because it's powerful

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.660 
launcher a weapon because it's powerful
and<00:02:07.320> it's<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.829> sniper<00:02:08.099> can<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.550> your

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and it's like the sniper can get your

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.780 
and it's like the sniper can get your
mom<00:02:08.879> calendars<00:02:09.119> don't<00:02:09.660> agree<00:02:09.899> with<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
mom calendars don't agree with it

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.130 
mom calendars don't agree with it
so<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.820> think<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.300> should<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.480> available<00:02:12.720> as

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
so I think that should be available as

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.670 
so I think that should be available as
an<00:02:13.290> attachment<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> most<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:16.260> for<00:02:16.500> no

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
an attachment at the most and as for no

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.100 
an attachment at the most and as for no
and<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.340> for<00:02:17.550> newbie<00:02:17.910> guns<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.660> I'm
