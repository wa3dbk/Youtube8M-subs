00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone in today's video os 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.150
 bring collaboration to April das 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.180
 makeup that is a girl who makes 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.910
 super super super beautiful makeups 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.300
 I'll leave your video here so the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.300
 you know 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.800
 and we have decided to make a ready 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.240
 with me more or less and will do the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.430
 part of makeup and I'm going to do the 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.200
 part of good hairstyles I bring you 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.730
 three super super easy hairstyles 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.680
 do with things that we have all the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.420
 world at home and do not need or 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.280
 heat machines or spoil I do not know 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.690
 but nothing is three super hairstyles 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.230
 easy but that will take us out of 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.230
 any trouble 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.260
 the first hairstyle is super super easy 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.330
 let's start making a ponytail 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.330
 normal and lateral current 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.580
 when you have it done we are going to divide 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.990
 above the pigtail our hair 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.240
 in two parts 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 and once we have it divided we're going 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.689
 to raise the pigtail up and the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.720
 We put in the hole that has been 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.820
 stayed and now it's just now 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.670
 is to put everything a little bit so that 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.420
 look better the more narrow 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.420
 and it is already 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.979
 here it has been super easy it is a way of 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.780
 give a pigtail a different touch 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.579
 normal and current seems to be very 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.270
 much more elaborate than what 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.270
 really is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.099
 now we go with the second proposal already 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.379
 you will see that it is also very easy, we are going to 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.709
 start doing a queue more or less 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.709
 normal 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.159
 and when we go to the last round 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.290
 of the ponytail we do not take it out completely 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.610
 we leave about half this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.160
 depends a little on the length of 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.530
 your hair but they have to be like that 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.530
 with a little hair out 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.250
 and now we simply raise the lock of 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.040
 down up 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.360
 and we put it through the little hole that we 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.360
 has been around in the middle 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 and now let's narrow down a bit 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.320
 hair to turn it around and put it 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.320
 inward 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.560
 so little by little we are putting it with 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.850
 a little patience we 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 stirring the hair back 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.050
 and putting all the parts that we are 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 remain loose for this reason 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.760
 you can help with some forks 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.569
 here is also super easy it seems more 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.420
 elaborated of what is 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.490
 and is that his hairstyle is over 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.010
 You can also place some 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.530
 accessory some pretty hairpins or 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.709
 like me in this case what I'm going to 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.569
 use is a jewel of these to for 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.810
 the head for the hair to give it a 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.980
 touch a little more 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.980
 more glamorous 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.510
 and we have reached the last hairstyle of this 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.100
 video for this we are going to use a 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.470
 rubber band and we're going to make a 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.710
 high pigtail of all normal life and 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.710
 current 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:59.340
 then we're going to help with a donut 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.340
 to make more volume in the bun 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.740
 then we put it and we are putting 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.099
 all our hair around 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.099
 and will fix it with a rubber band hair 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.880
 now with the hair we have 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.010
 surplus 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.770
 let's do something quick you can 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.000
 braid it or like me in this case 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.600
 just what I'm going to do is 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.670
 twist it a little bit so that it shapes 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.350
 around our bun so that it does not 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.890
 so there is a little bit more more 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.890
 Elaborated 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.729
 and as you see we put it around 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:59.609
 of the dock so we will also hide the 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.349
 rubber hair and we will fix it with some 

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:03.239
 hairpins or me in this case I do not 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.729
 I had forks I used a rubber band 

00:06:03.239 --> 00:06:07.739
 of hair very very finite to you 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.089
 they also happen to you that you lose 

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:11.429
 damn hairpins that you can 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.139
 buy 500 that in three weeks now 

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:15.439
 you have lost all where the 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.439
 Forks 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.050
 and as a final touch to make it a 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.419
 little bit more carefree with a brush or 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.090
 Boli or whatever you want we will take a 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:31.830
 little hair so there is a 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.729
 little bit more volume and it's a little bit 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:39.719
 more month and more more carefree 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:44.460
 and there you are these are the three hairstyles 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.460
 yes, since they are super super easy 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.409
 also as a touch you can put it 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:58.740
 around some pearls or some 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.690
 chain with flowers or something out there that 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.909
 you have what you can put around the 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:05.389
 bow and will give a very very very effect 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:05.389
