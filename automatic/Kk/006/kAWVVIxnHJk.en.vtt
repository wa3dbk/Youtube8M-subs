 I present to you a new translation of the lesson on 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.050
 shooting newborns less 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.550

 my channel 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.599
 Today our guest is a baby aria to her 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.680
 only 5 days old 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.390
 she is still very baby mom fed her 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 before they came to me and i 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.910
 I usually ask parents for a child 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.250
 fed before shooting so us 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 do not need to be interrupted by feeding 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 baby is now full and therefore rather 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.579
 she will fall asleep altogether in that case 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.350
 I will not pass it on to 90 percent 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.090
 cases i start shooting with swaddling 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.460
 see what her beautiful hair 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.039
 up just incredible i'm already 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 previously washed my hands and baby 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 Hazel is completely naked on 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.489
 one diaper while mom keeps 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.020
 baby on hands and starting 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.530
 turn it over to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.450
 check if she fell asleep tightly with me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.970
 pretty cool hands many 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.500
 photographers wear soft gloves 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.009
 in order to touch a child they are not 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.659
 may i need to have contact with the baby 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.180
 if i'm not a hundred percent sure what 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.590
 the baby fell asleep then I swaddled him 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.540
 I always try to think and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.320
 getting ready for a photo shoot with a newborn 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.900
 I now prepare the baby 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 her to shoot I put these on her 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.000
 wonderful knitted shorts that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.829
 close the diaper so in the photo 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
 you won't see a diaper even if 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.130
 will slightly crawl out from under these 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 I have shorts just in case 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.770
 wonderful lilac skirt for 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.750
 kids 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.390
 Now I will try to pick her up 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.450
 see if she fell asleep or not 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.369
 a little bit if she didn't fall asleep then 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.369
 I can always swaddle her 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.270
 Now we will try to start shooting right 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
 so without a diaper and see how you are 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 will lead the baby korea during the shooting 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.930
 usually i have someone who is watching 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.090
 for a child while shooting he woke up 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.610
 or not this may be an assistant either 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.730
 dad or mom could you come 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 sit here beside you thanks today 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.290
 I work without an assistant and will 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.030
 use the help of parents on their own 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.709
 your phone and including recording sound in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.750
 flowing water which will calm 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.750
 baby and create the effect of white sum 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.430
 we will take a picture of the baby here 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.530
 this basket or tub which we 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.600
 stuffed with all sorts of soft blankets 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.549
 can use rags covered 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.010
 whatever you see, what is the depth of u 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.959
 this basket 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.900
 so I fill this one with something 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.200
 soft so that the child is comfortable 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:59.640
 lie here not very gently let's 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.099
 change them in places and here is a rag 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.799
 nice to hang around the edges of the basket 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:11.400
 that's it much softer so bed we 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:15.650
 her up and here on this soft fur 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.650
 litter we will lay out the child 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:22.829
 let's try to put ours there 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.840
 baby and it is very important to put the child in 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.760
 posture you want while you hold it on 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.350
 hands 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.970
 let the child take the desired position until 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.989
 how will you lay it out 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.989
 somewhere for shooting 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.930
 always need to sit next to someone 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.180
 watched the baby because she can 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.940
 now jerk unexpectedly and something 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.980
 this capacity can happen enough 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.550
 sturdy so she's not going anywhere but 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.760
 does not matter 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.070
 mom sits here at length 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.850
 hands to support the child 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:04.590
 if I see something happen now to us 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:12.180
 need to lull the child to make sure that 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:14.340
 aria fell asleep now I will ask mom 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.160
 support your arm right here on your back 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 baby while i will cook the light i will 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.970
 take the lens 50 millimeters off 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.950
 me camera canon 5d mark 2 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.260
 as you see here the source behind me 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.970
 Light is now modeling light is off 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.340
 but the impulse is to work and one more 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.520
 source here now we will do 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:36.960
 test frame perfectly she opened one 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:45.080
 eye and I want to change position a little 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:45.080
 and heads like that all is well 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.570
 I usually take off from different positions changing 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.540
 shooting angle taking horizontal and 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.220
 vertical frames'm taking top 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:19.010
 I move a little aside 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:22.430
 she is such a beauty how great 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.050
 it turns out I like it we 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.870
 today is just perfect little 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.880
 model is all just great make sure 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.550
 what you got all the footage you 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.870
 wanted for your shooting 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.700
 Now I want to make more small 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.530
 changes to take a picture just 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:45.160
 perfect i want to raise a little and 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:47.870
 his court duck she will smile now 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.400
 sometimes when i walk baby closer to 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.860
 shift it i see something interesting 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.860
 I think about the need to make such a frame too 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.020
 make a couple more shots from the top point 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.430
 shooting some think it's for shooting 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.230
 newborns need to be used in 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.710
 mostly lens only 50 millimeters 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.570
 I do not agree you are limited 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.360
 free movement when you shoot 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.920
 by 50 millimeters 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.250
 I like the best way to shoot on 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.600
 lens 24 70 millimeters and this is my 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.600
 one of the most favorite lenses 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.610
 most likely you will not need 200 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.800
 photos in one pose 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.690
 so make sure you get this 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.259
 the frame you need and change the position 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.259
 baby 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:07:00.550
 seems like u really liked to lie in 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:03.090
 this basket oh god but isn't she 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.090
 lovely 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:15.940
 like this posture seems to me a lot 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:17.050
 more interesting she's so cute i just 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:23.110
 fall in love mia 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:25.030
 look I don't need to do 20 thousand 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.860
 same photos so when i 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.020
 I feel that I got this one 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.759
 frame i give mom to choose he chooses 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.520
 one photo is the best 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.139
 some more if you make a book to you 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.569
 need to take a photo with the general plan 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:40.120
 some large snapshots some 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.150
 details and then you can already change 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.860
 scenery if you liked the translation 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.659
