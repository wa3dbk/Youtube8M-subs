00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
when Jean would go at the beginning of

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.750 
when Jean would go at the beginning of

playing it upside down when I go to the

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.279 
playing it upside down when I go to the
second<00:00:55.879> chord<00:00:56.210> here<00:00:56.479> and<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.870> little<00:00:57.140> teeny

upside-down<00:01:02.390> ago<00:01:08.979> make<00:01:09.979> sense<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:11.799> other

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
upside-down ago make sense and in other

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.440 
upside-down ago make sense and in other
songs<00:01:13.250> like<00:01:13.490> in<00:01:15.490> Washington's<00:01:16.490> next<00:01:16.970> there's

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
songs like in Washington's next there's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.820 
songs like in Washington's next there's
one<00:01:17.600> part<00:01:17.840> at<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:17.960> end<00:01:18.080> where<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.380> was<00:01:18.500> using<00:01:18.649> a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
one part at the end where I was using a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.219 
one part at the end where I was using a
Wang<00:01:19.130> mar<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:20.179> make<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.509> sound<00:01:20.690> like<00:01:20.869> a<00:01:20.929> wolf

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
Wang mar to make it sound like a wolf

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.330 
Wang mar to make it sound like a wolf
100<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.789> I<00:01:23.000> try<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.830> make<00:01:24.830> sounds<00:01:25.190> like<00:01:25.220> that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
100 so I try and make sounds like that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.399 
100 so I try and make sounds like that
in<00:01:25.819> skin<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.420> my<00:01:26.509> teeth<00:01:26.539> is<00:01:26.899> another<00:01:27.200> really

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
in skin of my teeth is another really

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.249 
in skin of my teeth is another really
neat<00:01:27.649> part<00:01:27.920> 2<00:01:28.130> because<00:01:28.340> when<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.640> band

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
neat part 2 because when the band

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.600 
neat part 2 because when the band
rebuilds<00:01:30.259> itself<00:01:30.380> with<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.950> song<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
rebuilds itself with the song in the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.570 
rebuilds itself with the song in the
middle<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.149> tension<00:01:32.600> after<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.960> solo

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
middle for the tension after the solo

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.109 
middle for the tension after the solo
the<00:01:34.580> riff<00:01:34.850> stops<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:35.539> just<00:01:35.720> go<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.850> kind<00:01:38.000> of

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
the riff stops I just go just a kind of

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.180 
the riff stops I just go just a kind of
it<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> main<00:01:39.530> scratching<00:01:40.069> spatial<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.740> a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
it like a main scratching spatial so a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.740 
it like a main scratching spatial so a
lot<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> interesting<00:01:44.240> things<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.659> do

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
lot of interesting things you can do

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.469 
lot of interesting things you can do
with<00:01:44.840> your<00:01:44.899> pic<00:01:45.200> without<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.709> even<00:01:45.890> having<00:01:46.039> to

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
with your pic without you even having to

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:54.360 
with your pic without you even having to
fret<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> other<00:01:47.780> side<00:01:48.470> of<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.679> guitar

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.220 

okay<00:01:55.090> we're<00:01:55.690> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> show<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.020> something

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
okay we're going to show you something

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.620 
okay we're going to show you something
right<00:01:56.410> now<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.760> picking<00:01:57.760> chords<00:01:58.120> upside<00:01:58.420> down

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
right now to picking chords upside down

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.440 
right now to picking chords upside down
and<00:01:59.760> that<00:02:00.760> doesn't<00:02:01.060> make<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.180> lot<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.360> sense

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
and that doesn't make a lot of sense

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.150 
and that doesn't make a lot of sense
right<00:02:01.690> now<00:02:01.840> but<00:02:01.990> for<00:02:02.170> me<00:02:02.470> when<00:02:02.620> you<00:02:02.740> voice<00:02:02.980> a

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
right now but for me when you voice a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.070 
right now but for me when you voice a
chord<00:02:03.430> upside<00:02:03.760> down<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.330> hear<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.900> higher

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
chord upside down and hear the higher

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.680 
chord upside down and hear the higher
notes<00:02:05.410> first<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.730> obvious<00:02:06.850> he's<00:02:07.300> going<00:02:07.570> to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
notes first and obvious he's going to

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.390 
notes first and obvious he's going to
sound<00:02:07.990> better<00:02:08.290> because<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:08.950> hear<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.250> whole

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
sound better because you hear the whole

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.820 
sound better because you hear the whole
court<00:02:09.820> if<00:02:10.090> you<00:02:10.479> hit<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.869> lower<00:02:11.140> note<00:02:11.500> first

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
court if you hit the lower note first

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.280 
court if you hit the lower note first
it's<00:02:12.700> kind<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:12.970> like<00:02:13.120> having<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.570> fat<00:02:13.780> person<00:02:14.050> in

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it's kind of like having a fat person in

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.230 
it's kind of like having a fat person in
your<00:02:14.440> house<00:02:14.560> ain't<00:02:14.860> much<00:02:15.100> left<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.550> do<00:02:15.820> after

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
your house ain't much left to do after

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.010 
your house ain't much left to do after
that<00:02:16.270> note<00:02:16.720> takes<00:02:17.050> over<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.070> i<00:02:18.730> will<00:02:19.510> pick<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
that note takes over so i will pick the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.120 
that note takes over so i will pick the
notes<00:02:20.260> upside<00:02:20.710> down

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.660 

does<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.060> make<00:02:25.210> sense<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.510> you
