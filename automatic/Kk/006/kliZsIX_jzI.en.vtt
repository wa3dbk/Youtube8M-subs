there's<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.700> basis<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.450> let's<00:04:06.900> take<00:04:07.110> a

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
there's the basis for that let's take a

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.130 
there's the basis for that let's take a
look<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.620> antutu<00:04:08.690> software<00:04:09.690> on<00:04:09.840> both

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
look at the antutu software on both

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.170 
look at the antutu software on both
these<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.709> we'll<00:04:10.890> see<00:04:11.160> how<00:04:11.340> they<00:04:11.459> both<00:04:11.730> ferret

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
these and we'll see how they both ferret

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.620 
these and we'll see how they both ferret
out<00:04:12.800> is<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.980> ante<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.550> benchmarking<00:04:15.330> software

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
out is the ante to benchmarking software

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
that's version llevo version 3.3 that we

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.409 
that's version llevo version 3.3 that we
have<00:04:20.640> on<00:04:20.820> here<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:23.090> yes<00:04:24.090> version<00:04:24.570> 3.3<00:04:25.169> and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
let's take a look at the scores that we

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.600 
let's take a look at the scores that we
have<00:04:30.870> on<00:04:31.229> these<00:04:31.530> devices<00:04:31.890> now<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.400> can<00:04:32.520> see

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
have on these devices now you can see

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.020 
have on these devices now you can see
the<00:04:32.729> HT<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.300> score<00:04:33.630> is<00:04:34.340> 19,000<00:04:36.380> 667<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:38.030> HTC

one score is 10 times of 606 so almost a

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.690 
one score is 10 times of 606 so almost a
