00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.180
 well everyone knows that pokémon is a 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.270
 the most successful franchises in 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.369

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.880
 about pokémon 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.460
 but what few people pay attention to is about 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.160
 the spinoff pokémon for those who do not know the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.559
 Pinocchio are different eagles games 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.739
 games that take the universe from some 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.329
 franchise and change the theme of that game 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.729
 turning other lose games 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.379
 other different games then it is 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.569
 of these games that we will talk about now 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.079

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:53.149

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.609
 for over 15 years pokémon has been doing 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.159
 success in games and has become one of 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.839
 biggest nintendo franchises 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.929
 all this popularity has made him 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.600
 won several parallel games the 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.289
 called thorny and it is from them that we go 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.340
 Talk now starting with pokémons nep 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.350
 released for nintendo 64 in 1999 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.770
 In this game your goal is not to battle 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.380
 with the pokémons and yes take pictures of them 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.780
 in the best poses possible 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.939
 that is you go out there all over the world 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 hunting pokémons to take pictures of them 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.390
 in their natural environments in the world 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.719
 clear open 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.630
 the game is very short but very fun 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.509
 pokémon pinball for the color game brought 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.039
 the pokémon theme for pings instead 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.140
 to play with metal balls 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.880
 Do you have a little ball and still give 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.929
 to capture the Pokémon during the 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.899
 departures 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.179
 pokémon tim kagame this version of the game 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.789
 pokemon cards made up success 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.280
 even with the physical cards where we can 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.310
 find championships out there and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 events in several versions of this game already 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.939
 have been released for tablets and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.009
 other pokémon stadium consoles released 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.140
 for nintendo 64 this series of games 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.480
 marked many people for bringing the 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.110
 Pocket Monsters for the World 3 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.970
 In epic battles the game has several 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.599
 innovations for the time in addition to several 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.239
 mini games spread by the pokémon game 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.239
 colision released for the gamecube 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.640
 the game has a rpg mode in 3d as well 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.650
 fun but not very faithful to the rest 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.080
 of the series without capture of pokémons 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.310
 without gyms and other 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.620
 details too 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.280
 still the game yielded a sequel 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.750
 called pokémon x the game of darkness 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.400
 with a bucking games list 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.410
 Pokémon is huge. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.769
 I will now quote the main ones 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.290
 starting with pokémon posed change 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.470
 released for the game collor is basically 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.569
 a pokemon tetris where the objective is 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.900
 form powerful combinations 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.920
 between the pieces of the puzzle because 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.260
 dying nintendo ds made good use of the screen 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.720
 sensitive to the touch of the ds in capturing 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.150
 pokémons where you had to turn one 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.609
 pawn around the screen without 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.590
 bump into nothing to catch the 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:18.530
 pokémon hubble released for nintendo 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.120
 wii in 2009 is one of the few games 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.250
 based on pokémon in which the 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.400
 little monsters really fight for real 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.650
 under direct control of the player the title 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:32.239
 already received sequences for the 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 and nintendo 3ds pokémon a academy one of the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.280
 games with a more interesting concept 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.349
 of nintendo ds was certainly the series to 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.200
 the free fall to which he taught techniques 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.049
 drawings and paintings that could 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.609
 be taken off the notebook and to 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.680
 real life 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.500
 in nintendo 3ds the franchise received a 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.840
 variation with pokemon themes allowing 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.359
 that fans could learn and create 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.150
 paintings of your favorite monsters 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.220
 and to close with the golden key is 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.859
 being developed in Japan a game of 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.000
 called pokémons fight because in 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.980
 average lathe 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.590
 one curiosity about this game is that 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.449
 it is being produced by the same team 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.620

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.870

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.359

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.549
 Frantic full of fuel this 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.120
 game in for now it will be released 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.220

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.440
