00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
rendering and clouds in general have not

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
rendering and clouds in general have not
changed<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.580> really<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.600> not

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.340 
changes to them I mean it you know it's
something<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.630> always<00:01:27.720> been<00:01:27.960> part<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
something it's always been part of the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.280 
something it's always been part of the
game<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.610> know<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:30.090> fast<00:01:30.659> clouds<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
game you know they are fast clouds and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
game you know they are fast clouds and
fancy<00:01:31.829> clouds<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.430> know<00:01:32.520> there's<00:01:32.759> some

classic<00:01:39.390> update<00:01:40.229> Wow<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.119> only<00:01:42.360> thing<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
classic update Wow the only thing that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.219 
classic update Wow the only thing that
changed<00:01:43.140> between<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.680> was<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.729> UM<00:01:45.509> which

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
changed between them was the UM which

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.270 
changed between them was the UM which
way<00:01:46.409> they<00:01:46.560> floated<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.280> being<00:01:47.640> disabled<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
way they floated and being disabled so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
way they floated and being disabled so
the<00:01:50.280> first<00:01:50.640> time<00:01:50.939> they<00:01:51.119> were<00:01:51.180> added<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.930> in

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the first time they were added was in

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.520 
the first time they were added was in
2009<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.759> we've<00:01:53.970> had<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> same<00:01:54.540> clouds<00:01:54.990> since

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
2009 so we've had the same clouds since

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.310 
2009 so we've had the same clouds since
2009<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.670> definitely<00:01:57.450> something<00:01:57.990> needs<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> be

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
2009 so definitely something needs to be

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
2009 so definitely something needs to be
a<00:01:58.380> little<00:01:58.560> updated<00:01:58.979> there<00:01:59.130> especially<00:01:59.880> if

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
a little updated there especially if

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.480 
a little updated there especially if
it's<00:02:00.060> causing<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.630> FPS<00:02:01.079> lag<00:02:01.490> something

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's causing so much FPS lag something

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.889 
it's causing so much FPS lag something
else<00:02:02.759> that's<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.390> added<00:02:03.719> our

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
else that's going to be added our

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
else that's going to be added our
command<00:02:04.380> blocks<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.860> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> be<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> little

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
command blocks are going to be a little

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
command blocks are going to be a little
changed<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.390> there's<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.960> new

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
changed up there's going to be a new

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.900 
changed up there's going to be a new
graphic<00:02:07.469> user<00:02:07.619> interface<00:02:07.770> which<00:02:08.759> will

is a little hard to understand but you

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.430 
is a little hard to understand but you
