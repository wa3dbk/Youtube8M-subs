00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.180
 good the or by the numbers came favorite 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.160
 this match against the bosses 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.410
 the university technician who had 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.230
 done a good job and found 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.290
 the first one not a very good against for 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.850
 that this number 16 for the goyeneche 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.279
 ends up being the first one hits you from 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.860
 fast first very good pass 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.080
 maldonado and this first low nothing 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.300
 what to do for goalkeeper for good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.430
 ariel daniel kings and finish 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.550
 picking it up inside another one that has 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.379
 the u in a headbutt a bounce is left 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 there and there appears the importance of 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.040
 archer to bail out to bail 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.290
 forward and the ball goes through the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.470
 side is again comes the man who 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 I know how that position and in this rebound the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.100
 people what is in the best 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.630
 position in the first half hits me 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.520
 it looks like this tiny July coast 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.989
 most mobile of the utc people for 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.480
 that the hand appears important 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 home goalie to get the ball 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 on the crossbar and in this there is no 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 there is a lack shoulder to shoulder and without 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.540
 But it is eaten by Goyenechea and as 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 says my friend jesus were alone 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 of fast love and how you do not eat 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 the second and then find the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.000
 second in this a good center what 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.980
 find anyone to dial this number 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.140
 9 maldonado who gets his head 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.450
 below something else could be seen 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.010
 archer seems to me kings because it's fair 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.440
 it seems where the archer has to go 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.850
 to look for the ball with decision is very 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.440
 good the utc that is opening the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.270
 ball at times I thought he was entering 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 home on the angle you had stuck 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.690
 number 9 that had entered the 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.330
 second time the man of the two 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.310
 goals and filipe and the ball is going 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.990
 opening 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.600
 and this is another one that has a way 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.340
 strong and then bounce I think that 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.770
 from the experience the archer and the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.899
 experience takes it out of the ball 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 for me it was in is the repetition 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.509
 you have to study hard the name that 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 going from head to back is this one of the 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 good players that people 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 university esparza 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.939
 another one that has this path that had 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.069
 entered time is very strong the center 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 a lot of power and road takes it out of the 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.550
 way of the oven 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.550
 it does everything right the technical gesture 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.480
 of pointer in this group the people 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.849
