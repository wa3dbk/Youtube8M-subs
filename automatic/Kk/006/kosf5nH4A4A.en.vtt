what<00:04:13.170> it<00:04:13.260> look<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:15.510> a<00:04:15.540> good<00:04:15.690> idea<00:04:15.810> to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
what it look like it's a good idea to

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.469

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
this is one of the reasons I carry this

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.040 
this is one of the reasons I carry this
kit<00:05:50.010> so<00:05:50.220> it<00:05:50.820> should<00:05:51.000> principally<00:05:51.660> be<00:05:51.810> ready

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
kit so it should principally be ready

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:02.610 
kit so it should principally be ready
let's<00:05:52.380> take<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.560> look<00:05:52.770> at<00:05:52.890> it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.430 

and<00:06:03.620> it<00:06:03.740> have<00:06:03.890> not<00:06:04.100> burnt<00:06:04.400> to<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.390> bottom<00:06:05.690> what

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
and it have not burnt to the bottom what

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.530 
and it have not burnt to the bottom what
we<00:06:06.560> have<00:06:06.740> now<00:06:06.890> is<00:06:07.190> a<00:06:07.220> little<00:06:07.970> bit<00:06:08.090> more<00:06:08.330> than

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540

eat it straight out of the cabbage this
is<00:06:47.000> one<00:06:47.240> reason<00:06:47.420> it's<00:06:47.720> awesome<00:06:48.140> survival<00:06:48.560> food

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
is one reason it's awesome survival food

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.780 
is one reason it's awesome survival food
if<00:06:50.000> it's<00:06:50.180> frozen<00:06:50.480> in<00:06:51.260> the<00:06:51.440> hard<00:06:51.650> winter<00:06:51.800> just

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:52.790 
if it's frozen in the hard winter just

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.930 
if it's frozen in the hard winter just
open<00:06:53.210> the<00:06:53.270> can<00:06:53.300> put<00:06:53.750> it<00:06:53.900> on<00:06:54.050> the<00:06:54.170> fire<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:55.190> heat

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
open the can put it on the fire and heat

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.690 
open the can put it on the fire and heat
it<00:06:56.060> up<00:06:56.530> we<00:06:57.530> got<00:06:57.710> a<00:06:57.740> target<00:06:57.980> in<00:06:58.280> here

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
it up we got a target in here
