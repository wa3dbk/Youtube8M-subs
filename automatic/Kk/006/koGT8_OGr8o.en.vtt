00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.020
 there are peculiar people who have ashtrays with soda cans other 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.300
 they make those little dolls with the only ones they have left over from the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.080
 sandwiches but we surpass those who build buildings with jazz bubbles 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.739
 efe 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.210
 you have gone well there are people who do not use or half concrete 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.319
 good soap bubbles rather the help of soap bubbles for 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:28.869
 build 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.300
 and that's not what I say, Carlos Vinuesa says he's a mathematician 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 autonomous university of madrid and that's where it has proven why I if not what 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 I see 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.810
 good 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.420
 I never thought that the mathematical 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.780
 from behind funny carlos lives abbreviate from the bed too 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.540
 can you please stop this is something scientific because I'm doing 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.640
 I do not see anything scientific old scientific name because you think that the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.620
 bubbles have inconformed wait 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.510
 too easy 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.630
 because this forgave 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.440
 and if we put the square 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.260
 of the letter and debtors square compass 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.620
 then let's see them 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.620
 the products then for that reason is that the thick 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.920
 well because of all the surfaces but they cover that amount in their 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.700
 inside 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.220
 the first task comes 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.930
 on the sidewalk 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740
 good not even for let's make bubbles instead of bubbles 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.810
 favre in front the different and because the bubble is very well there in your 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.080
 inside like the spherical ones that we did before 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200
 the pomp is something that no tate lamented this wire 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.520
 you see it but a flat ashton pump has compacted vale asks for the pampas that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.140
 can be formed with that volume I could be some did bomb goes to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.610
 follow up down is that the flat pomp in which you have lower 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.240
 surface, no matter how hard we try, the pumps do not stop in their efforts to 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.260
 occupy the same 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.930
 and we see it in these effects 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.270
 the behavior we observe serves a powerful reason besides 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.020
 mathematical that color 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.480
 mother nature like any of ours now too 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.260
 that's why when we sign the pump it is circulated 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.320
 in this way it occupies the smallest possible surface 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:11.779
 we go that the troops to what is known colloquially as 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.889
 roses 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.230
 good then imagine you have to have 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.440
 a road network 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.749
 between several cities 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.919
 make it as short as possible as it does 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.729
 the director of the ccs 

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.439
 good this piece 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.229
 imagine that peace presentations 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.619
 and be like that on a triangle shaped map 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.589
 As the shorter roads that the counts do, we are going to say what the 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.589
 July pomp as they tend to have the least surface 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.769
 architects and engineers are based on the behavior of the pump for 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.219
 build is difficult ospina and signal road networks 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.579
 By choosing the smallest possible surface the soap always shows us the way 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.779
 shorter to join several points 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:56.650
 which greatly appreciates the pocket because it is the most 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:57.379
 economic 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.379
 minor would do to build lower spending 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.879
 and now we have arrived at noon of the matter because we are going to 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:04.220
 watch 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.760
 that you have to see the bubbles with the architecture because this you see 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 here 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.029
 according to estimated the city and Alan Phillips 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.989
 adif is leading the process 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.829
 the ñuñoa Olympic stadium 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.059
 that hosted the 1972 games was designed by the architect fry another 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:30.289
 based on the theories of soap bubbles 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:35.069
 He raised some pillars to those already known that were not tense and submerged 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.529
 in a solution of soapy water 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:41.370
 in this way another got a breasts that had the minimum surface 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.629
 possible thus saving on the amount of material 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.709
 in addition to the Olympic Games zone he preached all designed under this 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.029
 technical the German pavilion of the montreal exhibition 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.160
 the same was practiced a little bit he managed to turn this body 8 into him 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.160
 rival's political stadium 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.129
 me from the belly so many spots repeated
