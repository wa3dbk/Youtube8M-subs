00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
going on why these moldings separate

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.540 
going on why these moldings separate
from<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> door<00:00:15.630> frame<00:00:15.980> and<00:00:16.980> what<00:00:17.100> happens<00:00:17.430> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
from the door frame and what happens is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.250 
from the door frame and what happens is
these<00:00:17.699> clips<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:19.580> they<00:00:20.580> basically<00:00:21.260> separate

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
these clips here they basically separate

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.370 
these clips here they basically separate
from<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> frame<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.570> like<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.869> there's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
from the frame just like this there's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.189 
from the frame just like this there's
little<00:00:25.590> press<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.070> tabs<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.750> clip<00:00:27.960> pulls

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
little press in tabs and the clip pulls

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.849 
little press in tabs and the clip pulls
away<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:29.570> broke<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.689> couple<00:00:30.720> when<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> remove

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
away I broke a couple when I remove

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.630

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
repair compound didn't hold there as you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.420 
repair compound didn't hold there as you
can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:42.660> bar<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:44.010> held<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
can see here this bar is held in the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.170 
can see here this bar is held in the
same<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.910> pressing<00:00:47.910> clips

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
same way but these little pressing clips

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.319 
same way but these little pressing clips
and<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.170> breaks<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> basically<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.149> need

to do is get some repair compound and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
to do is get some repair compound and
weari<00:00:55.410> adhere<00:00:55.860> those<00:00:56.579> two<00:00:56.820> pieces<00:00:56.969> together

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
weari adhere those two pieces together

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.680 
weari adhere those two pieces together
and<00:00:57.930> fix<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.379> clips<00:00:59.449> also<00:01:00.449> when<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.660> have

broken<00:01:00.899> Clips<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.780> can

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
broken Clips like this one here you can

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.509 
broken Clips like this one here you can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
screw that holds what's the front of it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.160 
screw that holds what's the front of it
in<00:01:43.979> by<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> mirror<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.509> got<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.750> remove<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
window to get this out because these

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.260 
window to get this out because these
screws<00:01:49.829> basically<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.460> can't<00:01:50.670> access<00:01:51.090> with

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
screws basically you can't access with

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.539 
screws basically you can't access with
the<00:01:51.360> window<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.770> but<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.890> not<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> big<00:01:53.250> deal<00:01:53.399> to

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the window in but it's not a big deal to

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.800 
the window in but it's not a big deal to
get<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> window<00:01:54.000> up<00:01:54.560> hopefully<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.860> helps

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
get the window up hopefully that helps

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.840 
get the window up hopefully that helps
and<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.110> try<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.380> project<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.700> get

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and you can try this project and get

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.540 
and you can try this project and get
these<00:02:00.000> things<00:02:00.030> working
