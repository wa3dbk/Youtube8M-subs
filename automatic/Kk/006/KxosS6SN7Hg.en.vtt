00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.540
 very interested post 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.460
 line grew 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.600
 ing the basis of the stylus for them kaztag screens 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.419
 so let's say to the lady 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.339
 jointly decided to do 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.539
 a couple of working prototypes 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.179
 empirically 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.480
 it was found that optimal 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.429
 use doubts 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.449
 rolled up 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.839
 ass cube 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.730
 from hard disk 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.970
 So 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.270
 use tape 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.440
 mirror real 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.290
 pledged 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.040
 on a rigid basis 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.480
 hard plastic packing act 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.820
 headphone 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.160
 whereas as instrumentation 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.240
 basis of eastern pro 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.270
 but tough at the same time 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.750
 made with cnews 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.839
 so hard was the tape 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.839
 long enough 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.430
 shifted through 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.980
 if 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.760
 in this place 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 need to be transparent 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.480
 Further 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.030
 evolved 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 stuck 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.560
 Double-sided tape 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 to fit more volume 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.780
 of materials 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 sufficient portable enclosures 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.270
 ira prototype 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.950
 by this technology 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.500
 readiness and university 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.150
 trial version 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.820
 rigidly lined with tape which is here 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.660
 the doctor sank our electrical tape all 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.660
 fixed all took 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.950
 what is this 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 it seemed that performance 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 enough 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 not bad 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.390
 but 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.390
 the ground was not enough 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.140
 however, the area of ​​the policy is larger 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.690
 a brilliant option 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.349
 came across 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.529
 caught the remnants 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.919
 let the remains 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.919
 but also because it is impossible to lose 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.199
 I decided 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.349
 pay tribute 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.909
 books by authority which is not a very long time 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.139
 served 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.059
 accordingly however then there were for 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.059
 of suppliers 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.159
 on the same technology 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.399
 plastic 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.780
 the word is not applied tape yarik 0 3 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.319
 cursing this whole article 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.739
 body reinforced 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.739
 in the fortified 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.229
 cap 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.039
 comfortable enough 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.719
 at this moment falls 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.039
 the opposition 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:00.459
 im son 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.239
 you can varnish 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.239
 until the moment of screams 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.159
 comfortable enough 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.159
 easy at ease without any quotes 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.189
 rather uncomfortable 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.989
 repeat here 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.199
 it turns out 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.399
 one layer of material from the hard disk 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.749
 rake from the second but it is quite 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.919
 enough 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.919
 basically 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.269
 NY 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.049
 without reservation skill 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.609
 even something to write this turnout 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.769
 more convenient 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 no no 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.259
 Unfortunately 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.289
 largely 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.259
 And then the ear is a regular firmware 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:02.259
 jump 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.389
 if not clear enough even 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.579
 insofar as 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.079
 this type of screens 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.620
 determines the average 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:11.919
 the room 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.169
 that point in the middle 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:17.169
 contact 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:19.389
 relevant 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.969
 this is a bribe share of industrial 

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.629
 stylus idea 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.039
 if that 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.159
 Yes, very good 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.110
 to realize 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.110
 you can even draw 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.419
 so everything is in our hands 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.789
 everything from this case, taking into account Ryazan 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.370
 fit 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.159
 minutes 15 20 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.169
 I consider that 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.529
 for 20 minutes 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.529
 and cheaper than the price of oil in the world 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.309
 Sincerely yours 

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.100
 I'm still with u 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.210
 why r
