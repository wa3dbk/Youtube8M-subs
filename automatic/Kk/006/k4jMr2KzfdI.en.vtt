 five thousand 581 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.500
 all these centers are computing 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.700
 machines designed to automatically looked at two phones 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.049
 formerly this operation was carried out by telephone operators 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.610
 the largest and oldest plant is the rotary plant 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.789
 it's called rotary because its broken components do not rotate permanently or 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.789
 occasional 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.379
 the most important parts of the plant are 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.039
 searchers 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.569
 selectors 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.449
 registered 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.769
 all these parts contain several real 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.330
 the relay is an electromagnetic element that works like a 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:42.769
 switch 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.769
 nowadays they have been replaced by other stories 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:51.309
 Search engines have the mission to find an element 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:55.249
 this will vary according to the phase in which we find ourselves being able to be the 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.499
 phone that picks up a free pickup a free recorder 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.109
 They are composed of brush arms that rotate from a boat of 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.359
 terminals on which it makes contact 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.659
 in these terminals that are connected various components of the 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.839
 central 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:19.349
 In the central there are several search engines and these group in racks where each 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.159
 one has its function 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.270
 the generic function of the electors

 this third reader 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.510
 selector fourth the final selector according to the order in which they enter 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.510
 running along a call 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.769
 in addition to its general function 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.719
 each one has another specific 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.709
 the first selector supervises the unhooked and hung from the two 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 phones 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.539
 the fourth selector 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.769
 provide the signals of the state of communication to the diamond 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.769
 and current for the ringing tone 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.129
 the final sector 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:22.460
 once positioned being called 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.749
 determines if it is free

 p 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.290
 coordinating all these machines 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.620
 5th recorder which is the intelligent part of the central 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.879
 the recorder reaches the dialer number 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.770
 and with this information goes to the voters to put in communication 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.800

 the disk of the phone in its recoil movement opened I close via 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.080
 telephone by which the exchange is connected 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.300
 as many times as the number marked 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.860
 is the communication mode this phone calling and the registrar 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.129
 by dialing 1

 an opening 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.719
 when dialing but 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.719
 10 openings 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.919
 these openings and closures are counted to the recorder and stored in the 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.759
 oaks in recorders 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.089
 yesterday on the sidelines for each number checked 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.909
 composed of four leves which are given a previous numerical value 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.650
 4 I made 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.720
 with the combination of these values ​​we can register each number dialed 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.439
 the combined efforts of registrars 

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:45.999
 Gijón by the reception of the marked appointments and the wifi connection reader

 each phone line this unit directly with the search engine first 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.069
 each search engine has first connected with three lines 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.800
 at the moment when a telephone is picked up 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.550
 a voltage change occurs one of the terminals a seeker 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.150
 the brushes of this citizen is located its the terminal belonging to the 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.069
 calling phone 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.069
 each search engine first this union selector first 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.199
 once the search engine has first been located on the pertaining terminal 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:25.469
 to the phone that calls 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.469
 is our first corresponding will be the favor
