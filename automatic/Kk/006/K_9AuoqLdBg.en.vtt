00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
your iDevice and then you have a whole

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
your iDevice and then you have a whole
bunch<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.500> background<00:00:56.190> applications<00:00:56.399> running

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bunch of background applications running

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.610 
bunch of background applications running
obviously<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> background<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
obviously in the background now this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
obviously in the background now this
normally<00:00:59.010> makes<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.340> device<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.820> slower

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149
