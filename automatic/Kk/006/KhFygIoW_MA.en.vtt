why manganese galvanizes shark's teeth

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.730 
why manganese galvanizes shark's teeth
that<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.909> why<00:01:27.330> thin<00:01:27.720> layers<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.439> metal

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
that is why thin layers of this metal

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.160 
that is why thin layers of this metal
deposit<00:01:29.400> themselves<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.450> surface<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.079> the

deposit themselves on the surface of the
teeth<00:01:31.380> over<00:01:31.619> time<00:01:32.390> but<00:01:33.390> scientists<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.229> know

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
teeth over time but scientists do know

teeth over time but scientists do know
how<00:01:34.770> quickly<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> metal<00:01:35.610> accumulates<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
how quickly the metal accumulates and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
how quickly the metal accumulates and
they<00:01:36.990> deduced<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.740> teeth<00:01:37.979> date<00:01:38.280> from<00:01:38.520> at

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
they deduced that the teeth date from at

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.230 
they deduced that the teeth date from at
least<00:01:38.960> 1.5<00:01:39.960> million<00:01:40.470> years<00:01:40.979> ago<00:01:41.250> meaning<00:01:42.030> the

megalodons<00:01:42.810> probably<00:01:43.320> died<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.740> around<00:01:44.040> them

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
megalodons probably died out around them
