00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.950 

now<00:00:05.220> let's<00:00:05.460> try<00:00:05.670> combining<00:00:06.000> vertical<00:00:06.810> hip

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
now let's try combining vertical hip

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.370 
now let's try combining vertical hip
circles<00:00:07.410> with<00:00:07.799> hand<00:00:08.280> undulations<00:00:09.080> so<00:00:10.080> we're

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
circles with hand undulations so we're

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.129 
circles with hand undulations so we're
going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> do<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> stationary<00:00:11.370> hip<00:00:11.519> circle

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
going to do a stationary hip circle

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.049 
going to do a stationary hip circle
pushing<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.259> weight<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.620> right<00:00:13.860> leg

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
belly tight just as lifted so swing back

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.570 
belly tight just as lifted so swing back
up<00:00:21.230> forward<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.590> down

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.120 

going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> frame<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.930> hips<00:00:28.170> bring<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.479 

next<00:00:46.870> let's<00:00:47.110> create<00:00:47.410> an<00:00:47.770> interesting<00:00:48.040> hand

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
next let's create an interesting hand

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.420 
next let's create an interesting hand
undulation<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:49.180> frame<00:00:49.540> for<00:00:49.989> our<00:00:50.020> body<00:00:50.500> so<00:00:51.309> we're

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
undulation a frame for our body so we're

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.330 
undulation a frame for our body so we're
