00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 healthy dear friends viewers and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.990
 subscribers of my channel today we 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 let's talk about that silver and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.610
 a review that lingered a little bit should 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.230
 had come out a little bit earlier all the same 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.570
 but better late than never nevertheless 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.410
 tell a little about his skills honestly 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 saying i was thinking whether due respect due 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.070
 the fact that this article is a living legend 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.890
 which still plays well I thought that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 at least a couple of skills will be assigned to him 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 a little more than he actually plays 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.530
 so but still a legend why and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.770
 no but they decided to do it purely by 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.930
 how he plays and to be honest here these 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 skills that he has now on that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.469
 from the card must be on his usual 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.199
 cards and me this is an ace card not 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.590
 quite surprised even that one too with 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.879
 card in 13 fibula much brighter than 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.729
 this is it pretty slow speed 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:10.470
 80 but felt at 73 877 I do not know 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.430
 why plus is he a little lost in the attack 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.119
 not always where interns are needed because 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.369
 war indoor medium and low 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.440
 maybe well and so 91 ball control 92 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.970
 flexibility 82 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.840
 hryvnia 90 completion 83 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:37.700
 penalty 80 you that these 85 penalty 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.520
 85 strike force 93 reaction and 80 choice 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.580
 4 star positions weak foot four 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.890
 star special tricks now move on to 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.570
 Blow blow him certainly not bad but 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:54.200
 not bad about comparative terms for 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.600
 forward mediocre such a blow to the net 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.270
 one-to-one exits can also be 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.810
 ok but here's a penalty kick 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.450
 strong to twist his average but 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.990
 anyway better and after all and a twist 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.100
 rather than force because he wore 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.270
 blows goes off somewhere in general and in 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.540
 Overall I wished for more and did not surprise then 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.390
 that anri is not very expensive 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.830
 well, not really cool 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 he is in the game but 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.050
 but do not forget that he still 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.600
 already 37 years and and soon thirty eight and 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.270
 I don't know when she will soon soon soon 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.580
 he has to hang the boots on a nail so 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.000
 what I would like to recommend you 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.430

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.950
