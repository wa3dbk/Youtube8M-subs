00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:11.250
 so size for the gland when the gland 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.480
 calendula 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:26.359
 our gland has size 35 inner 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.359
 35 inner 47 per handle and 7 thickness 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.739
 that is 35 40 7 by 7 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:39.120
 click send size here size 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.400
 mandrels are very important first outdoor 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 diameters start with him that is here 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.070
 outdoor loud which will abut 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.049
 in the lid of the oil pump which is like a buzz 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.589
 so far that will not allow the gland to fail 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:55.650
 further here is 50 millimeters 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.360
 tynda and that's what I'm fifty miles from 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.339
 millimeters outer here this inner 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.430
 naturally gland diameter in 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:08.730
 comparing 46 is best done per meter 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.210
 smaller so we have your mandrel 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:20.910
 that is 46 millimeters then holes 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 under directly the crankshaft 2027 itself 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.460
 Well millimeters and the length of the mandrel 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.270
 long we did for convenience but here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 us 12 millimeters can be done not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.830
 less than eight and you yourself something on the height here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.360
 this one here is this phase 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.770
 do so the plaza is very important too 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 at this depth gland will 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.590
 get clogged 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:55.080
 she's about three millimeters 22 soon blame 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.540
 even they are three three and a half years old can 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.670
 here is plus or minus half a meter is better to do 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.000
 three millimeters that's this height with this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.000
 the edges 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.260
 Well 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.110
 towards 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.930
 boys gland measures yes you can not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:33.269
 have i say the postcard 42 sing 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:41.079
 inner 3030 32 by 66 thickness 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:41.950
 Well, here is similar to 50 millimeters in 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.220
 spiders 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.510
 outdoor we must limit them less 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:55.150
 40 one millimeter one here is the thickness under 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 the camshaft is 31 millimeters high 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:06.879
 waist and millimeter 3 millimeter well and 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.560
 the depth here is also not particularly important there 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.420
 camshaft is not much inferior 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:18.209
 that's 10 millimeters long the simplest 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.209
 100 millimeters renounced
