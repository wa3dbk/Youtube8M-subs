00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.970 
recently did was because I found that
when<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.900> was<00:02:36.960> playing<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.590> would<00:02:37.710> constantly

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
when I was playing I would constantly

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.580 
when I was playing I would constantly
have<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> think<00:02:38.700> about<00:02:38.820> my<00:02:39.360> hands<00:02:39.930> hitting<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
have to think about my hands hitting the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.860 
have to think about my hands hitting the
switches<00:02:41.070> and<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.150> people<00:02:42.360> tape<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
switches and a lot of people tape up the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.120 
switches and a lot of people tape up the
switches<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.320> started<00:02:43.650> doing<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.890> but

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
switches and I started doing that but

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.680 
switches and I started doing that but
then<00:02:44.280> recently<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.730> just<00:02:44.820> had<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.300> switches

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
then recently I just had the switches

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.170 
then recently I just had the switches
removed<00:02:46.340> basically<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.460> not<00:02:47.610> just<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.910> one

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
removed basically it's not just the one

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.820 
removed basically it's not just the one
sound<00:02:48.600> guitar<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.320> don't<00:02:49.470> even<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.710> to

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
sound guitar so I don't even have to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.860 
sound guitar so I don't even have to
think<00:02:49.950> about<00:02:50.070> anything<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.060> really<00:02:51.780> like

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
think about anything and I really like

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:04.860 
think about anything and I really like
that

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.170 

and<00:03:05.739> I've<00:03:05.890> never<00:03:06.069> actually<00:03:06.220> seen<00:03:06.400> somebody

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and I've never actually seen somebody

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.479 
and I've never actually seen somebody
set<00:03:08.019> up<00:03:08.050> my<00:03:08.230> guitar<00:03:08.379> before<00:03:08.830> really<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.400> is

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
set up my guitar before really this is

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.220 
set up my guitar before really this is
very<00:03:09.700> exciting<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.269> will<00:03:10.420> occasionally<00:03:10.780> clean

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
very exciting I will occasionally clean

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.140 
very exciting I will occasionally clean
my<00:03:11.379> guitar<00:03:11.709> maybe<00:03:11.950> once<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.489> year<00:03:12.700> or<00:03:12.849> something

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
my guitar maybe once a year or something

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.600 
my guitar maybe once a year or something
and<00:03:13.900> at<00:03:14.379> that<00:03:14.560> point<00:03:14.739> it's<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:14.980> covered<00:03:15.340> in<00:03:15.519> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
and at that point it's just covered in a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.150 
and at that point it's just covered in a
film<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.180> sweat<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.800> definitely<00:03:18.040> a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
film of sweat this is definitely a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:40.550 
film of sweat this is definitely a
workhorse<00:03:18.550> guitar<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.510> love<00:03:19.810> it

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.839 

you<00:03:41.560> know<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.739> a<00:03:41.769> lot<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.010> people<00:03:42.250> label<00:03:42.579> us<00:03:42.700> as

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
you know and a lot of people label us as

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.209 
you know and a lot of people label us as
like<00:03:42.939> a<00:03:43.000> synth<00:03:43.390> pop<00:03:43.599> band<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.349> like<00:03:45.040> to

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:45.219 
like a synth pop band but I like to

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.640 
like a synth pop band but I like to
think<00:03:45.400> of<00:03:45.549> our<00:03:46.150> Sounders<00:03:46.719> broader<00:03:47.349> than<00:03:47.590> that

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
think of our Sounders broader than that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.069 
think of our Sounders broader than that
synthesizes<00:03:48.519> serve<00:03:49.000> one<00:03:49.390> kind<00:03:49.629> of<00:03:49.689> purpose

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
they're not going to be able to do

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.039 
they're not going to be able to do
everything<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.790> and<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.209> like<00:03:52.629> to<00:03:52.840> have
