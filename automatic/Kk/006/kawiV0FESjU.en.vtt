hello YouTube I was watching um to daily

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.850 
hello YouTube I was watching um to daily
magnetopause<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.889> magnetosphere<00:00:12.860> cygnets

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
magnetopause and magnetosphere cygnets

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.920 
magnetopause and magnetosphere cygnets
on<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.340> walk<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:15.199> i<00:00:16.199> just<00:00:17.070> noticed<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
on this walk and i just noticed that

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.080 
on this walk and i just noticed that
starting<00:00:18.930> yesterday<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.480> 1300<00:00:21.830> UTC<00:00:23.090> this

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
starting yesterday about 1300 UTC this

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.950 
starting yesterday about 1300 UTC this
magnetopause<00:00:24.869> line<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.189> all<00:00:27.000> over<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
magnetopause line is just all over the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.800 
magnetopause line is just all over the
place<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.189> scrambling<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.269> crazy

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
place it's just scrambling like crazy

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.010 
place it's just scrambling like crazy
and<00:00:32.270> the<00:00:34.640> we<00:00:35.640> didn't<00:00:35.880> have<00:00:36.030> any<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:36.630> major

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and the we didn't have any really major

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.400 
and the we didn't have any really major
space<00:00:37.559> weather<00:00:38.149> during<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> time<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.230> know

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
space weather during the time you know

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.549 
space weather during the time you know
the<00:00:40.620> highest<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:42.059> KP<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.360> um

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
the highest we got was KP of two and um

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.119 
the highest we got was KP of two and um
and<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> know<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.989> started<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> pull<00:00:49.950> up

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
and you know so I I started to pull up

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.610 
and you know so I I started to pull up
the<00:00:50.789> other<00:00:51.079> magnetic<00:00:53.000> magnetospheric

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
the other magnetic magnetospheric

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
the other magnetic magnetospheric
cygnets<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.809> listen<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:59.899> jumped<00:01:00.899> out

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
cygnets and listen was just jumped out

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.009 
cygnets and listen was just jumped out
is<00:01:01.260> being<00:01:01.559> strange<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.370> I've<00:01:02.789> never<00:01:03.329> seen

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is being strange because I've never seen

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of what's causing this when you when you

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.050 
of what's causing this when you when you
look<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> cosmic<00:01:37.110> rays<00:01:37.320> today<00:01:37.909> there<00:01:38.909> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
look at the cosmic rays today there is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:53.980 
look at the cosmic rays today there is
nothing<00:01:41.150> then<00:01:42.320> when<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.470> look<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:52.970> ACE

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
nothing then when we look at the ACE

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.899 
nothing then when we look at the ACE
plasma<00:01:57.829> density<00:02:00.770> speed<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.189> temperature<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
plasma density speed and temperature is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
plasma density speed and temperature is
all<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:04.159> mmm<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> doesn't<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:08.039> know<00:02:08.330> seem

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
all there mmm it doesn't you know seem

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.559 
all there mmm it doesn't you know seem
like<00:02:09.660> anything

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
like anything

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.920 
like anything
out<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.499> the<00:02:12.650> ordinary<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.680> have<00:02:16.069> no<00:02:16.459> idea

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
out of the ordinary so I have no idea

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.610 
out of the ordinary so I have no idea
what's<00:02:17.930> causing<00:02:18.230> this<00:02:18.909> but<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:20.409> thought<00:02:21.409> I'd

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
what's causing this but I thought I'd

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.580 
what's causing this but I thought I'd
just<00:02:21.650> pass<00:02:22.189> it<00:02:22.430> along<00:02:23.019> thanks<00:02:24.019> for<00:02:24.200> watching

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
just pass it along thanks for watching

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.800 
just pass it along thanks for watching
and<00:02:24.739> God<00:02:24.950> bless<00:02:26.650> I'm<00:02:27.650> just<00:02:28.010> continuing<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:29.090> was

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
and God bless I'm just continuing I was

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.610 
and God bless I'm just continuing I was
looking<00:02:30.019> through<00:02:30.290> solar<00:02:31.129> IMG<00:02:32.000> for<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:33.109> more

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
looking through solar IMG for just more

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.699 
looking through solar IMG for just more
clues<00:02:34.010> of<00:02:34.280> what<00:02:35.209> may<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.629> been<00:02:35.810> causing<00:02:36.469> all

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
clues of what may have been causing all

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.020 
clues of what may have been causing all
that<00:02:37.129> strange<00:02:38.019> strange<00:02:39.019> things<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.669> ran

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
that strange strange things but I ran

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.709 
that strange strange things but I ran
across<00:02:41.209> this<00:02:41.719> one<00:02:44.200> signal<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:47.150> was<00:02:47.329> very

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:47.719 
across this one signal and it was very

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:51.129 
across this one signal and it was very
interesting<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:50.120> looks<00:02:50.389> like<00:02:50.480> it's<00:02:50.629> the

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
interesting and it looks like it's the

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.319 
interesting and it looks like it's the
it's<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.310> Sun<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.689> different<00:02:55.329> magnetic

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
it's the Sun with the different magnetic

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.220 
it's the Sun with the different magnetic
lines<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:58.159> I'm<00:02:59.000> guessing<00:02:59.569> that's<00:02:59.719> what<00:03:00.079> it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
lines to it I'm guessing that's what it

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.369 
lines to it I'm guessing that's what it
is<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:02.269> was<00:03:02.989> like<00:03:03.049> wow<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:03.889> is<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.139> a

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
is and I was like wow this is this is a

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.250 
is and I was like wow this is this is a
very<00:03:07.180> complex<00:03:08.180> form<00:03:08.689> if<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:11.389> relates<00:03:11.870> to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
very complex form if if it relates to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.949 
very complex form if if it relates to
the<00:03:12.650> shape<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.760> Earth's<00:03:14.000> magnetic<00:03:14.930> field

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
the shape of the Earth's magnetic field

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.979 
the shape of the Earth's magnetic field
and<00:03:15.590> I<00:03:16.220> saw<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.759> they<00:03:17.120> got<00:03:17.389> this<00:03:17.629> off<00:03:17.959> of

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
and I saw that they got this off of

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.409 
and I saw that they got this off of
Islam<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:19.699> I<00:03:20.290> went<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.379> the<00:03:21.500> issue<00:03:21.769> aside<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.579> I

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
Islam so I went to the issue aside and I

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.539 
Islam so I went to the issue aside and I
looked<00:03:23.750> for<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.199> and<00:03:24.939> I<00:03:25.939> pulled<00:03:26.659> it<00:03:26.780> up<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.560> I

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
looked for it and I pulled it up and I

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.839 
looked for it and I pulled it up and I
did<00:03:28.759> a<00:03:28.790> comparison<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.470> here's<00:03:33.519> around<00:03:34.519> our

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
did a comparison so here's around our

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:40.719 
did a comparison so here's around our
time<00:03:35.919> this<00:03:36.919> is<00:03:37.129> the<00:03:37.280> 12<00:03:37.579> to<00:03:37.849> 13<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:39.519> you<00:03:40.519> know

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
time this is the 12 to 13 and you know

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:46.420 
time this is the 12 to 13 and you know
if<00:03:41.709> yeah<00:03:42.709> it<00:03:42.769> goes<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.459> 19th<00:03:44.379> but<00:03:45.379> if<00:03:46.129> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
if yeah it goes to the 19th but if you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.439 
if yeah it goes to the 19th but if you
if<00:03:46.849> you<00:03:47.359> look<00:03:47.629> at<00:03:47.810> how<00:03:48.430> complex<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.699> is<00:03:49.900> how

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
if you look at how complex it is how

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:56.499 
if you look at how complex it is how
disorganized<00:03:53.449> it<00:03:54.109> is<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.060> pulled

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:56.509 
disorganized it is and then so I pulled

00:03:56.509 --> 00:04:01.030 
disorganized it is and then so I pulled
it<00:03:56.629> up<00:03:56.780> in<00:03:57.639> 2009<00:03:58.639> and<00:03:59.290> this<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.469> how<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.829> looked

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
it up in 2009 and this is how it looked

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.030 
it up in 2009 and this is how it looked
in<00:04:01.180> 2009<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:02.449> you<00:04:02.629> see<00:04:02.870> how<00:04:03.049> much<00:04:03.680> more

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
in 2009 and you see how much more

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.849 
in 2009 and you see how much more
organized<00:04:04.669> it<00:04:04.969> is<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.840> green<00:04:09.139> is<00:04:09.469> all<00:04:09.680> so

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
organized it is and the green is all so

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.429 
organized it is and the green is all so
you<00:04:12.859> know<00:04:13.069> I<00:04:13.340> know<00:04:14.150> on<00:04:14.509> suspicious<00:04:15.229> observers

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
you know I know on suspicious observers

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.879 
you know I know on suspicious observers
two<00:04:16.190> minute<00:04:16.549> news<00:04:17.349> everybody<00:04:18.349> was<00:04:18.530> talking

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
two minute news everybody was talking

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.300 
two minute news everybody was talking
about<00:04:19.219> how<00:04:19.760> quiet<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.479> Sun<00:04:20.750> is

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
about how quiet the Sun is

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.540 
about how quiet the Sun is
and<00:04:22.370> I'm<00:04:22.910> wondering<00:04:23.870> if<00:04:24.380> this<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.830> a<00:04:24.980> reason

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
and I'm wondering if this is a reason

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.430 
and I'm wondering if this is a reason
why<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.750> sun<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.230> so<00:04:27.410> quiet<00:04:27.770> because<00:04:28.130> this

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
why the sun is so quiet because this

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.250 
why the sun is so quiet because this
complexity<00:04:30.440> or<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:31.750> disorganization<00:04:32.750> in

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
complexity or this disorganization in

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.730 
complexity or this disorganization in
the<00:04:34.250> magnetic<00:04:34.910> field<00:04:36.730> of<00:04:37.730> Earth<00:04:38.270> anyway<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.260> an

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
the magnetic field of Earth anyway is an

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.150 
the magnetic field of Earth anyway is an
indication<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:41.360> very<00:04:41.690> /<00:04:42.530> weakening

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
indication of a very / weakening

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.120 
indication of a very / weakening
magnetic<00:04:43.790> field<00:04:44.060> now<00:04:44.990> if<00:04:45.169> that<00:04:45.470> applies<00:04:46.100> to

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
magnetic field now if that applies to

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.740 
magnetic field now if that applies to
the<00:04:46.520> Sun<00:04:46.960> I'm<00:04:47.980> wondering<00:04:48.980> if<00:04:49.130> that<00:04:50.090> what<00:04:50.450> may

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
the Sun I'm wondering if that what may

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.100 
the Sun I'm wondering if that what may
be<00:04:50.810> causing<00:04:51.669> another<00:04:52.669> quiet<00:04:53.120> solar<00:04:53.690> activity

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
be causing another quiet solar activity

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.520 
be causing another quiet solar activity
in<00:04:54.919> this<00:04:55.660> solar<00:04:56.660> maximum<00:04:57.440> cycle<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.530> that's

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
in this solar maximum cycle so that's

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.360 
in this solar maximum cycle so that's
just<00:05:01.870> a<00:05:03.010> hypothesis<00:05:04.090> because<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:06.500> just<00:05:06.860> wanted

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
just a hypothesis because I just wanted

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.960 
just a hypothesis because I just wanted
to<00:05:07.460> pass<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:08.060> along<00:05:08.500> but<00:05:09.500> just<00:05:10.400> this<00:05:10.580> huge

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
to pass that along but just this huge

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.360 
to pass that along but just this huge
difference<00:05:11.720> just<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.200> a<00:05:12.320> couple<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.770> years<00:05:12.830> in

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
difference just in a couple of years in

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.230 
difference just in a couple of years in
in<00:05:13.639> three<00:05:14.419> years<00:05:14.979> this<00:05:15.979> is<00:05:16.160> how<00:05:16.340> much<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.880> Sun

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
in three years this is how much the Sun

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.120 
in three years this is how much the Sun
changed<00:05:17.870> and<00:05:18.220> I<00:05:19.220> saw<00:05:19.460> this<00:05:19.669> other<00:05:19.910> signet<00:05:21.130> it's

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
changed and I saw this other signet it's

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.110 
changed and I saw this other signet it's
the<00:05:22.370> same<00:05:22.639> time<00:05:23.030> period<00:05:23.860> from<00:05:25.450> 2012<00:05:26.450> today<00:05:26.960> to

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
the same time period from 2012 today to

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.920 
the same time period from 2012 today to
back<00:05:29.120> to<00:05:29.919> this<00:05:30.919> one<00:05:31.070> is<00:05:31.250> actually<00:05:31.570> 2010<00:05:32.570> I

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
back to this one is actually 2010 I

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:44.529 
back to this one is actually 2010 I
meant<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.740> get<00:05:33.940> 2009<00:05:39.100> and<00:05:40.100> AH<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:44.150> won't<00:05:44.390> go

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
meant to get 2009 and AH it won't go

00:05:44.539 --> 00:06:03.150 
meant to get 2009 and AH it won't go
back<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:44.990> 2009<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:47.030> if<00:05:47.180> you<00:05:47.360> go<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.890> 2010<00:05:58.630> books

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:15.050 

yep<00:06:05.200> it's<00:06:06.200> loading<00:06:06.710> or<00:06:07.780> 2012<00:06:08.780> you

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.500 

okay<00:06:15.270> here<00:06:15.480> we<00:06:15.510> go<00:06:18.710> so<00:06:19.710> this<00:06:20.010> is<00:06:20.360> what<00:06:21.360> the

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
okay here we go so this is what the

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.110 
okay here we go so this is what the
magnetic<00:06:22.110> field<00:06:22.440> with<00:06:22.680> earth<00:06:23.400> footprint

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
magnetic field with earth footprint

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.650 
magnetic field with earth footprint
locations<00:06:24.990> looks<00:06:25.320> like<00:06:25.560> today<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:27.210> you<00:06:27.630> can

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
locations looks like today and you can

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.550 
locations looks like today and you can
see<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.050> red<00:06:28.410> lines<00:06:29.540> it's<00:06:30.540> all<00:06:30.810> mixed<00:06:31.139> in<00:06:31.410> with

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
see the red lines it's all mixed in with

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.890 
see the red lines it's all mixed in with
the<00:06:31.620> black<00:06:32.490> lines<00:06:32.880> and<00:06:33.330> it's<00:06:34.130> another<00:06:36.350> another

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
the black lines and it's another another

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.200 
the black lines and it's another another
version<00:06:39.900> of<00:06:40.350> how<00:06:40.590> complex<00:06:41.430> or<00:06:41.730> disorganized

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
version of how complex or disorganized

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.340 
version of how complex or disorganized
the<00:06:42.810> Sun<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.560> then<00:06:44.550> if<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:44.880> dis<00:06:45.120> is<00:06:45.350> 2010

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
the Sun is and then if you dis is 2010

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.290 
the Sun is and then if you dis is 2010
instead<00:06:46.740> of<00:06:46.860> 2009<00:06:47.610> but<00:06:48.540> you<00:06:48.900> look<00:06:49.110> how

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
instead of 2009 but you look how

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.420 
instead of 2009 but you look how
organized<00:06:51.300> this<00:06:51.600> is<00:06:51.870> in<00:06:52.080> comparison<00:06:52.710> and<00:06:52.919> this

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
organized this is in comparison and this

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.129 
organized this is in comparison and this
is<00:06:53.639> just<00:06:53.880> a<00:06:54.000> big<00:06:54.540> difference<00:06:55.260> and<00:06:56.960> so<00:06:57.960> again

00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 
is just a big difference and so again

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.460 
is just a big difference and so again
I'm<00:06:58.680> wondering<00:06:59.280> is<00:06:59.520> this<00:07:00.360> if<00:07:00.840> it's<00:07:01.139> anything

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
I'm wondering is this if it's anything

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.879 
I'm wondering is this if it's anything
like<00:07:01.680> the<00:07:01.889> Earth's<00:07:02.250> magnetic<00:07:03.030> field<00:07:03.240> is<00:07:03.960> this

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:04.889 
like the Earth's magnetic field is this

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.940 
like the Earth's magnetic field is this
an<00:07:05.220> indication<00:07:06.000> that<00:07:06.270> the<00:07:06.900> sun's<00:07:07.229> magnetic

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
an indication that the sun's magnetic

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.409 
an indication that the sun's magnetic
field<00:07:08.130> has<00:07:08.870> changed<00:07:09.870> drastically<00:07:10.290> and<00:07:11.419> could

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 
field has changed drastically and could

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.550 
field has changed drastically and could
be<00:07:12.570> contributing<00:07:13.050> to<00:07:14.010> how<00:07:14.160> quiet<00:07:14.639> the<00:07:15.000> Sun<00:07:15.240> is

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.750 
be contributing to how quiet the Sun is
compared<00:07:16.560> to<00:07:16.650> past<00:07:17.370> solar<00:07:18.000> maximums<00:07:18.860> so<00:07:19.860> there

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
compared to past solar maximums so there

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.830 
compared to past solar maximums so there
you<00:07:20.789> go<00:07:21.200> thank<00:07:22.200> you<00:07:22.440> for<00:07:22.620> watching<00:07:23.360> yet<00:07:24.360> at<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
you go thank you for watching yet at the

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.600 
you go thank you for watching yet at the
same<00:07:24.870> time<00:07:25.140> I<00:07:25.850> realized<00:07:26.850> that<00:07:27.210> in<00:07:28.160> 2009<00:07:29.160> it<00:07:29.400> was

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 
same time I realized that in 2009 it was

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.500 
same time I realized that in 2009 it was
the<00:07:29.820> solar<00:07:30.120> minimum<00:07:30.780> so<00:07:31.820> you<00:07:32.820> know<00:07:32.940> that<00:07:33.270> could

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
the solar minimum so you know that could

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.750 
the solar minimum so you know that could
be<00:07:33.750> that<00:07:34.100> could<00:07:35.100> be<00:07:35.430> a<00:07:35.570> reason<00:07:36.570> why<00:07:36.950> the<00:07:37.950> they

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
be that could be a reason why the they

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.409 
be that could be a reason why the they
look<00:07:39.000> so<00:07:39.030> different<00:07:40.039> my<00:07:41.039> what<00:07:41.789> I<00:07:41.820> really

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 
look so different my what I really

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:44.659 
look so different my what I really
really<00:07:42.900> would<00:07:43.020> like<00:07:43.229> to<00:07:43.289> do<00:07:43.620> is<00:07:43.800> be<00:07:44.100> able<00:07:44.130> to

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669 
really would like to do is be able to

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:51.020 
really would like to do is be able to
pull<00:07:45.060> this<00:07:45.090> back<00:07:45.479> up<00:07:45.840> in<00:07:48.380> 2002<00:07:49.380> compared<00:07:50.030> to

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030 
pull this back up in 2002 compared to

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.909 
pull this back up in 2002 compared to
solar<00:07:51.419> maximums<00:07:53.210> to<00:07:54.210> really<00:07:54.570> see<00:07:54.900> you<00:07:55.260> know

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 
solar maximums to really see you know

00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:00.250 
solar maximums to really see you know
what<00:07:56.419> you<00:07:57.419> know<00:07:57.539> how<00:07:57.720> they<00:07:58.050> would<00:07:58.440> look<00:07:58.740> but<00:07:59.460> um

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260 
what you know how they would look but um

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.409 
what you know how they would look but um
those<00:08:01.260> are<00:08:01.310> those<00:08:02.310> are<00:08:02.370> just<00:08:02.700> some<00:08:03.120> few

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:03.419 
those are those are just some few

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.200 
those are those are just some few
thoughts<00:08:03.720> I<00:08:04.020> had<00:08:04.310> thanks<00:08:05.310> for<00:08:05.460> watching<00:08:05.880> and
