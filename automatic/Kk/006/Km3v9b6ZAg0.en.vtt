00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.430 
what i also really like about this you
can<00:03:36.350> actually<00:03:36.769> go<00:03:36.980> to<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:38.209> end<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.840> line<00:03:39.049> or<00:03:39.410> a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
can actually go to the end of line or a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.099 
can actually go to the end of line or a
start-up<00:03:39.859> line<00:03:40.100> with<00:03:40.940> just<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.389> swipe<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:41.989> if

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
start-up line with just a swipe so if

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.890 
start-up line with just a swipe so if
you<00:03:42.230> space<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.799> pee<00:03:43.609> that's<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.480> end<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> line

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you space to pee that's the end of line

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.170 
you space to pee that's the end of line
and<00:03:45.139> space<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.650> cue<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.519> startup<00:03:46.880> line<00:03:47.000> is

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
and space to cue the startup line is

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.660 
and space to cue the startup line is
very<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.079> makes<00:03:48.230> sense<00:03:48.670> considering

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
very it just makes sense considering

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.030 
very it just makes sense considering
those<00:03:49.940> q<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.569> p<00:03:50.600> or<00:03:50.870> opposite<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.769> each<00:03:51.889> other

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
those q and p or opposite of each other

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.460 
those q and p or opposite of each other
just<00:03:52.340> like<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:52.970> what<00:03:53.480> about<00:03:53.599> characters

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
just like that so what about characters

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.620 
just like that so what about characters
now<00:03:54.620> that's<00:03:54.829> one<00:03:55.069> big<00:03:55.370> flaw<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.180> iphones

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
now that's one big flaw of the iphones

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.990 
now that's one big flaw of the iphones

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
of the character trying to get your

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.559 
of the character trying to get your
cursor<00:04:01.040> position<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:02.000> right<00:04:02.180> character

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569
