00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
about destroying the what is it is about

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
about destroying the what is it is about
creating<00:01:14.549> something<00:01:15.270> beyond<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.110> borders<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
current imagination right and those

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.859 
current imagination right and those
sept-iles<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.159> particular<00:01:20.520> involve<00:01:21.240> mercury

and<00:01:22.110> Mars<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.820> something<00:01:24.030> about<00:01:24.479> what<00:01:24.960> we

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and Mars so it's something about what we

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
and Mars so it's something about what we
think<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.009> say<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.790> actually
