comparison<00:00:03.480> review<00:00:04.080> between<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.710> new<00:00:04.950> fire

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
comparison review between the new fire

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.330 
comparison review between the new fire
HD<00:00:05.850> 6<00:00:06.120> here<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.569> left<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.340> kindle

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
HD 6 here on the left and the kindle

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.299 
HD 6 here on the left and the kindle
fire<00:00:08.580> HDX<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.929> 7<00:00:10.230> inch<00:00:10.320> version<00:00:10.559> so

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
fire HDX to the 7 inch version so

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.129 
fire HDX to the 7 inch version so
obviously<00:00:11.820> there's<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.330> huge<00:00:12.599> difference<00:00:12.809> in

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
obviously there's a huge difference in

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.220 
obviously there's a huge difference in
size<00:00:13.349> there's<00:00:13.920> also<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.280> 7-inch<00:00:15.030> fire<00:00:15.299> HD<00:00:15.929> that

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
size there's also a 7-inch fire HD that

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.930 
size there's also a 7-inch fire HD that
they<00:00:16.350> just<00:00:16.560> released<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.949> year<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
they just released this year it's a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.970 
they just released this year it's a
closer<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> size<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.830> very

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
closer to the size of this one it's very

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.900 
closer to the size of this one it's very
similar<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> doesn't<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.699> higher

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
similar it doesn't have the higher

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
similar it doesn't have the higher
resolution<00:00:21.449> screen<00:00:21.480> that<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> HDX<00:00:22.439> has

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
resolution screen that the HDX has

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.950 
resolution screen that the HDX has
anyway<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.029> confusing<00:00:24.480> but<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
anyway it's all kind of confusing but I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
anyway it's all kind of confusing but I
have<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> comparison<00:00:26.039> table<00:00:26.310> my<00:00:26.460> website<00:00:27.060> if

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have a comparison table my website if

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.250 
have a comparison table my website if
you<00:00:27.240> wanted<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> figure<00:00:27.779> out<00:00:27.960> all<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you wanted to figure out all the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.900 
you wanted to figure out all the
differences<00:00:28.590> between<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.429> wanted<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
differences between them but I wanted to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.580 
differences between them but I wanted to
just<00:00:30.000> show<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.480> video<00:00:30.720> basically<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> show

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
just show this video basically to show

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
just show this video basically to show
the<00:00:31.679> differences<00:00:32.070> between<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.610> smallest

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the differences between the smallest

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.889 
the differences between the smallest

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
Kindle Fire the fire HD 6 and you fire

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
Kindle Fire the fire HD 6 and you fire
the<00:00:37.140> 7-inch<00:00:37.559> fires<00:00:38.160> which<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> lot<00:00:38.640> more

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the 7-inch fires which are a lot more

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.630 
the 7-inch fires which are a lot more
common<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.210> mean<00:00:39.360> 7-inch<00:00:40.290> tablets<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:41.160> been<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
common I mean 7-inch tablets have been a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.580 
common I mean 7-inch tablets have been a
day<00:00:42.329> since<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.840> beginning<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.290> Android

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
day since the very beginning of Android

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
day since the very beginning of Android
tablets<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.579> interesting<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:45.270> finally

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
tablets so it's interesting to finally

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.700 
tablets so it's interesting to finally
see<00:00:45.660> somebody<00:00:45.960> come<00:00:46.050> out<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> 6<00:00:46.590> inch

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
see somebody come out with a 6 inch

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.990 
see somebody come out with a 6 inch
version<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> lot

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
version as you can see it's a lot

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.810 
version as you can see it's a lot
smaller<00:00:48.440> overall<00:00:49.440> we've<00:00:49.739> got<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.370> at

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
smaller overall we've got like it's at

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
smaller overall we've got like it's at
least<00:00:50.969> an<00:00:51.180> inch<00:00:51.390> shorter<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.199> an<00:00:52.559> inch<00:00:52.710> wider

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
least an inch shorter and an inch wider

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
least an inch shorter and an inch wider
or<00:00:53.280> narrower<00:00:53.690> probably<00:00:54.690> more<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.899> an<00:00:54.989> inch

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
or narrower probably more like an inch

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.350 
or narrower probably more like an inch
and<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> quarter<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.590> narrow<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.160> least

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and a quarter of narrow or at least

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.139 
and a quarter of narrow or at least
their<00:00:57.360> thickness<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.550> very<00:00:59.550> different<00:00:59.969> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
their thickness is very different just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
their thickness is very different just
because<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> HDX<00:01:01.289> has<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.559> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
because like the HDX has a really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.319 
because like the HDX has a really
tapered<00:01:02.250> edge<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:02.879> has<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
tapered edge and this one has more of a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.830 
tapered edge and this one has more of a
thick<00:01:03.539> edge<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:06.030> thickness

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
thick edge so i think that the thickness

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.240 
thick edge so i think that the thickness
is<00:01:06.930> about<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> same<00:01:07.409> overall<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.040> feels<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
is about the same overall but it feels a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
is about the same overall but it feels a
lot<00:01:08.369> thinner<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> HDX<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.560> of

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
lot thinner on the HDX just because of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
lot thinner on the HDX just because of
the<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.130> edges<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:11.670> beveled<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:13.049> far

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the way the edges are beveled so as far

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
the way the edges are beveled so as far
as<00:01:13.380> software<00:01:14.310> goes<00:01:14.490> i'm<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.299> entirely<00:01:15.570> sure

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
as software goes i'm not entirely sure

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
as software goes i'm not entirely sure
if<00:01:15.930> Amazon's<00:01:16.470> updating<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.390> operating

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
if Amazon's updating the operating

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.270 
if Amazon's updating the operating
system<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> HDX<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> mean<00:01:19.920> since

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
system on the HDX or not I mean since

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.620 
system on the HDX or not I mean since
they're<00:01:20.460> still<00:01:20.640> offering<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.270> would<00:01:21.390> assume

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
they're still offering it I would assume

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.590 
they're still offering it I would assume
that<00:01:21.689> they<00:01:21.930> would<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.820> fire

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that they would but right now the fire

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.429 
that they would but right now the fire
HDX<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.560> has<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.119> fire<00:01:27.119> OS<00:01:27.570> 3-pointer<00:01:28.080> running

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
HDX it has a fire OS 3-pointer running

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.870 
HDX it has a fire OS 3-pointer running
on<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.009> right<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> right<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
on I'm here right here on the right and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.690 
on I'm here right here on the right and
the<00:01:30.600> new<00:01:30.780> fire<00:01:31.229> HD<00:01:31.650> s<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.860> fire<00:01:32.100> OS<00:01:32.430> four

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the new fire HD s have fire OS four

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
the new fire HD s have fire OS four
point<00:01:32.939> oh<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:34.040> thought<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> funny

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
point oh I thought it was kind of funny

four-point-oh amazon says like an
entirely<00:01:39.119> visual<00:01:39.900> upgrade<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.890> can

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
entirely visual upgrade but as you can

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
entirely visual upgrade but as you can
tell<00:01:41.070> i<00:01:41.250> mean<00:01:41.549> they<00:01:41.850> look<00:01:42.090> identical

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
tell i mean they look identical

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
tell i mean they look identical
virtually<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> mean<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:44.100> OS<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.549> pretty<00:01:44.970> much

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
virtually I mean the OS is pretty much

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
virtually I mean the OS is pretty much
identical<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.659> only<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:45.960> that's<00:01:46.140> really

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
identical the only thing that's really

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
identical the only thing that's really
changed<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> icon<00:01:48.450> see<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> silk

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
changed is like the icon see you silk

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
changed is like the icon see you silk
icon<00:01:49.320> browser<00:01:49.590> right<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.520> left

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
icon browser right there on the left

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.789 
icon browser right there on the left
it's<00:01:51.060> totally<00:01:51.390> different<00:01:51.479> than<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.869> old<00:01:52.020> icon

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
it's totally different than the old icon

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.859 
it's totally different than the old icon
so<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> icons<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.610> new<00:01:53.759> there's<00:01:54.360> some<00:01:54.540> also

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so the icons are new there's some also

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
so the icons are new there's some also
some<00:01:55.079> different<00:01:55.439> additional<00:01:56.250> things<00:01:56.430> like

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
some different additional things like

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.480 
some different additional things like
smart<00:01:57.000> suspend<00:01:57.450> which<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.500> new<00:01:59.040> feature<00:01:59.250> on

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
smart suspend which is a new feature on

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.359 
smart suspend which is a new feature on
the<00:01:59.610> HDS<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.979> supposedly<00:02:01.979> help<00:02:02.250> with

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the HDS that supposedly help with

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.370 
the HDS that supposedly help with
battery<00:02:02.700> life<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.960> far<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> goes

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
battery life so as far as that goes

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660 
battery life so as far as that goes
let's<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:04.950> ahead<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.219> talk<00:02:05.340> some<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.610> about

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
let's go ahead and talk some more about

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
let's go ahead and talk some more about
the<00:02:05.969> features<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.509> these<00:02:06.630> two<00:02:06.780> devices<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the features with these two devices so

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.619 
the features with these two devices so
the<00:02:07.979> 6<00:02:08.429> inch<00:02:08.580> version<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> high

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
the 6 inch version here has a high

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.600 
the 6 inch version here has a high
resolution<00:02:09.840> screen<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.440> 1280<00:02:10.830> by<00:02:10.979> 800<00:02:11.190> 4<00:02:11.520> on

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
resolution screen is 1280 by 800 4 on

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
resolution screen is 1280 by 800 4 on
the<00:02:11.640> 6<00:02:11.940> inch<00:02:12.060> screen<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.450> works<00:02:12.599> out<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> 250

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
the 6 inch screen that works out to 250

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.120 
the 6 inch screen that works out to 250
dots<00:02:14.370> per<00:02:14.610> inch<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.690> 7<00:02:16.440> inch<00:02:16.560> version<00:02:16.830> here

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
dots per inch on the 7 inch version here

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.160 
dots per inch on the 7 inch version here
it's<00:02:17.280> got<00:02:17.400> if<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:18.120> is<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.300> HDX<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.020> got

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's got if this is the HDX so it's got

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.750 
it's got if this is the HDX so it's got
over<00:02:20.480> 300<00:02:21.480> i<00:02:21.780> think<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.020> 323<00:02:22.470> pixels<00:02:23.160> frames<00:02:23.610> so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
over 300 i think is 323 pixels frames so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.190 
over 300 i think is 323 pixels frames so
you<00:02:23.820> got<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.030> high<00:02:24.240> resolution<00:02:24.450> screen<00:02:24.870> on

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
you got the high resolution screen on

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.770 
you got the high resolution screen on
the<00:02:25.290> HDX<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.250> 7<00:02:26.610> inch<00:02:26.700> version<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> HD<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the HDX the 7 inch version of the HD it

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.060 
the HDX the 7 inch version of the HD it
has<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> low<00:02:28.170> resolution<00:02:28.650> screen<00:02:28.860> has<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
has the low resolution screen has the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.530 
has the low resolution screen has the
same<00:02:29.220> resolution<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.820> smaller<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
same resolution is a smaller one so it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.270 
same resolution is a smaller one so it
actually<00:02:30.780> loses<00:02:31.320> clarity<00:02:31.710> once<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
actually loses clarity once you get the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.670 
actually loses clarity once you get the
bigger<00:02:32.460> screen<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.000> as<00:02:33.600> far<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:33.900> comparing

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
bigger screen but as far as comparing

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.830 
bigger screen but as far as comparing
these<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:34.860> screens<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.670> this<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> same

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
these two screens go this is the same

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.290 
these two screens go this is the same
book<00:02:37.110> with<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.560> same<00:02:37.800> roughly<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.820> same<00:02:39.000> font

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
book with the same roughly the same font

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.400 
book with the same roughly the same font
sizes<00:02:39.510> they<00:02:39.750> scale<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> little<00:02:40.320> bit

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
sizes they scale a little bit

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.720 
sizes they scale a little bit
differently<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:40.980> actually<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.520> size

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
differently so it's actually one size

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.130 
differently so it's actually one size
bigger<00:02:41.760> on<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.360> on<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> left<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.840> they<00:02:42.960> look

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
bigger on here on the left but they look

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
bigger on here on the left but they look
actually<00:02:43.410> about<00:02:43.890> exactly<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.460> same<00:02:44.610> size<00:02:44.790> but

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
actually about exactly the same size but

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.960 
actually about exactly the same size but
as<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:45.990> can<00:02:46.080> see<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.650> cuts<00:02:46.830> off<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.700> here

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
as you can see so it cuts off right here

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.180 
as you can see so it cuts off right here
at<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> word<00:02:48.270> taking<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.470> that's<00:02:49.920> right

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
at the word taking so like that's right

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.050 
at the word taking so like that's right
here<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:51.210> you're<00:02:51.330> getting<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.720> much<00:02:51.990> extra

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
here so you're getting that much extra

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.700 
here so you're getting that much extra
screen<00:02:54.060> like<00:02:54.540> reading<00:02:54.870> real<00:02:55.050> estate<00:02:55.380> with<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
screen like reading real estate with the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.550 
screen like reading real estate with the
larger<00:02:56.370> 7-inch<00:02:56.820> screen<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:58.410> really

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
larger 7-inch screen so that's really

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380 
larger 7-inch screen so that's really
only<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.890> couple<00:02:59.070> of<00:02:59.280> sentences<00:02:59.670> like<00:03:00.090> three

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
only a couple of sentences like three

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.960 
only a couple of sentences like three
lines<00:03:00.690> basically<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:02.160> definitely<00:03:02.520> works

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
lines basically but it definitely works

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.610 
lines basically but it definitely works
out<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.390> lot<00:03:03.510> overall<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.140> once<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.500> have

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
out to a lot overall but once you have

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.200 
out to a lot overall but once you have
the<00:03:04.770> smaller<00:03:05.040> device<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.580> really<00:03:05.850> like<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
the smaller device I really like the

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.080 
the smaller device I really like the
fire<00:03:06.450> HDX<00:03:06.900> form<00:03:07.410> factor<00:03:07.800> or<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.220> fire<00:03:08.520> HD

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
fire HDX form factor or the fire HD

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.550

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
software on the HD I'm not sure that I

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.690 
software on the HD I'm not sure that I
said<00:03:28.440> if<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.650> HDX<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.070> getting<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.340> software

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
said if the HDX is getting the software

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.670 
said if the HDX is getting the software
or<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.180> as<00:03:30.690> far<00:03:30.840> as<00:03:30.900> features<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.410> you're

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
or not but as far as features go you're

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.870 
or not but as far as features go you're
getting<00:03:31.920> same<00:03:32.100> exacting<00:03:32.459> seems<00:03:32.730> that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
getting same exacting seems that

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.490 
getting same exacting seems that
carousel<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> different<00:03:34.200> hardware

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
carousel you got the different hardware

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.530 
carousel you got the different hardware
differences<00:03:34.709> with<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.160> HDX<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.240> does<00:03:36.360> have

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
differences with the HDX it does have

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.010 
differences with the HDX it does have
two<00:03:36.780> speakers<00:03:37.050> whereas<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.510> HD<00:03:39.510> here<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
two speakers whereas the HD here on the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.330 
two speakers whereas the HD here on the
left<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.380> only<00:03:40.500> has<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.830> speaker<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
left it only has one speaker and the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.460 
left it only has one speaker and the
speaker<00:03:41.400> definitely<00:03:42.150> sounds<00:03:42.390> better<00:03:42.570> on<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
speaker definitely sounds better on the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
speaker definitely sounds better on the
HDX<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.190> don't<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.370> how<00:03:44.490> well<00:03:44.640> it's<00:03:44.760> going<00:03:44.880> to

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
HDX I don't know how well it's going to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.270 
HDX I don't know how well it's going to
translate<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.380> camera<00:03:46.830> here<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.160> let<00:03:47.250> me

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
translate on the camera here but let me

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.590 
translate on the camera here but let me
go<00:03:47.400> ahead<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.550> give<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.820> quick<00:03:48.090> sound<00:03:48.390> test

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
go ahead and give you a quick sound test

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:57.890 
go ahead and give you a quick sound test
here<00:03:48.810> with<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.959> volume<00:03:49.110> up<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.470> both<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.709> them

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.509 

so<00:03:58.530> yeah<00:03:58.650> it's<00:03:58.799> definitely<00:03:58.980> quite<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> bit

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
so yeah it's definitely quite a bit

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.580 
so yeah it's definitely quite a bit
quieter<00:03:59.879> on<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.060> HD<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> one

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
quieter on the HD just with that one

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.890 
quieter on the HD just with that one
speaker<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.610> 7<00:04:02.909> inch<00:04:03.030> version<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.420> HD<00:04:03.750> has

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
speaker the 7 inch version the HD has

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.929 
speaker the 7 inch version the HD has
two<00:04:04.079> speakers<00:04:04.409> I<00:04:04.620> noticed<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.129> spec<00:04:05.909> sheet

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
two speakers I noticed on the spec sheet

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.190 
two speakers I noticed on the spec sheet
otherwise<00:04:06.450> i<00:04:06.510> think<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.840> pretty<00:04:06.930> much<00:04:07.079> exactly

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
otherwise i think is pretty much exactly

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.830 
otherwise i think is pretty much exactly
the<00:04:07.650> same<00:04:07.829> these<00:04:08.040> all<00:04:08.310> both<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.239> bluetooth

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
the same these all both have bluetooth

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.470 
the same these all both have bluetooth
and<00:04:10.430> obviously<00:04:11.430> like<00:04:11.610> I<00:04:11.640> said<00:04:11.939> you<00:04:12.060> got<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> few

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
and obviously like I said you got a few

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.660 
and obviously like I said you got a few
hardware<00:04:13.230> upgrades<00:04:13.620> with<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.920> HDX<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.609> the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
hardware upgrades with the HDX with the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.069 
hardware upgrades with the HDX with the
high<00:04:14.760> resolution<00:04:14.970> screen<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.930> the

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
high resolution screen and the

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.990 
high resolution screen and the
additional<00:04:16.859> speakers<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.579> it's<00:04:17.699> also<00:04:17.820> got

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
additional speakers and it's also got

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.460 
additional speakers and it's also got
dual<00:04:18.239> band<00:04:18.479> Wi-Fi<00:04:18.720> where<00:04:19.019> this<00:04:19.079> one<00:04:19.199> a<00:04:19.289> single

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
dual band Wi-Fi where this one a single

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.080 
dual band Wi-Fi where this one a single
band<00:04:19.769> Wi-Fi<00:04:19.949> another<00:04:20.669> thing<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:20.880> i<00:04:21.060> noticed

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
band Wi-Fi another thing that i noticed

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.689 
band Wi-Fi another thing that i noticed
this<00:04:21.449> difference<00:04:21.870> between<00:04:22.169> these<00:04:22.289> two<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
this difference between these two is the

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.770 
this difference between these two is the
touchscreen<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:26.150> that's<00:04:27.150> one<00:04:27.330> thing<00:04:27.479> they<00:04:27.630> did

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
touchscreen so that's one thing they did

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.080 
touchscreen so that's one thing they did
to<00:04:27.870> save<00:04:28.050> money<00:04:28.229> on<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.620> hd2<00:04:28.830> get<00:04:29.370> down<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.669> 99

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
to save money on the hd2 get down to 99

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.640 
to save money on the hd2 get down to 99
bucks<00:04:30.389> because<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.720> HDX<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.199> twice<00:04:31.380> as<00:04:31.410> much

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
bucks because the HDX is twice as much

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.250 
bucks because the HDX is twice as much
as<00:04:31.770> 199<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:33.270> one<00:04:33.449> only<00:04:33.600> has<00:04:33.780> a<00:04:33.810> two-point

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
as 199 is this one only has a two-point

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.779 
as 199 is this one only has a two-point
touch<00:04:34.530> screen<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.070> you<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.310> only<00:04:35.520> activate

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
touch screen so you can only activate

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.640 
touch screen so you can only activate
two<00:04:36.090> points<00:04:36.389> on<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.510> screen<00:04:36.720> at<00:04:36.810> once<00:04:36.990> where

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
two points on the screen at once where

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.100 
two points on the screen at once where
the<00:04:37.889> kindle<00:04:38.250> fire<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:39.210> HDX<00:04:39.780> that's<00:04:39.990> got

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
the kindle fire if the HDX that's got

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.689 
the kindle fire if the HDX that's got
10-point<00:04:40.620> capacitive<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.280> obviously<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.639> got

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
10-point capacitive so obviously you got

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.870 
10-point capacitive so obviously you got
a<00:04:41.760> lot<00:04:42.030> more<00:04:43.220> points<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.310> touch<00:04:44.460> on<00:04:44.639> screen<00:04:44.850> I

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
a lot more points of touch on screen I

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.670 
a lot more points of touch on screen I
don't<00:04:45.030> really<00:04:45.120> know<00:04:45.300> how<00:04:45.449> useful<00:04:46.199> that<00:04:46.380> is

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
don't really know how useful that is

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.080 
don't really know how useful that is
basically<00:04:46.949> only<00:04:47.160> use<00:04:47.370> two<00:04:47.550> most<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.940> time

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
basically only use two most the time

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.400 
basically only use two most the time
unless<00:04:48.270> you're<00:04:48.479> using<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.870> piano<00:04:49.110> app

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
unless you're using like a piano app

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.320 
unless you're using like a piano app
like<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.800> but<00:04:50.010> so<00:04:50.849> as<00:04:50.910> far<00:04:50.970> as<00:04:51.120> that<00:04:51.270> goes

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
like this but so as far as that goes

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.029 
like this but so as far as that goes
they're<00:04:51.660> basically<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.990> same<00:04:52.050> one<00:04:52.770> thing

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
they're basically the same one thing

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.110 
they're basically the same one thing
you'll<00:04:53.160> notice<00:04:53.310> here<00:04:53.550> is<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.000> new

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
you'll notice here is with the new

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.089 
you'll notice here is with the new
operating<00:04:54.599> system<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:55.139> automatically<00:04:55.680> opens

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
operating system and automatically opens

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.120 
operating system and automatically opens
apps<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.520> full<00:04:56.729> screen<00:04:56.910> which<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.180> nice<00:04:57.539> so

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
apps in full screen which is nice so

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.650 
apps in full screen which is nice so
with<00:04:59.130> these<00:04:59.250> old<00:04:59.490> operating<00:05:00.180> system<00:05:00.599> it

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
with these old operating system it

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.300 
with these old operating system it
always<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.870> put<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.139> annoying<00:05:01.500> ugly<00:05:01.830> tab<00:05:02.070> on

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
always to put this annoying ugly tab on

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.850 
always to put this annoying ugly tab on
everything<00:05:02.849> that<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:03.900> had<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.110> slide<00:05:04.380> up<00:05:04.590> it's

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
everything that you had to slide up it's

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.170 
everything that you had to slide up it's
like<00:05:04.949> totally<00:05:05.250> obviously<00:05:05.699> have<00:05:05.789> to<00:05:05.849> slide<00:05:06.060> up

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
like totally obviously have to slide up

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.219 
like totally obviously have to slide up
so<00:05:06.330> I<00:05:06.360> don't<00:05:06.479> know<00:05:06.539> where<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.720> tab<00:05:06.900> had<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.139> be

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
so I don't know where the tab had to be

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.900 
so I don't know where the tab had to be
there<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.590> on<00:05:07.830> these<00:05:08.310> newer<00:05:08.520> ones<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:08.849> just

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
there so on these newer ones you just

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.310 
there so on these newer ones you just
have<00:05:09.150> to<00:05:09.240> slide<00:05:09.479> up<00:05:09.630> they<00:05:09.840> got<00:05:09.990> rid<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.169> that

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
have to slide up they got rid of that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.770 
have to slide up they got rid of that
tab<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.949> definitely<00:05:11.130> looks<00:05:11.520> better<00:05:11.610> far<00:05:12.570> as

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
tab so it definitely looks better far as

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.149 
tab so it definitely looks better far as
the<00:05:12.960> visual<00:05:13.260> aspects<00:05:13.620> go<00:05:13.800> when<00:05:13.919> you're<00:05:13.979> in

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
the visual aspects go when you're in

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.909 
the visual aspects go when you're in
apps<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:15.389> silk<00:05:15.960> browser<00:05:16.139> was<00:05:16.409> apparently

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
apps so silk browser was apparently

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.710 
apps so silk browser was apparently
improved<00:05:17.280> with<00:05:17.490> the<00:05:17.699> OS<00:05:18.180> four<00:05:18.419> point<00:05:18.630> oh<00:05:18.690> I

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
improved with the OS four point oh I

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.360 
improved with the OS four point oh I
really<00:05:19.020> don't<00:05:19.050> notice<00:05:19.349> any<00:05:19.620> differences<00:05:20.220> to

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
really don't notice any differences to

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.379 
really don't notice any differences to
be<00:05:20.460> honest<00:05:20.729> with<00:05:20.820> you<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.000> don't<00:05:21.090> know<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.300> they

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
be honest with you I don't know if they

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.210 
be honest with you I don't know if they
haven't<00:05:21.510> implemented<00:05:21.960> them<00:05:22.169> yet<00:05:22.349> instead

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
haven't implemented them yet instead

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.980 
haven't implemented them yet instead
that<00:05:23.400> it<00:05:23.520> had<00:05:23.669> private<00:05:24.240> browsing<00:05:24.510> and<00:05:24.840> stuff

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
that it had private browsing and stuff

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.570 
that it had private browsing and stuff

but I don't see that option anywhere I

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.129 
but I don't see that option anywhere I

the<00:05:31.229> old<00:05:31.409> HDX<00:05:32.099> you<00:05:32.280> didn't<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.760> print

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
the old HDX you didn't have that print

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.029 
the old HDX you didn't have that print
page<00:05:33.180> option<00:05:33.599> which<00:05:33.720> was<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:33.930> new<00:05:34.110> feature<00:05:34.320> you

full<00:05:36.960> screen<00:05:37.199> mode<00:05:37.320> works<00:05:37.530> really<00:05:37.680> well<00:05:37.770> on

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
full screen mode works really well on

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.029 
full screen mode works really well on
the<00:05:39.260> smaller<00:05:40.260> screen<00:05:40.560> there<00:05:40.710> because<00:05:40.860> you<00:05:40.919> get

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
the smaller screen there because you get

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.520 
the smaller screen there because you get
rid<00:05:41.159> of<00:05:41.220> all<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.930> bars<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.139> everything<00:05:43.409> it

rid of all the bars and everything it
looks<00:05:43.560> a<00:05:43.740> lot<00:05:43.830> better<00:05:44.010> with<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.460> full<00:05:44.820> screen

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
looks a lot better with the full screen

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.430 
looks a lot better with the full screen
so<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.449> got<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.659> full<00:05:45.870> screen<00:05:46.080> on<00:05:46.169> this<00:05:46.289> one

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.779 
so you got the full screen on this one
too<00:05:46.530> it<00:05:46.650> just<00:05:46.830> doesn't<00:05:47.070> require<00:05:47.280> going<00:05:47.490> into

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
too it just doesn't require going into

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:48.920

I'd always annoy me so I'm glad they got
rid<00:05:53.789> of<00:05:53.849> that<00:05:53.940> it's<00:05:54.510> just<00:05:54.630> totally<00:05:54.930> obvious

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
rid of that it's just totally obvious

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.140 
rid of that it's just totally obvious
that<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.440> swipe<00:05:55.680> up<00:05:55.919> and<00:05:56.099> you<00:05:56.669> get<00:05:56.789> back<00:05:57.000> to

your<00:05:57.240> menu<00:05:57.419> anyway<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:57.840> I<00:05:58.260> don't<00:05:58.860> know<00:05:58.919> why

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
your menu anyway so I don't know why

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.560 
your menu anyway so I don't know why
that<00:05:59.039> tab<00:05:59.370> needed<00:05:59.669> to<00:05:59.760> be<00:05:59.909> there<00:06:00.090> so<00:06:00.270> otherwise

like<00:06:03.750> I<00:06:03.870> said<00:06:03.930> these<00:06:04.169> two<00:06:04.320> devices<00:06:04.500> very

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
like I said these two devices very

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:06.440 
like I said these two devices very
similar<00:06:05.280> obviously<00:06:06.090> it's<00:06:06.210> just<00:06:06.330> some

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
similar obviously it's just some

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.969 
similar obviously it's just some
hardware<00:06:06.719> differences<00:06:06.960> between<00:06:07.380> them<00:06:07.770> that

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
hardware differences between them that

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.769 
hardware differences between them that
separate<00:06:08.550> them<00:06:08.729> so<00:06:08.760> I'm<00:06:09.360> gonna<00:06:09.510> go<00:06:09.599> ahead<00:06:09.630> and

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
separate them so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:10.940 
separate them so I'm gonna go ahead and

differences between these two obviously
the<00:06:14.650> size<00:06:14.890> is<00:06:15.250> the<00:06:15.820> biggest<00:06:16.150> difference<00:06:16.330> and

new fire HD s they have a rear camera
none<00:06:25.540> of<00:06:25.570> the<00:06:25.750> other<00:06:26.170> fire<00:06:26.740> tablets<00:06:27.100> used<00:06:27.250> to

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
none of the other fire tablets used to

none of the other fire tablets used to
have<00:06:27.430> rear<00:06:27.580> cameras<00:06:27.880> so<00:06:28.030> even<00:06:28.390> though<00:06:28.510> this
