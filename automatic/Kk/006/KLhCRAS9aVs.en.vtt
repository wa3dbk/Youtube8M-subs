00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
lane splitting in California only 7% of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.469 
lane splitting in California only 7% of
the<00:01:44.740> motorcycle<00:01:45.340> riders<00:01:45.640> of<00:01:45.759> California

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
completed this survey I just thought I'd

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.520 
completed this survey I just thought I'd
let<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:48.789> know<00:01:49.030> so<00:01:49.240> it<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.509> small<00:01:49.990> sample

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
let you know so it is a small sample

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.399 
let you know so it is a small sample
size<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.709> that<00:01:54.250> 7%<00:01:55.119> they<00:01:55.720> completed<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
size but of that 7% they completed the

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.449 
size but of that 7% they completed the
survey<00:01:58.080> 12%<00:01:59.080> or<00:01:59.259> should<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.530> say<00:01:59.679> eleven<00:02:00.159> point

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
survey 12% or should I say eleven point

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.060 
survey 12% or should I say eleven point
seven<00:02:00.819> percent<00:02:01.179> so<00:02:01.630> well<00:02:01.810> round<00:02:02.080> up<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.440> 12%

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.760

they either hit a car our car hit them
while<00:02:10.619> lane<00:02:10.979> splitting<00:02:11.520> that's<00:02:12.090> one-eighth

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
while lane splitting that's one-eighth

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.350 
while lane splitting that's one-eighth
of<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.740> small<00:02:14.100> sample<00:02:14.610> size

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
of that small sample size

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.740 
of that small sample size
okay<00:02:17.080> not<00:02:17.350> only<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:19.710> 47%<00:02:20.710> of<00:02:20.860> those<00:02:21.100> writers
