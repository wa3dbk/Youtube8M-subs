water and corn syrup I'll write heat to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.030 
water and corn syrup I'll write heat to
medium<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:02.080> bring<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.530> boil

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
medium then bring to a boil

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.820 
medium then bring to a boil
now<00:02:03.910> once<00:02:04.480> it's<00:02:04.630> at<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.810> boil<00:02:05.110> we<00:02:05.410> want<00:02:05.620> to<00:02:05.710> make

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
now once it's at a boil we want to make

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.110 
now once it's at a boil we want to make
sure<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.250> there<00:02:06.400> aren't<00:02:06.550> any<00:02:06.790> sugar

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
sure that there aren't any sugar

since this can cause something called
crystallization<00:02:11.890> which<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:12.850> make<00:02:12.970> your

crystallization which can make your

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.090 
crystallization which can make your
caramels<00:02:13.660> grainy<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.320> really<00:02:14.740> ruin<00:02:15.070> the

sugar until it reaches 320 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:28.920> at<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.340> temperature<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:31.210> sugar

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
Fahrenheit at this temperature the sugar

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.500 
Fahrenheit at this temperature the sugar
will<00:02:31.660> take<00:02:31.870> on<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.260> light<00:02:32.590> amber<00:02:33.220> color<00:02:33.510> now

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
will take on a light amber color now

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.060 
will take on a light amber color now
we're<00:02:34.720> ready<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.990> add<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.320> butter<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:35.980> cream

mixture from before add it in small

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.390 
mixture from before add it in small
batches<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:39.970> use<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.750> candy<00:02:41.140> thermometer

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
batches then use the candy thermometer

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.270

to<00:02:42.400> stir<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.820> into<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.360> sugar<00:02:43.570> mixture<00:02:43.990> as<00:02:44.410> you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
to stir it into the sugar mixture as you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.880

do<00:02:45.490> this<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.780> caramel<00:02:47.320> will<00:02:47.650> bubble

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
do this the caramel will bubble

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.460 
do this the caramel will bubble
violently<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.810> want<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.290> this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
slowly and carefully so nothing buckles

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.220 
slowly and carefully so nothing buckles
over<00:02:54.239> now<00:02:55.239> place<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.750> candy<00:02:56.080> thermometer

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
over now place the candy thermometer

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.040 
over now place the candy thermometer
back<00:02:56.830> on<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.280> side<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> pan<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.330> cook<00:02:58.989> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.610 
caramel until 240 degrees Fahrenheit
this<00:03:02.890> will<00:03:03.160> create<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.550> soft<00:03:04.000> caramel<00:03:04.600> if<00:03:04.989> you
