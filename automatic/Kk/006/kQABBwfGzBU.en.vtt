go with around a 34 degree included

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.089 
go with around a 34 degree included
angle<00:01:54.880> it's<00:01:55.149> about<00:01:55.360> 17<00:01:55.959> degrees<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.590> each<00:01:56.770> side

angle it's about 17 degrees on each side
of<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.310> edge<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.390> angle<00:01:58.660> is<00:01:58.929> 10<00:01:59.289> to<00:01:59.440> 20

00:01:59.729 --> 00:01:59.739 
of the edge so this angle is 10 to 20

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.859

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.600 
grind a larger included angle will stand
up<00:02:04.959> to<00:02:04.989> more<00:02:05.229> hard<00:02:05.649> use<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.429> more

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
difficult to hone to razor-sharp edge so

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.040
