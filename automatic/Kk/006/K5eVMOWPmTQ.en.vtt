 hello to everyone during this video he 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.270
 there will be no intronizes video of the 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.680
 new aquatic symphony that is 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
 become a magnificent show all 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.860
 simply because of copyrights 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.969
 youtube thank you 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.470
 this being said let's now move on to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.140
 2015 novelties of the parc du bocage 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.090
 let's start with our big novelty of 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.310
 this year 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.500
 this clafoutis it is composed of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.609
 big world and thanks a lot of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.380
 small aquatic mini games so the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.360
 real action is carried out by whitewater 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.210
 to the big builders of attraction to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.070
 little Canadian she replaces the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.470
 pool and water slides to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.770
 the input of this type and so we notice 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:51.000
 as decors and effects by abc decor 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.030
 I think it's actually by them and at 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.710
 the back of the pull there is a small 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.050
 amp in the photo point that was realized 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.860
 only the entrance to the pool is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.250
 still present 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:12.690
 I imagine she will go to the level of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.330
 colorado a lower part of sludge 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.060
 and so the floating part has been changed 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.100
 we can also notice that he had 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.190
 three new cases that were 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.270
 built to streamline the tent 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.100
 the park entrance and new 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 buzy characters were installed in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.720
 the ranch where the whole party on the left 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.430
 is doomed it feels a very close 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.780
 very close to the attraction what he 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 will really do a lot of good at the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 map a heath we can also notice 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.320
