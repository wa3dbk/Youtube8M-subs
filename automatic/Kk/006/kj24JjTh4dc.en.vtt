are<00:00:43.220> awesome

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
are awesome

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.549 
are awesome
so<00:00:43.879> we<00:00:44.150> took<00:00:44.300> that<00:00:44.480> concept<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.110> created<00:00:45.530> a

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 
so we took that concept and created a

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.070 
so we took that concept and created a
board<00:00:45.680> game<00:00:46.089> we've<00:00:47.089> created<00:00:47.329> a<00:00:47.600> database<00:00:47.930> that

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
board game we've created a database that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.649 
board game we've created a database that
maps<00:00:48.559> out<00:00:48.739> 600<00:00:49.699> internet<00:00:50.150> searches<00:00:50.510> across

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
maps out 600 internet searches across

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:52.299 
maps out 600 internet searches across
