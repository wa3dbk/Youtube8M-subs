episode so first things first with this

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.880 
episode so first things first with this
base<00:00:18.210> as<00:00:18.420> usual<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.050> like<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> take<00:00:19.529> care<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
base as usual I like to take care of the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890 
base as usual I like to take care of the
rocket<00:00:20.189> launcher<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.570> some

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
rocket launcher in the back but for some

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
rocket launcher in the back but for some
reason<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.590> probably<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.070> least

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
reason that was probably like the least

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
reason that was probably like the least
accurate<00:00:23.730> barrage<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.720> time<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.410> as<00:00:25.529> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
accurate barrage of all time so as I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
accurate barrage of all time so as I
dropped<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:25.949> artillery<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.880> still<00:00:27.449> has<00:00:27.630> like

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
dropped that artillery it still has like

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
dropped that artillery it still has like
10<00:00:28.109> health<00:00:28.349> left<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.130> drop<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
10 health left and I have to drop a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
10 health left and I have to drop a
second<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.269> total<00:00:30.660> waste<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
second one which is a total waste of

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.170 
second one which is a total waste of
energy<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> was<00:00:32.219> sort<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> annoying<00:00:32.730> I'm

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
energy so that was sort of annoying I'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700 
energy so that was sort of annoying I'm
gonna<00:00:33.360> drop<00:00:33.510> my<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.020> barrage<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
gonna drop my second barrage on that

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.870

perfect<00:00:57.449> shock<00:00:57.629> bombs<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.050> actually<00:00:58.230> did

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
perfect shock bombs I actually did

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
perfect shock bombs I actually did
really<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.100> those<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> shot<00:00:59.730> three

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
really well with those and I shot three

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
really well with those and I shot three
buildings<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> time<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.500> didn't<00:01:01.920> really

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
buildings at a time and I didn't really

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.439 
buildings at a time and I didn't really
have<00:01:02.190> too<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.460> room<00:01:02.730> for<00:01:02.760> error<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have too much room for error there so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
have too much room for error there so
that<00:01:03.570> worked<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.080> well<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.769> can

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that worked out really well and you can

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.310 
that worked out really well and you can
sort<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.549> troops<00:01:05.880> split<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.020> at

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
sort of see my troops split up and at

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.510 
sort of see my troops split up and at
this<00:01:07.439> point<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.770> don't<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
this point I don't really know where I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.969 
this point I don't really know where I
want<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> drop<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> flare<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

feel<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:13.920> my<00:01:14.159> heavies<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.880> my

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
feel like my heavies would have or my

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
feel like my heavies would have or my
zookas<00:01:15.540> would<00:01:15.689> have<00:01:15.780> gotten<00:01:15.930> shot<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
zookas would have gotten shot down so
I'm<00:01:16.799> sort<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.250> letting<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.670> attack

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
I'm sort of just letting this attack

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.910 
I'm sort of just letting this attack
play<00:01:18.210> its<00:01:18.360> course<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> my<00:01:19.229> troops<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> top

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
play its course and my troops on the top

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
play its course and my troops on the top
right<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.340> attacking<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> HQ<00:01:21.270> where<00:01:21.420> my

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
right are attacking the HQ where my

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
right are attacking the HQ where my
troops<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> left<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.470> distracting<00:01:23.009> these

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
troops on the left are distracting these

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.980 
troops on the left are distracting these
defences<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> then<00:01:24.330> after<00:01:24.570> dropping<00:01:24.810> these

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
defences and then after dropping these

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
defences and then after dropping these
heal<00:01:25.259> spells<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.740> buy<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.340> little<00:01:26.790> bit

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
heal spells to buy it just a little bit

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
heal spells to buy it just a little bit
of<00:01:27.030> time<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.720> troops<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> top<00:01:28.350> right<00:01:28.560> will

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
of time my troops on the top right will

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.170 
of time my troops on the top right will
take<00:01:28.799> care<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.100> HQ<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.820> will<00:01:30.000> wrap

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
take care of the HQ and that will wrap

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
take care of the HQ and that will wrap
it<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> raid<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it up for the raid so for that one a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.590 
it up for the raid so for that one a
little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.369> indecisive<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> end

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
little bit indecisive but in the end

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359 
little bit indecisive but in the end
surprisingly<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.350> actually<00:01:34.619> didn't<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.159> any

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
surprisingly I actually didn't have any

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.920 
surprisingly I actually didn't have any
casualties<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> heavies<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
casualties from the heavies to the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.780 
casualties from the heavies to the
zookas<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.770> did<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.159> good<00:01:38.400> job<00:01:38.549> there

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
zookas so I did a really good job there

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
zookas so I did a really good job there
and<00:01:39.030> let's<00:01:39.299> move<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> raid<00:01:39.869> number<00:01:40.229> two<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.250> for

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and let's move to raid number two so for

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.460 
and let's move to raid number two so for
this<00:01:41.729> base<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.570> too<00:01:42.840> difficult<00:01:43.409> I've

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
this base not too difficult I've

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.960 
this base not too difficult I've
actually<00:01:43.710> been<00:01:43.890> seeing<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.549> difficult

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
actually been seeing some more difficult

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.490 
actually been seeing some more difficult
bases<00:01:45.299> now<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> I've<00:01:45.780> raised<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.140> victory

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
bases now that I've raised my victory

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.289 
bases now that I've raised my victory
points<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.040> somewhere<00:01:47.399> above<00:01:47.610> 200<00:01:48.149> now

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
points I'm somewhere above 200 now

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.569 
points I'm somewhere above 200 now
whereas<00:01:48.930> maybe<00:01:49.110> five<00:01:49.409> episodes<00:01:49.860> ago<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> was<00:01:50.430> at

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
whereas maybe five episodes ago I was at

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
whereas maybe five episodes ago I was at
like<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> hundred<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.329> ten<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.409> these<00:01:52.590> ones

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
like a hundred and ten but these ones

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.410 
like a hundred and ten but these ones
here<00:01:53.009> are<00:01:53.070> usually<00:01:53.340> really<00:01:53.670> simple<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
here are usually really simple and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.209 
here are usually really simple and
usually<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> easy<00:01:55.110> ones<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.500> look<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
usually the easy ones I look for are the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
usually the easy ones I look for are the
ones<00:01:56.250> without<00:01:56.490> rocket<00:01:57.000> launchers<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> boob

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
ones without rocket launchers and boob

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.480 
ones without rocket launchers and boob
cannons<00:01:58.259> if<00:01:58.710> they<00:01:58.860> don't<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.159> rocket

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
cannons if they don't have rocket

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.889 
cannons if they don't have rocket
launchers<00:01:59.759> or<00:01:59.850> boom<00:02:00.030> cannons<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.689> sniper

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
launchers or boom cannons and the sniper

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.749 
launchers or boom cannons and the sniper
towers<00:02:01.290> don't<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.829> 10,000<00:02:02.549> health

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
towers don't have like 10,000 health

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
towers don't have like 10,000 health
then<00:02:03.360> generally<00:02:03.780> I'm<00:02:03.869> though<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.110> able

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
then generally I'm though will be able

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.749 
then generally I'm though will be able
to<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.619> them<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> same

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
to take them out and that's the same

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
to take them out and that's the same
thing<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> base<00:02:06.630> right<00:02:06.780> here<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
thing for this base right here so the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
thing for this base right here so the
only<00:02:07.970> defensive<00:02:08.970> buildings<00:02:09.300> he<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.509> less<00:02:09.720> or

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
only defensive buildings he have less or

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.170 
only defensive buildings he have less or
he<00:02:10.259> has<00:02:10.410> left<00:02:10.709> are<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.340> Splash<00:02:11.580> Damage<00:02:11.610> ones

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
he has left are the Splash Damage ones

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.940 
he has left are the Splash Damage ones
that<00:02:12.330> are<00:02:12.420> going<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.569> do

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that are going to do

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.440 
that are going to do
to<00:02:13.190> multiple<00:02:13.489> units<00:02:13.849> like<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> mortar<00:02:14.360> and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
to multiple units like the mortar and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.000 
to multiple units like the mortar and
the<00:02:14.510> machine<00:02:14.780> guns<00:02:15.020> somebody<00:02:15.709> go<00:02:15.800> ahead<00:02:15.920> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
the machine guns somebody go ahead and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.380 
the machine guns somebody go ahead and
take<00:02:16.099> those<00:02:16.220> guys<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.640> shouldn't<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.239> any

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
take those guys out shouldn't have any

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.880 
take those guys out shouldn't have any
casualties<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.140> that'll<00:02:18.410> wrap<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.680> up<00:02:18.769> for

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
casualties and that'll wrap it up for

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.070 
casualties and that'll wrap it up for
the<00:02:18.950> raid<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:20.150> smooth<00:02:20.450> sailing<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:20.930> was

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
the raid so smooth sailing I was

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.600 
the raid so smooth sailing I was
actually<00:02:21.230> really<00:02:21.620> disappointed<00:02:22.190> when<00:02:22.550> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
actually really disappointed when I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
actually really disappointed when I
upgraded<00:02:23.030> my<00:02:23.120> HQ<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:23.690> don't<00:02:23.840> know<00:02:23.900> if<00:02:24.019> I<00:02:24.050> talked

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
upgraded my HQ I don't know if I talked

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
upgraded my HQ I don't know if I talked
about<00:02:24.379> that<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.769> last<00:02:24.950> couple<00:02:25.160> of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
about that in the last couple of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.710 
about that in the last couple of
episodes<00:02:25.400> but<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:25.940> thought<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.180> unlocked<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
episodes but I thought I unlocked the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.839 
episodes but I thought I unlocked the
smoke<00:02:27.050> at<00:02:27.230> HQ<00:02:27.590> 14<00:02:28.069> but<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.340> think<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.700> actually

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
smoke at HQ 14 but I think it's actually

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.110 
smoke at HQ 14 but I think it's actually
HQ<00:02:29.510> 16<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.590> might<00:02:30.830> start<00:02:31.069> maxing<00:02:31.489> out<00:02:31.550> my<00:02:31.610> HQ

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
HQ 16 so I might start maxing out my HQ

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.059 
HQ 16 so I might start maxing out my HQ
again<00:02:32.420> because<00:02:32.780> once<00:02:33.050> again<00:02:33.319> if<00:02:33.680> you<00:02:33.830> guys<00:02:33.920> are

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
again because once again if you guys are

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.470 
again because once again if you guys are
new<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.250> boom<00:02:34.459> there's<00:02:34.730> no<00:02:34.880> penalty<00:02:35.300> for

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
new to boom there's no penalty for

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.050 
new to boom there's no penalty for
upgrading<00:02:35.810> your<00:02:36.019> HQ<00:02:36.170> too<00:02:36.590> fast<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> really

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
upgrading your HQ too fast and I really

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.130 
upgrading your HQ too fast and I really
definitely<00:02:38.209> want<00:02:38.510> to<00:02:38.540> get<00:02:38.690> those<00:02:38.810> smoke

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
definitely want to get those smoke

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.630 
definitely want to get those smoke
warrior<00:02:39.560> strategy<00:02:40.069> going<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.519> that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
warrior strategy going because that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.729 
warrior strategy going because that
seems<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.269> lot<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.510> fun<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.080> it'll

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
seems like a lot of fun and it'll

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.289 
seems like a lot of fun and it'll
definitely<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.250> lot<00:02:43.430> easier<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.910> take<00:02:44.060> care

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
definitely be a lot easier to take care

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.240 
definitely be a lot easier to take care
of<00:02:44.330> some<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.569> those<00:02:44.629> difficult<00:02:45.049> bases<00:02:45.440> alright

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
of some of those difficult bases alright

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.620 
of some of those difficult bases alright
so<00:02:46.430> starting<00:02:46.700> off<00:02:46.819> right<00:02:46.970> there<00:02:47.180> gonna<00:02:47.390> do<00:02:47.540> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
so starting off right there gonna do the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.059 
so starting off right there gonna do the
same<00:02:47.810> thing<00:02:47.870> with<00:02:48.230> a<00:02:48.260> barrage<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.890> an

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
same thing with a barrage and an

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.589 
same thing with a barrage and an
artillery<00:02:49.400> looks<00:02:49.849> like<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> actually<00:02:50.239> worked

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
artillery looks like it actually worked

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.600 
artillery looks like it actually worked
out<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.930> time<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.440> this<00:02:51.890> base<00:02:52.099> is<00:02:52.340> one<00:02:52.519> of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
out this time and this base is one of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.550 
out this time and this base is one of
the<00:02:52.700> easier<00:02:53.030> bases<00:02:53.420> that<00:02:53.540> I've<00:02:53.690> seen<00:02:54.049> I<00:02:54.230> guess

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
the easier bases that I've seen I guess

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.470 
the easier bases that I've seen I guess
the<00:02:54.799> strategy<00:02:55.459> or<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> guess<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.120> design

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
the strategy or I guess the design

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.390 
the strategy or I guess the design
behind<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:56.930> base<00:02:57.110> is<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:57.920> there's<00:02:58.099> a<00:02:58.190> ton

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
behind this base is that there's a ton

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.710 
behind this base is that there's a ton
of<00:02:58.430> defensive<00:02:58.940> buildings<00:02:59.299> but<00:02:59.450> pretty<00:02:59.660> much

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
of defensive buildings but pretty much

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.390 
of defensive buildings but pretty much
all<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.140> defensive<00:03:00.530> buildings<00:03:00.860> are<00:03:01.010> so<00:03:01.190> low

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
all the defensive buildings are so low

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.830 
all the defensive buildings are so low
level<00:03:01.579> that<00:03:02.150> they're<00:03:02.329> not<00:03:02.390> even<00:03:02.540> gonna<00:03:02.720> be

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
level that they're not even gonna be

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.330 
level that they're not even gonna be
able<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.019> make<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> dent<00:03:03.530> inside<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.980> my<00:03:04.040> troops

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
able to make a dent inside of my troops

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.640 
able to make a dent inside of my troops
so<00:03:04.640> dropping<00:03:04.940> shock<00:03:05.269> bombs<00:03:05.540> looks<00:03:06.319> like<00:03:06.470> my

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
so dropping shock bombs looks like my

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.770 
so dropping shock bombs looks like my
heavies<00:03:07.099> are<00:03:07.220> gonna<00:03:07.340> run<00:03:07.610> over<00:03:07.640> those<00:03:08.180> bombs

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
heavies are gonna run over those bombs

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.569 
heavies are gonna run over those bombs
so<00:03:09.110> my<00:03:09.260> troops<00:03:09.560> don't<00:03:09.709> or<00:03:09.920> my<00:03:10.010> zookas<00:03:10.430> don't

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
so my troops don't or my zookas don't

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.970 
so my troops don't or my zookas don't
run<00:03:10.730> over<00:03:10.760> those<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.329> then<00:03:11.900> after<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.380> bid<00:03:12.769> I'm

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
run over those and then after a bid I'm

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.199 
run over those and then after a bid I'm
not<00:03:13.220> gonna<00:03:13.370> make<00:03:13.549> my<00:03:13.700> way<00:03:13.819> through<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.120> entire

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
not gonna make my way through the entire

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.910 
not gonna make my way through the entire
base<00:03:14.690> I'm<00:03:14.900> sort<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.380> gonna<00:03:15.530> switch<00:03:15.799> my

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
base I'm sort of just gonna switch my

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.860 
base I'm sort of just gonna switch my
troops<00:03:16.250> over<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> right-hand<00:03:16.910> side<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.510> they

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
troops over the right-hand side and they

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.330 
troops over the right-hand side and they
should<00:03:18.109> just<00:03:18.139> be<00:03:18.319> able<00:03:18.470> to<00:03:18.590> take<00:03:18.799> care<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.069> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
should just be able to take care of the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.190 
should just be able to take care of the
HQ<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.209> I'm<00:03:20.329> not<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.630> worry<00:03:20.810> about<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:21.019> guys

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
HQ so I'm not gonna worry about the guys

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.199 
HQ so I'm not gonna worry about the guys
up<00:03:21.380> top<00:03:21.530> unfortunately<00:03:22.519> it<00:03:22.579> looks<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.060> two

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
up top unfortunately it looks like two

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.550 
up top unfortunately it looks like two
of<00:03:23.239> my<00:03:23.359> zookas<00:03:23.750> went<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.109> left<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.500> those

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
of my zookas went to the left and those

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.650 
of my zookas went to the left and those
guys<00:03:24.769> are<00:03:24.950> gonna<00:03:25.040> go<00:03:25.220> down<00:03:25.400> pretty<00:03:26.090> easy<00:03:26.389> base

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
guys are gonna go down pretty easy base

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.750 
guys are gonna go down pretty easy base
not<00:03:27.500> too<00:03:27.709> bad<00:03:27.859> at<00:03:27.980> all<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.340> let's<00:03:28.489> see<00:03:28.639> how

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
not too bad at all and let's see how

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.809 
not too bad at all and let's see how
much<00:03:28.910> we<00:03:28.970> made<00:03:29.450> for<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.900> resources<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:31.609> we<00:03:31.700> got

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
much we made for the resources so we got

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.160 
much we made for the resources so we got
a<00:03:31.850> little<00:03:32.000> bit<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.239> Intel<00:03:32.540> definitely<00:03:33.019> want

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
a little bit of Intel definitely want

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.120 
a little bit of Intel definitely want
you<00:03:33.260> guys<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.410> tell<00:03:33.680> me<00:03:33.709> how<00:03:33.889> you've<00:03:34.010> been

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
you guys to tell me how you've been

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.770 
you guys to tell me how you've been
doing<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.430> your<00:03:34.519> operations<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.329> know<00:03:35.389> again

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
doing with your operations I know again

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.150 
doing with your operations I know again
there<00:03:35.959> was<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.170> big<00:03:36.380> riot<00:03:36.620> with<00:03:36.889> the<00:03:37.010> loot

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
there was that big riot with the loot

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.500 
there was that big riot with the loot
changes<00:03:37.579> and<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.850> looks<00:03:38.000> like<00:03:38.060> they<00:03:38.239> switch

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
changes and it looks like they switch

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.479 
changes and it looks like they switch
that<00:03:38.720> back<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> little<00:03:39.049> bit<00:03:39.350> or<00:03:40.130> I<00:03:40.190> guess<00:03:40.340> not

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
that back a little bit or I guess not

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.259 
that back a little bit or I guess not
like<00:03:40.700> loot<00:03:40.910> changes<00:03:41.299> but<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:43.060> amount<00:03:44.060> of

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
like loot changes but the amount of

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.849 
like loot changes but the amount of
invasions<00:03:45.079> that<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.440> could<00:03:45.590> have<00:03:45.709> in<00:03:45.829> your

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
invasions that you could have in your

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.650 
invasions that you could have in your
base<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:46.459> now<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.880> that's<00:03:47.000> over<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.450> seems

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
base but now that that's over it seems

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.940 
base but now that that's over it seems
like<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.840> lot<00:03:47.989> of<00:03:48.079> people<00:03:48.319> aren't<00:03:48.470> liking<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
like a lot of people aren't liking the

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.620 
like a lot of people aren't liking the
operations<00:03:49.519> more<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.940> we've<00:03:50.480> definitely

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
operations more and we've definitely

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.569 
operations more and we've definitely
been<00:03:50.900> making<00:03:51.260> our<00:03:51.380> way<00:03:51.470> through<00:03:51.500> inside<00:03:52.130> of<00:03:52.370> my

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
been making our way through inside of my

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.129 
been making our way through inside of my
task<00:03:52.850> force<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.329> think<00:03:53.359> I'll<00:03:53.600> probably<00:03:53.780> put<00:03:54.049> us

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
task force I think I'll probably put us

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.780 
task force I think I'll probably put us
a<00:03:54.230> task<00:03:54.410> force<00:03:54.680> video<00:03:54.859> soon<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.489> second

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
a task force video soon of the second

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.190 
a task force video soon of the second
one<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:55.940> we<00:03:56.150> did<00:03:56.359> I<00:03:56.540> think<00:03:56.810> we<00:03:56.989> did

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
one that we did I think we did

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.990 
one that we did I think we did
pencil-neck<00:03:57.859> and<00:03:58.099> then<00:03:58.280> we<00:03:58.400> did<00:03:58.609> one<00:03:58.639> maybe

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
pencil-neck and then we did one maybe

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.509 
pencil-neck and then we did one maybe
even<00:03:59.120> two<00:03:59.900> levels<00:04:00.260> higher<00:04:00.470> than<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:01.069> so<00:04:01.489> I

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
even two levels higher than that so I

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.800 
even two levels higher than that so I
definitely<00:04:01.760> want<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.120> get<00:04:02.209> on<00:04:02.299> those<00:04:02.450> videos

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
definitely want to get on those videos

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.509 
definitely want to get on those videos
soon<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.319> it's<00:04:03.829> sort<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.099> just<00:04:04.160> hard<00:04:04.459> to

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
soon and it's sort of just hard to

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.160 
soon and it's sort of just hard to
record<00:04:04.849> all<00:04:05.060> those<00:04:05.209> raids<00:04:05.420> at<00:04:05.599> the<00:04:05.690> same<00:04:05.900> time

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
record all those raids at the same time

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.020 
record all those raids at the same time
alright<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.130> for<00:04:07.280> this<00:04:07.370> space<00:04:07.549> here<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.849> looks

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
alright so for this space here it looks

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.640 
alright so for this space here it looks
like<00:04:08.150> this<00:04:08.299> guy<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.450> an<00:04:08.630> actual<00:04:08.930> human<00:04:09.290> so

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
like this guy is an actual human so

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.170 
like this guy is an actual human so
we're<00:04:09.769> gonna<00:04:09.889> switch<00:04:10.099> from<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> NPC's<00:04:10.970> and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
we're gonna switch from the NPC's and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.360 
we're gonna switch from the NPC's and
just<00:04:11.419> try<00:04:11.599> to<00:04:11.660> destroy<00:04:12.049> someone<00:04:12.470> who<00:04:12.980> has<00:04:13.160> some

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
just try to destroy someone who has some

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.890 
just try to destroy someone who has some
real<00:04:13.549> money<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.970> give<00:04:14.090> us<00:04:14.239> because<00:04:14.540> most<00:04:14.780> of

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
real money to give us because most of

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.719 
real money to give us because most of
those<00:04:15.019> NPC<00:04:15.560> battles<00:04:15.919> really<00:04:16.099> only<00:04:16.459> give<00:04:16.639> you

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
those NPC battles really only give you

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.180 
those NPC battles really only give you
like<00:04:16.880> 15,000<00:04:17.720> gold<00:04:17.930> which<00:04:18.169> seems<00:04:18.440> really<00:04:18.919> weak

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
like 15,000 gold which seems really weak

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.069 
like 15,000 gold which seems really weak
because<00:04:19.849> if<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.090> lose<00:04:20.359> one<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.660> those<00:04:20.780> raids

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
because if you lose one of those raids

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.270 
because if you lose one of those raids
you<00:04:21.289> have<00:04:21.409> to<00:04:21.530> spend<00:04:21.769> like<00:04:21.919> forty<00:04:22.250> five

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
you have to spend like forty five

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.940 
you have to spend like forty five
thousand<00:04:22.909> to<00:04:22.970> make<00:04:23.120> your<00:04:23.270> army<00:04:23.630> again<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.919> I

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
thousand to make your army again so I

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.290 
thousand to make your army again so I
definitely<00:04:25.159> want<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.490> tag<00:04:25.669> this<00:04:25.820> guy<00:04:26.000> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
definitely want to tag this guy and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.670 
definitely want to tag this guy and
see<00:04:26.449> if<00:04:26.509> we<00:04:26.599> can<00:04:26.750> destroy<00:04:26.870> him<00:04:27.080> without<00:04:27.349> losing

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
see if we can destroy him without losing

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.159 
see if we can destroy him without losing
too<00:04:27.800> many<00:04:27.949> people<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:29.389> right<00:04:29.539> now<00:04:29.660> shock<00:04:29.960> bomb

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 
too many people so right now shock bomb

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.629 
too many people so right now shock bomb
in<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.379> defense<00:04:30.740> is<00:04:30.889> up<00:04:31.009> front<00:04:31.250> there<00:04:31.490> is<00:04:31.520> a

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
in the defense is up front there is a

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.279 
in the defense is up front there is a
rocket<00:04:32.120> launcher<00:04:32.389> in<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.569> very<00:04:32.750> back<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.259> I

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
rocket launcher in the very back but I

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:34.749 
rocket launcher in the very back but I
decided<00:04:33.710> from<00:04:33.919> the<00:04:34.009> very<00:04:34.099> beginning<00:04:34.400> I

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
decided from the very beginning I

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.460 
decided from the very beginning I
wouldn't<00:04:35.060> worry<00:04:35.210> about<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.479> because<00:04:36.110> most

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
wouldn't worry about that because most

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.869 
wouldn't worry about that because most
of<00:04:36.560> my<00:04:36.650> heavy<00:04:36.889> should<00:04:37.129> be<00:04:37.250> in<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.430> front<00:04:37.639> and

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
of my heavy should be in the front and

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.430 
of my heavy should be in the front and
the<00:04:38.060> way<00:04:38.180> that<00:04:38.389> it<00:04:38.479> was<00:04:38.569> angled<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.199> really

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
the way that it was angled it's really

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.140 
the way that it was angled it's really
not<00:04:39.560> gonna<00:04:39.680> do<00:04:39.889> too<00:04:40.069> much<00:04:40.190> work<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.580> my<00:04:40.699> zookas

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
not gonna do too much work on my zookas

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.909 
not gonna do too much work on my zookas
and<00:04:41.330> i<00:04:41.720> should<00:04:41.960> just<00:04:41.990> be<00:04:42.259> able<00:04:42.409> to<00:04:42.500> attack<00:04:42.770> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
and i should just be able to attack the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.830 
and i should just be able to attack the
base<00:04:43.069> all<00:04:43.819> right<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.120> right<00:04:44.240> now<00:04:44.419> there<00:04:44.629> was<00:04:44.810> a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
base all right so right now there was a

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.149 
base all right so right now there was a
machine<00:04:44.990> gun<00:04:45.319> in<00:04:45.409> the<00:04:45.470> back<00:04:45.620> took<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.129> out

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:46.159 
machine gun in the back took that out

before took care of my zookas used a
free<00:04:48.110> spell<00:04:48.349> on<00:04:48.470> some<00:04:48.620> of<00:04:48.710> the<00:04:48.770> defense's<00:04:49.220> rest

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030

but<00:05:10.819> I'm<00:05:10.880> going<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.030> go<00:05:11.120> ahead<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.419> drop<00:05:11.539> to

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
but I'm going to go ahead and drop to

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.270 
but I'm going to go ahead and drop to
barrage<00:05:12.020> is<00:05:12.289> directly<00:05:12.680> on<00:05:12.830> those<00:05:12.919> rocket

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
barrage is directly on those rocket

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.860 
barrage is directly on those rocket
launchers<00:05:13.550> which<00:05:13.759> worked<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.120> really<00:05:14.330> well

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
launchers which worked out really well

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.659 
launchers which worked out really well
looks<00:05:15.349> like<00:05:15.500> there's<00:05:15.680> two<00:05:15.889> more<00:05:16.069> boom<00:05:16.280> cannons

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
looks like there's two more boom cannons

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:17.740 
looks like there's two more boom cannons
actually<00:05:17.030> that<00:05:17.150> I'm<00:05:17.210> gonna<00:05:17.330> have<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.569> take

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
actually that I'm gonna have to take

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.209 
actually that I'm gonna have to take
care<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:17.990> so<00:05:18.289> let's<00:05:18.469> find<00:05:18.650> out<00:05:18.770> how<00:05:18.949> it's<00:05:19.099> gonna

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
care of so let's find out how it's gonna

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.890 
care of so let's find out how it's gonna
how<00:05:19.639> we're<00:05:19.789> gonna<00:05:19.880> do<00:05:20.150> it<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.539> I'm<00:05:20.780> gonna

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
how we're gonna do it and I'm gonna

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.059 
how we're gonna do it and I'm gonna
start<00:05:21.169> by<00:05:21.289> attacking<00:05:21.590> through<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.949> right

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
start by attacking through the right

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.459 
start by attacking through the right
hand<00:05:22.219> side<00:05:22.490> so<00:05:22.930> heavies<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:23.960> zookas<00:05:24.349> are

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:24.469 
hand side so heavies and zookas are

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:25.869 
hand side so heavies and zookas are
going<00:05:24.680> down<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.099> I<00:05:25.129> should<00:05:25.370> be<00:05:25.490> out<00:05:25.610> of<00:05:25.639> range

00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:25.879 
going down and I should be out of range

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.490 
going down and I should be out of range
of<00:05:26.120> most<00:05:26.300> the<00:05:26.419> rest<00:05:26.629> of<00:05:26.780> these<00:05:26.870> troops<00:05:27.199> and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
of most the rest of these troops and

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.499 
of most the rest of these troops and
there<00:05:28.190> are<00:05:28.370> these<00:05:28.580> two<00:05:28.639> boom<00:05:29.000> cannons<00:05:29.360> right

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
there are these two boom cannons right

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:30.610 
there are these two boom cannons right
here<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:29.870> I'm<00:05:29.930> going<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.080> want<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.289> make<00:05:30.409> sure<00:05:30.590> I

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
here so I'm going to want to make sure I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.320 
here so I'm going to want to make sure I
take<00:05:30.889> care<00:05:31.039> of<00:05:31.099> those<00:05:31.250> as<00:05:31.430> fast<00:05:31.639> as<00:05:31.789> possible

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
take care of those as fast as possible

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.300 
take care of those as fast as possible
so<00:05:32.810> two<00:05:32.870> artillery<00:05:33.289> going<00:05:33.740> down<00:05:33.860> on<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.069> first

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
so two artillery going down on the first

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.980 
so two artillery going down on the first
one<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:34.789> as<00:05:34.880> soon<00:05:35.090> as<00:05:35.210> this<00:05:35.389> little<00:05:35.599> storage

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
one and as soon as this little storage

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.689 
one and as soon as this little storage
thing<00:05:36.229> goes<00:05:36.530> down<00:05:36.710> right<00:05:36.919> here<00:05:37.159> I<00:05:37.310> can<00:05:37.520> drop<00:05:37.639> my

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
thing goes down right here I can drop my

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.939 
thing goes down right here I can drop my
third<00:05:38.030> artillery<00:05:38.509> and<00:05:38.750> then<00:05:39.440> now<00:05:39.560> it's<00:05:39.710> just<00:05:39.830> a

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
third artillery and then now it's just a

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.890 
third artillery and then now it's just a
matter<00:05:40.069> of<00:05:40.219> that<00:05:40.400> third<00:05:40.699> one<00:05:40.909> or<00:05:41.270> that<00:05:41.389> second

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
matter of that third one or that second

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.450 
matter of that third one or that second
boom<00:05:42.020> cannon<00:05:42.259> on<00:05:42.440> the<00:05:42.529> left-hand<00:05:42.860> side<00:05:42.979> and

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
boom cannon on the left-hand side and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.040 
boom cannon on the left-hand side and
let's<00:05:43.849> decide<00:05:44.210> how<00:05:44.360> I'm<00:05:44.479> gonna<00:05:44.630> take<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:44.990> out

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
let's decide how I'm gonna take that out

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.480 
let's decide how I'm gonna take that out
so<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.529> could<00:05:45.770> just<00:05:45.889> go<00:05:45.979> on<00:05:46.069> and<00:05:46.370> all-out

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
so I could just go on and all-out

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.279 
so I could just go on and all-out
assault<00:05:46.699> to<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.150> left<00:05:47.389> but<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:47.659> do<00:05:47.779> risk<00:05:48.169> the

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
assault to the left but I do risk the

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.809 
assault to the left but I do risk the
fact<00:05:48.529> that<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.830> mortar<00:05:49.130> could<00:05:49.310> shoot<00:05:49.520> down<00:05:49.550> my

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
fact that the mortar could shoot down my

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.640 
fact that the mortar could shoot down my
zookas<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.330> I<00:05:50.419> did<00:05:50.630> that<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:51.380> let's<00:05:51.500> go<00:05:51.560> ahead

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
zookas if I did that so let's go ahead

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.140 
zookas if I did that so let's go ahead
and<00:05:51.800> bring<00:05:51.889> my<00:05:52.009> troops<00:05:52.310> over<00:05:52.580> and<00:05:52.789> let's<00:05:53.000> see

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
and bring my troops over and let's see

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.820 
and bring my troops over and let's see
how<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.360> works<00:05:53.630> because<00:05:53.779> if<00:05:54.110> my<00:05:54.229> zookas<00:05:54.650> went

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
how it works because if my zookas went

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.740 
how it works because if my zookas went
too<00:05:55.009> far<00:05:55.219> forward<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:56.240> mortar<00:05:56.539> would

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
too far forward the mortar would

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.209 
too far forward the mortar would
actually<00:05:57.110> shoot<00:05:57.259> them<00:05:57.380> down<00:05:57.620> but<00:05:57.979> it<00:05:58.069> looks

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
actually shoot them down but it looks

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.189 
actually shoot them down but it looks
like<00:05:58.279> the<00:05:58.490> heavies<00:05:58.759> are<00:05:58.909> in<00:05:59.029> range<00:05:59.300> and<00:05:59.630> those

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 
like the heavies are in range and those

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.779 
like the heavies are in range and those
zookas<00:06:00.650> that<00:06:00.770> are<00:06:00.889> left<00:06:01.159> are<00:06:01.340> actually<00:06:01.639> gonna

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
zookas that are left are actually gonna

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.040 
zookas that are left are actually gonna
turn<00:06:01.969> around<00:06:02.120> and<00:06:02.270> shoot<00:06:02.449> that<00:06:02.630> mortar<00:06:02.930> so

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
turn around and shoot that mortar so

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.450 
turn around and shoot that mortar so
that<00:06:03.169> actually<00:06:03.469> works<00:06:03.650> out<00:06:03.830> perfectly<00:06:04.219> that

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
that actually works out perfectly that

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.010 
that actually works out perfectly that
could<00:06:04.610> have<00:06:04.729> been<00:06:04.789> a<00:06:04.849> lot<00:06:05.090> worse<00:06:05.120> if<00:06:05.569> the

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
could have been a lot worse if the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.529 
could have been a lot worse if the
zookas<00:06:06.409> got<00:06:07.340> too<00:06:07.580> close<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:07.940> that<00:06:08.090> mortar<00:06:08.389> and

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
zookas got too close to that mortar and

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.269 
zookas got too close to that mortar and
I<00:06:08.599> just<00:06:08.810> dropped<00:06:08.960> a<00:06:09.110> giant<00:06:09.319> shell<00:06:09.710> on<00:06:09.860> them<00:06:10.009> but

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
I just dropped a giant shell on them but

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.070 
I just dropped a giant shell on them but
fortunately<00:06:10.969> it<00:06:11.150> worked<00:06:11.270> out<00:06:11.479> and<00:06:11.779> it<00:06:11.900> looks

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
fortunately it worked out and it looks

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.300 
fortunately it worked out and it looks
like<00:06:12.199> we're<00:06:12.319> gonna<00:06:12.440> be<00:06:12.590> able<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.800> destroy<00:06:13.159> this

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
like we're gonna be able to destroy this

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.279 
like we're gonna be able to destroy this
base<00:06:13.520> with<00:06:13.729> no<00:06:13.849> problems<00:06:14.270> so<00:06:14.599> some<00:06:14.870> good<00:06:15.080> rates

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
base with no problems so some good rates

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.320 
base with no problems so some good rates
today<00:06:15.529> didn't<00:06:16.250> really<00:06:16.430> have<00:06:16.550> any<00:06:16.759> failures<00:06:17.150> we

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
today didn't really have any failures we

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.120 
today didn't really have any failures we
only<00:06:17.479> attacked<00:06:17.840> one<00:06:18.110> RealPlayer<00:06:18.620> base<00:06:18.860> and

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
only attacked one RealPlayer base and

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.100 
only attacked one RealPlayer base and
that<00:06:19.520> one<00:06:19.639> worked<00:06:19.819> out<00:06:19.940> really<00:06:20.180> well<00:06:20.300> but<00:06:20.990> as

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
that one worked out really well but as

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.809 
that one worked out really well but as
my<00:06:21.319> victory<00:06:21.650> points<00:06:21.949> are<00:06:22.069> gaining<00:06:22.490> I'm

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:22.819 
my victory points are gaining I'm

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.370 
my victory points are gaining I'm
definitely<00:06:23.240> encountering<00:06:23.719> a<00:06:23.840> lot<00:06:23.870> of<00:06:24.050> tougher

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
definitely encountering a lot of tougher

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.170 
definitely encountering a lot of tougher
bases<00:06:24.800> and<00:06:24.949> I'm<00:06:25.009> sure<00:06:25.190> the<00:06:25.310> NPC<00:06:25.729> bases<00:06:26.060> are

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
bases and I'm sure the NPC bases are

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.240 
bases and I'm sure the NPC bases are
gonna<00:06:26.270> get<00:06:26.479> ridiculous<00:06:26.990> soon<00:06:27.199> so<00:06:27.860> we'll<00:06:28.159> have

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:28.250 
gonna get ridiculous soon so we'll have

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.589 
gonna get ridiculous soon so we'll have
to<00:06:28.370> see<00:06:28.400> what<00:06:28.669> we<00:06:28.759> can<00:06:28.849> do<00:06:29.000> when<00:06:29.090> that<00:06:29.210> happens
