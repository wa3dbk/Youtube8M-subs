zombies<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.550> cod<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.660> pc<00:00:43.260> mod<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.800> all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
zombies in cod for the pc mod we all

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.579 
zombies in cod for the pc mod we all
known<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.430> called<00:00:44.940> reign<00:00:45.449> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.989> undead<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wonder if that statement was

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.340 
wonder if that statement was
grammatically<00:00:48.299> correct<00:00:49.309> who<00:00:50.309> gives<00:00:50.729> a<00:00:50.940> crap

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
grammatically correct who gives a crap

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.890 
grammatically correct who gives a crap
