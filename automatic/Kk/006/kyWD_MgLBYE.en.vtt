00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
Sonny could have did a better job with

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.370 
Sonny could have did a better job with
some<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> games<00:02:04.049> they<00:02:04.319> packed<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:04.859> I<00:02:05.100> mean

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
some of the games they packed in I mean

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.749 
some of the games they packed in I mean
if<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.709> really<00:02:07.740> wanted<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.220> solve<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> system

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
if you really wanted to solve the system

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
if you really wanted to solve the system
as<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.240> bundle<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.530> charge<00:02:10.769> would

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
as a bundle I think the charge would

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.790 
as a bundle I think the charge would
have<00:02:11.009> made<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> bundle<00:02:12.269> it's<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have made it this bundle it's it's a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.300 
have made it this bundle it's it's a
some<00:02:14.070> franchise<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.570> system<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.310> could

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
some franchise for the system I could

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
some franchise for the system I could
have<00:02:17.400> seen<00:02:17.550> something<00:02:17.760> like<00:02:18.320> wipeout<00:02:19.320> and<00:02:19.380> a

and<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.450> port<00:03:36.690> on<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> top<00:03:37.110> side<00:03:37.410> and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.580 

really<00:03:41.370> feels<00:03:41.610> nice<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.510> light<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.440> of

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
really feels nice and light and then of

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.260 
really feels nice and light and then of
course<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.190> back<00:03:44.430> side<00:03:44.700> where<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
course this is the back side where the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.810 
course this is the back side where the
touch<00:03:45.510> controls<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:47.130> as<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.550> can<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
touch controls are and as you can see it

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.490 
touch controls are and as you can see it
looks<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.030> little<00:03:48.270> bit<00:03:48.450> more<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.750> glass<00:03:49.170> it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
looks a little bit more like glass it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.780 
looks a little bit more like glass it
doesn't<00:03:49.709> look<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:49.920> plastic<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.640> thought

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
doesn't look this plastic is I thought

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.100 
doesn't look this plastic is I thought
it<00:03:50.910> was<00:03:50.970> going<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.180> look<00:03:51.330> from<00:03:51.510> some<00:03:51.660> pictures

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
it was going to look from some pictures

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.630 
it was going to look from some pictures
I've<00:03:52.230> seen<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:53.310> let's<00:03:53.640> crank<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.150> baby<00:03:54.450> up

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
I've seen so let's crank this baby up

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.960 
I've seen so let's crank this baby up
see<00:03:56.640> if<00:03:56.670> we<00:03:56.760> get<00:03:56.850> any<00:03:57.030> power<00:03:57.330> out<00:03:57.510> of<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:58.970> now

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
see if we get any power out of it now

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.430 
see if we get any power out of it now
you<00:04:00.030> know<00:04:00.239> most<00:04:00.420> systems<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.140> everything

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
you know most systems and everything

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.600 
you know most systems and everything
usually<00:04:01.650> when<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.010> get<00:04:02.190> them<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.400> get<00:04:02.550> some

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
usually when you get them to get some

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.850 
usually when you get them to get some
power<00:04:02.850> out<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.140> doesn't<00:04:04.200> look<00:04:04.620> like

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
power out of it so it doesn't look like

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.790 
power out of it so it doesn't look like
it<00:04:05.459> has<00:04:05.640> any<00:04:05.940> juice<00:04:06.300> in<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.660> at<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:07.020> point<00:04:07.380> so

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
it has any juice in it at this point so

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.310 
it has any juice in it at this point so
there<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.550> and<00:04:09.390> I'll<00:04:09.570> push<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.840> wrong<00:04:10.050> damn

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
there it is and I'll push the wrong damn

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.949 
there it is and I'll push the wrong damn
thing<00:04:10.580> so<00:04:11.580> I<00:04:11.610> could<00:04:11.760> see<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:11.970> pilot<00:04:12.660> logo

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
thing so I could see the pilot logo

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:27.900 
thing so I could see the pilot logo
coming<00:04:13.290> on

initial screen that you get you can kind
of<00:05:57.040> play<00:05:57.370> around<00:05:57.400> with<00:05:57.850> this<00:05:58.030> as<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:59.020> can<00:05:59.140> see

of play around with this as you can see

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.520 
of play around with this as you can see
one<00:06:00.340> thing<00:06:00.370> I<00:06:00.640> did<00:06:00.880> notice<00:06:00.910> is<00:06:01.570> they<00:06:02.380> don't

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
one thing I did notice is they don't

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.320 
one thing I did notice is they don't
have<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.070> netflix<00:06:05.370> icon<00:06:06.370> up<00:06:06.550> yet<00:06:06.820> so<00:06:07.120> i'm

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
have the netflix icon up yet so i'm

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.030 
have the netflix icon up yet so i'm
guessing<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.900> probably<00:06:07.930> won't<00:06:08.650> be<00:06:08.740> available

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
guessing it probably won't be available

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.010 
guessing it probably won't be available
until<00:06:09.370> next<00:06:09.730> week<00:06:09.940> when<00:06:10.150> everyone<00:06:10.570> else<00:06:10.660> gets

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
until next week when everyone else gets

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.409 
until next week when everyone else gets
it<00:06:11.260> but<00:06:11.530> still<00:06:12.370> have<00:06:12.490> like<00:06:12.730> a<00:06:12.760> couple<00:06:13.360> of

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
it but still have like a couple of
