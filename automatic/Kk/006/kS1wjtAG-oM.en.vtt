off<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> earth<00:02:42.080> who<00:02:43.080> knows<00:02:43.260> maybe<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
off of the earth who knows maybe that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
eyes what do you think guys I can't I

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.480 
eyes what do you think guys I can't I
can't<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.740> at<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.130> say<00:02:53.280> it's

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
can't just look at it and say it's

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.730 
can't just look at it and say it's
definitely<00:02:54.000> life<00:02:54.210> but<00:02:54.570> but<00:02:55.230> doesn't<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.620> make

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
definitely life but but doesn't it make

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.530 
definitely life but but doesn't it make
you<00:02:55.830> want<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.370> more<00:02:56.490> yes<00:02:56.970> let's

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you want to look a little more yes let's

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.820 
you want to look a little more yes let's
send<00:02:57.810> into<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:57.990> spacecraft<00:02:58.530> back<00:02:58.680> there

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
send into the spacecraft back there

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.250 
send into the spacecraft back there
there<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.460> decide<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.600> was<00:03:00.810> shot<00:03:01.050> by

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
there it is you decide that was shot by

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.500 
there it is you decide that was shot by
the<00:03:01.620> opportunity<00:03:02.310> spacecraft<00:03:02.880> 23rd<00:03:03.390> of

the opportunity spacecraft 23rd of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.650 
the opportunity spacecraft 23rd of
februari<00:03:03.840> 2004a<00:03:05.300> nothing<00:03:06.300> they<00:03:06.390> could<00:03:06.450> do

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
februari 2004a nothing they could do

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.210 
februari 2004a nothing they could do
they<00:03:06.690> had<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.080> just<00:03:07.290> move<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.680> because<00:03:07.980> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
they had to just move on because it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.350 
they had to just move on because it
didn't<00:03:08.430> have<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.670> scientific

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
didn't have the scientific

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.180 
didn't have the scientific
instrumentation<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:10.590> any<00:03:10.830> further

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
instrumentation to do any further

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.370 
instrumentation to do any further
exploring<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.480> guess<00:03:12.990> we<00:03:13.140> need<00:03:13.230> another

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
exploring so I guess we need another

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.800 
exploring so I guess we need another
mission<00:03:13.830> but<00:03:13.980> maybe<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.490> maybe<00:03:14.600> that's<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
mission but maybe just maybe that's the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.979 
mission but maybe just maybe that's the
Holy<00:03:15.989> Grail<00:03:16.670> fear<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:18.150> is<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.360> mean<00:03:18.690> believe<00:03:18.930> me

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
Holy Grail fear it is I mean believe me

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.900 
Holy Grail fear it is I mean believe me
I<00:03:19.350> think<00:03:19.470> about<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.040> lot<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.459> very<00:03:20.670> very

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
I think about it a lot it's very very

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.100 
I think about it a lot it's very very
interesting<00:03:21.270> i'd<00:03:21.330> like<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.630> just<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:21.959> you

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
interesting i'd like to just see you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.050 
interesting i'd like to just see you
know<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.800> shapes<00:03:23.130> Martian<00:03:23.640> head<00:03:23.820> bowing

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
know of the shapes Martian head bowing

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.850 
know of the shapes Martian head bowing
and<00:03:24.270> then<00:03:24.420> they<00:03:24.570> would<00:03:24.690> disprove<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.440> would

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
and then they would disprove that would

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.640 
and then they would disprove that would
sell<00:03:26.070> it<00:03:26.100> what<00:03:26.400> yes<00:03:26.610> exactly<00:03:27.209> yes<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.930> little

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.530 
theories about whether or not we do we
are<00:03:43.830> not<00:03:43.980> alone<00:03:44.220> yeah<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:45.090> a<00:03:45.150> fascinating

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
are not alone yeah it's a fascinating

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500 
are not alone yeah it's a fascinating
look<00:03:45.810> at<00:03:46.050> some<00:03:46.260> interesting<00:03:46.709> people<00:03:47.040> who<00:03:47.510> have

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
look at some interesting people who have

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.540 
look at some interesting people who have
a<00:03:48.540> lot<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.780> conviction<00:03:49.200> about<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.830> we'll

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
a lot of conviction about this we'll

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.100 
a lot of conviction about this we'll
leave<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.820> that<00:03:50.880> Jimmy<00:03:51.360> Carter<00:03:51.690> swears<00:03:51.930> he

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
leave it at that Jimmy Carter swears he

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.370 
leave it at that Jimmy Carter swears he
saw<00:03:52.250> yes<00:03:53.250> in<00:03:53.580> interview<00:03:54.209> with<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.480> we<00:03:54.630> talked

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
saw yes in interview with you we talked

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.170 
saw yes in interview with you we talked
about<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.770> he<00:03:55.800> doesn't<00:03:56.250> believe<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.670> was<00:03:56.790> alien

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
about it he doesn't believe it was alien

about it he doesn't believe it was alien
it<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.290> know<00:03:58.410> it's<00:03:58.530> hard<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.800> imagine<00:03:58.890> given

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
it you know it's hard to imagine given

the expanse of the universe travel at

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.070 
the expanse of the universe travel at
that<00:04:02.430> distance<00:04:02.670> but<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.720> know<00:04:03.840> we<00:04:03.989> have

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
that distance but you know we have

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.810 
that distance but you know we have
little<00:04:04.290> pea<00:04:04.500> brains<00:04:04.770> by<00:04:05.010> comparison<00:04:05.489> right

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
little pea brains by comparison right

we've<00:04:06.000> been<00:04:06.150> studying<00:04:06.330> physics<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:06.900> 500

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
we've been studying physics for 500

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.229 
we've been studying physics for 500
years<00:04:07.440> do<00:04:07.620> we<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.830> everything<00:04:08.100> no<00:04:08.550> i<00:04:08.850> don't
