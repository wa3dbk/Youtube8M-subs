but basically it's a true dolby digital

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.140 
but basically it's a true dolby digital
decoder<00:01:27.689> box<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:28.470> basically<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.030> put<00:01:30.030> your

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
decoder box I'm basically just put your

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.969 
decoder box I'm basically just put your
optical<00:01:30.570> input<00:01:30.930> into<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.350> thing<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
optical input into this thing and you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.700 
optical input into this thing and you
can<00:01:32.130> help<00:01:32.670> any<00:01:32.970> headphones<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> turns

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
them into simulated surround sound so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
them into simulated surround sound so
you're<00:01:37.140> basically<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.009> get<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> same

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
like A's ax 720 headset or like astro

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.850 
like A's ax 720 headset or like astro
you<00:01:47.790> know<00:01:47.880> anything<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.740> and<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
thing does a fantastic job of simulating

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.289 
thing does a fantastic job of simulating
the<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.960> know<00:01:55.310> 7.1<00:01:57.649> signal<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.299> very

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the you know 7.1 signal so very

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.139 
the you know 7.1 signal so very
lightweight<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.460> almost<00:02:02.700> almost

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
lightweight you know it's almost almost

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.380 
lightweight you know it's almost almost
too<00:02:03.540> lightweight<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.020> mean

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
too lightweight I mean

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390 
too lightweight I mean
it<00:02:04.479> doesn't<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.440> know<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.770> found<00:02:05.950> an<00:02:06.010> 80<00:02:06.159> box

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
it doesn't you know just found an 80 box

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.529 
it doesn't you know just found an 80 box
on<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.700> thing<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:06.940> it's<00:02:07.150> like<00:02:07.330> one<00:02:07.960> ounce

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
on this thing and it's like one ounce

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.090 
on this thing and it's like one ounce
but<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.780> mean<00:02:11.140> it's<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.380> it's<00:02:11.560> portable

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
but I mean it's so it's portable

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.900 
but I mean it's so it's portable
lightweight<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.790> love<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.450> sounds<00:02:14.200> like
