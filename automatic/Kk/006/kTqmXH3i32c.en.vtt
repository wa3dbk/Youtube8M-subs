00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.200 

number<00:00:00.930> five

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.640 

will<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.870> smoke<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.469> engine

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
will that smoke off the engine

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:06.040 
will that smoke off the engine
how<00:00:58.220> was<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.460> that<00:00:59.080> normal

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.590 

got<00:01:06.730> 555

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.540 

on<00:01:13.689> 24<00:01:14.380> pounds<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.740> boost

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
on 24 pounds of boost

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.580 
on 24 pounds of boost
between<00:01:16.150> these<00:01:16.270> two<00:01:16.330> points<00:01:16.480> here<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.260> it'll

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
between these two points here so it'll

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.530 
between these two points here so it'll
get<00:01:17.830> us<00:01:17.950> move<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.430> out<00:01:18.640> right<00:01:18.880> down<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.180> 11<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
get us move on out right down to 11 the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.140 
get us move on out right down to 11 the
one<00:01:19.780> which<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:19.990> really<00:01:20.350> good<00:01:20.940> peak<00:01:21.940> power

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
one which is really good peak power

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.030 
one which is really good peak power
we're<00:01:22.420> making<00:01:22.660> 12<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.020> 1<00:01:23.230> which

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
we're making 12 to 1 which

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.130 
we're making 12 to 1 which
that's<00:01:24.730> that's<00:01:24.940> ideal<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.630> can<00:01:25.750> see<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that's that's ideal and you can see the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.560 
that's that's ideal and you can see the
power<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.860> know<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.040> torque<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.520> is<00:01:27.880> hanging

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
power you know the torque is is hanging

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.210 
power you know the torque is is hanging
right<00:01:28.690> through<00:01:29.050> there<00:01:29.260> right<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.040> as

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
right through there right and then as

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.160 
right through there right and then as
the<00:01:30.340> airfield<00:01:30.670> drops<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.690> can<00:01:31.870> see<00:01:32.050> it

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the airfield drops you can see it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.560 
the airfield drops you can see it
started<00:01:32.470> dropping<00:01:32.680> us

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
started dropping us

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
started dropping us
before<00:01:33.870> we<00:01:34.050> actually<00:01:34.230> bring<00:01:34.620> this<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.010> smooth

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
before we actually bring this and smooth

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
before we actually bring this and smooth
this<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.729> right<00:01:36.330> get<00:01:36.840> rid<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.110> different

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this out right get rid of that different

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:46.110 
this out right get rid of that different
put<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.759> porfa<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:40.200> it

but we're going to spray both the front
mount<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.630> Radha<00:04:03.110> body<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:04.340> see<00:04:04.550> what<00:04:04.760> kind<00:04:05.180> of

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
mount and Radha body to see what kind of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.930 
mount and Radha body to see what kind of
baseline<00:04:05.660> that<00:04:05.690> gives<00:04:06.110> us

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940
