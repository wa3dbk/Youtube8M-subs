can<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.150> both<00:02:25.269> hands<00:02:25.569> now<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.870> only

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
can do that on both hands now the only

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.229 
can do that on both hands now the only
other<00:02:26.290> move<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.799> we<00:02:26.890> need<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.190> know<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
other move that we need to know is the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.930 
other move that we need to know is the
fold<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:28.989> if<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:29.980> your<00:02:30.130> hammer<00:02:30.400> grip<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
fold so if you have your hammer grip and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.089 
fold so if you have your hammer grip and
you<00:02:31.060> swing<00:02:31.360> over<00:02:31.660> your<00:02:32.110> arm<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.680> hit<00:02:32.920> your

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
you swing over your arm so you hit your

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.280 
you swing over your arm so you hit your
forearm<00:02:33.549> what<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:34.510> gonna<00:02:34.599> do<00:02:34.840> is<00:02:35.140> we're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
forearm what we're gonna do is we're

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.839 
forearm what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.440> make<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> giant<00:02:35.950> doughnut<00:02:36.519> with<00:02:36.700> our

remember starting in the hammer grip
swing<00:02:59.320> in<00:02:59.560> which<00:02:59.740> and<00:03:00.160> then<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.820> can<00:03:00.940> swing

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
swing in which and then you can swing

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:15.300 
swing in which and then you can swing
all<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.540> way<00:03:01.750> outwards<00:03:02.230> but<00:03:05.160> learnt<00:03:14.310> casein

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
all the way outwards but learnt casein

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.680 
all the way outwards but learnt casein
once<00:03:15.490> you've<00:03:15.700> got<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.360> put<00:03:16.570> them

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
once you've got that you just put them

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.660 
once you've got that you just put them
together<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.290> we<00:03:17.740> start<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.250> our<00:03:18.340> right<00:03:18.550> we're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
together so we start in our right we're

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.830 
together so we start in our right we're
gonna<00:03:18.760> start<00:03:19.000> in<00:03:19.090> our<00:03:19.150> right<00:03:19.360> hand<00:03:19.390> with<00:03:19.720> our

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
really so I'm going to turn almost like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.870 
really so I'm going to turn almost like
oh<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:33.310> gonna<00:03:33.820> turn<00:03:34.350> grab<00:03:35.350> swing<00:03:36.280> all<00:03:36.640> the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
oh but I'm gonna turn grab swing all the

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.910 
oh but I'm gonna turn grab swing all the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
way around back to the cradle again so

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.170 
way around back to the cradle again so
I'm<00:03:39.010> in<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> cradle<00:03:39.489> again<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:39.850> I<00:03:39.910> can<00:03:40.060> throw

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
I'm in the cradle again so I can throw

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.590 
I'm in the cradle again so I can throw
again<00:03:40.570> throw<00:03:41.140> catch<00:03:41.970> all<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.209> way<00:03:43.300> around

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
throw cat all the way around and you

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.460 
throw cat all the way around and you
just<00:03:46.209> keep<00:03:46.390> doing<00:03:46.570> that<00:03:48.060> magic<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:50.290> might

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
just keep doing that magic and you might

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.390 
just keep doing that magic and you might
find<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.800> it's<00:03:50.980> hitting<00:03:51.160> you<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.340> face

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.820 
find that it's hitting you in the face
what<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.150> would<00:03:52.330> suggest<00:03:52.450> for<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.260> instead

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
what I would suggest for that is instead

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.020 
what I would suggest for that is instead
of<00:03:53.950> what<00:03:54.130> you're<00:03:54.340> probably<00:03:54.520> doing<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:54.910> not

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
of what you're probably doing is not

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.090 
of what you're probably doing is not
turning<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:55.989> if<00:03:56.230> you<00:03:56.320> don't<00:03:56.500> turn<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.950> will

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
turning so if you don't turn this will

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.009 
turning so if you don't turn this will
happen<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:58.360> not<00:03:58.390> nice

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
happen it's not nice

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.900 
happen it's not nice
don't<00:03:59.320> let<00:03:59.440> it<00:03:59.470> do<00:03:59.650> that<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.610> make<00:04:00.880> sure

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
don't let it do that to you so make sure

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.390 
don't let it do that to you so make sure
if<00:04:01.269> you<00:04:01.450> ask<00:04:01.690> you<00:04:01.870> as<00:04:02.049> you<00:04:02.230> let<00:04:02.380> go<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:03.040> turn

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
if you ask you as you let go you turn

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.330 
if you ask you as you let go you turn
your<00:04:03.610> body<00:04:03.790> at<00:04:04.090> least<00:04:04.330> 180<00:04:04.600> degrees<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:06.010> you

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
your body at least 180 degrees and you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.250 
your body at least 180 degrees and you
can<00:04:06.459> even<00:04:06.640> let<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.090> hoops<00:04:07.299> swing<00:04:07.690> slightly

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
can even let the hoops swing slightly

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.610 
can even let the hoops swing slightly
down<00:04:08.470> your<00:04:08.680> hand<00:04:08.860> if<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.130> want<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.970> this<00:04:10.090> point

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
down your hand if you want at this point

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.780 
down your hand if you want at this point
so<00:04:11.620> guys<00:04:11.769> when<00:04:11.950> you're<00:04:12.070> doing<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.610> he'd

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
so guys when you're doing this one he'd

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.100 
so guys when you're doing this one he'd
be<00:04:12.940> really<00:04:13.209> careful<00:04:13.510> what<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:13.660> other<00:04:13.810> hand<00:04:13.989> is

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
be really careful what the other hand is

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.349 
be really careful what the other hand is
doing<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:14.769> doesn't<00:04:15.070> look<00:04:15.160> good

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.420 

for<00:04:17.959> this

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.969 

okay<00:04:21.060> think<00:04:21.840> about<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.229> other<00:04:22.320> hand<00:04:22.620> bring

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
okay think about that other hand bring

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.249 
okay think about that other hand bring
your<00:04:23.130> chest<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.580> if<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.030> want<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.270> go<00:04:24.360> from<00:04:24.539> you

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
your chest up if you want to go from you

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.710 
your chest up if you want to go from you
can<00:04:25.380> do<00:04:25.470> better<00:04:25.650> or<00:04:26.130> maybe<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.120> straight<00:04:27.509> out

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
can do better or maybe like straight out

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120 
can do better or maybe like straight out
whoo

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
whoo

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.680 
whoo
but<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:29.550> this<00:04:29.610> with<00:04:29.880> two<00:04:30.060> hoops<00:04:30.270> you<00:04:30.449> need<00:04:30.600> to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
but I do this with two hoops you need to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.810 
but I do this with two hoops you need to
learn<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> both<00:04:31.110> ways<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:31.919> from<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.310> point<00:04:32.610> we

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
learn it both ways so from this point we

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.540 
learn it both ways so from this point we
did<00:04:33.030> from<00:04:33.660> cradle<00:04:33.930> throw<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.889> chicken<00:04:35.370> and

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
did from cradle throw to chicken and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.360 
did from cradle throw to chicken and
around<00:04:36.389> but<00:04:36.930> what<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.169> can<00:04:37.410> do<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:38.190> if<00:04:38.280> you

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
around but what you can do is if you

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.249 
around but what you can do is if you
fold<00:04:38.639> back<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:39.000> other<00:04:39.120> way<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:40.050> you're<00:04:40.169> in

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
fold back the other way so you're in

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.129 
fold back the other way so you're in
chicken<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.220> turn<00:04:41.400> backwards<00:04:42.139> throw

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
chicken you can turn backwards throw

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.900 
chicken you can turn backwards throw
catch<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:44.090> unravel<00:04:45.090> to<00:04:45.330> cradle<00:04:45.720> throw<00:04:46.590> catch

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
catch and unravel to cradle throw catch

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.730 
catch and unravel to cradle throw catch
unravel<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.030> cradle<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:48.930> ones<00:04:49.169> moving

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
unravel to cradle so ones moving

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.279 
unravel to cradle so ones moving
backwards<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.610> ones<00:04:50.850> moving<00:04:51.300> forwards<00:04:51.750> to

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
backwards and ones moving forwards to

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.200 
backwards and ones moving forwards to
show<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.650> on<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.770> left<00:04:53.070> hand<00:04:53.190> we<00:04:53.940> do<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
show that on the left hand we do the

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.189 
show that on the left hand we do the
forwards<00:04:54.690> over<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.650> top<00:04:56.090> we<00:04:57.090> from<00:04:57.720> an<00:04:57.810> open

very<00:05:04.620> catch<00:05:04.800> unravel<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.880> then<00:05:06.120> if<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:07.039> undo

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
very catch unravel and then if you undo

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.980 
very catch unravel and then if you undo
that<00:05:08.070> Ravel<00:05:08.639> you<00:05:08.849> end<00:05:09.030> up<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.300> chicken<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.870> you

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
that Ravel you end up in chicken and you

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.379 
that Ravel you end up in chicken and you
can<00:05:10.110> go<00:05:10.199> back<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:10.530> other<00:05:10.590> way<00:05:14.240> what<00:05:15.240> that

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
can go back the other way what that

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.900 
can go back the other way what that
means<00:05:15.599> is<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.870> can<00:05:15.990> do<00:05:16.050> a<00:05:16.080> teaspoon<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.400> I've

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
means is you can do a teaspoon so I've

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.969 
means is you can do a teaspoon so I've
got<00:05:18.030> both<00:05:18.210> thumbs<00:05:18.419> forwards<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.440> swing<00:05:19.740> both

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
got both thumbs forwards and swing both

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.490 
got both thumbs forwards and swing both
hips<00:05:20.310> over<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.060> same<00:05:21.360> way<00:05:21.630> so<00:05:21.690> ones<00:05:22.259> and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
hips over the same way so ones and

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.589 
hips over the same way so ones and
cradle<00:05:22.800> ones<00:05:23.009> in<00:05:23.190> chicken<00:05:23.550> so<00:05:24.060> in<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.300> case

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
cradle ones in chicken so in this case

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.810 
cradle ones in chicken so in this case
both<00:05:24.870> my<00:05:25.139> heats<00:05:25.349> up<00:05:25.590> looking<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.580> right

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.070
