well you know bromas not a 47 pounder I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.740 
well you know bromas not a 47 pounder I
mean<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> shown<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> Malignaggi<00:00:18.390> fight

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.060 
I think that actually really has it you
know<00:00:21.240> he's<00:00:21.390> not<00:00:21.539> powerful<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.650> way<00:00:22.800> I

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
