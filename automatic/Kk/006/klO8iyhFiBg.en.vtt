00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
hi I'm Karen flirty from living by Human

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.740 
hi I'm Karen flirty from living by Human
Design<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> series<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
Design and this is a series of

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.890 
Design and this is a series of
informational<00:00:16.350> videos<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:17.010> Human<00:00:17.670> Design

another<00:00:18.900> question<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.410> I'm<00:00:19.500> often<00:00:19.740> asked<00:00:20.160> is

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
another question that I'm often asked is

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.320 
another question that I'm often asked is
what<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> reflector

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
what is a reflector

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.450 
what is a reflector
well<00:00:21.779> reflectors<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> rarest<00:00:22.949> among<00:00:23.250> us

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
well reflectors are the rarest among us

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
well reflectors are the rarest among us
there<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.029> only<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.449> percent<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
there are only one percent of the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.730 
there are only one percent of the
population<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.060> they<00:00:27.060> are<00:00:27.090> here<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.930> reflect

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
population and they are here to reflect

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.179 
population and they are here to reflect
the<00:00:29.400> energy<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.599> rest<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.830> just

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the energy of the rest of us so just

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.240 
the energy of the rest of us so just
imagine<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.710> energetic<00:00:34.710> chart<00:00:35.010> on

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
imagine that on the energetic chart on

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.720 
imagine that on the energetic chart on
their<00:00:35.550> energy<00:00:35.969> chart<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:37.489> reflector<00:00:38.489> has

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
their energy chart the reflector has

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.510 
their energy chart the reflector has
every<00:00:39.300> Center<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.899> white<00:00:40.219> instead<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> being

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
every Center in white instead of being

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
every Center in white instead of being
colored<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.969> every<00:00:42.480> Center<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.170> white

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
colored in every Center would be white

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
colored in every Center would be white
on<00:00:43.379> their<00:00:43.739> chart<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.000> means<00:00:45.270> is

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
on their chart and so what that means is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.330 
on their chart and so what that means is
that<00:00:45.629> they're<00:00:45.930> always<00:00:46.170> taking<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.890> energy

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
that they're always taking in energy

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
that they're always taking in energy
from<00:00:47.550> other<00:00:47.730> people<00:00:48.180> they're<00:00:48.660> always<00:00:48.809> taking

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
from other people they're always taking

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
from other people they're always taking
it<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> amplifying<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.820> they're

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it in and amplifying it so they're

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.580 
it in and amplifying it so they're
really<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.480> reflect<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> energy<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
really here to reflect the energy of the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
really here to reflect the energy of the
rest<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> us<00:00:53.070> they're<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> reflect<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
rest of us they're here to reflect the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
rest of us they're here to reflect the
energy<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> community<00:00:55.350> if<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.340> fruit

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
energy of the community if a fruit

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.330 
energy of the community if a fruit
flector<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.180> happy<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.739> community<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
flector is happy then the community is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
flector is happy then the community is
happy<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.510> reflector<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.500> happy

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
happy and if the reflector is not happy

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.640 
happy and if the reflector is not happy
then<00:01:02.460> most<00:01:03.420> likely<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.840> community<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> not

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
then most likely the community is not

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.310 
then most likely the community is not
happy<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.820> famous<00:01:06.060> reflectors<00:01:06.750> happen<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
happy some famous reflectors happen to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
happy some famous reflectors happen to
be<00:01:07.549> Sandra<00:01:08.549> Bullock<00:01:08.850> Michael<00:01:09.840> Jackson

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
be Sandra Bullock Michael Jackson

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.460 
be Sandra Bullock Michael Jackson
Richard<00:01:11.010> Burton<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.930> number<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.350> other

Richard Burton and a number of other

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
Richard Burton and a number of other
people<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:14.610> were<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.880> people<00:01:15.390> who

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
people but they were all people who

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.880 
people but they were all people who
happen<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.770> entertainment

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
happen to be in the entertainment

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670 
happen to be in the entertainment
industry<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.450> their<00:01:18.659> time<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.650> were

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
industry and at their time they were

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
industry and at their time they were
reflecting<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.640> health<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
reflecting the health of the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.620 
reflecting the health of the
entertainment<00:01:22.140> community<00:01:22.790> their<00:01:23.790> strategy

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
entertainment community their strategy

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.020 
entertainment community their strategy
as<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.290> decision-making<00:01:25.950> strategy<00:01:26.700> for

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
as a decision-making strategy for

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.679 
as a decision-making strategy for
reflectors<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.710> wait<00:01:28.920> 28<00:01:29.400> days<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
reflectors is to wait 28 days and so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990 
reflectors is to wait 28 days and so
that's<00:01:31.020> definitely<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> longest<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.490> any<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that's definitely the longest of any of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.270 
that's definitely the longest of any of
the<00:01:33.240> strategies<00:01:33.829> waiting<00:01:34.829> twenty-eight<00:01:35.159> days

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the strategies waiting twenty-eight days

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.850 
the strategies waiting twenty-eight days
can<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> problem<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> some

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
can be a bit of a problem for some

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.960 
can be a bit of a problem for some
people<00:01:37.890> especially<00:01:38.280> if<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.729> trying<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
people especially if you're trying to

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.270 
people especially if you're trying to
buy<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.240> car<00:01:39.450> or<00:01:39.780> something<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.409> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
buy your car or something like that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.520 
buy your car or something like that
but<00:01:41.549> waiting<00:01:41.820> 28<00:01:42.299> days<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:42.720> them<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.079> totally

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
but waiting 28 days for them is totally

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.340 
but waiting 28 days for them is totally
appropriate<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.460> their<00:01:45.350> information

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
appropriate because their information

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.249 
appropriate because their information
there<00:01:46.710> their<00:01:47.130> beam<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.479> based<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> moon

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
there their beam is based on the moon

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
there their beam is based on the moon
and<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.890> moon<00:01:49.920> has<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.280> 28<00:01:50.670> day<00:01:50.909> cycle<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.479> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and the moon has a 28 day cycle and so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
and the moon has a 28 day cycle and so
that's<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.409> based<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.610> they

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that's what it's based on for them they

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.789 
that's what it's based on for them they
should<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> talking<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.810> people<00:01:54.990> during<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
should be talking to people during that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.830 
should be talking to people during that
period<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.670> getting<00:01:57.090> other<00:01:57.420> people's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
period and getting other people's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.690 
period and getting other people's
opinion<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> once<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
opinion and once they get that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.219 
opinion and once they get that
information<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.540> they're<00:02:00.689> able<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> make<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
information then they're able to make a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
information then they're able to make a
decision<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.369> stand<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.909> them<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.780> if

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
