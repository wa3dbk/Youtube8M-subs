00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
fuel filter so there is diesel going

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.410 
fuel filter so there is diesel going
through<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> lines<00:01:57.520> even<00:01:58.030> though<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.300> is

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
through the lines even though it is

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.270 
through the lines even though it is
really<00:01:58.900> old<00:01:59.050> so<00:01:59.440> next<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.310> need<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.550> take<00:02:00.729> this

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
really old so next I need to take this

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.430 
really old so next I need to take this
this<00:02:03.280> curved<00:02:03.640> pipe<00:02:04.000> off<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.080> checked

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
this curved pipe off and I checked

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.119 
this curved pipe off and I checked
that's<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.860> 17<00:02:06.340> millimeter<00:02:06.580> wrench<00:02:07.090> on<00:02:08.129> it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
that's a 17 millimeter wrench on it

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.420 
that's a 17 millimeter wrench on it
should<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.819> fitting<00:02:10.149> on<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:12.040> fitting

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
should be the fitting on this fitting

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.009 
should be the fitting on this fitting
down<00:02:12.610> here<00:02:12.909> so<00:02:13.269> I'm<00:02:13.330> gonna<00:02:13.420> do<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:15.720> now<00:02:16.720> that

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.720 
down here so I'm gonna do that now that
curved<00:02:17.349> pipe<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:17.799> out<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.099> way<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.250> have<00:02:18.610> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
curved pipe is out of the way I have to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.160 
curved pipe is out of the way I have to
remove<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.209> more<00:02:19.360> fitting<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.840> that's<00:02:19.959> this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
remove one more fitting and that's this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.120 
put in the new pump okay I got the
primer<00:03:25.920> compound<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.709> old<00:03:28.890> one

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
primer compound and have the the old one

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.979 
primer compound and have the the old one
and<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.340> new<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.520> here<00:03:29.910> side<00:03:30.090> by<00:03:30.120> side<00:03:30.540> new

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
and the new one here side by side new

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.530 
and the new one here side by side new
one<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.320> left<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.850> can<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.390> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
one on the left and you can see that the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.240 
one on the left and you can see that the
fittings<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.350> are<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> same<00:03:34.709> size<00:03:34.980> even

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
fittings they are the same size even

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.710 
fittings they are the same size even
though<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.520> per<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.820> new<00:03:36.180> primer<00:03:36.450> pump

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
though the per the new primer pump

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.090 
though the per the new primer pump
itself<00:03:37.020> is<00:03:37.140> actually<00:03:37.260> smaller<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:37.980> more

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
itself is actually smaller and more

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.500 
itself is actually smaller and more
compact<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.880> at<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:40.170> point<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:41.330> then<00:03:42.330> I<00:03:42.360> have

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
compact so at this point and then I have

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.060 
compact so at this point and then I have
to<00:03:42.660> pick<00:03:42.810> up<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.050> copper<00:03:43.440> washer<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.860> just

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
to pick up that copper washer you just

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.820 
to pick up that copper washer you just
heard<00:03:44.250> me<00:03:44.489> drop<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:45.320> but<00:03:47.120> at<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.239> point

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
heard me drop there but at this point

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.229 
heard me drop there but at this point
assembly<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.130> reverse<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.970> disassembly<00:03:51.750> I

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
assembly is reverse of disassembly I

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.930 
assembly is reverse of disassembly I
have<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.360> new<00:03:54.510> primer<00:03:54.900> pump<00:03:55.580> screwed<00:03:56.580> in<00:03:56.760> now

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
have the new primer pump screwed in now

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.760 
have the new primer pump screwed in now
by<00:03:57.270> hand<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:59.060> it'll<00:04:00.060> take<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> 17<00:04:01.080> millimeter

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
by hand and it'll take a 17 millimeter

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.880 
by hand and it'll take a 17 millimeter
wrench<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:02.820> tighten<00:04:03.000> that<00:04:03.239> up<00:04:03.320> but<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.350> really

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
wrench to tighten that up but I really

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.199 
wrench to tighten that up but I really
don't<00:04:05.310> think<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.550> gonna<00:04:05.670> have<00:04:05.850> any<00:04:05.970> problem

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
don't think I'm gonna have any problem

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.760 
don't think I'm gonna have any problem
getting<00:04:06.330> a<00:04:06.510> 17<00:04:06.780> millimeter<00:04:07.290> wrench<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:07.620> there

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
getting a 17 millimeter wrench on there

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.080 
getting a 17 millimeter wrench on there
there's<00:04:07.950> more<00:04:08.130> clearance<00:04:08.580> now<00:04:08.760> with<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:08.970> new

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
there's more clearance now with the new

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.400 
there's more clearance now with the new
primary<00:04:09.390> pump<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.900> gonna<00:04:10.020> tighten<00:04:10.230> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
primary pump so I'm gonna tighten that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.050 
primary pump so I'm gonna tighten that
up<00:04:10.470> then<00:04:11.280> put<00:04:11.489> everything<00:04:11.670> else<00:04:11.910> back

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
up then put everything else back

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.740 
up then put everything else back
together<00:04:15.200> one<00:04:16.200> more<00:04:16.380> tip<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.850> new<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
together one more tip the new the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.870 
together one more tip the new the
fitting<00:04:18.989> on<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.169> new<00:04:19.260> pump<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.709> 17<00:04:20.430> millimeter

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
fitting on the new pump is 17 millimeter

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880 
fitting on the new pump is 17 millimeter
but<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.690> found<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.140> actually<00:04:22.260> easier<00:04:22.830> to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
but I found it actually easier to

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.530 
but I found it actually easier to
tighten<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.790> up<00:04:23.880> with<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:27.120> know<00:04:27.240> with<00:04:27.390> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
tighten it up with the you know with the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.050 
tighten it up with the you know with the
adjustable<00:04:28.110> wrench<00:04:28.380> here<00:04:28.760> because<00:04:29.760> as<00:04:30.000> you

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
adjustable wrench here because as you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.630 
adjustable wrench here because as you
can<00:04:30.210> see<00:04:30.450> it's<00:04:32.900> quite<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:33.990> bit<00:04:34.200> shorter<00:04:34.979> than

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
can see it's quite a bit shorter than

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.710 
can see it's quite a bit shorter than
the<00:04:36.800> 17<00:04:37.800> millimeter<00:04:38.190> wrench<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.510> will

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
the 17 millimeter wrench and this will

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.659 
the 17 millimeter wrench and this will
clear<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.140> frame<00:04:40.350> rails<00:04:40.620> that<00:04:40.950> one<00:04:41.130> not<00:04:41.460> so

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
clear the frame rails that one not so

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.090 
clear the frame rails that one not so
much<00:04:41.850> so<00:04:42.180> pump<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.260> tightened<00:04:43.560> up<00:04:43.620> now<00:04:43.770> so<00:04:44.010> I'm

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
much so pump is tightened up now so I'm

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.219 
much so pump is tightened up now so I'm
going<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.340> put<00:04:44.460> everything<00:04:44.610> else<00:04:44.970> back<00:04:45.150> in

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.940 

okay<00:04:49.229> everything's<00:04:49.590> back<00:04:49.740> together

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
okay everything's back together

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.580 
okay everything's back together
batteries<00:04:50.729> in<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.870> fuel<00:04:52.080> system<00:04:52.260> is

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
batteries in and the fuel system is

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.310 
batteries in and the fuel system is
primed<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:55.490> was<00:04:56.490> able<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.729> feel<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.260> feel<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
primed I was able to feel it feel the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.960 
primed I was able to feel it feel the
increased<00:04:58.740> pressure<00:04:59.010> on<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.280> pump<00:04:59.460> there<00:04:59.700> and

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
increased pressure on the pump there and

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.290 
increased pressure on the pump there and
I<00:05:00.090> saw<00:05:00.300> bubbles<00:05:00.840> going<00:05:01.289> through<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.300> through

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
I saw bubbles going through so through

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.960 
I saw bubbles going through so through
the<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.419> clear<00:05:03.810> plastic<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.880> was<00:05:06.030> there<00:05:06.210> so<00:05:06.510> I

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
the a clear plastic it was there so I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.510 
the a clear plastic it was there so I
believe<00:05:08.970> I'm<00:05:09.090> done<00:05:09.270> here<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:10.370> hopefully<00:05:11.370> the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
believe I'm done here and hopefully the

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.100 
believe I'm done here and hopefully the
car<00:05:11.729> will<00:05:11.910> start<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.450> that'll<00:05:12.660> be<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.780> separate

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
car will start but that'll be a separate

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.260 
car will start but that'll be a separate
