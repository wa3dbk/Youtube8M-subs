so<00:03:07.620> obviously<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.310> stealing<00:03:08.670> stuff<00:03:08.849> works

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
so obviously the stealing stuff works

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.240 
so obviously the stealing stuff works
but<00:03:09.480> why<00:03:09.629> is<00:03:09.690> stealing<00:03:10.260> even<00:03:10.560> necessary<00:03:11.069> in

but why is stealing even necessary in

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.680 
but why is stealing even necessary in

no<00:05:14.580> big<00:05:14.760> deal<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.120> just<00:05:15.210> how<00:05:15.480> things<00:05:15.810> work

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170

I<00:06:16.950> know<00:06:17.070> it<00:06:17.340> has<00:06:17.460> probably<00:06:17.790> been<00:06:18.000> on<00:06:18.180> your<00:06:18.330> mind

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
I know it has probably been on your mind

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.330 
I know it has probably been on your mind
since<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.870> start<00:06:19.260> Scott<00:06:19.770> there<00:06:20.160> is<00:06:20.310> a

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
since the start Scott there is a

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.400 
since the start Scott there is a
difference<00:06:20.970> between<00:06:21.240> characters<00:06:22.080> who<00:06:22.290> were

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
difference between characters who were

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.590 
difference between characters who were

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
inspired by others and characters who

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.900 
inspired by others and characters who
were<00:06:24.870> just<00:06:25.110> obviously<00:06:25.650> shameless<00:06:26.250> ripoffs

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
were just obviously shameless ripoffs

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.040 
were just obviously shameless ripoffs
I<00:06:26.940> completely<00:06:27.360> understand<00:06:27.750> what<00:06:27.840> you<00:06:27.930> mean

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
I completely understand what you mean

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.110 
I completely understand what you mean
but<00:06:28.950> I<00:06:28.980> personally<00:06:29.430> kind<00:06:29.790> of<00:06:29.880> find<00:06:30.060> that

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
but I personally kind of find that

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.390 
but I personally kind of find that
distinction<00:06:30.540> to<00:06:30.720> be<00:06:30.870> relevant<00:06:31.650> I<00:06:31.890> think<00:06:32.250> we

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
distinction to be relevant I think we

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.370 
distinction to be relevant I think we
just<00:06:32.580> need<00:06:32.700> to<00:06:32.820> accept<00:06:33.270> that<00:06:33.420> everything<00:06:33.990> was

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
just need to accept that everything was

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.200 
just need to accept that everything was
inspired<00:06:34.830> by<00:06:35.070> something<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.640> came<00:06:35.880> before

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
inspired by something that came before

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
character seems like they're just a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.020 
character seems like they're just a
carbon<00:06:40.410> copy<00:06:40.590> of<00:06:40.770> one<00:06:41.010> that<00:06:41.190> came<00:06:41.370> before<00:06:41.580> them

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
it's not important how a character was

it's not important how a character was
initially<00:06:44.790> created<00:06:45.420> what's<00:06:45.690> important<00:06:46.260> is

what<00:06:46.890> the<00:06:46.980> writers<00:06:47.310> do<00:06:47.760> with<00:06:47.940> that<00:06:48.120> character

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
what the writers do with that character

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.300 
what the writers do with that character
that<00:06:48.720> will<00:06:48.870> make<00:06:49.080> them<00:06:49.320> even<00:06:50.070> just<00:06:50.220> a<00:06:50.280> little

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
that will make them even just a little

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.490 
that will make them even just a little
bit<00:06:50.730> different<00:06:51.030> so<00:06:51.180> let's<00:06:51.570> stop<00:06:51.840> being<00:06:52.200> caught
