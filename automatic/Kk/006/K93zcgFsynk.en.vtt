00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
go too far let's talk about high

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
go too far let's talk about high
altitude<00:01:36.869> flying<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.799> you're<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.040> an

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
air is very thin and dangerous so by law

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.240 
air is very thin and dangerous so by law
the<00:01:45.329> airplane<00:01:45.780> must<00:01:45.990> keep<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> inside<00:01:46.979> of

the airplane must keep the inside of
that<00:01:47.369> commercial<00:01:47.640> aircraft<00:01:48.240> pressurized<00:01:48.930> so

that commercial aircraft pressurized so

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
that commercial aircraft pressurized so
that<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.770> only<00:01:49.890> feels<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.880> you're<00:01:51.060> no<00:01:51.270> more

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
that it only feels like you're no more

than 8,000 feet high the reason it's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
than 8,000 feet high the reason it's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
dangerous is that when air gets that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
dangerous is that when air gets that
thin<00:01:56.790> there's<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.390> enough<00:01:57.630> oxygen<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.770> your

maybe<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:23.150> answer<00:05:23.660> even<00:05:24.380> crazier<00:05:25.250> is<00:05:25.520> an

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
maybe the answer even crazier is an

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.580 
maybe the answer even crazier is an

they will be pushed together one of the

they will be pushed together one of the
most<00:05:36.260> popular<00:05:36.770> theories<00:05:37.100> for<00:05:37.370> why<00:05:37.520> this

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
most popular theories for why this

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.430 
most popular theories for why this
happens<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:38.660> these<00:05:38.900> virtual<00:05:39.410> particles

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
happens is that these virtual particles

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.130 
happens is that these virtual particles
popping<00:05:40.190> into<00:05:41.000> space<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.570> then<00:05:41.660> disappearing

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
popping into space and then disappearing

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.950 
popping into space and then disappearing
are<00:05:42.710> actually<00:05:43.190> reflecting<00:05:43.820> off<00:05:44.000> of<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.630> metal

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
are actually reflecting off of the metal

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.930 
are actually reflecting off of the metal
but<00:05:45.350> because<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.830> plates<00:05:46.130> are<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:46.640> close

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
but because the plates are so close

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.120 
but because the plates are so close
together<00:05:47.320> particles<00:05:48.320> with<00:05:48.470> wavelengths

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
together particles with wavelengths

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.000 
together particles with wavelengths
longer<00:05:49.610> than<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.270> gap<00:05:50.510> don't<00:05:51.229> get<00:05:51.440> reflected

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
longer than that gap don't get reflected

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.040 
longer than that gap don't get reflected
so<00:05:52.400> there's<00:05:52.580> more<00:05:52.910> virtual<00:05:53.630> particles

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
so there's more virtual particles

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.540 
so there's more virtual particles
pushing<00:05:54.440> on<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.650> outside<00:05:55.039> than<00:05:55.370> the<00:05:55.400> inside

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
pushing on the outside than the inside

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.180 
pushing on the outside than the inside

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
and the metal plates contact

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.520 
and the metal plates contact
I<00:05:58.310> know<00:05:59.150> these<00:05:59.419> concepts<00:05:59.960> have<00:06:00.080> gotten<00:06:00.320> pretty

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
I know these concepts have gotten pretty

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.219 
I know these concepts have gotten pretty
crazy<00:06:01.010> but<00:06:01.640> rest<00:06:01.910> assured<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.780> really<00:06:03.050> all

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:03.229 
crazy but rest assured that really all
