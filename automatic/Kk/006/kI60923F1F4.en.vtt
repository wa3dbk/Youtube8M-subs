00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.639
 and the following information 

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:05.920
 would trigger a series of reactions 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.170
 in the population since behind 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.809
 studies conducted between 2011 and the 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.700
 present year for the project the mantaro 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.919
 revives vital foods it 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.800
 found contaminated with lead metal 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.170
 highly dangerous we talk about the potato 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.330
 and milk 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.369
 this is bad news for all 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.920
 our housewives authorities 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.869
 chefs chefs farmers and ranchers 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.099
 as well as for those who love potato and 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.510
 the milk because these two 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.309
 basic products in our 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.500
 feed contain components 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.440
 highly contaminants such as lead and 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.600
 zinc the mantaro project revives in its 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.809
 first stage has evaluated the resources 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.780
 water air floors these asan have sat 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.000
 bases for now in the second stage 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.100
 reassess them but mainly 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.050
 to continue to keep doing a second 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.580
 let's go the lead is a soft metal that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.440
 it serves to create metallic products 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.690
 cables and pipes but also in 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.070
 paint and pesticides lead is one of 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.260
 the four metals that have a greater 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.790
 harmful effect on human health 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.240
 this can enter the human body to 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.810
 through food by 65% water in 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.420
 20% and the air by 15% was evaluated 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.850
 for pastures and milks the potato in its 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.729
 short period of five to six months already 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.880
 take some lead but it's not much without 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.490
 But the grass itself 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.020
 take lead that is a highly metal 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.170
 toxic and therefore milk is also 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.610
 affected bad news yes but good 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.100
 news that we left the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 misinformation to the information then 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.270
 citizens have a duty 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.369
 we make with this milk the lead can 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.470
 cause various unwanted effects like 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.240
 are disturbance of the biosynthesis of the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 hemoglobin and anemia damage to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.200
 nervous system damage to the brain between 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.670
 others this was the disturbing revelation 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.500
 that made paula porta porta 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.390
 coordinator of the mantaro project 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.130
 revives during the presentation of 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.590
 results from the evaluations 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.970
 environmental activities carried out between 2011 and 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.550
 this year and this verifies that he 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.460
 the lead that has arrived and not just that 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.930
 metal other leads has been airway and 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.670
 is that the concentration of lead in 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 potato of the high and middle areas of the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.090
 The mantaro river basin would be 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.360

 Producer who throws him on purpose but 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.260
 we know that our

 producers do not cast on purpose is the

 cultivate while in milk it should be 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.410
 to the contamination of the grasslands that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.080
 they are irrigated with the waters of the river

 meeting where we have called authorities 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.930
 to deliver the technical proposals 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.250
 that if we can elaborate but 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.600
 also the proposals of the society

 civilian is in 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.320
 to be able to implement them and we 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.320
 We are happy to support you
