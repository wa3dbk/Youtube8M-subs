00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:02.870
 we are visiting the famous 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.549
 Moscow artist and 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.169
 political and public 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:09.599
 actor Alekseev with glasses 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.450
 for search 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.989
 a few questions 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:13.929
 actually with the presidential election 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.720
 except Odessa is looking for a successor if they 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.619
 such candidates are not offered to us today 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 how is the Russian question ever 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.949
 Putin and Medvedev Kursk include 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.909
 let's say so ambiguously 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.579
 say Russian national 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.179
 patriotic community can 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.129
 nominate your candidate 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:32.770
 Presidents of Russia 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.199
 2 question that this is a very difficult time 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 to date 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.030
 ao 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.560
 Russian organizations Russian community 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.340
 and ripe to avoid their 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.210
 sermon president 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.360
 and if the witnesses question remains very 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.450
 few words 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.370
 because the leader of the nation is all the same 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.360
 the head is such a figure 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.600
 and a comprehensive peter are few nations unasur 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 was considered the biggest koshenko 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 for example because 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.910
 Now they are afraid of the Soviet 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.690
 as for the president 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.540
 only technical figures which 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.710
 chooses countries 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.900
 and here but Russian patriots are quite 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.789
 what that can come out 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.280
 total percentage 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.790
 she lived 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.390
 because it's hard to choose beat 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.120
 the leader 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.100
 the president's portal is easier to play because 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.260
 that it is not only about those who choose to 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.110
 four years 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.609
 what is it for the period from 15 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.379
 and where we can and for this we need 

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.439
 the subsidiary bonds principle 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.650
 there is 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 they could you voice the nominations 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.980
 who do you think 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.210
 become agreed by the Russian candidate 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 patriots 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.860
 according to today 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.150
 but the main thing is 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.620
 and only to the person who 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.480
 make such great things 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.890
 but rather 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.570
 lack of compromising 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.770
 the quality of this candidate 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.570
 by and large such people are five 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.590
 six weeks ago a few if the project 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.039
 generally 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.179
 of course 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.539
 Prosecutor Rogozin who showed himself 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.640
 from a good country 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 This is one of the first to have experience. 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.580
 State Administration Vrubel 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.939
 d 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.109
 the minister 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.629
 and someone else's state 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.909
 project security 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.379
 as soon as he showed himself 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.209
 consistent honest man 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.519
 if the author speaks say about these 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.640
 candidates but 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.270
 during interrogation state 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.379
 posts and 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.980
 quite these rotations now probably 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.559
 as candidate 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.429
 at the time of the LEDs 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.449
 probably not of two 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:37.089
 percentage of candidates whom I called 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:39.699
 danger to the gate is preferable 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.369
 it would be the world 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.029
 he as I have already said fully 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.999
 about work experience in state 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:46.939
 machine 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.119
 but he doesn't have any americans 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:51.430
 n from the side 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.430
 here's the community he's in sight he's publicly 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.919
 besides a series of races on 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.919
 appeals slogans and 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.109
 they are all clear 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.109
 her assessment of the actions 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.059
 talk about sharks soon 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.529
 who could be 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.579
 other candidates for the liquidation portal 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:12.069
 wait for 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.289
 you will not find 

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:16.579
 what changes can be expected in the country 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.429
 in case of coming to power, let's say 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.429
 real representatives of the people 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.729
 Well, firstly we are sure that we need 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.319
 associate professor see what we see now is 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.349
 condition to want 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.459
 fleet of course the percentage of people coming to 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.609
 the authorities have this system 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.039
 which is the significance of a penthouse 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.019
 now we need not a revolution 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.249
 evolution 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.399
 and so when I have to look for irkut 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.489
 negative head 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.109
 state it should be 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.499
 because then breaking facts drastically 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.699
 there's no point 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:53.820
 government 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.860
 subsequent question 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.810
 we have a union 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.110
 Sarah Belarus consequences of the accident 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.260
 if Russia is not only now 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.729
 must have been missing 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:05.849
 i think he 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.739
 basically any presidential candidate and 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.539
 especially when 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.199
 questions concerned organization therefore 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.969
 can be killed 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:16.099
 as a player declaration 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.910
 percent what is she 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.579
 host state 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.920
 presidential term 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.580
 he will invite the prime minister 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.509
 Alexander Turchinov 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.490
 because it is in our union state 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.300
 this person is having state experience in 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.720
 I want to emphasize management 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.280
 positive experience of state 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.229
 of management 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.939
 because of Belarus despite the fact that he 

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.120
 evening and the republic is exactly like that and therefore a 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.980
 of milk 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.229
 so general manager president 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.749
 offering executive 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:45.069
 directors a job 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:46.860
 dollar the best goalscore not pick 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.849
 can 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.879
 reversible will move 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.849
 about this year economy 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.080
 between our children about wild pledges 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.819
 capitalism 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.719
 percentage so the development of socialism 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.120
 which is now the people of Belarus 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.530
 as soon as they have such a good form 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.979
 of life 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.520
 Here's how to collapse, but this device is it 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.539
 will give most of the population of Russia all 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.669
 still Rosatom of freedom because we have 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:12.610
 coming now 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.620
 and the complete separation of the poor 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.870
 and rich 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.349
 and more and more this gap 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.379
 and but I think that this is one of the first 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.099
 also what should the second do 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.529
 agreed that we have 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.409
 international relationships 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.509
 here and here we do not pay fast 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.539
 height development the question is so simple 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.779
 afraid of prokopenko appendage of america not 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.369
 today tomorrow we and our armed forces 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.889
 we will use successes as 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.999
 cannon fodder to nato their soldiers 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:42.599
 last car 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.009
 the process of revolution 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.550
 these things of course 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.940
 and everything seems to be in principle but if new everywhere 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.180
 written and if it is not necessary 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.400
 on any estimates very tightly communicate 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:57.280
 so I think that 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.250
 unlike today's government 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.279
 there must be a percentage 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:04.749
 management of such a composition sense 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:06.159
 with normal 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.919
 in the hike state 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.919
 to this problem i think that 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.729
 Boris Mironov 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.249
 with this task 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.249
 cope in principle 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:19.749
 the scale of his personality is quite about 

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:20.249
 according
