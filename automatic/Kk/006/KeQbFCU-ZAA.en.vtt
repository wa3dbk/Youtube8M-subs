almost doing a wall set but your legs
are<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:34.870> to<00:00:34.929> be<00:00:35.050> out<00:00:35.170> way<00:00:35.379> further<00:00:35.710> so<00:00:36.639> you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
are going to be out way further so you

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.729

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that all together we're going to get in

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.370 
that all together we're going to get in
that<00:02:38.980> posture<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> try<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.450> with

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
that posture I'm going to try it with

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.650 
that posture I'm going to try it with
our<00:02:41.650> lower<00:02:42.040> body<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.520> upper<00:02:42.880> body<00:02:43.060> combined
