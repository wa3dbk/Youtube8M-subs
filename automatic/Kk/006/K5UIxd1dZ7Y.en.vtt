00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.070
 for villegas friend that you will tell me the week more to return and return here 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.910
 we are today with a very interesting protagonist because he is going to give us some 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 of the keys that are going to be able to make us understand what it is that is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.730
 happening nowadays our society he is a grenadian who graduated in 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.769
 medicine and specialized in psychiatry specifically in the whole subject 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.770
 of depressions of anxiety and personality disorders 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.250
 reasons that have made him worthy of numerous recognitions in our 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.340
 country and also outside our borders is doctor enrique rojas and 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.400
 we have come to your consultation to talk to him and decipher some of 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.390
 the enigmas of this very complicated thing that we have here in our 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.930
 head that is the translator mind 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.270
 thank you very much for receiving us that we only talked about everything with great pleasure 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.630
 that cause the serious upsets of this thing so complicated that what 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.990
 denounce 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.320
 forgetting to say that almost everything is covered 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 almost everything is hosted reside 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.570
 the lava pieces of the mind worked were the ecological treasures 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.730
 may have two origins, an exogenous origin 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.530
 that comes from outside and in origin then that comes well biochemical disorder 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.020
 what comes from outside can be very complicated it can be 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.720
 percent encrym cis economic crisis hundred 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.760
 percent with the children with the woman with the husband with oneself against 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.700
 august with his person 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.110
 there are two types of exogenous actors that are the macro traumas 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.030
 emotional impacts 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.170
 very hard min 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.340
 that in man and woman are different until very recently 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.760
 in women it is especially sensitive to their affective actions 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.950
 and relatives 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.850
 and man is especially sensitive to this celebration, nomic and professional and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.620
 for starting a path 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.780
 exogenous 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 and the micro traumas that are tiny little things 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.670
 relatively low important but forming 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.440
 a mosaic of factors 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.360
 we have not exogenous from outside and then there is what from within that is 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.960
 biochemical alterations 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.899
 an example of this would be endogenous depression 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.179
 for the italy 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.969
 which is biochemistry to what it responds so much allows it to be perfectly cured 90% and 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.219
 the exogenous depressions that it sells out that has a more prognosis 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:22.749
 uncertain by the complexity of factors that occur within it we talk about the 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:23.549
 repression 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.089
 and you say goodbye to depression like that with a joy presley box office 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.439
 in this book of zamora same as saying goodbye to depression 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.029
 good of weights 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.029
 It is a tunnel 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.029
 I would say is a tunnel of blurred melancholy 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:42.209
 where apathy melancholy will appear sadness in the absence of use the lack 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.069
 of desire 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.829
 also memories appear 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.329
 negative is to say appear memories wrapped in feelings of guilt 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.079
 in endogenous depression 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.919
 we say goodbye with pharmacotherapy 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.189
 the firpo and the medication 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.669
 takes almost all the depressions to large but we also have 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.669
 Transmit 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.379
 the new ones that is denial or can adorn the person can not come 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.769
 delegation has side effects but if he psychiatrist handles the 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.020
 medication correctly 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.019
 the success 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.969
 I must not say that he is almost insured 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.909
 in addition to medication 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.909
 there are several factors that we manage more there that are 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.249
 drugs 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.340
 what to avoid relapse what we hope to call with a certain license 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.409
 per hundred of language antidepressant vaccines existing in the market 4 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.399
 5 very hippie effective 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.739
 or two new methods that are 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.129
 I repeat the details are what are the magnificent transcranial stimulator 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.729
 mechanics that apply the brain and correct prison 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.479
 that sends us with drugs 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.099
 the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve
