00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.259
 be something more complicated since each 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.900
 model of phone or tablet had a 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.820
 specific way to be rooted without 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.520

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 once you finish the installation it 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.010
 desktop of your computer and it will open 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.409
 the program interface where yes

 You can read some things in English 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.390
 As indicated, we must connect the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 phone on to the computer using 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.039
 our usb cable you must remember that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.500
 you must also have activated the 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.000
 debug usb of your device since 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.110
 without this configuration you will not be able 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.390
 proceed to rooted itself 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.880
 once the program has recognized your 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.130
 device will show you the root option 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.070
 on the green button on the bottom 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.440
 right of the interface click on it 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.160
 and the rooting process will start from 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.160
 automatic way 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.280
 When the process has finished the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.290
 program will show you that it has been rooted 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 correctly 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.020
 click on the complete button and close 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.939
 the program 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.850
 your tablet phone should already be 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.520
 rooted however let's check it 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.760
 As you can see in the device, there must be 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.800
 installed three new applications the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.930
 first blue and that is also 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.300
 completely in Chinese is a manager of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.130
 internal memory of the device 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.600
 second that is also in Chinese in its 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.090
 releasing ram 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.230
 both apps can be eliminated without 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.290
 no problem 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.360
 finally the third application receives 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.019
 the name of kim yu being is the well-known 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.000
 by all as superuser from it 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.610
 we can manage the applications that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.640
 request access to the root of your 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.310
 device 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.920
 this last application should be 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.770
 enough to know we have access 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.780
 root however we can go to 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.240
 google play and proceed to the download 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.220
 installation of the root application 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.530
 checker which is totally free 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 I already have it installed so I'm going 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.550
 to open it 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.290
 and if we click on the first option 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.800
 will proceed to check if we have access 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 root or not, if so, a message will appear 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.870
 congratulating us on our root access 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.670
 good friends, as you can see, it's pretty 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.710
 simple and certainly deserves the 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.320
 shame because we can enjoy 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.780
 numerous advantages I hope that this 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.550
