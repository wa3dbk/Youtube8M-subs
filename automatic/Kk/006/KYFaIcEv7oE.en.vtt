 It's getting tough and it's still a result 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.230
 It stopped in the place of saying 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.530

 Manakana does not have good results 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 Say residual dispute 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.420
 It is Tan continued uphill battle 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:02.240
 It was hard for us too 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.240
 I think the welfare section and it is good without giving up until the end 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 Because it directed me 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.850
 I lost today but in the result of mature 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 I think it may be connected 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.100
 KoiBanTatsuki is a player was ever season you tired of 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:25.520
 First of all , please tell us what you think of this season 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:31.210
 Well , I feel very sorry that I end up fighting the residue until the end, but somehow 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:36.310
 It is possible that it will remain and will fight again in the j league after next year somehow 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.310
 As a team level up, it is possible to promote more glass than the next season 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.530
 Ummm 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:47.000
 I would like to be a team, and in any situation I must use this voice to the end 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:53.630
 I am really grateful to the supporters who supported me 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.060
 To meet in the support or feeling that doing become servants or even the next fiscal year and beyond desperate

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.860
 I towards the supporters 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.590
 I did not do the most sad thing 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.730
 I think there is more fun than that 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.190
 I think that my best was fair copy from the teeth 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:29.920
 Also it was almost all played Hattori's own season game 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.380
 I wonder if I have fought this season with feelings like this 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.910
 Anyway for the team Think about what you can do to get the team a little 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.920
 Enemy Tan doing 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.890
 I think that it was good that the place where you finally got the winning points like today is that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.970
 I still have to hit a missing place 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.870
 The place has a lot to improve 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.120
