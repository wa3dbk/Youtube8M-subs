00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.089
 good morning friends i am rubÃ©n and 17 and 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.180
 we are in a new career go to 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.260
 5 online with subscribers exactly 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.700
 there you have seen that they are subscribers 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.460
 because any theme of the race 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.380
 have to be pushing me and I take the 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.790
 point is worth and took the point wait 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.490
 because it almost does not deserve me to the best 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.590
 it's worth reappearing let's see if I'm going to 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.170
 to turn here in plan or we go the one of 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.400
 today of course yes because I say with such and 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.790
 where was the point would have appeared 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.890
 above the barrel is how it is said 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.410
 gasoline and something because it would have been worse 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.060
 but well let's see let's see for 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.360
 what am I in fourth place already starts already 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.060
 pretty bad like this all over the face since 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.220
 this of the last we are going to see and for 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.750
 true he was guarding he has to say he 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.250
 has put by day but I do not know why 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.680
 demons it looks like it's 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.390
 cloudy the opposite is made clear and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.430
 it looks like it's like a light like that 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.630
 going to fall a rib you know 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.630
 it's not worth we're going to see 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:01.310
 if for a position or game where is it 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.620
 around here it's worth 8 goals go, yes, sir 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.610
 we passed the first one and I have put 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.820
 first I do not think so 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.770
 I do not believe it, I put it first. 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.470
 the first people passed by and I put on 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.540
 first there goes to the room if you have not 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.160
 ahead of all others that I have 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.260
 one behind that as I do not pass it now 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.710
 the first one again so I'll have 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.110
 problems but good let's see 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 if there were two like two laps by the way 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.490
 ok I do not remember where the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.800
 race so I do not know when the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.380
 second round let's see but good 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.600
 receiving 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.509
 I'm not going back, so I guess that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.740
 over here will be the entrance the second 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.869
 back let's see how many points I 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.399
 they are thus effectively what said 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 It is worth the second round begins 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.170
 now let's go there so let's see this 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.960
 Now you 're going to see us the first time 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.460
 obviously because I do not have anyone and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.770
 judelin serious to him I did not expect it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.149
 I did not know what the first one was 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.429
 why everyone has cost him 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.079
 quite what and in fact is that only the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.970
 happens to one immediately after it is 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.340
 who was behind because the rest was 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 had still been there either or 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.149
 let's see if it doubles any 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.580
 that it would be going we think 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.959
 surprising either I think that you should already 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.640
 be the experience of the 10,000 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.310
 damn spirals of those that I've done 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 I'm fed up and I've already had them 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 like nothing 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.870
 Let's see does not seem that I will not walk 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.069
 to bend nobody are all 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.010
 and let's see 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.989
 eye does not exploited uncle also exploits 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.660
 the car with a fucking beak to whom 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:43.260
 will advance what the hell what the hell 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.780
 and hell there was a point up and 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.850
 I keep myself first let's go yes sir now 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.390
 and yes I can give the race for 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.740
 nothing seems that he did not pass it on so 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.240
 there was a point above that I had not seen 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.060
 I thought we had to do everything 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.040
 pull but that point is referenced 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.320
 top of diego nin udinese and flip back 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.420
 Well nothing first since 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.030
 practically assured me already because the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 next goes to 14 seconds that is 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.980
 took life and more and I think that I with 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.450
 this I have the race done because 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.850
 I should lose 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.990
 a lot of time so that for me 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.900
 advanced in something that will not happen 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.780
 so 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.730
 great I'm going to take him the first place and 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.250
 the spiral that the truth does not always that 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.430
 people do not seem to me extremely 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.140
 difficult the first time not stretching anything 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.090
 but the first one I rate it the first 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.480
 and the second as you can see has not 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.040
 cost much better, so be it 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.659
 I have all the first place guys 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.220
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.129
 little runs and so you can leave a 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.569
 very great there if you liked it and this 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.500
 is the last one that I imagine wants to enter 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.450
 now in the second round I do not know or 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.590
 the best is the first no no second 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.629
 back not because I had not doubled 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.799
 nobody is not clear that this is the 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.750
 end of the of these in the end already 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.340
 it's slightly forward so good 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.689
 you already know that continue to participate what is 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.909
 said you have my registered below 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:10.819
