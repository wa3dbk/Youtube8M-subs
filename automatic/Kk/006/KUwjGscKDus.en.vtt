whenever Marquez bought paki I think I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.770 
whenever Marquez bought paki I think I
should<00:00:11.160> slow<00:00:11.340> down<00:00:11.370> if<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.880> won<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> fight<00:00:12.360> you

what do you really do like what it gets

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.900 
what do you really do like what it gets
rhythm<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.800> might<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> paki<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.670> look

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

good<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> bite<00:00:18.510> but<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.500> think<00:00:19.920> Tim<00:00:20.730> Bradley

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
good that bite but I think Tim Bradley

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.970 
good that bite but I think Tim Bradley
if<00:00:21.270> he<00:00:21.420> isn't<00:00:21.689> he<00:00:22.260> isn't<00:00:22.500> doing<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
if he isn't he isn't doing at the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.009 
if he isn't he isn't doing at the
Technic<00:00:23.340> punishment<00:00:24.029> against<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.420> preventive

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
Technic punishment against a preventive

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.980 
Technic punishment against a preventive
called<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.410> PMI<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.460> work<00:00:26.670> Marquez<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.810> if

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
called it PMI at work Marquez but if

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
called it PMI at work Marquez but if
Marquez<00:00:28.289> catch<00:00:28.590> them<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> time<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
Marquez catch them with at that time and

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.840 
Marquez catch them with at that time and
he<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:30.859> musta<00:00:31.859> period<00:00:32.160> almost<00:00:32.279> everybody<00:00:32.790> in

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
he has musta period almost everybody in

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.880 
he has musta period almost everybody in
the<00:00:32.940> game<00:00:33.090> South<00:00:33.420> Floyd<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.710> he

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the game South Floyd then I think he

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.200 
the game South Floyd then I think he
could<00:00:35.040> catch<00:00:35.219> Tim<00:00:35.520> Bradley<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.880> put<00:00:36.030> him<00:00:36.120> out

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
could catch Tim Bradley and put him out

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.030 
could catch Tim Bradley and put him out
but<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> then<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:37.020> Tim<00:00:37.200> Bradley<00:00:37.410> when<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
but and then I think Tim Bradley when I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
but and then I think Tim Bradley when I
working<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:39.840> Bradley

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
working so I'm have to go with Bradley

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:51.000 
working so I'm have to go with Bradley
but<00:00:40.850> bookmark<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:44.270> always<00:00:45.270> has<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> way<00:00:45.539> of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.480 

so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:13.040 

our<00:00:54.850> case
