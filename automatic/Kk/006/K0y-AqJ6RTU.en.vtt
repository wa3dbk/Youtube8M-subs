00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.130
 here the fire is off I go 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.130
 put a box of condensed milk 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.780
 I'll put it here too I left 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.850
 separated a spoonful of butter and 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.850
 Even butter is not margarine you 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.270
 can by margarine too and I think 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.420
 I put two tablespoons of chocolate is the 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.149
 mine is 50% so in your income if you 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.650
 put the powdered chocolate which is a 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.810
 little weaker 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.930
 you put three spoons and it was cocoa in 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.880
 powder 50% chocolate 50% 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.440
 You only put two because he's strong. 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.780
 Fire is off 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.290
 this is like a brigadier like 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.810
 chocolate already cold I even changed the pan 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.540
 What I did is pass in the sieve is 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.480
 secular because it has been sifted to 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.489
 be more lighthearted as you go 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.770
 to sell you spend the first 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.369
 also because this is a technique 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.770
 much updated from brigadier 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.600
 gourmet that always gives a burn 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
 Even if you touch it, we always stay. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.560
 sleep you pass on the first will stay 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.140
 great 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.990
 here I have more or less 1 100 grams 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.010
 chocolate you can put - a little 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.729
 more 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.290
 I'm putting more August because 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.400
 you put too much also ends up having 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.390
 loss 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.159
 My client is cold remembering that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.740
 that if it is hot of course it will melt 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.909
 All chocolate and you're ready. 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.170
 our chocolate stroganoff 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.350
 remembering that this too can be 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 served in a spoonful easter egg which the 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:52.229
 next year I'm sure this video that 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.229
 will bomb ready our 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.480
 to make it even better here 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.220
 side has white chocolate powder there you go 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.410
 decorating the subject 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.930
 if you want too if you do not want to just 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.390
 places a grain to the piece itself 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.090
 Chocolate is not, instead of you. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.920
 I'm doing but you can what is 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.920
 blended white chocolate with 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.250
 chocolate in the cereal 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.770
 Can you do this here, how can I do it? 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.870
 It's for my house, I can put the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.720
 chocolate on top also to the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.640
 problem is the case, home, will you? 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.310
 do it the way you want to put 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.340
 a little bit of white chocolate until the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.750
 highlight is a very cool thing and if 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.080
 You can even put a cherry 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.600
 Look how beautiful it looks, it's ready 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.600
 Help them feed their chocolate
