00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello girls find themselves for a 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.190
 new video we bet a video 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 on leaves so worries havana of 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 at dior 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 the golden jungle as could see 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.150
 here so it's a nail polish of a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.790
 crocodile effect nexer with a varnish 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.970
 golden and a khaki varnish so the price of 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.199
 which is about 30 euros so that's 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 seems very expensive at home with you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320
 it's very expensive but I watched the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.120
 price of a varnish individually and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.949
 German institutes these 20 euros the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.070
 polish so we can tell ourselves that we 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.140
 of them so it makes us pay 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.660
 cheaper so the last ones can 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.339
 be worn of course separately to the kop 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:55.860
 in these two varnishes the golden lantern and 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:01:02.010
 the unions that the references are 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:08.659
 here then there is the 148 is the walleye 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.659
 is there for the cac who knows the 608 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.060
 here we go wehrli trilogies 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.330
 a lot to give a little notice 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.190
 Here is there that explains to 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.060
 first lay a layer of the latter 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.380
 here nathan about two minutes but 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.120
 really at the maximum it is not necessary that this 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.970
 be dry and then apply a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.260
 girl a thin layer of it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 to wait a little bit and then 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.640
 to apply top coat so not at the top 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.270
 I took this one is a top coat that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 I just bought 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.890
 so this is sally hansen brand 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.120
 so this is a bonus game to which 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.190
 is interesting because it's a base 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.530
 and at the same time a top coat one can 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.570
 use before the polish or after to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.760
 that they are brighter and that's 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 so there I will not use basic because 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.150
 the saleswoman told me that it does not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.160
 did not work with a base 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.680
 so I started by applying the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:05.280
 last golden the supporting song 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:08.780
 serves just to look nice so that you 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.780
 wonder what the brush looks 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.220
 that's quite magical 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.810
 already I will apply the golden varnish 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.330
 so house only on a little bit happened 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.540
 since I had made the gel for my 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.540
 wedding 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.690
 a cross I'm applying my guy is in 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.489
 do I wipe I 'm going to be their edge I'm 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.850
 put at the base of my I do little 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.920
 movements like that and then I come back 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.760
 here is to catch up and to me 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.760
 bring closer to my side 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.840
 that's not going to the edge I'm going 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.939
 not up to the edge because I find 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.549
 that after that it overflows and its terraces 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.040
 not very clean it not look pretty so 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.900
 of course before you do your polish if 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.719
 you want the rendering to look pretty 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.430
 have to push nice little tulle but that's it 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:11.409
 did not hesitate to limay your nails for 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:11.409
 that it is the form that you desire and 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.090
 on the run 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.590
 so that's what it gives with the vrd 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.439
 golden now i'm going to apply the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:43.400
 khaki so I shake it too before 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:45.409
 apply it and I'm going to apply a 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.609
 thin layer so fashion told me if we 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.900
 wanted quite fine scales 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.989
 to apply a thin layer and if you 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.859
 want thicker scales 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.780
 to apply a thicker layer 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.180
 so she told me that the polish that is 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.129
 below we can use any 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.290
 what varnish of dior products actually 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.639
 the product that will act is when the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.079
 verdict she who will meet each other 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.970
 apparently produced there are principles 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.739
 assets which it creates this effect there 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.980
 and so it works with every Monday 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.980
 dior 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:21.760
 I take a little bit I'm the edges and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.760
 then apply 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.990
 do not apply finely on the little finger 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.260
 I will do the same and especially 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.260
 nails 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.889
 on the run 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.480
 here I applied the khaki good game but 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.480
 wait for it to make its effect 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.440
 so that's almost done it's 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.800
 at drying that facts start to 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.700
 arrive 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.170
 personally I find it very very 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.610
 pretty I think it's rather 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.620
 class I do not think it's like 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.960
 the creative cameron crackle varnish is 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.150
 very nice but I think it's 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.610
 much less classy than this one I 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.140
 find it really very pretty if not 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.630
 I had seen because there the prize game is 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.250
 rather expensive I had seen on the internet 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.290
 seems to me that these bourgeois powder is 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.760
 than the sheikh who in varnish who 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.740
 is called python effect but what does 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.590
 that he would do a little that effect was 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.570
 more Bordeaux color by guy must be 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.890
 much cheaper so that's what she 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.040
 will be that I 'll apply the polish 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.040
 transparent 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:23.340
 so here I think we have the result 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.400
 final so here frankly I 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:31.400
 find it super nice I'm really 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.400
 super nice stuff fan
