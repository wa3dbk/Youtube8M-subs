here's another Packer that I ordered
can't<00:03:19.599> really<00:03:19.719> remember<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.650> had<00:03:20.769> some<00:03:20.950> weird

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
can't really remember it had some weird

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.020 
can't really remember it had some weird
names<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:22.049> nice<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.560> go<00:03:24.459> get<00:03:24.640> them<00:03:24.790> and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.070 

so<00:03:30.740> I<00:03:30.800> don't<00:03:30.980> really<00:03:31.130> know<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.580> true<00:03:31.970> names<00:03:32.870> of
