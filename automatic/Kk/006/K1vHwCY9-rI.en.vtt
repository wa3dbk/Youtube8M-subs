00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.210 

so<00:00:00.420> my<00:00:00.840> question<00:00:01.290> for<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.740> about<00:00:02.040> this

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so my question for you is about this

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.370 
so my question for you is about this
idea<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.610> letting<00:00:02.790> go<00:00:02.939> of<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.149> oars<00:00:03.350> because<00:00:04.350> I

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
idea of letting go of the oars because I

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.570 
idea of letting go of the oars because I
find<00:00:05.009> for<00:00:05.279> me<00:00:05.460> it's<00:00:06.029> I<00:00:06.980> find<00:00:07.980> myself<00:00:08.220> more

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
find for me it's I find myself more

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.450 
find for me it's I find myself more
focused<00:00:09.090> when<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.269> have<00:00:09.510> goals<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.250> when<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.280> am

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
focused when I have goals and when I am

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.799 
focused when I have goals and when I am
more<00:00:14.460> focused<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:14.940> more<00:00:15.030> in<00:00:15.210> control<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.599> what

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
more focused and more in control of what

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.380 
more focused and more in control of what
I'm<00:00:15.929> creating<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.789> letting<00:00:17.789> go<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> oars

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
I'm creating and letting go the oars

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.800 
I'm creating and letting go the oars
like<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.650> back<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.039> forth<00:00:20.279> between<00:00:20.810> letting

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
like I go back and forth between letting

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.800 
like I go back and forth between letting
things<00:00:21.990> happen<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.590> being<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.100> action<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
things happen and being in action and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.630 
things happen and being in action and
like<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:24.990> example<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.560> my<00:00:26.099> desk<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.609> work

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
like one example is my desk at work

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.679 
like one example is my desk at work
seems<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.660> continually<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:29.090> out<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.420> control

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
seems to continually get out of control

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810 
seems to continually get out of control
with<00:00:30.960> paperwork<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.669> managing<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.700> time

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
with paperwork and managing my time

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.500 
with paperwork and managing my time
managing<00:00:33.600> my<00:00:33.719> paperwork<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> letting<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
managing my paperwork so letting go the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
managing my paperwork so letting go the
oars<00:00:36.660> feels<00:00:37.559> like<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> worst<00:00:37.980> thing<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.370> could

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
oars feels like the worst thing I could

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.030 
oars feels like the worst thing I could
do<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.899> feels<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> paperwork<00:00:40.829> will

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
do it just feels like the paperwork will

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
do it just feels like the paperwork will
continue<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> stack<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.629> I'll<00:00:42.960> forget<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
continue to stack up and I'll forget to

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369 
continue to stack up and I'll forget to
pay<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> bill<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.690> forget<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.809> return<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.110> phone

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
pay a bill or forget to return a phone

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.029 
pay a bill or forget to return a phone
call<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:47.360> well<00:00:48.360> let's<00:00:48.600> let<00:00:48.989> us<00:00:49.140> tell<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.710> what

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
call so well let's let us tell you what

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.090 
call so well let's let us tell you what
we<00:00:50.219> mean<00:00:50.809> about<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> orphan<00:00:55.010> there's<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
we mean about the orphan there's a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.340 
we mean about the orphan there's a
difference<00:00:56.699> between<00:00:58.070> using<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.430> oar<00:01:00.350> to

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
difference between using an oar to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.289 
difference between using an oar to
subtly<00:01:04.350> guide<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> direction<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.820> something

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
subtly guide the direction of something

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.609 
subtly guide the direction of something
and<00:01:06.530> use<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.970> make<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.810> power<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.380> makes

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and use it to make the power that makes

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.060 
and use it to make the power that makes
the<00:01:10.890> boat<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:12.229> so<00:01:13.400> most<00:01:14.400> people<00:01:14.700> don't

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
the boat go so most people don't

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.270 
the boat go so most people don't
remember<00:01:17.070> or<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.380> about<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.009> power

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
remember or don't know about the power

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.240 
remember or don't know about the power
of<00:01:20.490> Attraction<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.960> don't<00:01:22.170> remember<00:01:22.770> who

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
of Attraction they don't remember who

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.340 
of Attraction they don't remember who
they<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.990> power<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.189> energy<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
they are and the power of the energy and

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.249 
they are and the power of the energy and
so<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:29.250> try<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.909> their<00:01:30.210> effort<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:30.990> their

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so they try to use their effort or their

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.120 
so they try to use their effort or their
action<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:33.720> provide<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.290> energy<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.890> makes

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
action to provide the energy that makes

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
action to provide the energy that makes
it<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:36.200> rather<00:01:37.200> than<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:38.460> select<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.200> more

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it go rather than to select the more

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.600 
it go rather than to select the more
subtle<00:01:41.030> details<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.450> where<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.229> going<00:01:43.610> we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
subtle details of where it's going we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
subtle details of where it's going we
think<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.149> there's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.420> misunderstanding

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
think that there's a misunderstanding

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.350 
think that there's a misunderstanding
for<00:01:46.530> most<00:01:46.740> people<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.399> maybe<00:01:47.880> even<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.329> little

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
for most people and maybe even a little

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.760 
for most people and maybe even a little
with<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.869> too<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:50.930> when<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> remember<00:01:52.560> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
with you too that when you remember that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.660 
with you too that when you remember that
the<00:01:53.430> three<00:01:53.700> steps<00:01:54.060> are<00:01:54.329> ask<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.500> life<00:01:56.159> causes

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
the three steps are ask and life causes

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840 
the three steps are ask and life causes
you<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.770> when<00:01:58.770> when<00:01:59.670> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
you to do that and that when when you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.999 
you to do that and that when when you
ask<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:01.189> send<00:02:02.570> this<00:02:03.570> vibrational<00:02:04.409> rocket

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
ask you send this vibrational rocket

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
ask you send this vibrational rocket
that<00:02:05.689> joins<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.259> other<00:02:07.560> rockets<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.610> you've

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
that joins the other rockets that you've

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.180 
that joins the other rockets that you've
already<00:02:09.149> sent<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.709> some<00:02:11.160> were

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
already sent there and that some were

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.400 
already sent there and that some were
there<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:12.540> that's<00:02:12.720> who<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
there just because that's who you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.080 
there just because that's who you
and<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:14.250> law<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.700> attraction<00:02:15.620> causes<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and that law of attraction causes the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
and that law of attraction causes the
gathering<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.420> co-operative<00:02:18.870> components

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
gathering of the co-operative components

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.130 
gathering of the co-operative components
and<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.490> what<00:02:20.700> causes<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.420> stream<00:02:21.840> to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and that is what causes the stream to

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.640 
and that is what causes the stream to
move<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:24.030> you've<00:02:24.600> forgotten<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.320> part

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
move but if you've forgotten that part

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.560 
move but if you've forgotten that part
or<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> don't<00:02:26.130> remember<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.640> part<00:02:27.120> then

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
or you don't remember that part then

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.320 
or you don't remember that part then
somehow<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.710> have<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> idea<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.880> you<00:02:30.090> have

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
somehow you have the idea that you have

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.870 
somehow you have the idea that you have
to<00:02:30.510> make<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.900> stream<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:32.850> have

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
to make the stream you have to you have

that's really that's really the we we

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
have never been advocates of non action

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.000 
have never been advocates of non action
we<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.580> action<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.360> delicious<00:03:03.780> thing

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010

we think action is a delicious thing
what<00:03:05.010> we're<00:03:05.250> advocating<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.180> getting<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
what we're advocating is getting the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.580 
what we're advocating is getting the
vortex<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:07.500> clean<00:03:07.800> up<00:03:07.950> your<00:03:08.100> desk<00:03:09.590> get

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
vortex and then clean up your desk get

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.340 
vortex and then clean up your desk get
in<00:03:10.710> the<00:03:10.800> vortex<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.580> then<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.270> then<00:03:12.750> set<00:03:13.110> your

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
in the vortex and then and then set your

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500 
in the vortex and then and then set your
schedule<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:14.010> into<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.310> vortex<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:15.060> then

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
schedule get into the vortex and then

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.590 
schedule get into the vortex and then
fire<00:03:15.840> follow<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.650> inspired<00:03:17.190> action<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:18.360> say

fire follow the inspired action you say
this<00:03:19.410> isn't<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.830> conversation<00:03:20.160> about<00:03:20.760> action

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
this isn't a conversation about action
