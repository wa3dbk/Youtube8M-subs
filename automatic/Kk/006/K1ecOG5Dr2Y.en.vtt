00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
more more complexity to house for the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560 
more more complexity to house for the
work<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.430> basically<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.120> gonna<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.300> kind<00:00:33.510> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
work so basically it's gonna be kind of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.020 
work so basically it's gonna be kind of
it's<00:00:34.110> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.460> combo

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's kind of going to be like a combo

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.119 
it's kind of going to be like a combo
systems<00:00:36.600> what's<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> happen<00:00:37.380> as<00:00:37.559> far<00:00:38.010> as

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
systems what's going to happen as far as

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430 
systems what's going to happen as far as

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you know it's a little bit not a little

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
you know it's a little bit not a little
bit<00:00:54.539> more<00:00:54.719> difficult<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:56.149> execute

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bit more difficult to to execute

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
bit more difficult to to execute
thundery<00:00:57.570> unknown<00:00:57.899> thunders<00:00:58.260> point<00:00:58.500> cheap

thundery unknown thunders point cheap

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.049 
thundery unknown thunders point cheap
move<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.460> making<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:00:59.940> more

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
move so making a little bit more

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
move so making a little bit more
difficult<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.780> execute<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.680> definitely<00:01:02.219> worth

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
difficult to execute is definitely worth

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
difficult to execute is definitely worth
it<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> return<00:01:03.449> guys<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.470> you're<00:01:04.710> able<00:01:04.860> to

execute it without dodging it he can

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
execute it without dodging it he can
keep<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.070> could<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> again<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.750> we

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
keep he could actually do it again so we

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
keep he could actually do it again so we
can<00:01:09.990> hit<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> may<00:01:10.740> hit<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.159> again<00:01:11.310> it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to be even harder so basically the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.850 
going to be even harder so basically the
more<00:01:15.060> times<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> hit<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.259> harder<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.770> more

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
more times you hit the harder and more

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.410 
more times you hit the harder and more
powerful<00:01:17.220> gets<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.180> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
powerful gets it then we can also you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
powerful gets it then we can also you
can<00:01:18.600> do<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> end<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.920> class<00:01:19.979> who

maybe there's a violation here so at the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.090 
maybe there's a violation here so at the
end<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> month<00:01:30.990> Pikachu<00:01:31.439> hit<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> him<00:01:31.920> enough

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460 
times I guess then he Pikachu uses his
tail<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.799> you'll<00:01:35.430> hit<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.880> ox<00:01:36.090> ml<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.630> Mike<00:01:37.259> I

don't<00:01:37.590> believe<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.950> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.340> his

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
don't believe this is going to be his

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.789 
don't believe this is going to be his
final<00:01:38.759> smash<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.540> too<00:01:40.140> powerful<00:01:40.350> move

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
final smash but it's too powerful move

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.440 
final smash but it's too powerful move
it's<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.250> basically<00:01:41.430> never<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.270> we

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
it's going to be basically never have we

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960 
it's going to be basically never have we
had<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.869> um<00:01:43.250> what<00:01:44.250> seemed<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.579> little<00:01:44.729> little

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
had that um what seemed a little little

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270 
had that um what seemed a little little
mac<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.450> ultra<00:01:46.049> powerful<00:01:46.380> move<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.979> looks

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
mac that ultra powerful move that looks

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
mac that ultra powerful move that looks
kind<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.640> cheap<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.600> probably<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.380> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
kind of cheap this is probably going to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
kind of cheap this is probably going to
have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> similar<00:01:49.950> mechanic<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.939> execute

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
have a similar mechanic if you execute

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.240 
have a similar mechanic if you execute
it<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.990> execute<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.619> perfectly<00:01:53.040> you're

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it if you execute this perfectly you're

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.399 
it if you execute this perfectly you're
gonna<00:01:53.369> you're<00:01:53.939> gonna<00:01:54.030> knock<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.899> of

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
gonna you're gonna knock them out out of

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
gonna you're gonna knock them out out of
the<00:01:55.560> game<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.640> probably

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
the game you know so that's probably

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
the game you know so that's probably
what<00:01:57.270> they're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.930> hopefully

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
what they're going to do here hopefully

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.149 
what they're going to do here hopefully
