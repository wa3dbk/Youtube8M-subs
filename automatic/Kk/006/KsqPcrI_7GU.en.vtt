00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.369 
Charon orbit a common center of gravity
so<00:02:51.879> I<00:02:51.909> guess<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.359> could<00:02:52.510> call<00:02:52.689> it<00:02:52.750> a<00:02:52.959> double

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
so I guess you could call it a double

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.589 
so I guess you could call it a double

I<00:03:20.340> think<00:03:21.340> I've<00:03:21.489> in<00:03:21.700> Pluto<00:03:23.970> okay<00:03:24.970> let's<00:03:25.329> see

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
I think I've in Pluto okay let's see

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.349 
I think I've in Pluto okay let's see
what<00:03:25.540> people<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.139> street<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.859> say<00:03:27.359> no

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
what people on the street have to say no

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.589 
what people on the street have to say no
oh<00:03:28.659> definitely<00:03:29.500> definitely<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.909> yes<00:03:31.329> I

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
oh definitely definitely a yes I

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.030 
oh definitely definitely a yes I
definitely<00:03:31.750> think

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
definitely think

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.850 
definitely think
I<00:03:33.129> believe<00:03:33.760> they<00:03:33.969> baited<00:03:34.719> and<00:03:34.870> they<00:03:35.439> said<00:03:35.709> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
I believe they baited and they said it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.890 
I believe they baited and they said it
is<00:03:35.890> now<00:03:36.189> a<00:03:36.219> planet<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.000> I'll<00:03:37.209> go<00:03:37.359> with<00:03:37.480> general

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
is now a planet so I'll go with general

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.000 
is now a planet so I'll go with general

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
consensus no Pluto is not a planet I've

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.339 
consensus no Pluto is not a planet I've
long<00:03:42.519> believed<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.390> far<00:03:43.750> before<00:03:43.989> the

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
long believed that far before the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.369 
long believed that far before the
experts<00:03:45.250> came<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.239> with<00:03:46.420> that<00:03:46.569> solution<00:03:47.049> as

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
experts came up with that solution as

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.429 
experts came up with that solution as
well<00:03:47.620> it's<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.549> rock<00:03:48.879> it's<00:03:49.209> flying<00:03:49.540> around<00:03:49.959> it's

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
well it's a rock it's flying around it's

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.250 
well it's a rock it's flying around it's
way<00:03:50.769> beyond<00:03:51.310> all<00:03:51.609> the<00:03:51.760> gas<00:03:51.970> giants<00:03:52.689> doesn't

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
way beyond all the gas giants doesn't

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.990 
way beyond all the gas giants doesn't
make<00:03:53.379> sense<00:03:53.590> for<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.220> there<00:03:54.459> it's<00:03:54.849> just

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
make sense for it to be there it's just

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.460 
make sense for it to be there it's just
another<00:03:55.209> thing<00:03:55.510> flying<00:03:55.870> around<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.260> solar

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
another thing flying around the solar

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.460 
another thing flying around the solar
system<00:03:56.980> yeah<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:58.180> should<00:03:58.659> stay<00:03:58.930> at<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.109> planet

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
system yeah it should stay at the planet

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.530 
system yeah it should stay at the planet
they've<00:03:59.799> called<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.430> food<00:04:00.609> for<00:04:00.909> a<00:04:00.939> while<00:04:01.150> so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
they've called it food for a while so

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.229 
they've called it food for a while so
why<00:04:01.959> would<00:04:02.139> they<00:04:02.230> change<00:04:02.409> it<00:04:02.650> no<00:04:03.549> it's<00:04:03.909> not<00:04:04.209> a

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
why would they change it no it's not a

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.509 
why would they change it no it's not a
planet<00:04:04.629> any<00:04:04.930> wonder<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.560> was<00:04:05.799> last<00:04:06.129> year<00:04:06.250> but

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
planet any wonder it was last year but

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.629 
planet any wonder it was last year but
not<00:04:06.730> now<00:04:07.170> well<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.379> still<00:04:08.680> say<00:04:08.739> it's<00:04:09.099> a<00:04:09.220> planet

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
not now well I still say it's a planet

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.390 
not now well I still say it's a planet

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.409 
very cool when Galileo first saw Saturn
in<00:05:14.050> 1610<00:05:14.800> he<00:05:15.400> couldn't<00:05:15.729> quite<00:05:15.909> make<00:05:16.180> out<00:05:16.360> what

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
in 1610 he couldn't quite make out what

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.899 
in 1610 he couldn't quite make out what
the<00:05:16.659> rings<00:05:16.870> were<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.770> him<00:05:18.039> it<00:05:18.310> was<00:05:18.580> as<00:05:18.729> if<00:05:18.879> the

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
the rings were to him it was as if the

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.260 
the rings were to him it was as if the
planet<00:05:19.389> had<00:05:19.569> two<00:05:19.839> companions<00:05:21.120> Saturn<00:05:22.120> is

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
planet had two companions Saturn is

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.809 
planet had two companions Saturn is
actually<00:05:22.870> less<00:05:23.139> dense<00:05:23.439> than<00:05:23.560> water<00:05:23.740> if<00:05:24.610> you

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
actually less dense than water if you

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.329 
actually less dense than water if you
could<00:05:25.000> find<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.270> bath<00:05:25.449> tub<00:05:25.689> big<00:05:25.900> enough<00:05:26.339> Saturn

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
could find a bath tub big enough Saturn

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.689 
could find a bath tub big enough Saturn
could<00:05:27.699> actually<00:05:27.879> float<00:05:28.419> in<00:05:28.599> it<00:05:28.689> of<00:05:29.699> course

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
could actually float in it of course

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.939 
could actually float in it of course
we're<00:05:31.089> looking<00:05:31.330> at<00:05:31.419> a<00:05:31.449> planet<00:05:31.900> so<00:05:32.169> big<00:05:32.500> you<00:05:32.770> can

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
we're looking at a planet so big you can

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.040 
we're looking at a planet so big you can
line<00:05:33.129> up<00:05:33.159> over<00:05:33.370> 9<00:05:33.819> Earth's<00:05:34.150> from<00:05:34.479> one<00:05:34.750> side<00:05:35.020> to

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
line up over 9 Earth's from one side to

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.559 
line up over 9 Earth's from one side to
the<00:05:35.229> other<00:05:35.349> not<00:05:36.159> including<00:05:36.819> the<00:05:36.909> Rings<00:05:37.150> the

the other not including the Rings the

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.350 
the other not including the Rings the
Rings<00:05:38.319> are<00:05:38.710> so<00:05:39.069> big<00:05:39.400> they<00:05:39.580> could<00:05:39.819> barely<00:05:40.150> fit

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
Rings are so big they could barely fit

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.089 
Rings are so big they could barely fit
