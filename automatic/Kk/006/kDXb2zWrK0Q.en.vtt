but I think that would look really
pretty<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:37.979> frames<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> them

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pretty and I need frames for all of them

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.390 
pretty and I need frames for all of them

so tell me if you think this is a good
idea<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.750> should<00:01:42.930> definitely<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
idea and I should definitely get this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.990 
idea and I should definitely get this
deal<00:01:43.920> right<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.970> 20<00:01:45.420> miles<00:01:45.570> away<00:01:46.970> but<00:01:47.970> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
deal right it's 20 miles away but I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.870 
deal right it's 20 miles away but I
think<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.420> should<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:50.189> hope<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.640> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
think I should do it I just hope that I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.139 
think I should do it I just hope that I
actually<00:01:51.659> follow<00:01:52.350> through<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:53.149> okay

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
actually follow through with this okay

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.499 
actually follow through with this okay
so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.350> now<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:57.329> a
