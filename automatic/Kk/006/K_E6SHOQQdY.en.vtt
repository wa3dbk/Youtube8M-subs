bonding them to the the bass we've

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.160 
bonding them to the the bass we've
already<00:00:22.820> gone<00:00:23.000> ahead<00:00:23.180> made<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.720> bass<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:24.110> the

car and stuff and now we've made our two

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.529 
car and stuff and now we've made our two
rings<00:00:25.840> we're<00:00:26.840> going<00:00:26.960> to<00:00:27.020> do<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:28.150> that<00:00:29.150> I'm

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
rings we're going to do this that I'm

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.790 
rings we're going to do this that I'm
going<00:00:29.780> to<00:00:29.810> do<00:00:29.930> it's<00:00:30.470> kind<00:00:30.590> of<00:00:30.680> an

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
going to do it's kind of an

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.189 
going to do it's kind of an
old-fashioned<00:00:31.490> way<00:00:31.640> of<00:00:31.760> doing<00:00:32.029> this<00:00:32.199> where

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:33.199 
old-fashioned way of doing this where

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.590 
old-fashioned way of doing this where
I'm<00:00:33.350> going<00:00:33.470> to<00:00:33.530> do<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.830> mount<00:00:34.129> on<00:00:34.370> top<00:00:34.600> so

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
I'm going to do a mount on top so

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.260 
I'm going to do a mount on top so
basically<00:00:36.080> when<00:00:36.379> you<00:00:36.410> have<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:37.160> together<00:00:37.270> the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
basically when you have it together the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.210 
basically when you have it together the
speaker<00:00:38.540> assembly<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:39.230> like<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:39.650> with<00:00:39.980> using

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
speaker assembly is like this with using

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.930 
speaker assembly is like this with using
the<00:00:40.520> normal<00:00:40.699> grill<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:41.720> would<00:00:41.930> be<00:00:42.050> the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
the normal grill this would be the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.979 
the normal grill this would be the
standard<00:00:43.940> method<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.540> you<00:00:44.629> would<00:00:44.780> use<00:00:44.960> to

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
standard method that you would use to

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.000 
standard method that you would use to
making<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.500> grill

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
making a grill

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.100 
making a grill
I<00:00:46.040> meant<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:46.430> making<00:00:46.699> cake<00:00:46.850> columns<00:00:47.120> now<00:00:47.629> what

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
I meant to making cake columns now what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.240 
I meant to making cake columns now what
I've<00:00:48.199> done<00:00:48.229> is<00:00:48.379> I've<00:00:48.680> gone<00:00:48.800> ahead<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.100> I've

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
I've done is I've gone ahead and I've

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.770 
I've done is I've gone ahead and I've
already<00:00:49.460> made<00:00:49.610> my<00:00:49.640> rings<00:00:49.970> made<00:00:50.239> my<00:00:50.360> cutouts<00:00:50.690> to

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
already made my rings made my cutouts to

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.899 
already made my rings made my cutouts to
the<00:00:50.870> sides<00:00:51.110> that<00:00:51.229> need<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.530> be<00:00:51.589> I've<00:00:52.400> also<00:00:52.610> put

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
the sides that need to be I've also put

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.500 
the sides that need to be I've also put
a<00:00:52.970> rabbit<00:00:53.239> here<00:00:53.989> which<00:00:54.769> will<00:00:54.949> be<00:00:55.040> used<00:00:55.510> to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
a rabbit here which will be used to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.750 
a rabbit here which will be used to
guide<00:00:56.809> our<00:00:57.019> mold<00:00:57.229> fabric<00:00:57.650> on<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:58.339> surface

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
guide our mold fabric on the surface

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.100 
guide our mold fabric on the surface
this<00:00:58.909> is<00:00:58.970> where<00:00:59.210> we'll<00:00:59.330> bomb<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.809> it<00:00:59.930> and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
this is where we'll bomb to it and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.259 
this is where we'll bomb to it and
reason<00:01:00.379> we<00:01:00.440> do<00:01:00.589> that<00:01:00.769> that<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.760> like<00:01:01.909> to<00:01:02.030> do<00:01:02.150> this

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
reason we do that that I like to do this

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.420 
reason we do that that I like to do this
is<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.780> it<00:01:03.229> keeps<00:01:03.379> this<00:01:03.589> surface<00:01:03.979> here<00:01:04.100> flat

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
is that it keeps this surface here flat

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.190 
is that it keeps this surface here flat
so<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:05.180> way<00:01:05.360> when<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.659> go<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.810> put<00:01:06.049> anything

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
so that way when you go to put anything

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.140 
so that way when you go to put anything
on<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.680> they'll<00:01:07.130> have<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> nice<00:01:07.460> good<00:01:07.790> flat

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
on it they'll have a nice good flat

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.930 
on it they'll have a nice good flat
finished<00:01:08.659> surface<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.799> it<00:01:09.920> now<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> holes

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
finished surface to it now the holes

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.730 
finished surface to it now the holes
that<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.180> see<00:01:11.360> here<00:01:11.780> are<00:01:12.170> going<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.409> be<00:01:12.500> used

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
that you see here are going to be used

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.620 
that you see here are going to be used
for<00:01:12.979> dowel<00:01:13.460> rods<00:01:13.700> we're<00:01:14.060> going<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.270> take<00:01:14.450> down

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
for dowel rods we're going to take down

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.350 
for dowel rods we're going to take down
rods<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:15.500> insert<00:01:15.920> them<00:01:16.130> in<00:01:16.280> here<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.700> then

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
rods and we insert them in here and then

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.240 
rods and we insert them in here and then
when<00:01:17.630> we're<00:01:17.780> mounting<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.320> in<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.890> angle

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
when we're mounting this in the angle

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.800 
when we're mounting this in the angle
that<00:01:19.370> we<00:01:19.430> need<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.760> set<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.090> up<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.660> kick

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
that we need to set this up and the kick

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.250 
that we need to set this up and the kick
panel<00:01:21.110> i'll<00:01:21.230> be<00:01:21.740> using<00:01:21.880> casi<00:01:22.880> no<00:01:22.940> acrylics<00:01:23.450> in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
panel i'll be using casi no acrylics in

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.960 
panel i'll be using casi no acrylics in
bonding<00:01:24.740> these<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.160> fiberglass<00:01:25.640> frame

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
bonding these to the fiberglass frame

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.780 
bonding these to the fiberglass frame
and<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.450> will<00:01:26.600> hold<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.140> in<00:01:27.380> place<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:28.610> way

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and it will hold this in place that way

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.310 
and it will hold this in place that way
we<00:01:28.940> can<00:01:29.090> pull<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.390> kick<00:01:29.570> panel<00:01:29.840> out<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.200> then

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
we can pull the kick panel out and then

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.920 
we can pull the kick panel out and then
wrap<00:01:30.650> whole<00:01:31.040> mechanism<00:01:31.250> using<00:01:32.090> them<00:01:32.210> our<00:01:32.630> mold

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
wrap whole mechanism using them our mold

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.550 
wrap whole mechanism using them our mold
fabric<00:01:34.210> right<00:01:35.210> now<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:35.660> said<00:01:35.750> we've

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
fabric right now like I said we've

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.620 
fabric right now like I said we've
already<00:01:36.710> gone<00:01:36.920> I've<00:01:37.220> also<00:01:37.400> put<00:01:37.640> a<00:01:37.700> radius<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.570> a

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
already gone I've also put a radius of a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.350 
already gone I've also put a radius of a
rabbet<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.560> radius<00:01:40.100> edge<00:01:40.310> quarter<00:01:41.090> inch<00:01:41.210> on

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
rabbet a radius edge quarter inch on

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.330 
rabbet a radius edge quarter inch on
this<00:01:41.510> side<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.260> reason<00:01:42.530> for<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:43.100> is<00:01:43.310> that

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
this side the reason for that is is that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.690 
this side the reason for that is is that
in<00:01:44.270> this<00:01:44.540> particular<00:01:44.750> case<00:01:45.260> we<00:01:46.250> will<00:01:46.280> have<00:01:46.580> an

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
in this particular case we will have an

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.910 
in this particular case we will have an
extreme<00:01:47.210> pole<00:01:47.660> which<00:01:47.960> will<00:01:48.080> actually<00:01:48.350> cost<00:01:48.710> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
extreme pole which will actually cost to

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.560 
extreme pole which will actually cost to
pull<00:01:49.160> around<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.610> corner<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:50.120> back<00:01:50.300> down

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
pull around the corner and back down

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.690

points<00:03:06.980> across<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.549> hits<00:03:07.760> there<00:03:07.940> now<00:03:09.489> people

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
points across and hits there now people

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.910 
points across and hits there now people
are<00:03:10.610> asking<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:11.330> is<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.630> about<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.709> kick

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
are asking on what is it about the kick

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.410 
are asking on what is it about the kick
panel<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> angle<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.940> kick<00:03:14.150> panel

panel on the angle of the kick panel

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.810 
panel on the angle of the kick panel
it's<00:03:14.540> important<00:03:15.019> well<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.560> find<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.250> having

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
it's important well I find that having

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.180 
it's important well I find that having
the<00:03:17.390> angle<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.140> kick<00:03:18.290> panel<00:03:18.620> tilted<00:03:19.010> this

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
the angle of the kick panel tilted this

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.840 
the angle of the kick panel tilted this
way<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:20.840> helps<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:21.440> bit<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.070> as<00:03:22.310> long<00:03:22.670> as

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
way it helps a little bit but as long as

going to be very minimal unless you're

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.150 
going to be very minimal unless you're
like<00:03:35.780> sixty<00:03:36.170> degrees<00:03:36.440> off-axis

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
like sixty degrees off-axis

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.069 
like sixty degrees off-axis
the<00:03:37.579> really<00:03:37.850> important<00:03:38.360> thing<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.870> you

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
the really important thing is that you

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.600 
the really important thing is that you
want<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.350> get<00:03:39.440> both<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.709> these<00:03:40.010> aiming<00:03:40.459> and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
want to get both of these aiming and

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.789 
want to get both of these aiming and
generally<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.209> same<00:03:41.420> position<00:03:42.079> from<00:03:42.590> right

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
generally the same position from right

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.580 
generally the same position from right
to<00:03:42.829> left<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.450> case<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:45.320> know<00:03:45.440> it's

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
to left and in this case you know it's

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.650 
to left and in this case you know it's
an<00:03:45.709> it's<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.130> position<00:03:46.640> I've<00:03:46.820> done<00:03:47.120> for<00:03:47.420> years

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
an it's a position I've done for years

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.990 
an it's a position I've done for years
and<00:03:47.840> years<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.079> years<00:03:48.440> if<00:03:49.190> down<00:03:49.579> from<00:03:49.880> the

allows me to tilt this thing forward

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.580 
allows me to tilt this thing forward
backwards<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.060> test<00:04:07.270> it<00:04:07.510> I'll<00:04:08.200> put<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.470> where

back them up with fiberglass on the
second<00:04:57.070> run<00:04:57.190> you'll<00:04:57.400> do<00:04:57.550> both<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.000> inside

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
second run you'll do both in the inside

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.440 
second run you'll do both in the inside
and<00:04:58.540> the<00:04:58.630> outside<00:04:59.490> to<00:05:00.490> maximize<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.390> amount

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
the into the mold fabric so that it will

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.000 
the into the mold fabric so that it will

harden as a solid object sometimes when

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.040 
harden as a solid object sometimes when
you<00:05:09.130> don't<00:05:09.220> put<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.550> off<00:05:09.640> resin<00:05:10.120> in<00:05:10.240> there<00:05:10.420> it

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
you don't put it off resin in there it

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.590 
you don't put it off resin in there it
will<00:05:11.680> turn<00:05:11.950> into<00:05:12.100> it'll<00:05:12.940> be<00:05:13.000> soft<00:05:13.270> on<00:05:13.510> the

and hard on the outside and that's a bad

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.240 
and hard on the outside and that's a bad
thing<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.390> don't<00:05:16.510> want<00:05:16.690> to<00:05:16.720> have<00:05:16.900> that<00:05:20.100> as<00:05:21.100> you

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
couple things you have to make sure of

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.320 
couple things you have to make sure of
is<00:06:24.960> your<00:06:25.139> connection<00:06:25.409> points<00:06:25.949> here<00:06:26.250> so<00:06:26.879> when

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
is your connection points here so when

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.790 
is your connection points here so when
you<00:06:27.419> wrap<00:06:27.599> down<00:06:27.870> with<00:06:28.139> life<00:06:28.319> in<00:06:28.470> this<00:06:28.560> case

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
you wrap down with life in this case

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.309 
you wrap down with life in this case
I'll<00:06:28.979> wrap<00:06:29.159> it<00:06:29.190> with<00:06:29.400> vinyl<00:06:30.080> I'm<00:06:31.080> going<00:06:31.259> to

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 
I'll wrap it with vinyl I'm going to

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.629 
I'll wrap it with vinyl I'm going to
make<00:06:31.409> sure<00:06:31.560> those<00:06:31.800> connections<00:06:32.220> are<00:06:32.340> nice<00:06:32.460> and

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
make sure those connections are nice and

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.839 
make sure those connections are nice and
clean<00:06:32.849> and<00:06:34.280> it's<00:06:35.280> almost<00:06:35.430> dry

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
clean and it's almost dry

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:45.360 
clean and it's almost dry
so<00:06:36.810> it

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370
