00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.509
 The other day at McDonald's I am today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 been traveling early 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.330
 by heart and at some point had horst 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 halfway with and then have with one 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.189
 long came from highway sometime 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.340
 then the rescue 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.740
 the big m was usually always 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.900
 So far, the spa has been fast 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.719
 integrate and has now brought 20 with 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:40.260
 bronze and nicolas and something happy 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:40.890
 Today I came in and thought 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 that time 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.170
 I would have approached one 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.170
 Agent said Halo is vegan and contracted 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.079
 We do not have Saarland again 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 called off 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.949
 He said he was there until eleven- thirty 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.750
 is breakfast time there is only 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.189
 breakfast your wedding for breakfast 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 but who are simply no salad 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.659
 they have a card and then that's it 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.270
 is eating quite so buddy has become 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:22.200
 turn triangle away 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:23.580
 nicola brought and then I looked 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 what you have to have 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.259
 is not there is not synonymous 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.380
 bun , yes yes, this citizen falls quasi 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.210
 I danced and really not dared 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 I want something and then 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.080
 things are what they have 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.700
 everything listed 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.880
 the only thing that was really possible 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.920
 would be the team asked 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.050
 organism is pasteurized because of it 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.420
 tasting when I said of course he 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.909
 is pastor err is not for me at all 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 I like to drink juices organized 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.960
 apple sauce amish says pasteurized 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.240
 does not work for me anyway 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 Okay then it will be okay 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.989
 The water stays with the baker kumiko 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.120
 understand is out 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.140
 We have with just the style of you 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.620
 can perceive polak 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.620
 that is the is has moderately for a short time 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.530
 There is no thought at all now 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.810
 of course, on to glock, however 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.800
 Thirst Quiet Think Right Than 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.319
 better the captain is not as good as 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.220
 There is smoke there has to be somehow 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.600
 billing is therefore well explained namely 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.190
 Stops better than the cheapest 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.329
 drink a small water 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.900
 somehow 180 euro and yes there is easy 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.410
 right 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.610
 That's why the monastery wants to tell me 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.610
 toilets water given 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.739
 That's it 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.519
 I used to so I have to say because 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.800
 is a colleague is to make a corner 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.980
 and 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.910
 with bacon and bacon 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.910
 melted cheese has a cool to 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.070
 that's where the situation is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.330
 Of course, always where I ask of course 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.340
 small ones happen once such a 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:34.340
 situation I said okay 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.170
 stay strong but I want to be strong 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.170
 Stay in the meaning of it because I want to 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.540
 that just is not like it 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.740
 that would like to go with her teacher 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.230
 have to fight 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.970
 besides , I knew but fight okay so 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.500
 of course I have that thought my 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.420
 brain unit and so on there it went 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.730
 your debts a bit again 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.980
 better then eventually 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.690
 You could come home first 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.710
 make me pretty chic then 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.200
 made it and it was just fine 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.360
 chilled but have the domestic the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.250
 later attacks potatoes and made 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.970
 green sauteed with onions 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.120
 and then, if possible, that's what it was 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.199
 so to speak and the experience of today 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.590
 15 days which was not so nice body 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:30.770
 to and otherwise is not anymore 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 Yesterday also happened bigger again 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:39.229
 relatively advised in broccoli cabbage beautiful 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.380
 in the evening then and coconut oil very good 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.660
 tasted the industry in front of me 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.050
 heard yesterday that will be mine 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.660
 nutrition is the problem that is at 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.100
 red hill ago 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.419
 the acts must be the last meal 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.370
 the warm meal and that's it 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.100
 I can eat by as from 1600 mhz 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.150
 to eat a warm meal 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:09.560
 but that is not the last meal 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:11.180
 was just before went from the bed was perfect 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.020
 exactly also again 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.460
 this clear and for so and so 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.419
 describe is not totally great 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.010
 really valuable because somehow for 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.060
 my body 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.979
 I do not hope that somehow 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.590
 pesticides or something like the drugs 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.000
 similar effect then read that 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.220
 that only in force if you now completely 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.700
 normal not organic buy as well with very 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.570
 pesticides and all sorts 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.910
 contaminated with weedkillers 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.870
 I'm so trite but on friday 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.150
 video quite normal 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.740
 and maybe that too is the effect 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.430
 because she is not perfect perfect 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.030
 So from that hope that's what 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:56.289
 Positive are not so well that is 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:58.460
 even a real hammer but not yes 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.770
 in the past, often on the road 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.050
 one comes the big m and saves 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.570
 Mostly in need today as little 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.039
 then you talk in the dry 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.039
 see you were
