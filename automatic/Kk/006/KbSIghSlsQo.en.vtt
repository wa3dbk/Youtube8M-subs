00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.310
 hello, my name is rafael and welcome to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.310
 another literary mustache 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.000
 Good, I did until the day of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.119
 week are jokes under all 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 credits of who is or who translated all 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.369
 But I'll always leave the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 video for me was curiosity pn won 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.510
 but I saw this video on the band channel 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.039
 I was going to leave him here in the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.109
 down for who wants to take a look 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.910
 in her video this technique consists of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.690
 to draw a book for each day of the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.579
 week 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.100
 Sunday the book you do not want 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.989
 finished or did not want it finished in the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.120
 time I was reading is a tava 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.950
 taking literally I do not 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 I wanted to finish if I wanted more 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 story that is more of that plot than 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 was happening at the time there that is in 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.210
 flames 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 I think everyone has seen a movie and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.539
 story when he takes him or her 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.520
 but it 's very desperate, I really want 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.680

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.150

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.299
 very good and the final also without 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 Wonderful Monday Monday 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.770
 book you're too lazy to start 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.200
 I already commented this with a genius of the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.119
 I have a lot of paper airplanes. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 too lazy to start reading the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.439
 books yet even serial I know 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.080

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.920
 pocket is wonderful, I think it's very beautiful but 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.549
 The time is because I think of putting 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.040
 on the bookshelf it's good to read on a hill 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.159
 I'm lazy, I know there's going to be a lot of people. 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.009
 I know the medium but I'm lazy 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 reading June Tuesday the book 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.710
 you pushed the belly or read by 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.079
 must when I came home from school 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.119
 I've never wanted to read like this. 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.270
 how much I have today I think if I 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.000
 had 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.369
 Today at the time I got over well 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.789
 Of the books but I did not read the book I said 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.610
 I read that at the time for me it's great and it gives 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.039
 a sloth here the travels of gulliver to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.290
 you if you had this the college if 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.510
 I'm not mistaken in the 6th grade 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.430
 series has been taking time into account 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.190
 with all the last year of college and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.860
 despite the history such is that moral and 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.230
 everything else then in a very short time 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.500
 remember that time I think today 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.510

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.209

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.030
 half or reading at the moment in the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.220
 Mom, I'm reading black, please. 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.650
 I will not remember the name of the author 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.530
 because she is the most famous name in sweden 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.200
 difficult but it's a super cool story to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.079
 synopse says is the group of old people who 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.720
 they are the only nursing home except that 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.640
 the management of this super relaxed home 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.200
 Let's call the old men and they 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.510
 are tired of that they solve 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.940
 make a revolution that has idea 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.000
 main character the ox brand covers 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.980
 that in the prisons of Sweden treatment is 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.590
 much better than Brazil then 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.239
 He decides to put some cream on him. 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.920
 to have a better life the book is 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.139
 passes around this story as 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.590

 I'll be very honest, I will not choose any 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.079
 this category because I think 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.580
 right here that the book is bad I think 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.920
 worth it 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.130

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.080
