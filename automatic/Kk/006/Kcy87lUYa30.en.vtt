00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.860
 the fifteen of France 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.230
 he is a man that's here in fact we put 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.990
 to the point the traction control systems a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.520
 part of the traction control functions 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.920
 so the traction control is all together 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.630
 functions that which 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.400
 participates in the optimization of 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.350
 motor skills so in 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 the occurrence here are slopes 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.190
 slope with asymmetrical adhesion 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.220
 uncle usually lived the team and 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.090
 without anti skating will end up if he 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.020
 wants to start in this kind of 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.270
 configuration has receded 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.930
 so the principle of this feature 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.510
 in this case it is to detect 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.800
 therefore an asymmetrical adhesion and for 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.660
 so allow the motor of the vehicle 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.910
 to generate a braking torque on the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.769
 rumba proving this so that 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.309
 the vehicle can take off with the wheel 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.140
 high adhesion 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.670
 the car must not back down and especially 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.039
 she must not 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.359
 have a moment of separation so we 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.710
 develops regulators so as to 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.320
 what these cases I can do in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.820
 all peace of mind in comfort here this 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.450
 that we actually produce is someone 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 who should start 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.740
 bet to go out parking up 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.680
 in a slope with ice that is that 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.840
 on one only one of the two sides 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.180
 that's typically what happens for by 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 example a road that is icy that 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.539
 sunny than on a half or at 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.990
 what we see a lot in the countries 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.570
 Nordic 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.649
 the fact that center of the road the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.950
 cars were going cars are rolling 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.420
 car during rollin return what 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.920
 allows a center band with 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.330
 asphalt while on the one-eyed 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.330
 still ice of the year 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.289
 donated braking on a track 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.420
 artificial that simulates the presence of a 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.110
 alone on the left and ice on the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.299
 right part 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.530
 this braking should destabilize the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:02.780
 vehicle but thanks to the abs system we 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:05.210
 let's restore the vehicle I 'm doing 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 forced counter-steering to compensate the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.819
 couple of the CG born by the difference 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.819
 surface 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.110
 so in fact these systems are not the 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.670
 systems that are reclaimed from the shelf and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.959
 thrown into a car that 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.850
 requires adaptation and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.590
 point according to the time set of 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.520
 parameters characterizing vehicles 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.870
 so the tires the brakes to 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.950
 the architectured vehicles these masons 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.740
 completely etc etc 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.959
 all projects in the group pass between 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.250
 our hands the belchamp site is a 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.520
 important site to make this setting 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.350
 point 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.790
 we are also going to others 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.190
 are in winter especially we go to Spain 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.930
 or we go to the far north to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.920
 enjoy the bass wandering so 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.360
 these systems in fact that their goals 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.010
 it's not about pushing the limits of 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.810
 vehicle but it is to optimize 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.330
 Vehicle behavior has its limits 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.920
 so what I would say is that it takes 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.850
 avoid using it even if you do 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.360
 everything so that it works best 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.130
 possible 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.420
 the best thing is that a system 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.070
 never triggers in the use of a 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.420
 finally in the life of a vehicle in 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.680
 with a client is to use 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.290
 it is to avoid reaching the limits of 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.380
 the adhesion simply so that's 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:05.720
 apprehend and vigilant when there is 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.430
 snow and rain lift the foot and 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.850
 it will always be better than with the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.120
 system that works 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.120
 from what 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.720
 investigation 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.720
 g 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.959
 apple itunes 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.290
 it is a shock of approval in shock 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.420
 front 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.360
 it's typically representative of a 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.340
 shock coming out of bend that comes out 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.510
 turn and that he would type in a 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.340
 car that came in front 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.870
 and that's why we're tapping against a 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.180
 barrier that are deforming which itself 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.319
 roughly represents the behavior of the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.940
 block sold our car 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.150
 we immediately see that we have 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.069
 preserved the cabin cell is 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.820
 to say the space reserved for 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.690
 occupants to achieve this we rely 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.229
 on two principles 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.150
 the first is that in optimize 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.300
 energy absorption in the block 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.810
 before by optimizing the compression so 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.550
 each element of the front block to a 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.060
 predetermined behavior some of 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.790
 pile up 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.200
 some must break others must 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.600
 deform to absorb energy 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.940
 so all that is planned in advance by 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.010
 example the wheel stays in the focus and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.540
 just press will go along the second 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.340
 principle is that we must mention 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.410
 voices of effort for this 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.229
 cell either be preserved on this 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.030
 vehicle the voices of the forces that have 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:56.270
 been held back it's the top of the door 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.539
 here that builds on what's called the 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.070
 middle foot and the spar at the bottom of the 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.169
 car so these are the two ways 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.750
 of main effort that once one has 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.630
 absorbed the energy of a block before us 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.479
 allow to preserve this cell that 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.820
 then also allows us to have 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.440
 a door opening 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.050
 for passengers for occupants 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.620
 either for them to come out even if they 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.850
 are still aware or for access 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.290
 for firefighters to be able to extract 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.050
 occupants most easily 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.940
 possible on this type of shock 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.340
 we have passengers who are going 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.930
 go out with little wounds without 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.200
 no serious injury 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.970
 every element of the cockpit goes 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.540
 participate in occupant protection 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:44.060
 in the first place the seats that are going to 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.390
 distort the minimum possible and resist 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.430
 at the attraction of belts then we 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.430
 has the belts that will go off 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.200
 who have pretended to shoot 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.750
 occupants to the seat is limited 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.820
 advance their maximally towards the dashboard 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.850
 when reaching the level 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.890
 maximum effort that can support the 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.350
 ribcage the dummies are going 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.240
 keep moving forward and that's the airbags 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.430
 who in a second time will take the 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.930
 relay to welcome them at best and 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.060
 avoid who is touching us 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.330
 the dashboard the steering wheel a shock 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.010
 lasts about 100 vermin seconds the 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.470
 deployment phase 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.120
 the attraction of belts pretension 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.870
 belts plus the deployment of 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.730
 airbags are between 40 and 72 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.590
 seconds so it lasts about thirty 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.310
 thousand seconds for everything to be in 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.620
 square 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:39.060
 to best accommodate the occupants 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.250
 protect them the balance sheet is positive 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.110
 we studied the vehicle its 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.000
 structure all the elements for that 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.370
 best for the occupants 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.380
 but behind the essential thing this 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.090
 that users must use 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.400
 their seatbelt 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:56.070
 task and as soon as they get back into the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.520
 vehicle and check that the airbag 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:02.160
 passenger is active unless a seat 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.400
 child must the road is installed to 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.560
 this place also use the 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.510
 child seats advocated in an autistic 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.490
 and following the installation instructions 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:15.210
 manufacturers or signs of seats 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:18.120
 the strong message is actually a 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.740
 vehicle studied for shocks and 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.810
 behind a good use of the 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.530
 from the driver's user and 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.530
 of all passengers
