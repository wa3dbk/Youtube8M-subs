00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
tell us a little bit about the worker
and<00:00:44.460> your<00:00:44.579> findings<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.210> well

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and your findings as well

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.319 
and your findings as well
yeah<00:00:46.110> probably<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.680> stands<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.329> that's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
yeah probably one that stands out that's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.020 
yeah probably one that stands out that's
been<00:00:48.960> published<00:00:49.320> most<00:00:49.770> recently<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
been published most recently is one that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.330 
been published most recently is one that
we've<00:00:51.210> we've<00:00:51.719> monitored<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.129> last

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
we've we've monitored in the last

immune system called IgA the abbreviated

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.979 
immune system called IgA the abbreviated
term<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.359> quite<00:01:03.510> sensitive<00:01:03.870> to

are<00:01:51.479> three<00:01:51.990> elements<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.040> footballers

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
are three elements really to footballers

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.730 
are three elements really to footballers
performance<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.290> obviously<00:01:55.619> what

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
performance it was obviously what

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.350 
performance it was obviously what
happens<00:01:56.100> out<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> pitch<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.909> Saturday

happens out on the pitch on a Saturday

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240 
happens out on the pitch on a Saturday
but<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.840> complements<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.649> really<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
but what complements that really is the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.670 
but what complements that really is the
training<00:01:59.520> that<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.030> day<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.450> day<00:02:00.600> out<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
training that they do day in day out and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.910

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
will hopefully facilitate what happens

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.830 
will hopefully facilitate what happens
on<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> south<00:02:41.100> afternoon<00:02:41.600> football<00:02:42.600> really

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
on the south afternoon football really

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.830 
on the south afternoon football really
now<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:43.380> think<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.970> amongst<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> sports<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
now I think is amongst the sports at the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
now I think is amongst the sports at the
forefront<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.500> trying<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.220> implement

forefront of trying to implement

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.280 
forefront of trying to implement

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
strategies that will get the best out of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.010 
strategies that will get the best out of

on<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.780> daily<00:03:22.080> basis<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.220> once<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.519> get<00:03:23.640> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
on a daily basis and once you get that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.520 
on a daily basis and once you get that
baseline<00:03:24.120> measurement<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.380> then

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
baseline measurement you can then

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.110 
baseline measurement you can then
intervene<00:03:25.920> optimally<00:03:26.400> with<00:03:26.550> nutritional

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
intervene optimally with nutritional

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.150 
intervene optimally with nutritional
requirements<00:03:28.110> really<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.650> players<00:03:28.920> will

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
requirements really the players will

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.880 
requirements really the players will
typically<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.670> their<00:03:29.820> breakfast<00:03:30.239> here<00:03:30.450> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
then they have the launch as well so the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.570 
then they have the launch as well so the
nutrition<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.350> provide<00:03:34.769> from<00:03:35.250> when<00:03:35.430> they
