00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello from nick to loreto disfi where 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.420
 facile.it today I want to give you one 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:12.630
 solution to build your site 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 born web page anyway villas where 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.379
 I want to provide you with a solution to a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.100
 possible the problem that can be 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.720
 check then be very careful 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 because this is a very very thing 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.000
 important 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.779
 so now it is already about three years that 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 use builder program to get started 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.910
 precisely websites in a very way 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 simple in an intuitive manner 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 here's how to make a puzzle e 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.430
 I must say that I discovered this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.239
 program is very powerful and very 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.969
 however, intuitive and very versatile 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 lately I've noticed something 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:00.030
 that another web marketer some time 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 so he had pointed out to me the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 problem can appear right from the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.930
 made that builder and lets you 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.510
 to create a website simply with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.040
 the method to make a puzzle then you want 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.850
 put an image on your page 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.610
 web 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 put the image you want to put text 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.140
 take it from the toolbar and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.810
 enter the block the text commit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 a video you want to put a slideshow of 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 images all with the same system 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.979
 but what happens appointments 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 stabilizing your website 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.259
 it can happen that you say harmless 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 at this point I don't want the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.159
 margin I want to replace it with instead 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:46.749
 with ethical hub then remove the image 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.689
 the 16 b is the form to insert a 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.670
 video from youtube for example then in a 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.429
 other point of the page of the near site 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.109
 here I don't want the text I want 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.439
 insert a slideshow of images 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:02.950
 then you get back the text maybe you delete it 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:07.240
 that block of text and insert 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.640
 the memo the slideshow element then 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.390
 maybe you could decide to replace 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.799
 another item with another one 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.599
 in short, always taken of the bar of 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:21.069
 instruments 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:23.709
 and at that point we say the code let's say 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.640
 the html code of your page now more 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.099
 could be a little bit in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.530
 messed up for search engines that 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.840
 it could indeed happen that it is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.609
 once you've published yours 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.109
 Web page 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.859
 let's say it is excellent search engines 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:43.060
 let's say let's talk about google for example 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.349
 they go to the web pages 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.500
 and they say but in short this web page 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.870
 is not is not much the code is not much 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.540
 ordered is a little bit difficult 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.260
 to read but it will be a web page created 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.200
 we do it seriously or maybe 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.540
 there is under the hand of one of one 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.730
 person who wants to use said that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.980
 to get the first page indexed 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.349
 web and therefore could we say the robot 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.640
 of search engines may not 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.310
 giving the right importance is 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.129
 so right value to your web page 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.590
 created web builder instead 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:32.030
 deserves all the value you want 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.669
 what is the solution i started you at 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.810
 to do in this way I make ugly 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:38.090
 copy 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.239
 and then I make a nice copy of my site 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.790
 web tito say the truth has happened 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.870
 lately I made a couple of 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.500
 websites for a service company for 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.099
 a craftsman and I found out what I was doing 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.389
 so doing the draft first 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.329
 since it was indeed sirigu 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:03.169
 they were important because it was n't 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.959
 they were mine so I couldn't do big 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:10.639
 errors I noticed that the code 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:14.500
 it was very very clean or at least 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:17.510
 much much cleaner than that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.190
 it came out when I used to 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.289
 bild 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.260
 at the beginning so it didn't hurt me 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:27.020
 I discovered this this wonder 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.820
 solution so I thought it was 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.289
 really very useful indeed of a utility 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.440
 fundamental also for you and therefore not 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:42.830
 decided to talk just recently 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.670
 and I was talking via Skype with another point 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.570
 with another member of the 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:51.960
 newsletter you could too 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.240
 bar parts or not and he is too 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.200
 was impressed with this item 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.960
 suitable 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.300
 it really felt like it seems to me 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.760
 a good idea this one right now 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:08.070
 that you have therefore discovered this 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.000
 this solution is a problem 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.140
 can check you have nothing left but 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.540
 apply 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.600
 I hope my usual to have brought you 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.490
 something useful 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.140
 continue to use web builder and if 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.920
 did not you did start to use it 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.280
 m languages 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.550
 in the link below the video you will find 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.320
 certainly the possibility to start 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.930
 immediately and in a manner 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.260
 absolutely free like so many others 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.270
 people have already done and not minor 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.690
 been invited to share with the 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.750
