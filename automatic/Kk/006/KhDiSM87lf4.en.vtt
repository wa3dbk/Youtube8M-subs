00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
then the actual case this case is a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.630 
then the actual case this case is a
bumper<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.489> has<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:48.950> solid<00:00:49.950> back<00:00:50.309> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it was rugged enough to the point where

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
it was rugged enough to the point where
I<00:01:07.409> could<00:01:07.530> take<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> drop<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.280> I'm<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.850> careful

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
front and the back of the case so let me

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.450 
front and the back of the case so let me
take<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> off<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> I'll<00:01:19.979> show<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.400> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
looks like on the device as we see it as

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
looks like on the device as we see it as
quite<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> lay<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.970> table<00:01:24.119> design

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
quite a bit of a lay on the table design

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060 
quite a bit of a lay on the table design
here<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> case<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> does<00:01:25.770> fall

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
here in the case that it does fall

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.550 
here in the case that it does fall
face-first<00:01:26.430> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> side<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.020> embossed

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

slot for the volume toggle on the back

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
slot for the volume toggle on the back
and<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:33.990> totally<00:01:34.200> clear<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and it's totally clear and that is a

and it's totally clear and that is a
unique<00:01:35.610> part<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.000> case<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.450> can

Lightning connector which is pretty

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.850 
Lightning connector which is pretty
large<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.840> should<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.170> able<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.380> fit<00:01:58.590> some

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
large so that should be able to fit some

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.789 
large so that should be able to fit some

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
anything like that just about none

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.469 
anything like that just about none
that's<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.490> form-fitting<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that's very very form-fitting it is a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.540 
that's very very form-fitting it is a
very<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.079> snug<00:02:07.590> fit<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.129> must<00:02:08.340> say<00:02:08.429> it's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
very very snug fit I must say it's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.699 
very very snug fit I must say it's
definitely<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:09.060> tighter<00:02:09.660> fit<00:02:09.959> than<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> was

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
definitely a tighter fit than it was
