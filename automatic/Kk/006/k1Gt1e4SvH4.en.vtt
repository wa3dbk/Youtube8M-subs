gets<00:00:39.469> the<00:00:39.649> stepladder<00:00:39.920> and<00:00:40.429> then<00:00:40.910> they<00:00:41.059> pop

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
gets the stepladder and then they pop

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.569 
gets the stepladder and then they pop
straight<00:00:41.749> in<00:00:41.960> it's<00:00:42.620> fully<00:00:42.980> locked<00:00:43.309> in<00:00:43.489> the

is the feature that literally cuts your
work<00:03:19.069> time<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.489> half<00:03:19.699> the<00:03:20.120> reason<00:03:20.269> why<00:03:20.540> we're

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
work time in half the reason why we're

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.839 
work time in half the reason why we're
going<00:03:21.139> to<00:03:21.199> split<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.590> ladder<00:03:21.799> in<00:03:22.010> half<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
going to split the ladder in half the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.610 
going to split the ladder in half the
inside<00:03:23.239> section<00:03:23.599> we<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.049> lock<00:03:24.319> tabs

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
inside section we have the lock tabs

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.979 
inside section we have the lock tabs

it's all the way out it has its own

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.170 
it's all the way out it has its own
rubber<00:03:31.849> feet<00:03:33.040> locks<00:03:34.040> in<00:03:34.280> place<00:03:34.430> it's<00:03:34.849> a<00:03:34.909> four

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
rubber feet locks in place it's a four

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.149 
rubber feet locks in place it's a four
foot<00:03:35.389> high<00:03:35.540> trestle<00:03:35.870> now<00:03:36.709> I'm<00:03:36.829> going<00:03:36.949> to<00:03:37.010> show

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
foot high trestle now I'm going to show

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:43.360 
foot high trestle now I'm going to show
you<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.720> side<00:03:38.720> view<00:03:38.769> turn<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:39.979> around<00:03:42.370> lock

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
you this side view turn this around lock

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.939 
you this side view turn this around lock
this<00:03:43.669> into<00:03:44.000> place<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.659> one<00:03:44.810> closest<00:03:45.379> to<00:03:45.440> me

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
this into place to the one closest to me

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.710 
this into place to the one closest to me
and<00:03:46.040> then<00:03:46.609> what<00:03:46.790> you<00:03:46.909> want<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.120> do<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.449> grab

this back brace and as you pick this

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.719 
this back brace and as you pick this
brace<00:03:49.940> up<00:03:50.180> first<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:51.019> aligns<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.889> top<00:03:52.159> so<00:03:52.609> they

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:52.729 
brace up first it aligns the top so they

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.990 
brace up first it aligns the top so they
match<00:03:52.940> up<00:03:52.970> perfectly<00:03:53.659> and<00:03:54.229> then<00:03:54.699> you<00:03:55.699> adjust

closing on you this one doesn't so as

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.699 
closing on you this one doesn't so as
you<00:04:17.389> go<00:04:17.509> to<00:04:17.570> move<00:04:17.810> these<00:04:17.989> from<00:04:18.229> place<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:18.530> place

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
you go to move these from place to place

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.589 
you go to move these from place to place
you<00:04:19.430> have<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.729> worry<00:04:19.909> about<00:04:20.000> these<00:04:20.269> legs

coming together so little giant made an
accessory<00:04:23.270> 35<00:04:23.750> years<00:04:24.080> ago<00:04:24.229> called<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.950> work

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
accessory 35 years ago called the work

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.050 
accessory 35 years ago called the work
platform

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
between here fold straight down so now

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.530 
between here fold straight down so now
when<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.010> go<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.190> move<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.580> trestle<00:04:34.850> I<00:04:35.180> don't

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
when I go to move this trestle I don't

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.350 
when I go to move this trestle I don't
have<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.780> worry<00:04:35.900> about<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.200> coming<00:04:36.320> apart<00:04:37.360> now

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
have to worry about it coming apart now

together let me show you two ways one if
you're<00:04:43.850> used<00:04:44.150> to<00:04:44.300> working<00:04:44.419> with<00:04:44.870> little

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
you're used to working with little

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.920 
you're used to working with little
giants<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:48.260> one<00:04:48.650> if<00:04:48.860> you're<00:04:49.010> not<00:04:49.690> first<00:04:50.690> way

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
giants and one if you're not first way

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.360 
giants and one if you're not first way
is<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.410> take<00:04:51.830> this<00:04:52.010> back<00:04:52.669> together<00:04:54.160> slide<00:04:55.160> it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
is I take this back together slide it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.060 
is I take this back together slide it
right<00:04:55.400> down<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.940> middle<00:04:56.530> and<00:04:57.530> let<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.919> go

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
right down the middle and let that go

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.310 
right down the middle and let that go
all<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.250> way<00:04:58.430> down<00:04:58.700> now<00:04:59.450> let<00:04:59.810> me<00:04:59.900> show<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.139> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
all the way down now let me show you the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.700 
all the way down now let me show you the
easiest<00:05:00.710> way<00:05:00.889> to<00:05:01.040> do<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.750> when<00:05:02.750> this<00:05:02.930> is<00:05:03.110> set

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
easiest way to do it when this is set

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.920 
easiest way to do it when this is set
apart<00:05:03.979> like<00:05:04.160> this<00:05:04.460> I'll<00:05:05.000> take<00:05:05.419> one<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:05.690> these

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
apart like this I'll take one of these

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.020 
apart like this I'll take one of these

why<00:05:36.550> sometimes<00:05:37.550> you're<00:05:37.700> having<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.060> balance

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
why sometimes you're having to balance

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.170 
why sometimes you're having to balance
on<00:05:38.690> rungs<00:05:39.410> so<00:05:39.740> what<00:05:39.890> we<00:05:40.010> do<00:05:40.190> is<00:05:40.400> we<00:05:40.820> designed

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
on rungs so what we do is we designed

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
on rungs so what we do is we designed
this<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.570> hold<00:05:42.310> 375<00:05:43.310> pounds<00:05:43.870> now<00:05:44.870> these<00:05:45.020> this

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
this to hold 375 pounds now these this

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.779 
this to hold 375 pounds now these this
way<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.440> remember<00:05:45.710> how<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:45.979> put<00:05:46.220> this<00:05:46.400> on<00:05:46.640> the

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
way to remember how to put this on the

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.520 
way to remember how to put this on the
ladders<00:05:47.060> consider<00:05:47.510> it<00:05:47.600> like<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.780> big<00:05:48.050> mouth<00:05:48.289> and

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530
