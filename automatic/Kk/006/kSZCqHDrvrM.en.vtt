00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139 
that good stuff I also like to change up

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:30.280 
that good stuff I also like to change up
the<00:02:24.290> size<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.920> each<00:02:25.099> section<00:02:29.109> now<00:02:30.109> you'll

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the size of each section now you'll

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.660 
the size of each section now you'll
notice<00:02:30.469> that<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.829> putting<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.250> hot<00:02:31.430> roller

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
notice that I'm putting the hot roller

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.369 
notice that I'm putting the hot roller
kind<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.359> mid-shaft<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.170> then

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
kind of at the mid-shaft and then

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.149 
kind of at the mid-shaft and then
wrapping<00:02:33.889> the<00:02:34.040> ends<00:02:34.639> smoothly<00:02:35.510> around<00:02:36.159> and

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
wrapping the ends smoothly around and

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.920 
wrapping the ends smoothly around and
rolling<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.609> up<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:37.939> scalp<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.569> that's<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
rolling it up to the scalp so that's the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.300 
rolling it up to the scalp so that's the
last<00:02:39.109> clip<00:02:39.439> takes<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.430> medium<00:02:40.790> hold<00:02:41.030> hairspray

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
last clip takes a medium hold hairspray

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.619 
last clip takes a medium hold hairspray
give<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.519> little<00:02:43.669> spray<00:02:44.120> all<00:02:44.450> over<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.450> is

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
give it a little spray all over this is

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.940 
give it a little spray all over this is
usually<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.989> part<00:02:48.260> where<00:02:48.379> I<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.769> kind<00:02:48.919> of
