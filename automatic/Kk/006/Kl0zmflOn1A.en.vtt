with the winner coming in at 28 minutes
in<00:02:13.610> two<00:02:13.850> seconds<00:02:14.330> I'm<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.600> cyclist<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.890> do<00:02:16.220> I

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
in two seconds I'm a cyclist so I do I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.559 
trained for 3-4 hours a day aerobic Lee
anyways<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.100> guess<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.580> carries<00:02:22.910> over<00:02:23.090> as

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
anyways so I guess it carries over as

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.720 
anyways so I guess it carries over as
for<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> global<00:02:24.230> grinders<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.400> was<00:02:25.610> the
