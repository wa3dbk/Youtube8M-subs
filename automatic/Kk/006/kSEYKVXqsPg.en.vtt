00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.110
 since the council has bought more books 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.350

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.759
 ashamed I called the parents can be 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 victims to buy it I really need 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.140
 it just can't be cured even though I already thought 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 that I have too many books about 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 it was enough to drag them to buy 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.400
 diet 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.860

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.230
 cheese valve jerome 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.210

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.050
 humorous prose 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.720
 I love classic mystical prose 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.400
 This is simply chic little books usually those 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040
 more that this is such a classic which 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.620
 need to read here is a book from the category of those 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.510
 who need to read want to lithuania or 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.120

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.850
 the following books were purchased by us 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.380

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.780

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.650

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.090
 divine pretty and good that 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.010
