00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
for medium point on the tip there but

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.330 
for medium point on the tip there but
really<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.510> to<00:02:06.630> take<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> quick<00:02:07.170> or<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.830> very

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
much closer look at these brush tipped

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.290 
much closer look at these brush tipped
markers<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.490> can<00:02:11.640> see<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> pretty

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
markers you can see this is a pretty

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.200 
markers you can see this is a pretty
fine<00:02:12.600> tipped<00:02:12.990> marker

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
fine tipped marker

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.020 
fine tipped marker
but<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> brush<00:02:15.600> works<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.820> so<00:02:17.820> what<00:02:17.940> I'm

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
but the brush works well so what I'm

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
but the brush works well so what I'm
going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.360> today<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.260> take<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
going to do today is I'm going to take a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.610 
going to do today is I'm going to take a
look<00:02:20.430> at<00:02:20.640> each<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.240> these<00:02:21.420> pens<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.110> kind

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
look at each one of these pens and kind

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.590 
look at each one of these pens and kind
of<00:02:22.710> lay<00:02:22.890> down<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.370> color<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> piece<00:02:24.420> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
of lay down the color on a piece of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.510 
of lay down the color on a piece of
paper<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.320> can<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.860> how<00:02:26.160> well<00:02:26.370> they

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
paper so that you can see how well they

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.190 
paper so that you can see how well they
perform<00:02:26.970> I'll<00:02:27.120> try<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.540> some<00:02:27.750> blending

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
perform I'll try to do some blending

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.840 
perform I'll try to do some blending
because<00:02:28.920> these<00:02:29.700> are<00:02:29.850> water-based<00:02:31.730> there's<00:02:32.730> a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
because these are water-based there's a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.340 
because these are water-based there's a
water-based<00:02:33.330> markers<00:02:33.600> so<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:33.990> should<00:02:34.200> be

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
water-based markers so you should be

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.990 
water-based markers so you should be
able<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.650> blend<00:02:34.890> them<00:02:35.070> I've<00:02:35.250> got<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.460> blender

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
able to blend them I've got a blender

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.690 
able to blend them I've got a blender
it's<00:02:36.990> actually<00:02:37.470> prismacolor<00:02:37.920> blender<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:38.670> I

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
it's actually prismacolor blender but I

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.070 
it's actually prismacolor blender but I
use<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> little<00:02:40.860> blending<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:41.490> the

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
use it to do a little blending with the

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.140 
use it to do a little blending with the
kopecks<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.160> these<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.550> well<00:02:44.700> because

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
kopecks and and these as well because

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.480 
kopecks and and these as well because
they're<00:02:45.450> far<00:02:46.320> more<00:02:46.350> inexpensive<00:02:47.220> than<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
they're far more inexpensive than the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.850 
they're far more inexpensive than the
blenders<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:47.970> can<00:02:48.120> buy<00:02:48.270> from<00:02:49.020> either<00:02:49.200> Copic

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
blenders you can buy from either Copic

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.790 
blenders you can buy from either Copic
or<00:02:50.100> faber<00:02:50.700> castell<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.290> was<00:02:52.410> just<00:02:52.560> kind<00:02:52.740> of

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
or faber castell so I was just kind of

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.990 
or faber castell so I was just kind of
showing<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.280> difference<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.850> two

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
showing you the difference in the two

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.770 
showing you the difference in the two
tips<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.600> fine<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.700> medium<00:02:57.270> tip<00:02:57.540> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
tips this fine and the medium tip of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.250 
tips this fine and the medium tip of
standard<00:02:58.770> pens<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.210> aren't<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:01.050> for

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
standard pens and these aren't just for

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.770 
standard pens and these aren't just for
like<00:03:01.440> art<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.370> mean<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.730> could<00:03:02.910> actually<00:03:03.270> use

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
like art I mean you could actually use

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.470 
like art I mean you could actually use
these<00:03:04.110> on<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:05.040> know<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.640> work<00:03:05.850> or<00:03:06.150> school<00:03:06.420> or

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
these on you know for work or school or

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.080 
these on you know for work or school or
whatever<00:03:06.720> they're<00:03:07.260> kind<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.530> cool<00:03:07.710> and<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.970> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
whatever they're kind of cool and like I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.450 
whatever they're kind of cool and like I
said<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.450> ink<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.320> really<00:03:10.800> dark<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
said the ink is really really dark and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.200 
said the ink is really really dark and
deep<00:03:11.670> for<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> for<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> blacks<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.460> I<00:03:14.460> think

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
deep for the for the blacks so I think

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.450 
deep for the for the blacks so I think
what<00:03:15.330> I'll<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.630> here<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.140> we'll<00:03:16.470> take<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> look

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
what I'll do here is we'll take a look

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.090 
what I'll do here is we'll take a look
again<00:03:17.670> I'll<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.090> lay<00:03:18.450> down<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.710> colors

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
again I'll just lay down the the colors

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.710 
again I'll just lay down the the colors
and<00:03:20.310> we'll<00:03:20.400> take<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> look<00:03:20.910> at<00:03:21.030> these<00:03:21.180> one<00:03:21.510> at<00:03:21.660> a

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
and we'll take a look at these one at a

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.420 
and we'll take a look at these one at a
time<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.500> there<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.100> they're<00:03:23.280> all

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
time so there you can see they're all

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.850 
time so there you can see they're all
kind<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.760> collected<00:03:24.210> together<00:03:24.510> here<00:03:24.810> but<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
kind of collected together here but the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.200 
kind of collected together here but the
I<00:03:26.040> think<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.400> cool<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> way<00:03:26.880> favorite

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
I think it's cool the way favorite

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.910 
I think it's cool the way favorite
castel<00:03:27.570> marks<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.080> end<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.410> these<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.770> that

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
castel marks the end of these so that

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.899 
grays and they're all pretty spectacular
actually<00:03:53.720> but<00:03:54.620> they're<00:03:54.769> all<00:03:54.890> brush<00:03:55.189> tips<00:03:55.519> so

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
actually but they're all brush tips so

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.910 
actually but they're all brush tips so
I'm<00:03:56.209> you<00:03:56.659> can<00:03:56.810> see<00:03:56.959> this<00:03:57.079> is<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.290> warm<00:03:57.620> grey

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
I'm you can see this is a warm grey

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.530 
I'm you can see this is a warm grey
right<00:03:58.159> here<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.489> they're<00:03:58.579> all<00:03:58.700> numbered<00:03:59.060> and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
right here and they're all numbered and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.479 
right here and they're all numbered and
everything<00:04:00.409> so<00:04:00.650> I'll<00:04:00.739> start<00:04:01.010> with<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.310> warm

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.690 
everything so I'll start with the warm
grays<00:04:01.819> and<00:04:01.849> gradually<00:04:02.569> get<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.049> cools<00:04:03.700> you

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
grays and gradually get to the cools you

grays and gradually get to the cools you
can<00:04:04.819> see<00:04:05.060> there<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.629> I'm<00:04:06.139> going<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:06.799> try

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
can see there and I'm going to just try

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.759 
can see there and I'm going to just try
to<00:04:07.250> blend<00:04:07.579> them<00:04:07.849> here<00:04:08.170> manually<00:04:09.170> back<00:04:09.530> and

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
to blend them here manually back and

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.789 
to blend them here manually back and
forth<00:04:10.269> so<00:04:11.269> faber-castell<00:04:12.139> like<00:04:12.409> with<00:04:12.620> their

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
forth so faber-castell like with their

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.410 
forth so faber-castell like with their
pencils<00:04:13.220> they<00:04:13.370> have<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.519> numbering<00:04:13.909> system<00:04:14.030> for

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
pencils they have a numbering system for

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.240 
pencils they have a numbering system for
all<00:04:14.659> their<00:04:14.870> colors<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.409> if<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.650> ever<00:04:15.799> you're

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
all their colors so if you ever you're

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.249 
all their colors so if you ever you're
ever<00:04:16.340> curious<00:04:16.639> but<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> like<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.840> they<00:04:17.989> mark

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:18.259 
ever curious but I like that they mark

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.969 
ever curious but I like that they mark
the<00:04:18.440> name<00:04:18.680> on<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.250> pen<00:04:19.579> itself<00:04:19.940> as<00:04:20.239> well

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
the name on the pen itself as well

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.680 
the name on the pen itself as well
that's<00:04:21.979> very<00:04:22.190> helpful<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.330> final

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
that's very helpful and the final

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.659 
that's very helpful and the final
analysis<00:04:24.259> I<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:24.949> to<00:04:25.070> pick<00:04:25.220> up<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.460> pen

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
analysis I just like to pick up a pen

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.430 
analysis I just like to pick up a pen
and<00:04:25.699> look<00:04:26.090> at<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:26.389> not<00:04:26.509> have<00:04:26.720> to<00:04:26.900> go<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.169> color

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
and look at it not have to go to a color

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.010 
and look at it not have to go to a color
chart<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.820> try<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.060> figure<00:04:29.270> out<00:04:29.389> what<00:04:29.599> color<00:04:29.810> it

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
chart to try to figure out what color it

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.870 
chart to try to figure out what color it
is<00:04:30.110> so<00:04:30.440> very<00:04:30.949> happy<00:04:31.250> about<00:04:31.460> that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
is so very happy about that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.720 
is so very happy about that
thank<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.300> favorite<00:04:32.690> Castell

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.450 

next<00:04:39.730> time<00:04:39.850> going<00:04:40.000> to

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
next time going to

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.499 
next time going to
out<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.910> six<00:04:42.490> blue<00:04:43.490> shades<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:44.030> blue<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:46.509> see

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
out the six blue shades of blue so see

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.960 
out the six blue shades of blue so see
what<00:04:47.630> they're<00:04:47.810> like<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.520> they<00:04:49.520> come<00:04:49.729> in<00:04:49.849> these

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
what they're like and they come in these

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.939 
what they're like and they come in these
handy<00:04:50.389> little<00:04:50.569> packets<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.229> know<00:04:51.349> although<00:04:51.500> I

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
handy little packets you know although I

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.070 
handy little packets you know although I
find<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:52.729> it's<00:04:53.180> kind<00:04:53.449> of<00:04:53.539> bothersome<00:04:54.020> to

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
find that it's kind of bothersome to

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.960 
find that it's kind of bothersome to
take<00:04:54.319> them<00:04:54.470> in<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.650> out<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.009> I<00:04:55.069> just<00:04:55.310> kind<00:04:55.910> of

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
take them in and out so I just kind of

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.770 
take them in and out so I just kind of
stick<00:04:56.270> them<00:04:56.419> all<00:04:56.539> together<00:04:58.240> kind<00:04:59.240> of<00:04:59.330> list<00:04:59.630> the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
stick them all together kind of list the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.210 
stick them all together kind of list the
color<00:04:59.990> so<00:05:00.289> if<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.410> never<00:05:00.560> need<00:05:00.889> to<00:05:00.919> put<00:05:01.130> them

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
color so if you never need to put them

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.210 
color so if you never need to put them
back<00:05:01.400> you<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:03.080> here<00:05:03.380> again<00:05:03.919> I'm<00:05:04.039> going<00:05:04.160> to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
back you can but here again I'm going to

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.589 
back you can but here again I'm going to
just<00:05:04.340> get<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:04.520> number<00:05:04.729> them<00:05:05.000> and<00:05:05.150> you<00:05:05.210> can<00:05:05.389> see

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
just get a number them and you can see

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.939 
just get a number them and you can see
the<00:05:06.080> color<00:05:06.319> here<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:06.770> pretty<00:05:07.009> good

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.439 

so<00:05:10.949> think<00:05:11.189> I'll<00:05:11.279> take<00:05:11.459> a<00:05:11.519> look<00:05:11.729> at<00:05:11.909> the<00:05:11.999> rest<00:05:12.239> of

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
so think I'll take a look at the rest of

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.629 
so think I'll take a look at the rest of
the<00:05:12.539> sets<00:05:12.809> here<00:05:13.080> all<00:05:13.289> at<00:05:13.469> once<00:05:13.709> we'll<00:05:14.009> put<00:05:14.459> down

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
the sets here all at once we'll put down

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.669 
the sets here all at once we'll put down
the<00:05:14.789> color<00:05:15.029> and<00:05:15.299> then<00:05:15.389> I'll<00:05:15.509> blend<00:05:15.779> some<00:05:16.110> we'll

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:16.679 
the color and then I'll blend some we'll

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:19.459 
the color and then I'll blend some we'll
go<00:05:16.889> through<00:05:17.159> it<00:05:17.279> in<00:05:17.459> fast-forward<00:05:18.059> so<00:05:18.509> um<00:05:18.719> it

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:19.469 
go through it in fast-forward so um it

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.229 
go through it in fast-forward so um it
won't<00:05:19.619> you<00:05:20.339> won't<00:05:20.459> have<00:05:20.579> to<00:05:20.729> wade<00:05:20.939> through<00:05:20.969> all

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:21.239 
won't you won't have to wade through all

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:23.449 
won't you won't have to wade through all
of<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.509> time<00:05:21.869> but<00:05:22.079> you<00:05:22.259> can<00:05:22.439> see<00:05:22.679> the<00:05:23.249> color

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:23.459 
of that time but you can see the color

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:24.769 
of that time but you can see the color
go<00:05:23.729> down<00:05:23.939> and<00:05:24.179> then<00:05:24.269> you'll<00:05:24.389> see<00:05:24.599> how<00:05:24.719> the

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:24.779 
go down and then you'll see how the

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.719 
go down and then you'll see how the
blender<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.709> blending<00:05:26.129> works<00:05:26.339> with<00:05:26.579> these

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
blender the blending works with these

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:50.350 
blender the blending works with these
which<00:05:26.969> is<00:05:27.289> actually<00:05:28.289> pretty<00:05:28.499> extraordinary

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.549 

so<00:05:51.360> what<00:05:51.479> I'm<00:05:51.569> going<00:05:51.689> to<00:05:51.719> do<00:05:51.869> here<00:05:52.080> is<00:05:52.229> blend

00:05:52.549 --> 00:05:52.559 
so what I'm going to do here is blend

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.200 
so what I'm going to do here is blend
these<00:05:52.770> colors<00:05:53.249> and<00:05:53.369> you<00:05:53.460> can<00:05:53.580> see<00:05:53.639> how<00:05:54.029> they

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
these colors and you can see how they

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.029 
these colors and you can see how they
sort<00:05:54.509> of<00:05:54.629> all<00:05:54.839> blend<00:05:55.139> in<00:05:55.349> here<00:05:55.650> and<00:05:55.740> I'm<00:05:55.800> just

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 
sort of all blend in here and I'm just

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:58.969 
sort of all blend in here and I'm just
using<00:05:56.249> that<00:05:56.550> I<00:05:56.729> was<00:05:56.939> just<00:05:57.089> using<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.800> at<00:05:58.800> an

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
using that I was just using that at an

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.609 
using that I was just using that at an
expensive<00:05:59.520> prismacolor<00:06:00.389> blender<00:06:01.080> here<00:06:01.349> and

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:01.619 
expensive prismacolor blender here and

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:04.129 
expensive prismacolor blender here and
then<00:06:02.249> I'll<00:06:02.399> blend<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.909> rest<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.719> these<00:06:03.839> I'll

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
then I'll blend the rest of these I'll

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.170 
then I'll blend the rest of these I'll
do<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.439> same<00:06:04.619> thing<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:05.069> I'll<00:06:05.189> let<00:06:05.819> it<00:06:05.849> show

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
do the same thing and I'll let it show

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:27.180 
do the same thing and I'll let it show
you<00:06:06.240> how<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.419> worked

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.220 

so<00:06:28.190> I<00:06:28.220> guess<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.000> pros<00:06:29.600> of<00:06:29.870> these<00:06:30.020> are

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:30.230 
so I guess the the pros of these are

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.320 
so I guess the the pros of these are
that<00:06:30.380> they're<00:06:30.590> really<00:06:31.010> nice<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.910> ink<00:06:32.120> is

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
that they're really nice the ink is

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.020 
that they're really nice the ink is
great<00:06:32.630> it's<00:06:32.930> water-based<00:06:33.620> it's<00:06:34.310> permanent

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
great it's water-based it's permanent

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.780 
great it's water-based it's permanent
it's<00:06:35.210> very<00:06:35.540> light<00:06:35.870> fast<00:06:36.430> they're<00:06:37.430> made<00:06:37.639> in

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
it's very light fast they're made in

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.420 
it's very light fast they're made in
Germany<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:38.630> they're<00:06:38.840> probably<00:06:39.169> the<00:06:40.040> quality

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
Germany so they're probably the quality

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.310 
Germany so they're probably the quality
control<00:06:40.729> there's<00:06:41.000> probably<00:06:41.540> excellent<00:06:42.260> as

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
control there's probably excellent as

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.820 
control there's probably excellent as
with<00:06:43.070> most<00:06:43.250> faber<00:06:43.610> castell<00:06:43.880> products<00:06:44.830> and

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:45.830 
with most faber castell products and

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.939 
with most faber castell products and
hardly<00:06:46.370> ever<00:06:46.490> disappointed<00:06:47.240> by<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.419> quality

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:47.949 
hardly ever disappointed by the quality

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.010 
hardly ever disappointed by the quality
one<00:06:48.949> thing<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.669> I<00:06:49.699> noticed<00:06:50.180> as<00:06:50.300> a<00:06:50.330> con<00:06:50.630> was<00:06:50.900> I

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.020 
one thing that I noticed as a con was I

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.740 
one thing that I noticed as a con was I
got<00:06:51.199> some<00:06:51.410> paper<00:06:51.620> graining<00:06:52.160> as<00:06:52.310> I<00:06:52.340> worked<00:06:53.210> the

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
got some paper graining as I worked the

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.200 
got some paper graining as I worked the
markers<00:06:54.229> into<00:06:54.500> the<00:06:54.620> paper<00:06:54.860> if<00:06:55.130> I<00:06:55.310> did<00:06:56.000> some

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
markers into the paper if I did some

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.180 
markers into the paper if I did some
layering<00:06:56.510> or<00:06:56.840> whatever<00:06:57.169> the<00:06:57.380> paper<00:06:57.590> gets<00:06:57.889> wet

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
layering or whatever the paper gets wet

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.550 
layering or whatever the paper gets wet
enough<00:06:58.430> and<00:06:58.669> then<00:06:58.760> you<00:06:58.850> get<00:06:59.000> these<00:06:59.150> little

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
enough and then you get these little

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.230 
enough and then you get these little
paper<00:07:00.560> grain<00:07:00.950> kind<00:07:01.340> of<00:07:01.430> comes<00:07:01.669> up<00:07:01.820> off<00:07:02.060> the

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
paper grain kind of comes up off the

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.820 
paper grain kind of comes up off the
paper<00:07:02.479> and<00:07:02.630> that<00:07:02.780> can<00:07:02.990> have<00:07:03.169> as<00:07:03.290> much<00:07:03.440> to<00:07:03.680> do

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:03.830 
paper and that can have as much to do

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.100 
paper and that can have as much to do
frankly<00:07:04.700> with<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:05.060> paper<00:07:05.419> quality<00:07:05.600> as<00:07:05.930> it

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
frankly with the paper quality as it

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.780 
frankly with the paper quality as it
does<00:07:06.290> the<00:07:06.440> marker<00:07:06.800> itself<00:07:07.160> so<00:07:07.370> I'm<00:07:07.490> not<00:07:07.639> going

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
does the marker itself so I'm not going

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.940 
does the marker itself so I'm not going
to<00:07:07.850> hold<00:07:07.940> that<00:07:08.150> against<00:07:08.510> favor<00:07:08.690> castel<00:07:09.229> but

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 
to hold that against favor castel but

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.920 
to hold that against favor castel but
but<00:07:10.760> that's<00:07:10.940> something<00:07:11.270> to<00:07:11.360> look<00:07:11.510> out<00:07:11.660> for

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
but that's something to look out for

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.170 
but that's something to look out for
when<00:07:12.110> you're<00:07:12.229> using<00:07:12.470> these<00:07:12.760> one<00:07:13.760> other<00:07:13.940> note

when you're using these one other note
you'll<00:07:14.450> notice<00:07:14.780> on<00:07:14.930> each<00:07:15.110> one<00:07:15.320> of<00:07:15.410> the<00:07:15.500> pens

you'll notice on each one of the pens

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.620 
you'll notice on each one of the pens
there's<00:07:16.010> little<00:07:16.280> tiny<00:07:16.490> asterisks<00:07:17.240> and<00:07:17.270> what
