one<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:39.950> then<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.880> going<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.360> is<00:02:42.600> I'm

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
one but then what I'm going to do is I'm

and<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.980> will<00:02:44.100> get<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.340> card<00:02:45.260> ok<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.070> thought

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and I will get the card ok so I thought

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.030 
and I will get the card ok so I thought
I<00:02:47.490> would<00:02:47.610> try<00:02:47.880> back<00:02:48.300> card<00:02:48.750> today<00:02:49.020> we<00:02:49.770> normally

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
less yellow on this graphics card then I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.690 
less yellow on this graphics card then I
was<00:03:20.010> expecting<00:03:20.870> I<00:03:22.250> was<00:03:23.250> kind<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.490> expecting

was expecting I was kind of expecting
there<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.210> I<00:03:24.630> know<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.320> meant<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
there to be I know it's meant to

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.770 
there to be I know it's meant to
represent<00:03:26.010> like<00:03:26.490> an<00:03:26.670> ex<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.210> doesn't<00:03:27.570> meet

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the middle of the fan and as I was guess

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.050 
the middle of the fan and as I was guess
I<00:03:31.470> was<00:03:31.590> kind<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.890> expecting<00:03:32.100> more<00:03:32.610> yellow

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
I was kind of expecting more yellow

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660 
I was kind of expecting more yellow
because<00:03:33.360> people<00:03:33.750> have<00:03:33.840> come<00:03:33.990> to<00:03:34.670> appreciate

because people have come to appreciate
the<00:03:36.390> yellow<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> lot<00:03:36.870> more<00:03:37.050> with<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.560> these

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
the yellow a lot more with the these

don't<00:03:51.870> think<00:03:51.990> there's<00:03:52.350> enough<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.950> you<00:03:53.280> know

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
don't think there's enough but you know

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.560 
don't think there's enough but you know
maybe<00:03:53.790> we'll<00:03:54.000> see<00:03:54.120> i<00:03:54.150> don't<00:03:54.270> know<00:03:54.450> whether

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
maybe we'll see i don't know whether

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.850 
maybe we'll see i don't know whether
this<00:03:54.720> lights<00:03:54.960> up<00:03:55.200> yet<00:03:55.380> because<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.680> quite

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
this lights up yet because it quite

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.590 
this lights up yet because it quite
literally<00:03:56.130> has<00:03:56.430> not<00:03:57.410> been<00:03:58.850> in<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.970> Rickett<00:04:00.390> and

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
literally has not been in a Rickett and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.870 
literally has not been in a Rickett and
i'm<00:04:01.110> actually<00:04:01.320> trying<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.800> have<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.640> look<00:04:02.820> round

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
i'm actually trying to have a look round

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.230 
i'm actually trying to have a look round
the<00:04:03.150> back<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.160> if<00:04:05.250> there's<00:04:05.490> any<00:04:05.670> light<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
the back and see if there's any light to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.070 
the back and see if there's any light to
anything<00:04:06.360> now<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:09.090> does<00:04:09.300> look<00:04:09.330> like<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.900> might

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
anything now it does look like it might

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.550 
anything now it does look like it might
but<00:04:10.890> we'll<00:04:11.070> look<00:04:11.570> later<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.930> obviously<00:04:13.320> there

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
but we'll look later now obviously there

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.710 
but we'll look later now obviously there
are<00:04:13.590> two<00:04:13.770> SLI<00:04:14.390> connectors<00:04:15.390> like<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.660> would

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
are two SLI connectors like there would

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.560 
are two SLI connectors like there would
be<00:04:15.780> on<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.020> normal<00:04:16.320> 780<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:18.060> does<00:04:18.299> mean<00:04:18.510> that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
be on the normal 780 that does mean that

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.960 
be on the normal 780 that does mean that
we<00:04:18.840> can<00:04:18.959> obviously<00:04:19.170> do<00:04:19.470> dual<00:04:20.400> would<00:04:20.640> be<00:04:20.760> one

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
we can obviously do dual would be one

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.070 
we can obviously do dual would be one

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
but if you're going to do triple you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.290 
but if you're going to do triple you
need<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> second<00:04:22.710> one<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.760> cut<00:04:23.910> does<00:04:24.090> kind

would have thought it would have been a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
better idea to have actively or at least

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.800 
better idea to have actively or at least
had<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.770> back<00:05:17.700> plate<00:05:17.910> cooling<00:05:18.360> needs<00:05:18.510> but

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
had the back plate cooling needs but

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.400 
had the back plate cooling needs but
they've<00:05:19.710> obviously<00:05:19.860> decided<00:05:20.430> otherwise<00:05:21.410> nice

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
they've obviously decided otherwise nice

and that's why they are they cover more

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.290 
and that's why they are they cover more
of<00:05:45.390> it<00:05:45.690> now<00:05:46.470> if<00:05:46.560> we<00:05:46.680> come<00:05:46.860> round<00:05:47.070> to<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.250> back

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.390 

I've<00:05:51.300> left<00:05:51.570> these<00:05:51.780> bits<00:05:52.080> covered<00:05:53.010> up<00:05:53.130> but<00:05:53.310> you

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
I've left these bits covered up but you

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.320 
I've left these bits covered up but you
should<00:05:53.550> be<00:05:53.640> able<00:05:53.700> to<00:05:53.820> tell<00:05:53.970> by<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.150> size

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
should be able to tell by the size

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.510 
should be able to tell by the size
because<00:05:54.600> I'm<00:05:54.690> not<00:05:54.810> meant<00:05:55.110> to<00:05:55.260> this<00:05:56.190> is<00:05:56.340> just

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
because I'm not meant to this is just

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.220 
because I'm not meant to this is just
meant<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.730> be<00:05:56.790> me<00:05:57.030> giving<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> look<00:05:57.930> at<00:05:58.110> the

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 
meant to be me giving you a look at the

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.500 
meant to be me giving you a look at the
card<00:05:58.470> I'm<00:05:58.680> not<00:05:58.800> really<00:05:58.980> meant<00:05:59.220> to<00:05:59.310> talk<00:06:00.180> in

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
card I'm not really meant to talk in

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.390 
card I'm not really meant to talk in
depth<00:06:00.870> about<00:06:01.080> well<00:06:01.770> I'm<00:06:01.830> not<00:06:01.920> allowed<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.160> say

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
depth about well I'm not allowed to say

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.100 
depth about well I'm not allowed to say
anything<00:06:02.430> about<00:06:02.790> call<00:06:03.240> collapse<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:03.990> not

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
anything about call collapse and not

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.240 
anything about call collapse and not
allowed<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.440> say<00:06:04.590> anything<00:06:04.620> about<00:06:04.920> real

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
allowed to say anything about real

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.370 
allowed to say anything about real
performance<00:06:05.820> you'll<00:06:06.600> notice<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.080> didn't<00:06:07.320> say

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
performance you'll notice I didn't say

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.890 
performance you'll notice I didn't say
anything<00:06:07.470> about<00:06:07.800> fan<00:06:08.190> sizes<00:06:08.850> because<00:06:09.450> I<00:06:09.660> can

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
anything about fan sizes because I can

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.570 
anything about fan sizes because I can
get<00:06:10.050> a<00:06:10.080> lot<00:06:10.290> of<00:06:10.350> trouble<00:06:10.680> for<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.950> so<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:11.430> is

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
get a lot of trouble for it so this is

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.570 
get a lot of trouble for it so this is
just<00:06:11.760> a<00:06:11.940> quick<00:06:12.210> brief<00:06:12.750> look<00:06:13.160> we<00:06:14.160> will<00:06:14.340> be<00:06:14.460> doing

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
just a quick brief look we will be doing

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.410 
just a quick brief look we will be doing
a<00:06:14.910> full<00:06:15.600> size<00:06:15.930> you<00:06:16.410> know<00:06:17.090> video<00:06:18.090> and

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
a full size you know video and

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.410 
a full size you know video and
everything<00:06:19.370> afterwards<00:06:20.370> on<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.820> main<00:06:21.120> time

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
everything afterwards on the main time

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.030 
everything afterwards on the main time
to<00:06:21.600> lift<00:06:21.720> channel<00:06:22.050> but<00:06:22.260> yeah<00:06:22.620> I<00:06:22.650> just<00:06:22.890> thought

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
to lift channel but yeah I just thought

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.470 
to lift channel but yeah I just thought
I'd<00:06:24.710> give<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:25.740> our<00:06:26.130> first<00:06:26.550> kind<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:27.030> I<00:06:27.240> would

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
I'd give you our first kind of I would

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:32.780 
I'd give you our first kind of I would
say<00:06:27.630> in-depth<00:06:28.200> look<00:06:28.380> but<00:06:30.710> yeah<00:06:31.710> there's<00:06:32.580> a<00:06:32.640> lot

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
say in-depth look but yeah there's a lot

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.760 
say in-depth look but yeah there's a lot
more<00:06:32.820> you<00:06:33.120> can<00:06:33.150> see<00:06:33.330> there's<00:06:33.540> a<00:06:33.770> secondary

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
more you can see there's a secondary

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.100 
more you can see there's a secondary
heat<00:06:35.729> sink<00:06:36.030> down<00:06:36.270> here<00:06:36.510> as<00:06:36.660> well<00:06:36.780> this<00:06:36.960> is

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
heat sink down here as well this is

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.980 
heat sink down here as well this is
obviously<00:06:37.229> cooling

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.410 

the<00:06:40.590> memory<00:06:41.040> and<00:06:41.340> the<00:06:41.370> MOSFETs<00:06:41.910> and<00:06:42.120> stuff<00:06:42.300> and

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
the memory and the MOSFETs and stuff and

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.640 
the memory and the MOSFETs and stuff and
it's<00:06:42.570> fairly<00:06:42.810> long<00:06:43.080> contract<00:06:43.560> the<00:06:43.620> way<00:06:43.710> down

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
it's fairly long contract the way down

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.290 
it's fairly long contract the way down
something<00:06:46.650> it'll<00:06:47.040> also<00:06:47.160> add<00:06:47.340> a<00:06:47.550> lot<00:06:47.850> more<00:06:47.910> and

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
something it'll also add a lot more and

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.630 
something it'll also add a lot more and
rigidity<00:06:48.630> to<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:51.290> bum<00:06:52.290> ba-bum<00:06:52.440> ba-bum<00:06:52.680> will

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
rigidity to the bum ba-bum ba-bum will

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.490 
rigidity to the bum ba-bum ba-bum will
also<00:06:53.910> add<00:06:54.150> a<00:06:54.180> lot<00:06:54.390> more<00:06:54.450> rigidity<00:06:54.840> to<00:06:55.200> the<00:06:55.230> card

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:55.500 
also add a lot more rigidity to the card

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.260 
also add a lot more rigidity to the card
I<00:06:55.740> think<00:06:56.250> probably<00:06:56.460> the<00:06:56.700> reason<00:06:56.850> why<00:06:57.120> they've

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
I think probably the reason why they've

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.090 
I think probably the reason why they've
got<00:06:57.390> that<00:06:57.480> individual<00:06:58.200> bit<00:06:58.380> which<00:06:58.590> will<00:06:58.830> only

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
got that individual bit which will only

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.680 
got that individual bit which will only
you<00:06:59.670> know<00:06:59.790> the<00:06:59.910> one<00:07:00.030> in<00:07:00.150> the<00:07:00.210> box<00:07:00.420> that<00:07:00.600> will

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
you know the one in the box that will

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.780 
you know the one in the box that will
come<00:07:00.870> here<00:07:01.230> so<00:07:01.980> that<00:07:02.010> you<00:07:02.220> can<00:07:02.400> leave<00:07:02.550> this

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790 
come here so that you can leave this

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
come here so that you can leave this
area<00:07:03.030> open<00:07:03.750> for<00:07:04.740> the<00:07:05.030> hardcore<00:07:06.030> overclockers

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
area open for the hardcore overclockers

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.840 
area open for the hardcore overclockers
to<00:07:07.020> do<00:07:07.170> their<00:07:07.410> um<00:07:08.180> die<00:07:09.180> spots<00:07:09.570> and<00:07:09.840> the<00:07:10.500> like

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
to do their um die spots and the like

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.630 
to do their um die spots and the like
but<00:07:11.850> anyway<00:07:12.090> right<00:07:13.070> now<00:07:14.070> I'm<00:07:14.220> getting<00:07:14.340> fed<00:07:14.580> up

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
but anyway right now I'm getting fed up

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.930 
but anyway right now I'm getting fed up
with<00:07:14.850> holding<00:07:15.150> this<00:07:15.240> camera<00:07:15.300> in<00:07:15.660> my<00:07:15.750> hand<00:07:16.940> but

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
with holding this camera in my hand but

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.150 
with holding this camera in my hand but
we've<00:07:18.120> given<00:07:18.330> you<00:07:18.420> a<00:07:18.510> good<00:07:18.720> look<00:07:18.900> or<00:07:19.740> as<00:07:19.890> good

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530 
as we can do anyway it's now time for me

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.960 
as we can do anyway it's now time for me
to<00:07:23.660> break<00:07:24.660> off<00:07:24.900> from<00:07:24.930> this<00:07:25.580> and<00:07:26.580> you<00:07:26.730> will<00:07:26.850> be

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
to break off from this and you will be

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.670
