just<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.730> get<00:00:43.820> that<00:00:43.879> little<00:00:44.000> thrill<00:00:50.320> you

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
just to get that little thrill you

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.650

notice<00:00:51.620> I'm<00:00:51.739> not<00:00:51.769> rubbing<00:00:52.399> great<00:00:52.699> big<00:00:52.940> areas

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
notice I'm not rubbing great big areas

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.250 
notice I'm not rubbing great big areas
I'm<00:00:53.749> keeping<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.409> rubbing<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.949> a<00:00:54.980> minimum<00:00:56.260> and

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
I'm keeping the rubbing to a minimum and

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.809 
I'm keeping the rubbing to a minimum and
it's<00:00:57.679> simply<00:00:58.070> just<00:00:58.129> to<00:00:58.460> smooth<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.239> white

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
it's simply just to smooth in the white

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:03.570 
it's simply just to smooth in the white
so<00:01:01.819> that<00:01:01.850> it's<00:01:02.089> not<00:01:02.239> to<00:01:02.420> chalky<00:01:02.960> looking<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
so that it's not to chalky looking and

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.420 
so that it's not to chalky looking and
in<00:01:04.580> fact<00:01:05.290> I'm<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:06.470> going<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.800> take<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.040> little

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
in fact I'm just going to take a little

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.590 
in fact I'm just going to take a little
light<00:01:08.320> dusting<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.760> pink<00:01:10.760> all<00:01:10.970> for<00:01:11.180> that<00:01:11.330> to

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
light dusting of pink all for that to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.110 
light dusting of pink all for that to
make<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:11.930> softer<00:01:12.440> another<00:01:13.370> thing<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.730> do<00:01:13.790> is

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
make it softer another thing I do is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.360 
make it softer another thing I do is
rather<00:01:14.720> than<00:01:14.870> try<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:15.350> finish<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:15.830> here<00:01:16.190> I

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
rather than try and finish it here I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.880 
rather than try and finish it here I
like<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.450> look<00:01:17.600> at<00:01:17.750> things<00:01:17.960> away<00:01:18.470> from<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
like to look at things away from the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.760 
like to look at things away from the
scene<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.370> finish<00:01:20.210> it<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.480> studio<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.260> I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
scene and finish it in studio and I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.800 
scene and finish it in studio and I
always<00:01:22.010> take<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.250> digital<00:01:22.850> image<00:01:23.120> of<00:01:23.330> the

subject<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.510> printer<00:01:26.510> offers<00:01:26.690> a<00:01:26.900> little

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
subject and printer offers a little

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.500 
subject and printer offers a little
photo<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.310> I've<00:01:28.460> got<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.090> back<00:01:29.270> up

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
photo and then I've got that to back up

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.420 
photo and then I've got that to back up
when<00:01:29.690> I<00:01:29.720> go<00:01:29.930> back<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:30.500> are<00:01:30.650> always<00:01:30.950> treating

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
when I go back so are always treating

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.360 
when I go back so are always treating
the<00:01:31.760> outdoors<00:01:32.270> as<00:01:32.600> being<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.350> important<00:01:34.040> part

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
the outdoors as being the important part

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.700 
the outdoors as being the important part
but<00:01:34.640> it's<00:01:34.790> never<00:01:35.030> finished<00:01:35.300> until<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:35.990> look<00:01:36.500> at

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
but it's never finished until I look at

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.890 
but it's never finished until I look at
it<00:01:37.120> back<00:01:38.120> at<00:01:38.300> the<00:01:38.420> ranch<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.990> check<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:39.590> out

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900

it's<00:01:41.900> actually<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.290> lovely<00:01:42.500> dusting<00:01:43.130> of

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's actually a lovely dusting of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.370 
it's actually a lovely dusting of
bluebells<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.390> other<00:01:44.630> flowers<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.290> the

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
bluebells and other flowers in the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.900 
bluebells and other flowers in the
background<00:01:45.860> so<00:01:46.130> I'm<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.370> going<00:01:46.520> to<00:01:46.610> bring<00:01:46.760> in

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
background so I'm just going to bring in

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.300 
background so I'm just going to bring in
a<00:01:47.000> few<00:01:47.030> specks<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:48.850> color<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.480> suggest

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
a few specks of color just to suggest

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.030 
a few specks of color just to suggest
flower<00:01:52.310> types<00:01:52.730> and<00:01:53.480> flower<00:01:53.780> shapes<00:01:54.200> without

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
flower types and flower shapes without

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.930 
flower types and flower shapes without
being<00:01:55.430> too<00:01:55.670> detailed<00:01:56.150> I<00:01:57.550> want<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.640> get<00:01:58.730> this

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
being too detailed I want to get this

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.480 
being too detailed I want to get this
really<00:01:59.600> dark

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
really dark

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.859 
really dark
so<00:02:02.000> again<00:02:02.210> rather<00:02:02.479> than<00:02:02.810> trying<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:04.570> find<00:02:05.570> I'm

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
so again rather than trying to find I'm

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.559 
so again rather than trying to find I'm
sure<00:02:05.900> if<00:02:06.350> I<00:02:06.470> dug<00:02:06.770> deep<00:02:07.040> enough<00:02:07.310> into<00:02:07.549> my<00:02:07.820> box<00:02:08.119> I

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
sure if I dug deep enough into my box I

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.309 
sure if I dug deep enough into my box I
would<00:02:09.289> find<00:02:09.590> near<00:02:10.399> enough<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.850> color<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.750> put

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
would find near enough the color but put

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.920 
would find near enough the color but put
together<00:02:12.470> with<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.010> blue<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.600> dark

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
together with the blue and the very dark

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.000 
together with the blue and the very dark
brown<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:16.270> mixture<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.510> fairly<00:02:17.930> close<00:02:18.319> in

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
brown the mixture is fairly close in

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.080 
brown the mixture is fairly close in
color<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.300> gives<00:02:20.450> me<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> impression

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
color and it gives me the impression

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.550 
color and it gives me the impression
that's<00:02:23.090> what<00:02:23.300> I'm<00:02:23.450> after<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> impression

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that's what I'm after is the impression

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.870 
that's what I'm after is the impression
of<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.800> flower<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.190> don't<00:02:25.489> want<00:02:25.610> anything

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
of the flower I don't want anything

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.809 
of the flower I don't want anything
