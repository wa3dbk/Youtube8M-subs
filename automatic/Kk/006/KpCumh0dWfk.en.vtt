00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:08.179 
you know the way I used to do periods

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:11.350 
you know the way I used to do periods
actually<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.470> would<00:01:10.340> hold<00:01:10.520> down<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:11.330> left

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
actually was I would hold down the left

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.700 
actually was I would hold down the left
numerical<00:01:12.170> button<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:13.000> then<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.090> would<00:01:14.240> just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
numerical button and then I would just

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.400 
numerical button and then I would just
you<00:01:15.710> know<00:01:15.740> move<00:01:16.429> it<00:01:16.550> up<00:01:16.670> to<00:01:16.880> while<00:01:17.810> my<00:01:18.020> thumb<00:01:18.289> is

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
you know move it up to while my thumb is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.260 
you know move it up to while my thumb is
still<00:01:18.590> holding<00:01:18.740> down<00:01:18.979> up<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.820> period<00:01:20.060> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
still holding down up to the period and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.999 
still holding down up to the period and
let<00:01:20.390> go<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:20.929> then<00:01:21.530> it<00:01:21.649> would<00:01:21.740> give<00:01:21.860> me<00:01:21.890> a

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
let go and then it would give me a

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.100 
let go and then it would give me a
period<00:01:22.460> up<00:01:22.580> at<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.759> top<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.270> it<00:01:23.840> would<00:01:23.960> take

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
period up at the top and it would take

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.710 
period up at the top and it would take
me<00:01:24.229> back<00:01:24.410> to<00:01:24.590> my<00:01:24.619> standard<00:01:25.220> keyboard<00:01:25.720> but

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.790 
me back to my standard keyboard but
something<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> just<00:01:27.170> learned<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.470> was<00:01:27.649> pretty

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.389 
cool it's erase that period is just you
can<00:01:31.580> actually<00:01:31.759> just<00:01:32.569> have<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.530> spacebar

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
can actually just have the spacebar

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.600 
can actually just have the spacebar
twice<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:37.119> 12<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:39.170> goes<00:01:39.319> ahead<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.920> gives<00:01:40.520> you

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
twice so 12 it goes ahead and gives you

twice so 12 it goes ahead and gives you
a<00:01:40.640> period<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.209> a<00:01:41.450> space<00:01:41.920> let's<00:01:42.920> do<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.069> little

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
a period and a space let's do a little

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.600 
a period and a space let's do a little
