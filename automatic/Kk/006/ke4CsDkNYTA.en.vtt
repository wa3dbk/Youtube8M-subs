00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
what's up guys la Pueblo here doing some

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.829 
what's up guys la Pueblo here doing some
of<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.879> internal<00:00:03.529> Batman<00:00:04.529> Arkham<00:00:04.859> Knights

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.820 
of the internal Batman Arkham Knights
benchmarking<00:00:06.839> tool<00:00:07.109> let's<00:00:07.410> just<00:00:07.470> check<00:00:07.680> it

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
benchmarking tool let's just check it

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.230 
benchmarking tool let's just check it
out<00:00:07.919> we're<00:00:08.040> gonna<00:00:08.099> do<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.370> 1920<00:00:08.940> we've<00:00:09.090> already

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
out we're gonna do it 1920 we've already

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.789 
out we're gonna do it 1920 we've already
done<00:00:09.510> for<00:00:09.540> k<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.290> 1440p<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.799> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
done for k and 1440p so this is the the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.709 
done for k and 1440p so this is the the
game<00:00:13.980> maxed<00:00:14.370> out<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.969> benchmark<00:00:15.540> we're

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
game maxed out with the benchmark we're

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:16.820 
game maxed out with the benchmark we're
going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.260> show<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.770> then

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
going to do that to show you and then

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
going to do that to show you and then
we're<00:00:16.980> going<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> performance<00:00:17.970> tests

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
we're going to do the performance tests

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.890 
we're going to do the performance tests
and<00:00:18.770> see<00:00:19.770> how<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.130> runs<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> um<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.420> got

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and see how this runs I have it um I got

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.259 
and see how this runs I have it um I got
it<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.230> uh<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.710> game<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.130> capped<00:00:23.400> but

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
it probably uh the game is on capped but

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.880 
it probably uh the game is on capped but
I<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.570> at<00:00:24.660> 150<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:25.800> we're

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I have it at 150 I don't think we're

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
I have it at 150 I don't think we're
going<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.130> heading<00:00:26.220> andreea<00:00:26.609> 50<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:27.000> one

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to be heading andreea 50 with one

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.769 
going to be heading andreea 50 with one
card<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.810> let's<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.039> runs<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:30.179> we

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
card so let's just see how it runs if we

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.780 
card so let's just see how it runs if we
hit<00:00:30.900> 150<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> gotta<00:00:32.309> have<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> change

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
hit 150 you know I gotta have to change

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.220 
hit 150 you know I gotta have to change
it<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.630> don't<00:00:33.750> think<00:00:33.870> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it but I don't think we're going to be a

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.670 
it but I don't think we're going to be a
150th<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> performance<00:00:36.059> test<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.559> like

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
150th on a performance test so I'm like

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.869 
150th on a performance test so I'm like
I<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:37.920> saying<00:00:38.100> if<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> guys<00:00:38.430> didn't<00:00:38.670> see<00:00:38.760> my

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I was saying if you guys didn't see my

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.130 
I was saying if you guys didn't see my
other<00:00:38.969> videos<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.840> disappointed

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
other videos I'm a little disappointed

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.069 
other videos I'm a little disappointed
with<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> game<00:00:41.030> one<00:00:42.030> thing<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> me<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.780> an

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
with the game one thing to me is just an

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.760 
with the game one thing to me is just an
absolute<00:00:43.309> slack<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:45.750> consumers<00:00:46.230> face<00:00:46.469> is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
absolute slack and the consumers face is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
absolute slack and the consumers face is
that<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.160> release<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.700> game<00:00:47.960> which<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that they release the game which is a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680 
that they release the game which is a
absolutely<00:00:49.980> horrendous<00:00:50.190> port<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.390> game

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
absolutely horrendous port this game

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.860 
absolutely horrendous port this game
with<00:00:52.620> no<00:00:53.010> mouse<00:00:53.520> settings<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.300> I've<00:00:54.570> seen

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
with no mouse settings now I've seen

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.240 
with no mouse settings now I've seen
other<00:00:55.020> games<00:00:55.350> where<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.890> no<00:00:56.039> mouse

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
other games where there is no mouse

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
other games where there is no mouse
settings<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> camera<00:00:57.629> settings

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
settings but it's the camera settings

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
settings but it's the camera settings
that<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.260> could<00:00:58.500> adjust<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.210> for

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that you could adjust that you know for

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.150 
that you could adjust that you know for
your<00:01:00.480> mouse<00:01:00.690> sensitivity<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.920> has

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
your mouse sensitivity but this has

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.660 
your mouse sensitivity but this has
neither<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.559> into<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.920> any<00:01:05.309> file

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
neither you have to go into the any file

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.170 
neither you have to go into the any file
and<00:01:06.000> modify<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.049> from<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.700> adjust<00:01:09.060> your

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and modify it from there to adjust your

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
and modify it from there to adjust your
mouse<00:01:09.360> settings<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.930> me<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
mouse settings to me that is just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
mouse settings to me that is just
ludicrous<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.150> insane<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:12.990> just
