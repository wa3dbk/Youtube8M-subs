disprove that fade quickly what I've

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.400 
disprove that fade quickly what I've
decided<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.170> do<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.790> first<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:33.930> done

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
decided to do here is first of all done

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.069 
decided to do here is first of all done
this<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.860> 5d<00:00:35.250> Mark<00:00:35.430> 3<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.930> want

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this with my 5d Mark 3 and what I want

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
this with my 5d Mark 3 and what I want
to<00:00:37.140> shoot<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.860> 7d<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> guy

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
to shoot with is a 7d because a guy

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.049 
to shoot with is a 7d because a guy
specifically<00:00:39.629> asked<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.110> 7d<00:00:40.620> so

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
specifically asked about a 7d so

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.010 
specifically asked about a 7d so
hopefully<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.210> see<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.809> there's

hopefully you can see there that there's

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
hopefully you can see there that there's
the<00:00:43.170> EOS<00:00:43.739> 7d<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.570> I've<00:00:45.750> got<00:00:45.930> my<00:00:46.140> 580<00:00:46.710> X<00:00:47.039> 2<00:00:47.309> on

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
done simply with no triggers because

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.770 
done simply with no triggers because
that<00:01:38.759> was<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> whole<00:01:39.090> thing<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.479> well<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that was the whole thing was well you

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.940 
that was the whole thing was well you
can't<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.170> without<00:01:40.229> triggers<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> you

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
can't do it without triggers and you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.330 
can't do it without triggers and you
need<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.909> yn<00:01:42.780> 622<00:01:43.079> C's<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.220> this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
need the the yn 622 C's and all this

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
need the the yn 622 C's and all this
bunch<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.759> stuff<00:01:45.030> well<00:01:46.100> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.189> look<00:01:47.369> here

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bunch of stuff well if you look here

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.389 
bunch of stuff well if you look here
you'll<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.060> there's<00:01:48.210> no<00:01:48.329> trigger<00:01:49.280> if<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you'll see there's no trigger if you

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.130 
you'll see there's no trigger if you
look<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.850> you'll<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.329> there's<00:01:51.479> no<00:01:51.630> trigger

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
look here you'll see there's no trigger

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
look here you'll see there's no trigger
on<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.530> camera<00:01:52.799> anywhere<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.939> than<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
on this camera anywhere other than the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
on this camera anywhere other than the
flash<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.840> flash<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> trigger<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.710> guess

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
flash the flash is the trigger I guess

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.270 
flash the flash is the trigger I guess
if<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.219> will<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.630> don't<00:01:58.170> need<00:01:58.469> an<00:01:58.860> actual

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
if you will but you don't need an actual

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.200 
if you will but you don't need an actual
trigger<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.840> fire<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.350> optically<00:02:02.250> so

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
trigger to fire this thing optically so

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.690 
trigger to fire this thing optically so
this<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> master<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.469> slave<00:02:04.829> here's

just<00:02:08.459> I'll<00:02:09.000> set<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> up<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.989> then<00:02:10.170> I'll

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
just I'll set this up and then I'll

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.290 
just I'll set this up and then I'll
begin<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.979> film<00:02:11.190> here

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
begin to film here

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.270 
begin to film here
and<00:02:12.420> I'll<00:02:12.960> take<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> shots<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.800> we'll<00:02:14.070> see

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
here says it's high-speed sync

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.780 
here says it's high-speed sync
I<00:02:27.260> hope<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.730> you're<00:02:29.880> gonna<00:02:29.970> say<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:31.790> okay

I hope that you're gonna say that okay

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.480 
I hope that you're gonna say that okay
so<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.180> I'm<00:02:33.300> gonna<00:02:33.480> shoot<00:02:34.350> one<00:02:34.560> image<00:02:34.830> and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
so now I'm gonna shoot one image and

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.980 
so now I'm gonna shoot one image and
you'll<00:02:35.790> see<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.090> flash<00:02:36.330> far<00:02:36.600> over<00:02:36.840> there

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
you'll see that flash far over there

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.300 
you'll see that flash far over there
this<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.320> be<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.680> thousandth<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
this would be a two thousandth of a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
this would be a two thousandth of a
second<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:40.610> let's<00:02:41.610> go<00:02:41.760> ahead<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.120> shoot<00:02:42.930> this

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
second so let's go ahead and shoot this

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.140 
second so let's go ahead and shoot this
one<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.250> should<00:02:47.280> see<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.580> green<00:02:47.880> light

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
one and you should see that green light

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.690 
one and you should see that green light
but<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.050> will<00:02:49.200> put<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.560> picture<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.610> I'm

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
but I will put the picture then I'm

blue gel on and I'm gonna be shooting a
picture<00:03:05.250> here<00:03:05.460> at<00:03:05.730> four<00:03:06.000> thousands<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
picture here at four thousands of a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.560 
picture here at four thousands of a
second<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.940> you'll<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:12.270> hopefully
