know<00:01:42.360> pretty<00:01:42.570> different<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.079> guess<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.380> really

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
know pretty different I guess you really

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.080 
know pretty different I guess you really
don't<00:01:43.710> see<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.189> people<00:01:44.579> getting<00:01:44.880> chem

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090

like<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.759> figured<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.479> pretty

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
like that so I figured that was pretty

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.899 
like that so I figured that was pretty
cheeky<00:01:49.020> pretty<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.920> nice<00:01:50.460> move<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.850> guess

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cheeky pretty a pretty nice move I guess

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.429 
cheeky pretty a pretty nice move I guess

I<00:04:01.049> think<00:04:01.229> the<00:04:01.319> Kem<00:04:01.500> strike<00:04:01.620> was<00:04:01.889> about<00:04:02.129> like<00:04:02.849> 3

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
I think the Kem strike was about like 3

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.999 
I think the Kem strike was about like 3
minutes<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.479> 30<00:04:03.689> seconds<00:04:04.109> which<00:04:04.409> is<00:04:04.439> actually

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:05.009 
minutes and 30 seconds which is actually

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:06.860 
minutes and 30 seconds which is actually
pretty<00:04:05.189> quick<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.639> my<00:04:05.669> opinion<00:04:06.120> but<00:04:06.329> hope<00:04:06.780> you
