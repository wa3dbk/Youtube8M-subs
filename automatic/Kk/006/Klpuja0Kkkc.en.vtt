00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello to all so today I am 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.290
 happy to meet you for you 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.569
 review first impressions 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.309
 on the ccl cream from chez bourjois and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.900
 I really wanted to test it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.240
 because on youtube I saw several 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 journals very positive reviews like 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 very very negative streets 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 so I was really wondering how 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.590
 I could apprehend the product if 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.090
 we can say that like that but the thing 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.920
 that I would like to clarify just before 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.840
 that's not because a person 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.550
 loved the product or on the contrary it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.010
 hated her that he will inevitably 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 to match that obviously depends 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.790
 the type of our skin but also 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 full of other factors sometimes some 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.030
 products can give us pimples 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 to another person no it depends 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 really of our skin and that of our 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 skin then before you start with the cc 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.050
 cream i will start by talking to you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 of that making it the corrector that makes 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 part of the same range and I have them 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.640
 hated 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 so I did not wait for you if we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.480
 can say that to test it I tested 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.879
 a few days ago and it's really 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 a product or I do not know what it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.449
 then serves in parentheses I do not know 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 not if you hear the rain falling 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.000
 but it's the beginning ja montreal really 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.949
 it's the delluc 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 short but to come back to this product 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.729
 I have not appreciated at all since 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 it's a very liquid product and I 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.820
 found that for dark circles 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.930
 you still need something that is 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 a little bit of material a little bit of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.689
 textures otherwise it is useless and there 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
 that's exactly what it's all about 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.650
 I think it's a little fat that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 in line and that's really it 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.020
 no use in fact here I find 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.490
 really that it is useless for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 against I tested another anti-dark circles 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.430
 of Cherbourg who is a 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.350
 true little wonder but this one 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.030
 not so good so I 'm ready again 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.130
 to test the beast and I pray to them 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.280
 hues 31 ivory so that is the hue 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.810
 the clearest so let's see how that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.560
 then it's pretty fluid 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.000
 but rather very fluid what 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 personally I appreciate the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 first little defect so that's 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.020
 really to quibble 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.159
 but when I opened the tube and 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.850
 yet this is the first time that the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.409
 louvre 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 the product already had a little flow 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.560
 I think it's due to the fact that the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.450
 product is very liquid for me 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.430
 do not bother me but it's true that we 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.009
 see it's really flowing so I 'm going in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.009
 put on four points 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.950
 the hue is already a little too much 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.950
 dark for me I see it live 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.740
 of course before I hydrated my 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.330
 skin but I find it striking even 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.680
 a little bit of drought 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.680
 that's why I'm doing this head 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.910
 so finally the result leaves me 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 pretty puzzled then the first thing 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.300
 that I notice and in return screen I the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.430
 see also that it's too dark a 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.310
 orange and yellow side that does not 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.410
 does not match the level of the effect on 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.540
 the skin I would say it's not 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.210
 naughty because it slips relatively 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.740
 well but its brand still areas 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.730
 of drought then me it bothers me a 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.700
 little bit but it's true that this is the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.060
 case of a lot of products tain I you 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.340
 will say everything is not miraculous 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.900
 not a product that I hate but the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 first sight it does not make you a complexion 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.420
 of madness yes it 'll cover a little bit 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.190
 let's say I have a few small 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.860
 imperfections me I do not like too much 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.480
 load my complexion so that's enough for me but 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.580
 you do not have insults to completely 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.220
 wow i 'm mixed I actually 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.170
 hate it but at first sight so the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.280
 I'm not crazy about it 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.140
 what's odd is that I find 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.850
 the product of a rather light coverage 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.020
 but I find it still visible on 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.370
 the skin against foundations that 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.900
 are light which cover little the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.970
 imperfections but on the other side bones 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.160
 they perceive themselves very very little there I 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.630
 found that foundation is seen but in 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.820
 same time they do not cover much 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.010
 so we'll see we'll see how 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.690
 get dressed during the day and I 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.820
 just come back then so no 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.070
 that's after 6 hours of application is at 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.600
 first sight it does not shine so I 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.610
 explain to you right now I do not have 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.560
 could prevent me from powder and the bottom of 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.270
 finally dye the cream ccl rather because 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.400
 that otherwise I found that the result 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.630
 was really not beautiful on the skin in 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.100
 more of that the color was still 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.570
 a little bit too dark I do not know 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.390
 if the camera will really see you 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.640
 because with the brightness has never 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.870
 as seeing as true but still 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.520
 there was a difference I had to go out 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.140
 in the street and I could not see myself out 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.090
 with a pseudo-demarcation that 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.350
 I will marry my complexion with a powder a 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.230
 little bit clearer to really have 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.150
 something uniform and therefore 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.800
 that we powder it assekrem I find that the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.209
 holding is good so some are going 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.609
 maybe say yes but you are city ​​a 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.930
 a virtue to cheat is not wrong but 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.100
 after personally when I put a 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.359
 foundation game the court always 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.250
 so here we will say that I tested the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.240
 mutinous in my own conditions and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.950
 we are now going to the moment 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.140
 fateful of evaluation then 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.140
 firstly for his outfit I'm going to him 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.370
 put a 7 out of 10 because the product 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.630
 was rather well then certainly I 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.330
 would marry her but I do not have either 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.770
 powder and in the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.919
 good I kept them about four hours 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.689
 on my unpowdered skin and the product has 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.159
 not moved did not shine so there is no 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.900
 had not learn from that side of a 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.550
 Generally speaking, if it is a product that 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.169
 you will want there are no worries 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.150
 then another criterion that's going to be the 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.889
 comfort then for the comfort I m 9 on 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.659
 10 because really my skin is very 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.979
 comfortable with this product it's not 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.240
 a product that will make sure that 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.650
 your skin shooting or that kind of things 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.509
 so I have nothing to complain about 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.770
 as for the packaging I did not 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.569
 not too much to add 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.150
 it's a packaging that I find quite 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.349
 practice due to the fact that good 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.550
 so I do not know if you 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.409
 go see but the product tends to 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.090
 to sink so this is the small flat but 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.949
 I still find it nice to have this 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.780
 kind in bout because it allows you 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.099
 to come and really dose the product 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.719
 sometimes what's annoying with the 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:17.190
 foundation with a pump it's 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.300
 that a pump knows not enough but 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.560
 lay his trunks in any case I it's 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.699
 my case it's really between the two 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.690
 is often in fact I put two pumps 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.400
 but I do not put all the product 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.870
 So I think we can hide for 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.550
 my share for this product I find it 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.440
 rather practical so I put the note of 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.300
 9 out of 10 then we go to the criteria 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.580
 effect on the skin ie 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.439
 concretely if the ccl crémant your 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.539
 skin more beautiful for that I want to put 5 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.979
 out of 10 because if we could not 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.629
 tired of her creams I think she is 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.680
 not at all I read on the skin so not 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.289
 at all pretty it may be a little 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.330
 exaggerated but in any case I do not 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.919
 would not be comfortable with the cc cream if 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.270
 I powder is not because I find 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.159
 that it can be deposited a little bit of 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.199
 non- uniform way on the skin it's up to 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:54.000
 say that especially at the wings 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.379
 of the nose because me it's an area that 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.060
 is a little bit dryer I find 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.830
 that the country wants to make some failures and 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.900
 it's not very pretty but coming 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.819
 powder and it makes everything more uniform 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.560
 and it really comes to give the little 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.819
 finishing touch to your non-powder foundation 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.560
 and for me he misses a little something 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.029
 thing and your complexion is not 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.319
 completely finished after it's very 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.089
 personal point I like to have some 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.800
 very very clear thing and especially 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.539
 something really uniform so 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.039
 the court for me is essential 8 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.690
 penultimate criterion is the report 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:20.699
 quality price then for the report 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.319
 quality price I put it 8 out of 10 since 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.000
 it's still a dyed product that 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.159
 are going relatively cheap after this 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.870
 is not perfect either me powder and 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:29.310
 as I wanted 10 36 thousand homes in 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.050
 this video I think it's very 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.279
 pretty and well worth it in the background 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.319
 dyed ucl and now the last 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:36.330
 criterion is coverage then for the 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.250
 coverage i'm going to put him six out of ten 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.680
 why simply it's not a 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.529
 product that promises us a coverage of 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.209
 madness ie a total product for 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.069
 absolutely not so that would be totally 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:48.319
 justified if I put him a bad 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.549
 note however for people who 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.499
 want something that will come 

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:53.689
 cover up their imperfections or their 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:55.099
 acne scars just you 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:56.839
 do you want to have a tac that's when 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.089
 even a minimum covered if we can say 

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:01.069
 that's not the product that goes 

00:06:59.089 --> 00:07:02.569
 you're doing the best since it covers 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.339
 very very little so to conclude this is 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:05.929
 a product that I rather liked 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:07.729
 if it's true at the beginning when 

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:09.469
 first minutes of the application and 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.879
 I was not really singing because 

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.799
 I found that the effect on the skin 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.209
 was not terrible but eventually a 

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:15.919
 powder times and you really have 

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:17.089
 something to be so I can the 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.379
 recommended to all those who 

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:19.549
 do not have big imperfections to 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.499
 hide and they still want 

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:22.909
 something natural because for 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:24.199
 the price quality ratio is very very 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.209
 well then the last thing before 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.619
 leave you of course there I test them and 

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.179
 than today but I will continue to 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:30.859
 emit for a few days and if 

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:32.689
 I never realize that he makes me 

00:07:30.859 --> 00:07:34.369
 buttons or something like that 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.719
 of course you will do a little 

00:07:34.369 --> 00:07:37.489
 update and then I'll hold you at 

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:39.199
 current in a next video so 

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:40.429
 on this I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.019
 you all very very big 

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:44.439
 kisses and I tell you very soon 

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:44.439
 ban
