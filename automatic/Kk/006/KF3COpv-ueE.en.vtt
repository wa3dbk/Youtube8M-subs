is flexible so you can get it in a good
position<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.940> little<00:02:27.180> microphone<00:02:27.480> pick<00:02:27.870> up

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
position the little microphone pick up

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.220 
position the little microphone pick up
is<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.220> underside<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.420> then<00:02:31.110> when

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
is on the underside here and then when

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.440 
is on the underside here and then when
it's<00:02:31.350> not<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.620> use<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.860> simply<00:02:32.310> slide<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.210> back

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it's not in use you simply slide it back

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.740 
it's not in use you simply slide it back
in<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.530> ear<00:02:34.710> cup<00:02:34.980> here<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:36.300> also<00:02:36.420> got<00:02:36.720> some

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
in to the ear cup here we also got some

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.990 
in to the ear cup here we also got some
adjustment<00:02:37.440> on<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.710> sides<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.970> can

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
adjustment on the sides so we can

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.840 
adjustment on the sides so we can
actually<00:02:39.420> pull<00:02:40.170> these<00:02:40.380> down<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.460> ratchet

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
actually pull these down and the ratchet

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.810 
actually pull these down and the ratchet
mechanism<00:02:42.230> allows<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:43.740> them<00:02:43.950> larger

rate<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.350> it's<00:03:52.460> unidirectional<00:03:53.460> so<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.730> picks

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
rate and it's unidirectional so it picks

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.660 
rate and it's unidirectional so it picks
up<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.480> voice<00:03:54.690> very<00:03:55.200> well<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.680> people

up my voice very well and people

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.550 
up my voice very well and people
listening<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.150> me<00:03:57.300> during<00:03:57.540> gameplay<00:03:57.870> have

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
listening to me during gameplay have

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.680 
listening to me during gameplay have
said<00:03:58.770> that<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.920> found<00:03:59.250> sound<00:04:00.000> very<00:04:00.360> clear

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690
