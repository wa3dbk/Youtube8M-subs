00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
us to recover and maybe they have to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400

because<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> last<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.990> did<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
because I think with the last we did it

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.700 
because I think with the last we did it
against<00:01:49.530> Sunderland<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:51.290> eat<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.439> coppers
