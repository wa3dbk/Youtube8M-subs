00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.720
 one of my favorite motives is the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.760
 starry sky 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.269
 you can be incredibly dramatic 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.070
 Recordings make the best 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.750
 You have to get results like that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.060
 as far as possible from cities and others 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.400
 Light sources remove the photos 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.990
 but you can affect it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.710
 The location is best before 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.140
 during the day at the camera position 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 To schedule the composition 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.740
 and to decide which elements in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.739
 the landscape is installed into the image 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.940
 would like to do it better in the light than in the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.140
 dark 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 all you need is a good one 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.700
 camera like the 6d a tripod one 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.640
 remote trigger and hopefully one 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.489
 starry sky at night sees the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.440
 situation here is very different from how 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.300
 image of the tree in the foreground hopes 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.280
 wonderful landscape element before the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.780
 starry sky 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.280
 choose the live picture mode and 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.620
 put on the brightest motive on 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.910
 sky a plane or a plane 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.650
 bright stars use a big one 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.570
 aperture for example 28 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 the night sky is constantly changing 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.750
 you have to at focal length and 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.540
 take into account the exposure time 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.149
 opt for this 24 millimeter lens 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.070
 I am 25 seconds longer objective 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.229
 emphasize the movement of the stars 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.090
 often they choose much stronger therefore 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.759
 compensation a shorter closing time 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.880
 and a higher iso setting iso 1600 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.530
 or even 3200 a high iso 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.240
 Sensitivity brings things 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.200
 she does not appear with a naked eye 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.030
 can recognize 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.970
 turn off the noise reduction of the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.979
 camera from that you can still join 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.140
 take care of the editing of the raw files 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.880
 here, for example, have clouds in the picture 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.920
 pushed and many stars obscured 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.539
 sometimes there are several attempts 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.390
 necessary until you get the desired result 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.610
 this picture shows what you can do with it 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.149
 planning exercise and some luck everything 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.149
 can reach
