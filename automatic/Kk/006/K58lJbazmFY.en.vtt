on this thing with ya this is one of my

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.200 
on this thing with ya this is one of my
favorite<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> rock<00:00:15.570> amplifiers<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.500> a

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
favorite to rock amplifiers it's a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.470 
favorite to rock amplifiers it's a
fairly<00:00:18.210> new<00:00:18.449> amplifier<00:00:18.990> for<00:00:19.289> us<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:20.480> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
fairly new amplifier for us and to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.929 
fairly new amplifier for us and to
channel<00:00:21.960> very<00:00:22.380> simple<00:00:22.920> layout<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.760> got

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
channel very simple layout but it's got

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.130 
channel very simple layout but it's got
a<00:00:23.970> lot<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> features<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.960> think

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
a lot of the features that I think

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.980 
a lot of the features that I think
really<00:00:25.529> set<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.580> rock<00:00:26.820> apart<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> they

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
really set to rock apart and they

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.060 
really set to rock apart and they
weren't<00:00:28.199> bright<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.740> gigging<00:00:29.039> musician

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
weren't bright for the gigging musician

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.310 
weren't bright for the gigging musician
the<00:00:29.910> layouts<00:00:30.240> pretty<00:00:30.570> straight<00:00:30.869> ahead<00:00:30.990> you've

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the layouts pretty straight ahead you've

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
the layouts pretty straight ahead you've
got<00:00:31.470> an<00:00:31.650> expansion<00:00:32.369> control<00:00:32.790> which<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.239> on

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
got an expansion control which is on

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.560 
got an expansion control which is on
most<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:33.899> rock<00:00:34.079> amplifiers<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.270> allows

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
most two rock amplifiers and that allows

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.130 
most two rock amplifiers and that allows
you<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.230> bypass<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.370> EQ<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> contour

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you to bypass the EQ then the contour

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
you to bypass the EQ then the contour
control<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.860> both<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.190> clean<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> lead

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
control for both the clean in the lead

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.810 
control for both the clean in the lead
and<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.540> 35<00:00:43.020> 112<00:00:43.680> combo<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.489> get

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and this is the 35 112 combo you can get

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660 
and this is the 35 112 combo you can get
the<00:00:44.969> amplifier<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> heads<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.170> combos<00:00:46.680> 20<00:00:47.520> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the amplifier and heads or combos 20 to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.209 
the amplifier and heads or combos 20 to
35<00:00:48.329> 50<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.440> 100<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.620> let's<00:00:52.620> run<00:00:52.829> through<00:00:53.039> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
35 50 or 100 so let's run through the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.240 
35 50 or 100 so let's run through the
clean<00:00:53.489> channel<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.149> typical<00:00:54.809> -<00:00:55.680> rock<00:00:55.920> clean

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
clean channel here typical - rock clean

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.560 
clean channel here typical - rock clean

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
channel

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:25.890 
channel
we're<00:00:58.530> playing<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.949> PRS<00:00:59.460> custom<00:00:59.699> 24

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.960 

so<00:01:26.830> now<00:01:26.980> we're<00:01:27.100> going<00:01:27.190> to<00:01:27.250> go<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.730> game

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
so now we're going to go to the game

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.170 
so now we're going to go to the game
channel<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:29.380> I'll<00:01:30.310> give<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.610> an<00:01:30.700> idea<00:01:30.820> of<00:01:31.060> how

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
channel and I'll give you an idea of how

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.760 
channel and I'll give you an idea of how
this<00:01:31.330> contour<00:01:31.810> works<00:01:32.020> this<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.320> about<00:01:32.560> where<00:01:32.740> I

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
this contour works this is about where I

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.100 
this contour works this is about where I
had<00:01:33.010> it<00:01:33.130> set<00:01:33.370> before<00:01:33.760> you<00:01:34.120> can<00:01:34.240> get<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.510> EQ<00:01:34.870> set

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
had it set before you can get the EQ set

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.320 
had it set before you can get the EQ set
for<00:01:35.290> both<00:01:35.470> channels<00:01:36.040> if<00:01:36.580> one's<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:37.060> little

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
for both channels if one's a little

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.360 
for both channels if one's a little
bright<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:38.380> just<00:01:38.650> take<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.860> little<00:01:39.100> bit<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.310> a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
bright you just take a little bit of a

00:01:39.370 --> 00:02:14.770 
bright you just take a little bit of a
high<00:01:39.550> end<00:01:39.580> off<00:01:39.970> with<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.290> contour<00:01:41.800> control

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.680 

so<00:02:15.780> that's<00:02:16.730> using<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.819> output<00:02:18.000> section<00:02:18.420> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so that's using the output section of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.050 
so that's using the output section of
the<00:02:18.780> amplifier<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:20.190> preamp<00:02:20.610> section<00:02:20.819> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the amplifier and the preamp section a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.430 
the amplifier and the preamp section a
little<00:02:21.239> bit<00:02:21.360> I'm<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.690> run<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.050> gain<00:02:22.230> up

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
little bit I'm going to run the gain up

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:52.160 
little bit I'm going to run the gain up
a<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.739> bit<00:02:22.890> more<00:02:23.130> here<00:02:50.810> let's<00:02:51.810> say<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.989> go

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
a little bit more here let's say you go

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
a little bit more here let's say you go
from<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> humbucker<00:02:52.680> guitar<00:02:53.100> to<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.280> single<00:02:53.610> coil

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
from a humbucker guitar to a single coil

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.000 
from a humbucker guitar to a single coil
guitar<00:02:54.260> instead<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.410> having<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.739> really

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
guitar instead of having to really

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.330 
guitar instead of having to really
totally<00:02:56.610> change<00:02:56.910> your<00:02:57.000> EQ<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:58.340> play

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
totally change your EQ you can just play

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.500 
totally change your EQ you can just play
with<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.640> little<00:02:59.670> bit<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.060> then<00:03:00.180> really

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
with it a little bit and then really

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
with it a little bit and then really
altering<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.200> that's<00:03:01.680> actually<00:03:01.769> maybe<00:03:02.100> a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
altering so that's actually maybe a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.039 
altering so that's actually maybe a
maybe<00:03:02.700> now's<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:03.030> good<00:03:03.150> time<00:03:03.360> we'll<00:03:03.510> do<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> quick

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
maybe now's a good time we'll do a quick

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.809 
maybe now's a good time we'll do a quick
little<00:03:04.170> cut<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.010> we're<00:03:05.190> gonna<00:03:05.310> introduce<00:03:05.580> the

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
little cut and we're gonna introduce the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.690 
little cut and we're gonna introduce the
SP<00:03:06.120> six<00:03:06.360> break<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:07.019> second

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
SP six break for a second

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:26.949 
SP six break for a second
there's<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> SP<00:03:09.090> six

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.199 

so<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:28.010> Bob's<00:03:28.280> going<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.640> plan<00:03:28.849> I'm<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
so now Bob's going to plan I'm going to

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.369 
so now Bob's going to plan I'm going to
use<00:03:29.359> the<00:03:29.480> expansion<00:03:30.109> control<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:31.390> on<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:33.140> gain

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
use the expansion control on on the gain

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:56.839 
use the expansion control on on the gain
Channel

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.600
