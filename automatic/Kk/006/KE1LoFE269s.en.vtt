I actually recommend for this and what
I'm<00:01:13.100> using<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:14.180> very<00:01:14.600> porous<00:01:14.990> type<00:01:15.439> paper

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
I'm using is a very porous type paper

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.100 
I'm using is a very porous type paper
all<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:17.799> 110<00:01:18.799> GSM<00:01:19.509> cartridge<00:01:20.509> paper<00:01:20.810> a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
all this is is 110 GSM cartridge paper a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.969 
all this is is 110 GSM cartridge paper a
drawing<00:01:21.560> paper<00:01:21.770> basically<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.049> it<00:01:24.049> is<00:01:24.560> not

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
drawing paper basically and it is not

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.219 
drawing paper basically and it is not
just<00:01:25.009> sewed<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.789> wouldn't<00:01:26.149> advise<00:01:26.600> gesturing

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
just sewed I wouldn't advise gesturing

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.959 
just sewed I wouldn't advise gesturing
it<00:01:27.469> because<00:01:28.039> what<00:01:28.219> we<00:01:28.369> want<00:01:28.579> is<00:01:28.729> something

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
it because what we want is something

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:31.090 
it because what we want is something
that<00:01:29.270> is<00:01:29.359> really<00:01:29.539> going<00:01:29.719> to<00:01:29.840> soak<00:01:30.109> in<00:01:30.350> our<00:01:30.679> ink

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
that is really going to soak in our ink

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.010 
that is really going to soak in our ink
because<00:01:31.700> what<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.210> will<00:01:32.359> do<00:01:32.569> is<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:32.960> will

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
because what that will do is it will

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.989 
because what that will do is it will
give<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.319> lovely<00:01:33.530> blended<00:01:34.130> tonal<00:01:34.609> effect

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
give it a lovely blended tonal effect

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.270 
give it a lovely blended tonal effect
and<00:01:35.329> it<00:01:35.689> will<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:35.929> all<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.259> shading<00:01:36.499> work<00:01:36.829> for

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
and it will do all the shading work for

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.660 
and it will do all the shading work for
you

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.929 
you
I'm<00:01:38.479> just<00:01:38.960> altering<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.189> face<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:40.639> little<00:01:40.819> bit

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
I'm just altering the face a little bit

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.969 
I'm just altering the face a little bit
here<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> lips<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.200> jawline<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.649> don't

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
here the lips and the jawline I don't

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.469 
here the lips and the jawline I don't
particularly<00:01:43.399> like<00:01:43.670> very<00:01:43.939> much<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.389> it's

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
particularly like very much and it's

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.090 
particularly like very much and it's
probably<00:01:44.689> because<00:01:45.109> we<00:01:45.259> didn't<00:01:45.530> use<00:01:45.560> pencil

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
probably because we didn't use pencil

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.120 
probably because we didn't use pencil
before<00:01:46.999> I<00:01:47.209> sketched<00:01:47.630> her<00:01:47.840> out<00:01:48.079> but<00:01:48.740> I'm<00:01:48.920> just

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
before I sketched her out but I'm just

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.679 
before I sketched her out but I'm just
going<00:01:49.490> over<00:01:49.639> the<00:01:49.819> hair<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.090> little<00:01:50.389> bit<00:01:50.479> more

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
going over the hair a little bit more

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.830 
going over the hair a little bit more
just<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.280> hide<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.310> sins<00:01:52.729> basically<00:01:53.270> putting

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
just to hide the sins basically putting

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.449 
just to hide the sins basically putting
some<00:01:53.990> mountboard<00:01:54.409> underneath<00:01:54.859> to<00:01:55.100> protect<00:01:55.130> my

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
some mountboard underneath to protect my

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.020 
some mountboard underneath to protect my
table<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.409> what<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.619> is<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.009> bombay<00:01:58.429> ink<00:01:58.729> and

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030

shading<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.599> saying<00:02:36.900> at<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
shading and as I was saying at the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.679 
shading and as I was saying at the
beginning<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.730> very<00:02:39.000> forgiving<00:02:39.569> because

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
beginning it is very forgiving because

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.569 
beginning it is very forgiving because
you've<00:02:40.049> already<00:02:40.200> wet<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.739> paper<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.370> its

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
you've already wet the paper in its

you've already wet the paper in its

shading<00:02:45.480> together<00:02:46.129> for<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.940> don't

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
shading together for you so you don't

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.390 
shading together for you so you don't
need<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.659> worry<00:02:48.870> too<00:02:49.200> much<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:50.069> you're

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
paper for you and because it is a wash

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.199 
paper for you and because it is a wash
though<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.980> might<00:02:59.159> see<00:02:59.400> me<00:02:59.459> going<00:02:59.819> over<00:03:00.120> the

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.869 
though you might see me going over the
same<00:03:00.390> places<00:03:00.989> again<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:01.560> again<00:03:01.829> to<00:03:02.430> darken<00:03:02.819> it

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
same places again and again to darken it

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.449 
same places again and again to darken it
up<00:03:03.120> if<00:03:03.329> you<00:03:03.510> wanted<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.230> what<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.890> could<00:03:05.069> do<00:03:05.280> is

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
up if you wanted to what you could do is

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.399 
up if you wanted to what you could do is
just<00:03:05.489> use<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.209> Bombay<00:03:06.569> or<00:03:06.900> Indian<00:03:07.890> ink<00:03:08.099> or

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:09.409 
just use the Bombay or Indian ink or

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.229 
just use the Bombay or Indian ink or
cartridge<00:03:10.409> ink<00:03:10.560> whatever<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.239> straight

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
cartridge ink whatever you have straight

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.020 
cartridge ink whatever you have straight
from<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.470> actual<00:03:13.920> pot<00:03:14.159> to<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.670> darker

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
from the actual pot to make it darker

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.789 
from the actual pot to make it darker
but<00:03:15.209> because<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.599> made<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> wash<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.739> don't

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
but because I made a wash and I don't

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.890 
but because I made a wash and I don't
want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.159> waste<00:03:17.340> it<00:03:17.519> I'm<00:03:17.879> just<00:03:18.209> going<00:03:18.510> over<00:03:18.659> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
want to waste it I'm just going over and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.869 
want to waste it I'm just going over and
over<00:03:18.930> and<00:03:19.230> over<00:03:19.319> again<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:20.370> gradually

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
over and over again to gradually

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.800 
over and over again to gradually
increase<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.420> coloring<00:03:23.180> what<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.389> could<00:03:24.629> do

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
increase the coloring what you could do

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.470 
increase the coloring what you could do
and<00:03:25.109> what<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.440> show<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.829> later<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.489> is<00:03:26.730> how

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
and what I will show you later on is how

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.479 
and what I will show you later on is how
to<00:03:27.540> add<00:03:27.810> highlights<00:03:28.409> with<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> actual<00:03:29.159> white

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
to add highlights with the actual white

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.449 
to add highlights with the actual white
rather<00:03:30.389> than<00:03:30.720> doing<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:31.409> way<00:03:31.470> but<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.250> want

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
rather than doing it this way but I want

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.020 
rather than doing it this way but I want
to<00:03:32.609> show<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.329> way<00:03:33.569> first<00:03:34.489> but<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.790> am

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
to show you this way first but I am

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.339 
to show you this way first but I am
actually<00:03:36.239> going<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.720> show<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.959> three

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
actually going to show you three

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.420 
actually going to show you three
different<00:03:38.480> variations<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.690> this<00:03:39.870> technique

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
different variations on this technique

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.439 
different variations on this technique
and<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.519> next<00:03:41.790> one<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.359> all

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
and the next one is going to be all

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.030 
and the next one is going to be all
about<00:03:42.569> color<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.319> going<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.590> use<00:03:43.769> color

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
about color so I'm going to use color

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.030 
about color so I'm going to use color
pastels<00:03:44.519> as<00:03:45.120> well<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.780> using<00:03:46.079> color<00:03:46.440> ink<00:03:46.739> and

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
pastels as well as using color ink and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.740 
pastels as well as using color ink and
the<00:03:47.669> income<00:03:47.970> you'll<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.269> using<00:03:48.419> in<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.720> next

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the income you'll be using in the next

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.289 
the income you'll be using in the next
one<00:03:49.169> is<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.889> winter<00:03:50.220> winds<00:03:50.790> are<00:03:50.940> newton

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.539 
just felt like doing it and all of these
sketches<00:04:08.879> took<00:04:09.560> approximately<00:04:10.560> 10<00:04:11.430> minutes

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
sketches took approximately 10 minutes

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.539 
sketches took approximately 10 minutes
so<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.359> got<00:04:12.660> three<00:04:13.049> pages<00:04:13.949> for<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.370> art<00:04:14.489> journal

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
so I got three pages for an art journal

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.430 
so I got three pages for an art journal
in<00:04:15.030> about<00:04:15.329> 30<00:04:15.599> minutes<00:04:15.959> which<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.169> quite<00:04:16.409> good

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
in about 30 minutes which is quite good

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.949 
in about 30 minutes which is quite good
in<00:04:16.799> regards<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:17.909> actual<00:04:18.269> color<00:04:18.659> washes

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
in regards to the actual color washes

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.979 
in regards to the actual color washes
the<00:04:19.530> ink<00:04:19.709> washes<00:04:19.979> I<00:04:20.400> roughly<00:04:21.180> do<00:04:21.359> about<00:04:21.659> a

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
the ink washes I roughly do about a

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.120 
the ink washes I roughly do about a
tenth<00:04:22.710> ink<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:24.150> actual<00:04:25.080> water<00:04:25.320> but<00:04:26.010> it's

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
tenth ink to actual water but it's

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.920 
tenth ink to actual water but it's
entirely<00:04:26.430> up<00:04:26.610> to<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:26.880> what<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.180> do<00:04:27.360> here<00:04:27.750> you

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
entirely up to you what you do here you

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.170 
entirely up to you what you do here you
can<00:04:28.110> see<00:04:28.380> I'm<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.680> dipping<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.699> brush<00:04:29.880> into

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
can see I'm just dipping the brush into

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.300 
can see I'm just dipping the brush into
the<00:04:30.419> ink<00:04:30.810> directly<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:31.650> it's<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.070> minimal

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
the ink directly so it's a very minimal

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.189 
the ink directly so it's a very minimal
amount<00:04:32.909> of<00:04:33.030> ink<00:04:33.270> that<00:04:33.449> I'm<00:04:33.570> using<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
amount of ink that I'm using and

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.230 
amount of ink that I'm using and
actually<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:35.130> using<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.520> same<00:04:35.729> pot<00:04:36.000> and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
actually I'm using the same pot and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.860 
actually I'm using the same pot and
changing<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> color<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.139> a<00:04:37.229> little<00:04:37.380> bit

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
changing the color up a little bit

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.050 
changing the color up a little bit
and<00:04:39.490> I'm<00:04:40.490> doing<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.850> a<00:04:40.880> little<00:04:40.940> bit

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
and I'm doing it a little bit

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.090 
and I'm doing it a little bit
differently<00:04:41.510> I'm<00:04:41.660> not<00:04:41.870> going<00:04:42.140> to<00:04:42.320> cover<00:04:42.950> the

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
differently I'm not going to cover the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.430 
differently I'm not going to cover the
whole<00:04:43.310> page<00:04:43.610> in<00:04:43.970> ink<00:04:44.300> i'm<00:04:44.660> leavin'<00:04:45.020> eyeball

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
whole page in ink i'm leavin' eyeball

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.040 
whole page in ink i'm leavin' eyeball
completely<00:04:46.040> alone<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> am<00:04:47.540> gonna<00:04:47.750> do

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
completely alone but what I am gonna do

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.010 
completely alone but what I am gonna do
is<00:04:48.290> use<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.950> ink<00:04:49.130> for<00:04:49.370> what<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.850> think<00:04:50.450> does

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
is use the ink for what I think does

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.150 
is use the ink for what I think does
best<00:04:51.260> which<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.650> ripich<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.440> I'm<00:04:54.440> gonna<00:04:54.710> give<00:04:54.920> a

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
best which is ripich so I'm gonna give a

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.280 
best which is ripich so I'm gonna give a
little<00:04:55.790> bit<00:04:55.940> of<00:04:56.060> a<00:04:56.210> tear<00:04:56.690> effect<00:04:57.050> here<00:04:57.260> with

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
little bit of a tear effect here with

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.270 
little bit of a tear effect here with
the<00:04:57.530> ink<00:04:57.910> next<00:04:58.910> up<00:04:59.090> is<00:04:59.390> a<00:04:59.930> face<00:05:00.380> again<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:01.100> I

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the ink next up is a face again that I

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.170 
the ink next up is a face again that I
drew<00:05:01.910> first<00:05:02.390> off<00:05:02.720> with<00:05:03.110> black<00:05:03.950> pastel<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.760> I

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
drew first off with black pastel and I

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.930 
drew first off with black pastel and I
found<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.960> lot<00:05:06.230> easier<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:07.220> draw<00:05:07.430> her<00:05:07.700> she

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
found it a lot easier to draw her she

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.760 
found it a lot easier to draw her she
was<00:05:08.060> actually<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.360> lot<00:05:08.570> quicker<00:05:08.840> as<00:05:09.260> well<00:05:09.320> than

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
was actually a lot quicker as well than

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.620 
was actually a lot quicker as well than
the<00:05:09.890> white<00:05:10.040> one<00:05:10.190> this<00:05:10.370> sketch<00:05:11.030> was<00:05:11.180> literally

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
the white one this sketch was literally

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.750 
the white one this sketch was literally
a<00:05:11.660> couple<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.990> minutes<00:05:12.320> and<00:05:12.620> it's<00:05:13.550> probably

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
a couple of minutes and it's probably

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.920 
a couple of minutes and it's probably
because<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.300> could<00:05:14.450> see<00:05:14.570> what<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:14.720> was<00:05:14.810> doing

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
because you could see what I was doing

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.080 
because you could see what I was doing
with<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.590> black<00:05:15.890> rod<00:05:16.220> than<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:16.670> white<00:05:16.850> and

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
with the black rod than the white and

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.830 
with the black rod than the white and
white<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.860> what<00:05:18.860> I<00:05:18.890> did<00:05:19.220> was<00:05:19.400> I<00:05:19.610> added<00:05:19.850> white

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
white and what I did was I added white

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.990 
white and what I did was I added white
pastel<00:05:21.350> over<00:05:21.620> areas<00:05:22.190> that<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.400> wanted<00:05:22.820> to

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
pastel over areas that I wanted to

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.910 
pastel over areas that I wanted to
remain<00:05:23.300> as<00:05:23.510> a<00:05:23.540> highlight<00:05:23.990> so<00:05:24.260> on<00:05:24.380> her<00:05:24.620> forehead

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
remain as a highlight so on her forehead

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.360 
remain as a highlight so on her forehead
on<00:05:25.340> her<00:05:25.820> nose<00:05:26.150> on<00:05:26.420> her<00:05:26.630> cheeks<00:05:26.960> on<00:05:27.260> her<00:05:27.620> chin

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
on her nose on her cheeks on her chin

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.790 
on her nose on her cheeks on her chin
and<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:29.120> actually<00:05:29.330> much<00:05:29.810> prefer<00:05:30.200> her<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:30.680> it

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
and I actually much prefer her so it

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.530 
and I actually much prefer her so it
just<00:05:31.010> goes<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.370> show<00:05:31.520> you<00:05:31.580> that<00:05:31.940> sometimes<00:05:32.150> the

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
just goes to show you that sometimes the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.000 
just goes to show you that sometimes the
things<00:05:32.600> that<00:05:32.840> you<00:05:32.960> do<00:05:33.170> the<00:05:33.290> quickest<00:05:33.710> are

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
things that you do the quickest are

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.690 
things that you do the quickest are
actually<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.910> best<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.830> what<00:05:36.830> ink<00:05:37.190> I'm<00:05:37.460> using

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
here is a brown Bombay ink because I
