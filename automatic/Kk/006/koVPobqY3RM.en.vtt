all righty - this here is a my onboard
air<00:00:07.020> setup<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> 79<00:00:10.769> Ford<00:00:11.280> f-150

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
air setup this is a 79 Ford f-150

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
air setup this is a 79 Ford f-150
heavily<00:00:13.230> modified<00:00:13.820> but<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.230> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.640> York

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
heavily modified but on this is a York

heavily modified but on this is a York
210<00:00:18.359> air<00:00:18.810> compressor<00:00:20.779> that<00:00:21.779> I've<00:00:21.930> converted

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
210 air compressor that I've converted

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.070 
210 air compressor that I've converted
to<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:23.609> pump<00:00:23.970> air<00:00:24.390> instead<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.400> pump<00:00:26.400> freon

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
to just pump air instead of pump freon

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.339 
to just pump air instead of pump freon
there's<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> York<00:00:29.210> -<00:00:30.210> Tennant<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:30.779> stock

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
there's a York - Tennant and stock

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.920 
there's a York - Tennant and stock
location<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.910> there<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.390> that<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> for

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
location right there and that one is for

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.090 
location right there and that one is for
pumping<00:00:37.260> freon<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> wanted<00:00:40.920> air

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
pumping freon but I wanted air

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.650 
pumping freon but I wanted air
conditioned<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> had<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> build<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.450> other

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
conditioned so I had to build this other

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.770 
conditioned so I had to build this other
bracket<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.559> I'm<00:00:44.129> running<00:00:44.570> both<00:00:45.570> air

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
bracket here and I'm running both air

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
bracket here and I'm running both air
compressors<00:00:46.320> off<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.680> same<00:00:46.920> belt<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.910> used

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
compressors off the same belt and I used

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.080 
compressors off the same belt and I used
this<00:00:48.329> bracket<00:00:48.809> over<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.920> tension<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this bracket over here to tension the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.770 
this bracket over here to tension the
belt<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.579> those<00:00:53.730> slots<00:00:54.180> down<00:00:54.600> there

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
belt you can see those slots down there

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
belt you can see those slots down there
actually<00:00:55.140> can't<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:55.949> down

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
actually can't see them but they're down

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.750 
actually can't see them but they're down
there<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:57.199> this<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.770> bolts<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there and this your bolts to this in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900 
there and this your bolts to this in
those<00:01:00.000> slots<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.949> by<00:01:01.949> tightening<00:01:02.399> up<00:01:02.550> these

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
those slots and by tightening up these

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.460 
those slots and by tightening up these
books<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.449> bolts<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> side<00:01:04.140> over<00:01:04.350> here

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
books and bolts on the side over here

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.250 
books and bolts on the side over here
actually<00:01:05.220> their<00:01:05.549> studs<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.840> tension<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
actually their studs you can tension the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually their studs you can tension the
belt<00:01:08.360> um<00:01:09.740> so<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.510> kind<00:01:12.840> of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
belt um so right here this is kind of

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
belt um so right here this is kind of
the<00:01:13.049> cheating<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.280> not

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the cheating way to do it not not

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960 
the cheating way to do it not not
cheating<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.369> redneck<00:01:17.369> poor<00:01:17.700> man's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cheating but the the redneck poor man's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.590 
cheating but the the redneck poor man's
way<00:01:18.210> um<00:01:19.310> right<00:01:20.310> here<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.390> two

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
way um right here is just the two

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.859 
way um right here is just the two
factory<00:01:22.229> fittings<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.710> come<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
Kilby
makes<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.130> adapter<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:30.110> what<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
makes an adapter for this but on what I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660 
makes an adapter for this but on what I
did<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> piece<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.130> heater<00:01:32.400> hose

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
did is I just got a piece of heater hose

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.179 
did is I just got a piece of heater hose
that<00:01:32.909> fit<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.240> close<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.810> hose<00:01:34.590> clamped<00:01:35.070> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that fit it close and hose clamped it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.679 
that fit it close and hose clamped it
and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:36.360> put<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.860> K&amp;N<00:01:37.860> air<00:01:38.100> filter<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.600> on

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and I put a K&amp;N air filter right here on

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
and I put a K&amp;N air filter right here on
the<00:01:39.780> end<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.590> easy<00:01:40.829> enough<00:01:41.180> that's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the end and that was easy enough that's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
the end and that was easy enough that's
self-explanatory<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.320> slid<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.530> over<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
self-explanatory I just slid it over the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.810 
self-explanatory I just slid it over the
threads<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.520> over<00:01:45.299> here<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
threads and over here this is on a

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.810 
threads and over here this is on a
special<00:01:50.820> thread<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.780> air<00:01:52.439> conditioning<00:01:53.070> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
special thread for air conditioning but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.219 
special thread for air conditioning but
what<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> did<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:56.100> took<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.899> 1/2<00:01:57.899> inch

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
what I did is um I just took a 1/2 inch

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
what I did is um I just took a 1/2 inch
bushing<00:01:59.630> brass<00:02:00.630> bushing<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.520> teflon<00:02:02.520> taped

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bushing brass bushing and teflon taped

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.539 
bushing brass bushing and teflon taped
up<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> threads<00:02:03.509> good<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.369> tightened<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.399> on

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
up the threads good and tightened it on

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.069 
up the threads good and tightened it on
there<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.180> haven't<00:02:06.329> had<00:02:06.509> any<00:02:06.659> problems

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
there and I haven't had any problems

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:07.910 
there and I haven't had any problems
with<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.439> yet

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
with this yet

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.889 
with this yet
I've<00:02:08.759> had<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.119> compressor<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.720> for

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
I've had this compressor on here for

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.809 
I've had this compressor on here for
years<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.649> never<00:02:10.770> been<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> problem<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
years it's never been a problem the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.360 
years it's never been a problem the
threads<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.300> exactly<00:02:12.569> match<00:02:12.930> theirs

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
threads don't exactly match theirs

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.030 
threads don't exactly match theirs
hich<00:02:13.819> but<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.989> one's<00:02:15.200> tapered<00:02:15.650> where<00:02:15.830> this

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
hich but this one's tapered where this

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.300 
hich but this one's tapered where this
one<00:02:16.250> or<00:02:16.400> not<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.959> works<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.069> got

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
one or not so that works and then I got

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.550 
one or not so that works and then I got
a<00:02:19.390> check<00:02:20.390> valve<00:02:20.420> right<00:02:20.930> here<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.140> three-eighths

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
a check valve right here a three-eighths

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.680 
a check valve right here a three-eighths
check<00:02:21.830> valve<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:25.090> keeps<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.269> air<00:02:26.420> from

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
check valve and that keeps the air from

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.729 
check valve and that keeps the air from
back<00:02:26.900> flowing<00:02:27.290> into<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.620> compressor<00:02:28.010> once

up<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.930> pressure

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
up the pressure

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.479 
up the pressure
whenever<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.049> pressure<00:02:51.290> switch<00:02:51.620> turns<00:02:52.220> off

whenever the pressure switch turns off

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.400 
whenever the pressure switch turns off
it<00:02:52.819> puts<00:02:53.359> another<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:54.040> little<00:02:55.040> lever<00:02:55.280> which

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
it puts another a little lever which

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.970 
it puts another a little lever which
opens<00:02:57.410> up<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.829> small<00:02:58.700> port<00:02:59.230> right<00:03:00.230> here<00:03:00.260> on<00:03:00.739> this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
opens up a small port right here on this

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.569 
opens up a small port right here on this
check<00:03:01.250> valve<00:03:01.840> which<00:03:02.840> unloads<00:03:03.470> the<00:03:03.799> which

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
check valve which unloads the which

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.430 
check valve which unloads the which
takes<00:03:04.909> the<00:03:05.060> depressurize<00:03:05.750> as<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.319> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
takes the depressurize as this so the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.780 
takes the depressurize as this so the
compressor<00:03:06.799> can<00:03:06.829> start<00:03:07.159> up<00:03:07.280> these<00:03:07.459> here<00:03:07.670> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
compressor can start up these here and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.660 
compressor can start up these here and
you<00:03:07.879> don't<00:03:08.060> have<00:03:08.209> head<00:03:08.450> pressure<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.640> did<00:03:10.640> I

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
you don't have head pressure I did I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.089 
you don't have head pressure I did I
used<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.299> run<00:03:11.569> that<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:12.019> did<00:03:12.260> away<00:03:12.349> with<00:03:12.530> mine

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.140 

so<00:03:16.099> I<00:03:16.129> hope<00:03:16.400> that's<00:03:16.670> not<00:03:16.760> won't<00:03:16.970> cause<00:03:17.120> any

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
so I hope that's not won't cause any

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.750 
so I hope that's not won't cause any
problems<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:17.840> me<00:03:17.959> I'm<00:03:18.950> running<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.459> sealed

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
problems with me I'm running a sealed

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.819 
problems with me I'm running a sealed
pressure<00:03:20.090> switch<00:03:20.450> right<00:03:20.720> here<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.410> see<00:03:21.620> I

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
pressure switch right here you can see I

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.280 
pressure switch right here you can see I
should<00:03:22.609> have<00:03:22.730> made<00:03:22.880> these<00:03:23.060> a<00:03:23.290> disconnectable

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
should have made these a disconnectable

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.440 
should have made these a disconnectable
that<00:03:25.099> didn't<00:03:25.370> have<00:03:25.489> any<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.519> but

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
that didn't have any so I just but

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.670 
that didn't have any so I just but
that's<00:03:29.629> no<00:03:29.720> problem<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.200> can<00:03:30.349> always<00:03:30.560> go<00:03:30.650> back

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
that's no problem I can always go back

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.479 
that's no problem I can always go back
and<00:03:30.829> do<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.239> but<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:32.389> one<00:03:32.569> cuts<00:03:32.810> off<00:03:33.049> at

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
and do that but this one cuts off at

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.940 
and do that but this one cuts off at
1:45<00:03:34.489> and<00:03:34.519> back<00:03:34.849> on<00:03:35.000> at<00:03:35.150> 1:10<00:03:35.739> or<00:03:36.739> at<00:03:36.829> least

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
1:45 and back on at 1:10 or at least

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.379 
1:45 and back on at 1:10 or at least
that's<00:03:37.040> what<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> says<00:03:37.430> on<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.609> switch<00:03:37.970> it

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:38.389 
that's what it says on the switch it

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.539 
that's what it says on the switch it
actually<00:03:38.840> cuts<00:03:39.019> off<00:03:39.200> about<00:03:39.410> 130<00:03:40.069> and<00:03:40.190> back<00:03:40.340> on

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
actually cuts off about 130 and back on

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.920 
actually cuts off about 130 and back on
it<00:03:40.730> 90<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.590> works<00:03:42.949> good<00:03:43.310> for<00:03:43.370> me<00:03:43.699> and<00:03:43.940> then

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
it 90 so that works good for me and then

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.020 
it 90 so that works good for me and then
I<00:03:44.959> made<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.650> little<00:03:45.889> air<00:03:46.099> manifold<00:03:46.609> just<00:03:46.879> out

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
I made this little air manifold just out

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.930 
I made this little air manifold just out
of<00:03:47.440> different<00:03:48.440> fittings<00:03:48.680> that's<00:03:49.250> across<00:03:49.639> and

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
of different fittings that's across and

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.530 
of different fittings that's across and
this<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.150> of<00:03:50.239> course<00:03:50.389> as<00:03:50.599> a<00:03:50.629> tee<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:53.239> vinyl

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
this is of course as a tee that vinyl

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.879 
this is of course as a tee that vinyl
tubing<00:03:53.959> right<00:03:54.139> there<00:03:55.060> goes<00:03:56.060> for<00:03:56.889> polyurethane

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
tubing or whatever it is goes into the

goes to an outlet at the front which
I'll<00:04:11.510> show<00:04:11.629> you<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.870> second<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.379> this<00:04:12.769> big

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
I'll show you in a second and this big

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.860 
I'll show you in a second and this big
half-inch<00:04:13.549> air<00:04:13.730> hose<00:04:13.970> goes<00:04:14.269> all<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.540> way<00:04:14.810> to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
half-inch air hose goes all the way to

half-inch air hose goes all the way to
the<00:04:15.079> back<00:04:15.260> in<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.680> bed<00:04:15.919> where<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.250> keep<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
the back in the bed where I keep the

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.409 
the back in the bed where I keep the
tank<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.519> think<00:04:19.639> that<00:04:19.910> covers<00:04:20.090> everything

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
tank so I think that covers everything

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.930 
tank so I think that covers everything
right<00:04:20.780> here<00:04:20.989> under<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.380> hood

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940

now<00:04:24.940> right<00:04:25.150> here<00:04:25.420> now<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:25.990> just<00:04:26.230> did<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:26.770> today

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
now right here now I just did this today

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.000 
now right here now I just did this today
I<00:04:27.460> don't<00:04:28.150> really<00:04:28.300> like<00:04:28.480> this<00:04:28.690> setup<00:04:28.930> but<00:04:29.290> but

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
I don't really like this setup but but

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.070 
I don't really like this setup but but
right<00:04:30.130> here<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.490> can<00:04:30.760> pull<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.090> out<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
right here I can pull this out this is a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.770 
right here I can pull this out this is a
little<00:04:32.440> another<00:04:32.860> cross<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.640> my<00:04:34.450> air<00:04:34.750> line

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780

air-conditioning<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.830> must<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.030> that's<00:05:07.270> why

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
air-conditioning is a must so that's why

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.140

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.040 

alright<00:05:35.470> if<00:05:35.919> we<00:05:36.010> go<00:05:36.190> to<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.370> back<00:05:36.550> here<00:05:37.050> only

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
alright if we go to the back here only

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:49.110 
alright if we go to the back here only
Carlos<00:05:45.510> will<00:05:46.510> find<00:05:46.780> my<00:05:47.620> air<00:05:47.770> tank<00:05:48.010> now<00:05:48.700> I<00:05:48.790> used

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
Carlos will find my air tank now I used

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.420 
Carlos will find my air tank now I used
to<00:05:49.210> have<00:05:49.419> this<00:05:49.540> mounted<00:05:49.750> under<00:05:50.200> my<00:05:50.350> cab<00:05:50.680> but

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
to have this mounted under my cab but

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.790 
to have this mounted under my cab but
I've<00:05:51.550> since<00:05:51.810> rerouted<00:05:52.810> my<00:05:52.930> exhaust<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:53.650> now

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
I've since rerouted my exhaust and now

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.100 
I've since rerouted my exhaust and now
that<00:05:54.010> and<00:05:54.160> that<00:05:54.340> got<00:05:54.490> in<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.700> way<00:05:56.340> so<00:05:58.080> now<00:05:59.080> I

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
that and that got in the way so now I

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.380 
that and that got in the way so now I
have<00:05:59.320> it<00:05:59.440> mounted<00:05:59.590> here<00:05:59.950> but<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.060> air<00:06:01.210> line

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
have it mounted here but the air line

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.340 
have it mounted here but the air line
comes<00:06:01.660> up<00:06:01.840> through<00:06:02.020> the<00:06:02.110> bed<00:06:04.140> and<00:06:05.140> because

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
comes up through the bed and because

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.560 
comes up through the bed and because
it's<00:06:05.530> protected<00:06:05.800> by<00:06:06.100> a<00:06:06.250> piece<00:06:07.060> of<00:06:07.090> rubber<00:06:07.390> hose

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
it's protected by a piece of rubber hose

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.730 
it's protected by a piece of rubber hose
there<00:06:07.930> and<00:06:08.800> it<00:06:08.979> goes<00:06:09.130> up<00:06:09.750> and<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:11.080> might<00:06:11.290> reroute

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
there and it goes up and I might reroute

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.810 
there and it goes up and I might reroute
that<00:06:11.979> just<00:06:12.130> to<00:06:12.220> make<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:12.400> a<00:06:12.550> little<00:06:12.669> more

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
that just to make it a little more

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.690 
that just to make it a little more
aesthetically<00:06:13.300> pleasing<00:06:13.419> but<00:06:13.870> I<00:06:14.550> think<00:06:15.550> that

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:15.700 
aesthetically pleasing but I think that

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.210 
aesthetically pleasing but I think that
will<00:06:15.850> do<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.479> job<00:06:16.510> for<00:06:16.900> now<00:06:16.990> and<00:06:17.260> of<00:06:17.919> course<00:06:17.950> it

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
will do the job for now and of course it

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.020 
will do the job for now and of course it
goes<00:06:18.310> into<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.640> tank

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
goes into the tank

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.880 
goes into the tank
I<00:06:19.120> chose<00:06:19.450> half<00:06:19.720> inch<00:06:19.960> hose<00:06:20.200> so<00:06:20.560> there<00:06:20.710> wouldn't

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
I chose half inch hose so there wouldn't

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.320 
I chose half inch hose so there wouldn't
be<00:06:22.140> as<00:06:23.140> much<00:06:23.380> restriction<00:06:23.860> and<00:06:24.820> it's<00:06:25.000> not<00:06:25.150> that

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
be as much restriction and it's not that

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.960 
be as much restriction and it's not that
much<00:06:25.479> more<00:06:25.690> expensive<00:06:26.010> ok<00:06:27.010> right<00:06:27.550> here<00:06:27.760> you'll

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
much more expensive ok right here you'll

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.990 
much more expensive ok right here you'll
notice<00:06:28.360> I<00:06:28.710> used<00:06:29.710> a<00:06:29.830> PVC<00:06:30.190> I<00:06:31.349> use<00:06:32.349> PVC<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:33.070> no<00:06:33.970> I

notice I used a PVC I use PVC and no I

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.969 
notice I used a PVC I use PVC and no I
didn't<00:06:34.300> do<00:06:34.360> that<00:06:34.390> because<00:06:34.539> I'm<00:06:34.780> cheap<00:06:35.050> I<00:06:35.349> did

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
didn't do that because I'm cheap I did

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:36.870 
didn't do that because I'm cheap I did
that

lesson<00:06:53.170> I<00:06:53.260> guess<00:06:53.790> but<00:06:54.930> when<00:06:55.930> you<00:06:55.990> use<00:06:56.140> plastic

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
lesson I guess but when you use plastic

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.280 
lesson I guess but when you use plastic
like<00:06:56.860> this<00:06:57.070> it<00:06:57.750> eliminates<00:06:58.750> that<00:06:58.840> problem<00:06:58.960> so

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
like this it eliminates that problem so

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.530 
like this it eliminates that problem so
that's<00:06:59.470> why<00:06:59.590> there's<00:06:59.830> PV<00:07:00.100> C<00:07:00.280> T's<00:07:00.490> there<00:07:00.700> in<00:07:00.850> the

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
that's why there's PV C T's there in the

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.920 
that's why there's PV C T's there in the
bottom<00:07:01.930> I've<00:07:02.110> got<00:07:02.590> a<00:07:02.970> drain<00:07:03.970> valve<00:07:04.240> to<00:07:04.690> drain

anyway<00:07:46.330> that's<00:07:47.200> my<00:07:47.410> air<00:07:47.710> setup<00:07:48.250> this<00:07:48.820> is<00:07:49.000> part

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270 
anyway that's my air setup this is part

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.880 
anyway that's my air setup this is part
one<00:07:49.510> of<00:07:50.040> most<00:07:51.040> likely<00:07:51.430> a<00:07:51.460> two-part<00:07:52.300> video<00:07:52.890> so
