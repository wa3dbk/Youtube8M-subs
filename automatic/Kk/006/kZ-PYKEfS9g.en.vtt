society<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:47.280> did<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.549> maybe<00:02:49.470> some

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
society and I did see maybe some

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.160 
society and I did see maybe some
elements<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.340> there<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:52.600> was<00:02:52.870> probably

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
elements of it there it was probably

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.220 
elements of it there it was probably
more<00:02:53.530> lighthearted<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.570> can't<00:02:55.930> deny<00:02:56.110> that

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
more lighthearted but I can't deny that

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.020 
more lighthearted but I can't deny that
there<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.680> something<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:57.100> no<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:57.700> wouldn't

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
there was something there no I wouldn't

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.850 
there was something there no I wouldn't
say<00:02:58.150> that<00:02:58.299> it's<00:02:58.510> 14<00:02:59.079> specifically<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.829> I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
say that it's 14 specifically and I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.110 
say that it's 14 specifically and I
think<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.160> quite<00:03:00.250> important<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.820> we<00:03:00.940> do

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
think it's quite important that we do

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.160 
think it's quite important that we do
when<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.360> are<00:03:01.480> talking<00:03:01.570> about<00:03:01.690> lad<00:03:01.930> culture

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
when we are talking about lad culture

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.050 
when we are talking about lad culture
that<00:03:02.590> we<00:03:02.709> are<00:03:03.040> talking<00:03:03.340> about<00:03:03.610> a<00:03:03.790> wider

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
that we are talking about a wider

that we are talking about a wider

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
context it's not a very easy to just say

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.699

it's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.970> sport<00:03:07.299> team<00:03:07.810> thing<00:03:08.049> it's<00:03:08.200> not<00:03:08.350> it's
