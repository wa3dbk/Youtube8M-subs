00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 I thought it was cool, it was very similar to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 original is that side until not because 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.170
 Pretty good is we get here is by 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 a facade can see that we have places 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.350

 President, it is necessary that the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.730
 head 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:21.819

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.780
 Let's propose one here for the part 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.500
 upper of the entrance do not go 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.330
 to pronounce the first part of the 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.310
 here the main entrance will go up 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.160
 ascending here has the kingdom name edson 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.239
 what is a theater room is a theater 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.250
 it's much better 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.519
 There is no name here, it 's just a room. 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.110
 same main room second floor 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.640
 Of course the original has much more 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.440
 rooms that only the size that I 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 I did people did not stay to be 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.640
 so I was not going to start 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.860
 all over again because I was with her 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.989
 ready out inside it all 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.329
 he would put the rooms again 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.489
 that she has many more things plus one 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:23.650
 room here the other staircase and here is the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.870
 minimum that the dining room can see 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.420
 that we barzin pretty cool was full 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.019
 It looked good but it did look good in bulk. 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.400
 good for another entry lets show by 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.410
 Here I left. 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.660
 you can see that is not matter 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.480
 its main doors is that I left 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.310
 without even because I want to account 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.419
 closed something that had forgotten 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.970
 Ready, I wanted to put what's there. 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.470
 I wanted to put a pretty door 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.139
 a large door but a longer time 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.329
 then I left 100 at the time do not stay 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.530
 something that gets very ugly with 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.090
 this small size 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.370
 here is another entrance nor can you see 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.019
 which has the third floor of a balcony and 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.930
 The second and here is the first one you 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.940
 Come in here, I forgot the name of this one. 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.669
 living room 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:18.459
 I put the empty one bank the line 11 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:21.190
 Head weeks, who are we even going to go to? 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.830
 before I showed here here have the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.319
 Grandpa one is an oval room that was not 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.930
 nor oval because I had to pack it 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.759
 as it was down there is for 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.470
 be cute and here it is closed if 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.400
 you can see I think she's 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.050
 closed because she formed a 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.960
 format an egg even but to stay 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.660

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.789

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.430
 I put some things akpo to pretend to 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.229
 deposit just to have something 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.919
 even to not be without anything 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:17.380
 and is a new form of the most important 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.539
