so<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:05.070> set<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.090> adobe<00:01:06.240> media

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
so I can set this off the adobe media

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.060 
so I can set this off the adobe media
encoder<00:01:06.690> will<00:01:07.080> load<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.440> background<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
encoder will load in the background and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010

it<00:01:08.190> will<00:01:08.280> analyze<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:09.030> medium<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.750> see<00:01:09.900> it's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it will analyze my medium you see it's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.859

highlighting<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> word<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.630> spoke

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
highlighting the word as it spoke

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
highlighting the word as it spoke
because<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.530> knows<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> word<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> spoken

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
because it knows when the word is spoken
and<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.450> works<00:01:15.690> the<00:01:15.810> other<00:01:15.840> way<00:01:15.990> around<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and this works the other way around so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.990 
and this works the other way around so
if<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.010> okay<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> cut<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.940> scene

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
so you click on the word and it takes

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.790 
so you click on the word and it takes
the<00:01:20.490> playhead<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.720> point<00:01:22.020> at<00:01:22.200> people<00:01:22.320> and
