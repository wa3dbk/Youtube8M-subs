00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hi guys i'm luca and this eder 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.890
 in corner 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.870
 the top show on youtube numerone 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.960
 in Italy where we talk every week 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.070
 of how to prepare to improve and serve i 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 our rights 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 today other pouring techniques 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 advanced welcome to the first episode 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.060
 2014 of our second one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 season is wonderful to come back from this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.460
 break period and thank you 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.579
 for the new milestone of 3,000 members 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.410
 that we have achieved together 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 I sincerely hope that yours 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.809
 continuous support in this way today 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.629
 we will talk about other pouring techniques 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 boasted in particular to pay 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.340
 using the basic technique or the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.280
 forehand with your left hand like 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.579
 pour in forehand with two bottles 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 in the right hand or in the left hand 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.510
 pay the info rent at the same time 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.019
 with left and right hand quality 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.170
 equal and then less difference we start 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.799
 from the poured forehand with the hand 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.840
 left 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.490
 the technique of having basic balance that 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.200
 we explained in the first episode 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.479
 last season 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.560
 it is obviously also applicable to the hand 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.079
 left then we take the bottle 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.320
 that way we pay attention 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.719
 that the nozzle of the half shift of 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.579
 always in the opposite direction 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.649
 at the palm of the hand with which we pour 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:39.009
 so this in this direction 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.140
 now the movement to do is the following 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.240
 once identified in the focal point 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.299
 of the container pour to open the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:57.520
 paid we must bring the bottom of the 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:02:01.890
 bottle 6 hours to 11 hours during the 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.329
 poured the flow will always be 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.819
 perpendicular to the mouth of the container 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:12.579
 in which we pour and will always point to 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.430
 focal point anyway to close the 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:19.030
 paid we should bring the fund back 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.880
 of the bottle from 11 to 6 o'clock towards 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.920
 of us in this way also for 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.209
 this paid the count will be the 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.549
 same as the basic technique when 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.700
 we must prepare quickly first or 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.340
 more cultured it is possible to pour the same 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.459
 amount with both hands to do 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.299
 this we take two bottles for 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.890
 hand 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.770
 after that 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.540
 once the focal point has been identified o 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.110
 better cheer for then because the bottles 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.560
 are two to pour we will have to perform 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.569
 this movement or bring the fund 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.630
 bottles at 6 o'clock 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.770
 and as for the left hand 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.520
 bring it to hours 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.390
 regarding the right hand 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:11.350
 bring it to hours one after opening the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.840
 poured the flows of the two bottles 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.050
 must always be parallel between 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.140
 them and will never have to cross for 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.140
 remain perpendicular to the mouth of the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.170
 container in which we will go opponents ho 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:31.330
 did this to close the spill 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.370
 we should bring back the two funds 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.910
 bottles at 6 o'clock 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.910
 in this way 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.709
 and being careful that they do not connect between 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:47.079
 their very important thing is obvious 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.440
 understanding and that the movement must 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.660
 be synchronized both in opening and in 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.280
 closing 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.370
 let's take an example suppose we want to 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.400
 pour trocars with both hands 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.459
 throws within a we will take the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.590
 bottles and forehand pins that we will go to 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.950
 pour a double tree into the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.640
 team 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.799
 in this way the bubbles industry is not 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.180
 always necessary to pour the same 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.030
 quantity with both hands 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.950
 in fact it can happen that you want to pay in 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.280
 different quantities in this case 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.840
 We will open 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.540
 and pour them the way we have 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.000
 just shown while we're going to 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.100
 close on reaching the 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.200
 desired amount for each illness 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.130
 let's take an example suppose we want to 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:36.200
 pour nerve inside with your hand 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.960
 left and with the right hand 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.760
 we sell our pet bottles e 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:48.200
 we are going to pour into the type 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:50.540
 in this way it goes to 2 on reforms a 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.490
 another way to prepare drinks that 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.340
 they contain the same amount of spirit 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.860
 is to pour with two bottles in 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.430
 one hand grab with your hand 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.090
 right in forehand the first culture 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.450
 then raise the index and middle one 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.500
 hand and with these grab the second 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.470
 bottle 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.110
 being athletes who 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.720
 behind pure percussion for pure be 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.430
 always a metalcore nozzle are 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.530
 always facing the opposite direction 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:28.190
 compared to the palm of the hand with 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:31.010
 paid presidency and counting will be 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:39.200
 then the same as in the basic technique in 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:42.080
 this way an important thing is that the 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.630
 spout of the web of metal care not 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.930
 they must opt for each other we make a 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.850
 example suppose you want to pay one 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.090
 lie with both bottles 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.990
 always in the same hand to do this 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.790
 we take the bottles this way 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.500
 and let's pour inside 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:09.530
 cupertino bubble show this way 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:12.200
 bubbles if we were to pay the 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.210
 same quantity with four bottles e 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.169
 at the same time something happens 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.320
 often in the preparation of arrests 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.020
 we will have to proceed in the following way 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.169
 we prefer the first two 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.410
 right hand and at 32 look at the hand 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.410
 left 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.120
 and we're going to pour in this way 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.790
 we will pour a bubbles 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.970
 and a lie in this way I go to 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.970
 south 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.560
 this concludes the first episode of the 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.840
 2014
