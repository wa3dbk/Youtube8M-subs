Valentine's Day coming up they have a
new<00:00:26.580> assortment<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> flavor<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.960> says

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
new assortment of flavor that says

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.790 
new assortment of flavor that says
skittles<00:00:29.039> dark<00:00:29.730> side<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.510> other<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
rainbow and at first I thought this was

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
rainbow and at first I thought this was
just<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> wild<00:00:34.770> berry<00:00:35.100> flavor<00:00:35.670> which<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just like the wild berry flavor which is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
just like the wild berry flavor which is
easily<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.989> favorite<00:00:37.290> skittle<00:00:37.590> flavor<00:00:37.800> but

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
easily my favorite skittle flavor but

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.830 
easily my favorite skittle flavor but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
could just be the wild berry flavor it's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
could just be the wild berry flavor it's
the<00:01:51.810> skittles<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> purple<00:01:52.649> bag<00:01:52.799> then<00:01:53.520> they

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the skittles in the purple bag then they

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.550 
the skittles in the purple bag then they
just<00:01:53.759> repackage<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.450> rename<00:01:54.750> maybe<00:01:55.110> slight

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just repackage and rename maybe slight

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.469 
just repackage and rename maybe slight
difference<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.670> that's<00:01:56.850> exactly<00:01:57.299> what<00:01:57.420> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
difference but that's exactly what it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.240 
difference but that's exactly what it
