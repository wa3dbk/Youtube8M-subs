it's<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.780> close<00:00:15.990> game<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.680> looks<00:00:16.859> like

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
it's a close game but it looks like

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.359 
it's a close game but it looks like
magic<00:00:17.430> will<00:00:17.940> win<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.570> game<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.740> convincing

fashion<00:00:22.100> yeah<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.130> want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.880> about

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
fashion yeah I want to think about

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.779 
fashion yeah I want to think about
recent<00:00:24.990> changes<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.740> Swedish<00:00:26.609> team

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
recent changes in the Swedish team

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.679 
recent changes in the Swedish team
lineup<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.699> shot<00:00:30.390> in

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
lineup I think that it's like shot in

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.290 
lineup I think that it's like shot in
the<00:00:30.779> food<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.470> Swedish<00:00:31.890> scene<00:00:32.160> because<00:00:32.640> they

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the food for Swedish scene because they

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.959 
the food for Swedish scene because they
destroyed<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:34.800> good<00:00:35.010> team<00:00:35.219> like<00:00:35.460> fanatic

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
destroyed a very good team like fanatic

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.229 
destroyed a very good team like fanatic
and<00:00:37.430> basically<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:41.180> disconnected<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and basically they disconnected the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.139 
and basically they disconnected the
three<00:00:42.690> ingredients<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.680> cooks<00:00:44.070> forest<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.969> get

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
three ingredients I cooks forest and get

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
three ingredients I cooks forest and get
right<00:00:45.390> into<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:46.800> teams<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.289> in<00:00:49.289> my

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
right into two different teams and in my

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
right into two different teams and in my
opinion<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.829> team<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.370> benefited<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
opinion the team which benefited the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.510 
opinion the team which benefited the
most<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.550> Alliance<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.020> with<00:00:55.020> time

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
most will be Alliance and with time

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
most will be Alliance and with time
probably<00:00:56.520> escaped<00:00:57.120> but<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.930> guy<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
probably escaped but this guy is on the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
probably escaped but this guy is on the
same<00:00:58.739> level<00:00:58.770> static<00:00:59.550> at<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> point<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.809> I'm

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
same level static at this point and I'm

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439

well speaking of you guys you've been

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.649

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
performing really really great so far

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.630 
performing really really great so far
what<00:01:06.680> what's<00:01:07.680> your<00:01:07.860> secret<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> mean<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.580> what

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
what what's your secret I mean like what

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
what what's your secret I mean like what
are<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.909> secret<00:01:09.240> ingredient<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> plate

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
are your secret ingredient to the plate

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.370 
are your secret ingredient to the plate
well<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.299> played<00:01:12.780> five

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
well I think that we just played five

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
well I think that we just played five
laps<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.570> bit<00:01:15.720> too<00:01:15.900> early<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.590> say<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
laps so it's a bit too early to say that

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
laps so it's a bit too early to say that
we<00:01:18.390> are<00:01:18.509> playing<00:01:18.780> good<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.350> something<00:01:19.619> like

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
we are playing good or something like

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.000 
we are playing good or something like
that<00:01:20.240> up<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.659> we'll<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> final

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
that up if we'll get to the final

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.630 
that up if we'll get to the final
hopefully<00:01:24.970> win<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.360> for<00:01:25.630> example<00:01:25.980> then<00:01:26.980> we<00:01:27.460> can

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
hopefully win it for example then we can

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.060 
hopefully win it for example then we can
talk<00:01:27.760> about<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.300> i<00:01:28.510> think<00:01:28.570> but<00:01:28.990> now<00:01:29.230> it's<00:01:30.010> just

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
talk about it i think but now it's just

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.410 
talk about it i think but now it's just
too<00:01:30.460> early<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:31.210> talk<00:01:32.110> about<00:01:32.290> our<00:01:32.440> game<00:01:32.860> because

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
too early to talk about our game because

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.940 
too early to talk about our game because
we<00:01:34.420> are<00:01:34.570> far<00:01:34.870> away<00:01:34.990> from<00:01:35.140> what<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:35.680> want<00:01:35.830> to

we are far away from what we want to

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.910

really<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.920> this<00:02:26.920> city<00:02:27.220> because<00:02:27.370> it's<00:02:27.580> not

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
so different than Poland for example and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.860 
so different than Poland for example and

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.680 
hopefully I won't regret what I wished
for<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:45.160> also<00:02:45.610> wanted<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.239> play<00:02:46.510> in<00:02:46.570> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
for and I also wanted to play in the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.500 
for and I also wanted to play in the
final<00:02:47.110> against<00:02:47.620> Navi<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:48.370> still<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.360> are<00:02:49.420> in

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
final against Navi but still we are in

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.780 
final against Navi but still we are in
the<00:02:49.600> semi-final<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.470> we<00:02:51.040> need<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.310> wait<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:51.489> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the semi-final so we need to wait for it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.300 
the semi-final so we need to wait for it
but<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.450> just<00:02:52.600> always<00:02:52.989> hope<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.560> have<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
but I just always hope to have the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.360 
but I just always hope to have the
toughest<00:02:55.209> opponent<00:02:55.570> possible<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.230> beat<00:02:57.100> him

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
toughest opponent possible and beat him

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.479 
toughest opponent possible and beat him
so<00:02:58.000> we<00:02:58.450> can<00:02:58.630> truly<00:02:59.230> say<00:02:59.620> that<00:02:59.650> we<00:03:00.070> are<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.220> best

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
so we can truly say that we are the best

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.870 
so we can truly say that we are the best
without<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:01.810> like<00:03:02.019> winning<00:03:02.489> without<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
without it it's like winning without the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.740 
without it it's like winning without the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
it will grow up and yeah that's pretty

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.640 
it will grow up and yeah that's pretty
much<00:03:47.460> it<00:03:49.520> is<00:03:50.520> contract<00:03:51.450> your<00:03:51.540> main<00:03:51.840> job<00:03:51.870> for

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
much it is contract your main job for

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.280 
much it is contract your main job for
example<00:03:53.010> or<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.430> have<00:03:53.660> it's<00:03:54.660> my<00:03:54.840> it's<00:03:55.110> our

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
example or do you have it's my it's our

example or do you have it's my it's our
main<00:03:55.590> job<00:03:55.620> i<00:03:56.010> think<00:03:56.280> it's<00:03:56.670> fair<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.940> say<00:03:57.090> little

main job i think it's fair to say little

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.840 
main job i think it's fair to say little
bit<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.710> still<00:03:58.890> not<00:03:59.130> so<00:04:00.020> good<00:04:01.610> when<00:04:02.610> it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
bit but it's still not so good when it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.380 
bit but it's still not so good when it
comes<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.420> friday<00:04:04.110> but<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.730> depends<00:04:06.210> on

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
comes to friday but it all depends on

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.300 
comes to friday but it all depends on
how<00:04:06.450> well<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.990> play<00:04:07.350> in<00:04:07.560> tournaments<00:04:08.100> if<00:04:08.220> you

how well you play in tournaments if you

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.190 
how well you play in tournaments if you
play<00:04:08.490> very<00:04:08.670> well<00:04:08.820> if<00:04:09.060> you<00:04:09.180> went<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> lot<00:04:09.570> then

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
play very well if you went a lot then

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.290 
play very well if you went a lot then
it's<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.560> good<00:04:10.710> job<00:04:11.190> for<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.550> but<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.090> lose

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
it's a good job for you but if you lose

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.990 
it's a good job for you but if you lose
a<00:04:12.360> lot<00:04:12.630> then<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.860> better<00:04:13.980> started<00:04:14.550> something

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
a lot then you better started something

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.300 
a lot then you better started something
else<00:04:15.150> do<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.019> think<00:04:16.200> there's<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.470> limit<00:04:17.070> four

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
else do you think there's a limit four

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.030 
else do you think there's a limit four
per<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:18.030> age<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.720> mean<00:04:18.989> like<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.980> there

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
per of age I mean like is there

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.099 
per of age I mean like is there
certainly<00:04:20.549> where<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.330> should<00:04:21.480> probably<00:04:21.690> stop

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
certainly where you should probably stop

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.470 
certainly where you should probably stop
playing<00:04:22.350> well<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.550> for<00:04:23.730> example<00:04:24.150> how

get<00:04:34.350> better<00:04:34.610> then<00:04:35.610> I<00:04:35.820> will<00:04:36.000> think<00:04:36.690> about<00:04:36.840> my

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200

retirement<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:38.720> maybe<00:04:39.720> when<00:04:40.169> i<00:04:40.200> finish<00:04:41.070> my

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100

studies<00:04:41.780> unless<00:04:42.780> i<00:04:43.110> will<00:04:43.350> think<00:04:43.740> about<00:04:43.890> some

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
studies unless i will think about some

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.850 
studies unless i will think about some
changes<00:04:45.880> in<00:04:46.000> my<00:04:46.120> life<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.540> well<00:04:46.720> but<00:04:46.990> it's

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
changes in my life as well but it's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.790 
changes in my life as well but it's
sometime<00:04:48.700> in<00:04:49.030> front<00:04:49.360> so<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:50.080> still<00:04:50.500> have<00:04:50.620> some

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
sometime in front so I still have some

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.640 
sometime in front so I still have some
time<00:04:50.860> left<00:04:51.040> in<00:04:51.400> kind<00:04:51.520> of<00:04:51.640> strike<00:04:51.850> hopefully

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
time left in kind of strike hopefully

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.460 
time left in kind of strike hopefully
well<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:54.100> think<00:04:54.310> TSN<00:04:55.180> said<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.780> condo<00:04:56.170> strike

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
well I think TSN said that condo strike

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.950 
well I think TSN said that condo strike
is<00:04:57.040> kind<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.430> fading<00:04:57.820> away<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.570> mean<00:04:58.840> like

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
is kind of fading away so I mean like

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960 
is kind of fading away so I mean like
it's<00:04:59.200> getting<00:04:59.350> less<00:05:00.100> tournaments<00:05:00.790> less

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
it's getting less tournaments less

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.100 
it's getting less tournaments less
exposure<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.930> thing<00:05:02.140> is<00:05:02.170> true<00:05:02.440> I<00:05:04.020> don't<00:05:05.020> think

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
exposure the thing is true I don't think

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.920 
exposure the thing is true I don't think
so<00:05:05.470> i<00:05:05.770> think<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:07.380> as<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:09.010> last<00:05:09.220> year<00:05:09.430> showed

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
so i think that as the last year showed

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.990 
so i think that as the last year showed
there<00:05:10.930> can<00:05:11.140> be<00:05:11.170> plenty<00:05:11.770> of<00:05:11.920> exposure<00:05:12.430> and

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
there can be plenty of exposure and

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.600 
there can be plenty of exposure and
plenty<00:05:13.630> of<00:05:13.660> tournaments<00:05:14.440> it's<00:05:15.130> just<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.430> matter

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
plenty of tournaments it's just a matter

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.110 
plenty of tournaments it's just a matter
of<00:05:16.770> talking<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.980> good<00:05:18.430> people<00:05:18.850> and<00:05:21.120> like
