00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
and apparently this is one of them so

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.440

now<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.390> trusty<00:02:18.930> old<00:02:19.610> clock<00:02:20.610> set

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
now we have the trusty old clock set

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.810 
now we have the trusty old clock set
block<00:02:21.930> right<00:02:22.230> next<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.740> minecraft<00:02:23.070> zero

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.850 
block right next to it minecraft zero
destroyer<00:02:24.420> minecraft<00:02:24.900> words<00:02:25.080> don't<00:02:25.290> destroy

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
destroyer minecraft words don't destroy

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.750 
destroyer minecraft words don't destroy
and<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:26.790> testing<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:29.190> closest<00:02:29.490> player

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and that's testing on the closest player

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.380 
and that's testing on the closest player
if<00:02:30.390> our<00:02:30.720> clique<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.860> maximum<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.000> 1<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
if our clique is maximum of 1 and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.840 
if our clique is maximum of 1 and
minimum<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.840> 1<00:02:34.050> so<00:02:34.350> whenever<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> click<00:02:35.010> with

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
minimum of 1 so whenever you click with

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.780 
minimum of 1 so whenever you click with
the<00:02:36.450> thing<00:02:36.750> it's<00:02:37.050> going<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.440> add<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the thing it's going to add one to the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.510 
the thing it's going to add one to the
score<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:40.080> our<00:02:40.410> clique<00:02:40.680> which<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:41.310> means

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
score of our clique which then means

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.690 
score of our clique which then means
that<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.240> going<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.510> say<00:02:43.070> yep<00:02:44.070> he's<00:02:44.460> got

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that this is going to say yep he's got

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.890 
that this is going to say yep he's got
that<00:02:44.820> then<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.120> going<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.330> put<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.480> signal

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that then it's going to put a signal

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
that then it's going to put a signal
into<00:02:46.020> this<00:02:46.110> comparator<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.780> set

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
into this comparator which will then set

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.420 
into this comparator which will then set
the<00:02:48.930> school<00:02:49.170> board<00:02:49.350> back<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> zero<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.280> can

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the school board back to zero so you can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.360 
the school board back to zero so you can
use<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.700> again<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.710> then<00:02:52.710> see<00:02:52.980> look<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:53.160> can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
use it again and then see look you can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.440 
use it again and then see look you can
use<00:02:53.490> it<00:02:53.610> more<00:02:53.790> than<00:02:53.910> once<00:02:54.090> what<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:56.450> it's

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
use it more than once what and then it's

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.380 
use it more than once what and then it's
going<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:58.280> set<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.310> block<00:02:59.700> in<00:03:00.000> front<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.300> it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
going to set a block in front of it

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.360 
going to set a block in front of it
minus<00:03:00.600> 1<00:03:00.810> because<00:03:01.020> we're<00:03:01.320> going<00:03:01.440> dances<00:03:02.130> above

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
minus 1 because we're going dances above

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.460 
minus 1 because we're going dances above
the<00:03:02.520> ground<00:03:02.700> over<00:03:03.630> here<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:03.960> going<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.140> set<00:03:04.320> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
the ground over here it's going to set a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.060 
the ground over here it's going to set a
redstone<00:03:04.920> block<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.880> there<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.450> then<00:03:07.320> it's

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
redstone block right there and then it's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.100 
redstone block right there and then it's
going<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.670> set<00:03:08.970> needs<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.420> air<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.990> we're

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
going to set needs it to air so we're

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.560

remember
all<00:04:27.520> these<00:04:27.639> commands<00:04:28.289> be<00:04:29.289> in<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.310> description

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759

all these commands be in the description
and<00:04:31.199> then<00:04:32.199> this<00:04:33.090> book<00:04:34.090> that<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:35.139> basically

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
and then this book that this basically

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.630 
and then this book that this basically
it's<00:04:37.410> just<00:04:37.590> teleporting<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.130> arms<00:04:38.340> dental

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.240 
it's just teleporting the arms dental
player<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.120> setting<00:04:39.720> click<00:04:40.530> back<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.860> 0

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
player and that setting click back to 0

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.850 
player and that setting click back to 0
because<00:04:41.400> if<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:41.730> spam<00:04:42.060> this<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.360> can<00:04:42.860> reset

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
because if you spam this you can reset

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.950 
because if you spam this you can reset
it<00:04:43.920> so<00:04:44.100> that's<00:04:44.280> also<00:04:44.670> important<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.420> then

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
it so that's also important and then

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.670 
it so that's also important and then
this<00:04:46.290> is<00:04:46.650> going<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.670> just<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.560> teleporting<00:04:49.560> the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
arm stand up one and it's going to be

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.040 
arm stand up one and it's going to be
terrible<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.610> apps<00:04:53.730> will<00:04:54.180> not<00:04:54.360> up<00:04:54.480> once<00:04:54.780> up

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.010 
terrible in the apps will not up once up
by<00:04:55.290> 0.2<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:56.100> so<00:04:56.280> basically<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.700> does<00:04:57.020> 0.4

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
thing and when it gets the end it sets

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.760 
thing and when it gets the end it sets
off<00:05:05.280> its<00:05:05.790> i<00:05:05.970> execute<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.960> arm<00:05:07.110> stand<00:05:07.380> its
