00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Oils 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.230
 The engine will work around the clock at 50 degrees below zero, and here the oil plays 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.020
 Is important because if there is no good oil in the engine, there may be a problem when the engine is running 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.000
 continuously. As oil is like blood for the engine, we need blood in our bodies to move 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.160
 Muscle - The engine needs oil to do the same job 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.160
 Paul Marsh - Mechanic sports cars 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.010
 Consistently uninterrupted at these temperatures, you need oil. But a special type 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.080
 For temperatures up to 50 degrees below zero and will accomplish the task only a high quality 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.170
 Such as the Helix oil we have developed. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.230
 It is about our safety and is a lifeline if it does not work well 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.120
 Midway, we will not survive - we wear good clothes but we rely on this engine. 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.240
 We would like to know how hot the oil is affected. This oil is based on metal 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.180
 20/20, a local type, and we want to use it but it looks like honey, and we will not use it 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.140
 The next oil is also metallic and is 20/50, preferably in the summer. you may 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.100
 See it where it looks like honey too. It is frozen like a snow cube. The last oil is 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 Shell Helix oil works correctly. 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.060
 The oil contains material to clean the engine so expect to change its color. 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.110
 Oil performs its task over time, and if you look at it now you will find it black 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.140
 It collects impurities with the engine but we can use it for another 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:05.090
 Because we keep the cars running at 50 degrees below zero and it is preferable to change the oil.
