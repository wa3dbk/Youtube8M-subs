money doing their gigs is the price I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.280 
money doing their gigs is the price I
haven't<00:01:35.640> seen<00:01:35.939> what<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> street<00:01:36.720> price<00:01:36.900> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
haven't seen what the street price is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.210 
haven't seen what the street price is
going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.920> yet<00:01:38.659> but<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.130> 2000s<00:01:41.130> i

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
going to be yet but for the 2000s i

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.469 
going to be yet but for the 2000s i
believe<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.880> map<00:01:42.229> it's<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:44.180> $2,000<00:01:45.180> which

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
believe the map it's like $2,000 which

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.880 
believe the map it's like $2,000 which
is<00:01:45.810> pretty<00:01:46.619> flip<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.700> high<00:01:48.409> for<00:01:49.409> something<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
is pretty flip and high for something it

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
is pretty flip and high for something it
doesn't<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.430> video<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:52.170> then

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
doesn't even have video in it and then

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.710 
doesn't even have video in it and then
they're<00:01:52.710> they're<00:01:53.220> dvj<00:01:54.000> which<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> video

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
they're they're dvj which is the video

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.590 
they're they're dvj which is the video
one<00:01:55.049> that's<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.759> same<00:01:56.820> price<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
one that's around the same price or a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.060 
one that's around the same price or a
little<00:01:57.780> higher<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.890> again

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
little higher but then then again

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
little higher but then then again
doesn't<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> features<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.540> new

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
doesn't have the features of this new

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.910 
doesn't have the features of this new
deck<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.960> that's<00:02:03.960> pretty<00:02:04.259> high<00:02:04.500> i<00:02:04.530> mean<00:02:04.829> i'm

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
deck so that's pretty high i mean i'm

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.649 
deck so that's pretty high i mean i'm
sure<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> street<00:02:05.490> price<00:02:05.640> will<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:05.969> lower<00:02:06.270> but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
sure the street price will be lower but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
sure the street price will be lower but
I'm<00:02:06.840> betting<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> street<00:02:07.619> price<00:02:07.799> at<00:02:08.220> least

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I'm betting the street price at least

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.469 
I'm betting the street price at least
when<00:02:08.610> it

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
when it

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.449 
when it
comes<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.590> probably<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.280> no

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
comes out is probably going to be no

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.960 
comes out is probably going to be no
lower<00:02:11.670> than<00:02:11.790> like<00:02:12.090> 1600<00:02:13.040> 1700<00:02:14.040> something<00:02:14.849> like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
lower than like 1600 1700 something like

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.280 
lower than like 1600 1700 something like
that<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.269> might<00:02:15.390> be<00:02:15.450> able<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> knock<00:02:16.080> like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that you might be able to knock like

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.050 
that you might be able to knock like
three<00:02:16.590> hundred<00:02:16.709> dollars<00:02:17.280> off<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.519> price<00:02:18.709> um<00:02:19.709> i

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
three hundred dollars off the price um i

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.789 
three hundred dollars off the price um i
may<00:02:21.060> get<00:02:21.209> them<00:02:21.360> eventually<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.379> now<00:02:22.739> i

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
may get them eventually but not now i

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.420 
may get them eventually but not now i
just<00:02:23.159> don't<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.549> cash<00:02:23.819> i<00:02:24.500> may<00:02:25.500> opt<00:02:25.860> for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
just don't have the cash i may opt for

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.350 
just don't have the cash i may opt for
the<00:02:26.720> 900<00:02:27.720> over<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.440> thousand<00:02:29.190> i<00:02:29.370> haven't

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the 900 over the two thousand i haven't

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.360 
the 900 over the two thousand i haven't
looked<00:02:30.540> at<00:02:30.629> all<00:02:30.840> of<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.319> features<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.920> depth

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
looked at all of the features in depth

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280 
looked at all of the features in depth
yet<00:02:32.730> i<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.330> know<00:02:33.629> there's<00:02:33.840> something<00:02:34.049> called

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
yet i do know there's something called

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830 
yet i do know there's something called
like<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> needle<00:02:34.860> drop<00:02:35.280> or<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> needle<00:02:36.060> search<00:02:36.450> on

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
like a needle drop or a needle search on

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.649 
like a needle drop or a needle search on
the<00:02:37.049> 2000<00:02:37.829> which<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.489> pretty<00:02:38.909> big<00:02:39.299> feature

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
the 2000 which is a pretty big feature

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.520 
the 2000 which is a pretty big feature
which<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.079> left<00:02:40.709> off<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:42.450> 900<00:02:43.170> which<00:02:43.349> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
which is left off of the 900 which is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.059 
which is left off of the 900 which is
the<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.910> cut-down<00:02:45.150> version<00:02:46.069> i'm

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
the you know the cut-down version i'm

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.490 
the you know the cut-down version i'm
i'm<00:02:47.519> pretty<00:02:48.299> sure<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.870> scratching

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
i'm pretty sure that the scratching

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.330 
i'm pretty sure that the scratching
algorithm<00:02:50.220> on<00:02:50.370> both<00:02:51.290> is<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.620> same<00:02:52.920> so<00:02:53.220> it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
algorithm on both is the same so it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
algorithm on both is the same so it's
not<00:02:53.459> like<00:02:53.640> you're<00:02:53.730> going<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:53.940> get<00:02:54.030> like<00:02:54.239> lower

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
not like you're going to get like lower

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.890 
not like you're going to get like lower
quality<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.160> know<00:02:56.190> scratching<00:02:57.090> so<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.599> speak

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
quality you know scratching so to speak

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710 
quality you know scratching so to speak
on<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.620> 900<00:02:59.190> than<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.519> two<00:02:59.700> thousand<00:03:00.209> that's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
on the 900 than the two thousand that's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.020 
on the 900 than the two thousand that's
the<00:03:00.900> way<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.170> 800<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.829> the<00:03:01.920> 1000<00:03:02.579> are<00:03:02.670> set<00:03:02.879> up

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the way the 800 and the 1000 are set up

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.630 
the way the 800 and the 1000 are set up
I<00:03:03.840> can't<00:03:04.349> imagine<00:03:04.470> they'd<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.099> doing<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.489> any

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
I can't imagine they'd be doing it any

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.699 
I can't imagine they'd be doing it any
differently<00:03:06.209> for<00:03:06.840> their<00:03:07.530> two<00:03:07.799> upgrades<00:03:09.709> but

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
differently for their two upgrades but

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.229 
differently for their two upgrades but
anyway<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.220> want<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:11.940> know<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.180> guys

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
price is going to be I hear some

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.979 
price is going to be I hear some
retailers<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.940> vendors<00:03:18.419> are<00:03:18.569> selling<00:03:18.840> them

shirt here that use serato you know if
you<00:03:31.109> use<00:03:31.290> serato<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:32.040> lot<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.669> features<00:03:33.060> on

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
you use serato a lot of the features on

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.030 
you use serato a lot of the features on
this<00:03:33.540> new<00:03:33.780> unit<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.410> got<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.680> i<00:03:34.739> say<00:03:34.889> go

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
this new unit and got like i say go

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.650 
this new unit and got like i say go
ahead<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.220> check<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.549> out<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.880> lot<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.299> features

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
ahead and check it out a lot of features

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.839 
ahead and check it out a lot of features
on<00:03:36.810> this<00:03:36.930> new<00:03:37.260> unit<00:03:37.650> other<00:03:37.950> than<00:03:38.310> maybe<00:03:38.579> the

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
on this new unit other than maybe the

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.839 
on this new unit other than maybe the
needle<00:03:39.180> search<00:03:39.530> aren't<00:03:40.530> really<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:41.669> get

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
needle search aren't really going to get

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.180 
needle search aren't really going to get
you<00:03:42.030> anything<00:03:42.389> more<00:03:42.870> than<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.739> were<00:03:43.889> using

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
you anything more than if you were using

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.250 
you anything more than if you were using
it<00:03:44.549> with<00:03:46.940> then<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.450> were<00:03:48.599> using<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.079> with

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
it with then if you were using it with

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.869 
it with then if you were using it with
just<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.590> plain<00:03:49.859> CDJ<00:03:50.639> 1000<00:03:51.329> or<00:03:51.480> an<00:03:51.599> 800<00:03:52.730> you<00:03:53.730> know

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
just a plain CDJ 1000 or an 800 you know

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.909 
just a plain CDJ 1000 or an 800 you know
to<00:03:53.940> me<00:03:54.180> because<00:03:54.359> you<00:03:54.540> usually<00:03:55.200> use<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.739> built

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
to me because you usually use the built

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.039 
to me because you usually use the built
in<00:03:56.069> serato<00:03:56.430> features<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.239> not<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> native

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
in serato features and not the native

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.420 
in serato features and not the native
features<00:03:58.200> on<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.340> CD<00:03:59.879> deck<00:04:00.120> itself<00:04:01.129> now<00:04:02.129> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
features on the CD deck itself now it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.400 
features on the CD deck itself now it
does<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.060> two<00:04:03.239> thousand<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.810> i<00:04:03.930> believe<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
does the two thousand and i believe the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.240 
does the two thousand and i believe the
900<00:04:04.980> as<00:04:05.069> well<00:04:05.269> come<00:04:06.269> with<00:04:06.629> pioneer<00:04:07.560> software

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
900 as well come with pioneer software

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.890 
900 as well come with pioneer software
like<00:04:08.459> pioneer<00:04:09.000> apparently<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.569> making

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
like pioneer apparently is making

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.140 
like pioneer apparently is making
software<00:04:10.290> that<00:04:10.379> gives<00:04:10.650> with<00:04:10.829> these<00:04:11.069> now<00:04:11.310> that

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
software that gives with these now that

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.869 
software that gives with these now that
I<00:04:12.510> guess<00:04:13.169> is<00:04:13.379> supposed<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.799> be<00:04:13.919> competitor<00:04:14.609> for

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
I guess is supposed to be competitor for

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.190 
I guess is supposed to be competitor for
like<00:04:15.060> cerato<00:04:15.829> tractor<00:04:16.829> whatnot<00:04:17.959> maybe<00:04:18.959> it'll

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
like cerato tractor whatnot maybe it'll

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.670 
like cerato tractor whatnot maybe it'll
be<00:04:19.320> good<00:04:19.469> maybe<00:04:20.159> it'll<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.810> close<00:04:21.810> I'd

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
be good maybe it'll be close I'd

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.279 
be good maybe it'll be close I'd
it<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:23.729> I<00:04:23.880> had<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.120> guess<00:04:24.330> I'd<00:04:24.570> say<00:04:24.600> Saradha

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
it if I had to guess I'd say Saradha

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.939 
it if I had to guess I'd say Saradha
will<00:04:25.650> still<00:04:25.889> be<00:04:26.039> king<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.639> hill<00:04:27.949> with

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
will still be king of the hill with

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.040 
will still be king of the hill with
tractor<00:04:29.610> at<00:04:29.729> a<00:04:29.820> close<00:04:30.060> second<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.780> maybe

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
tractor at a close second and maybe

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.420 
tractor at a close second and maybe
virtual<00:04:31.740> vinyl<00:04:31.979> or<00:04:32.460> virtual<00:04:33.210> DJ<00:04:33.949> or<00:04:34.949> torque

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
know is the last piece of software

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.100 
know is the last piece of software
