00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
I know socks are little I had done a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.099 
I know socks are little I had done a
little<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> research<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> internet

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
little bit of research on the internet

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
little bit of research on the internet
and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.320> saw<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.739> there<00:00:58.920> were<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> DP<00:01:00.270> ends

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and I saw that there were the DP ends

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
and I saw that there were the DP ends
which<00:01:01.050> looked<00:01:01.530> scary<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> thought<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
which looked scary but I thought I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.039 
which looked scary but I thought I
looked<00:01:02.760> impressive<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.719> could<00:01:03.930> figure

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
looked impressive so if I could figure

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.770 
looked impressive so if I could figure
that<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.129> cool<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.270> then

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
that out that would be cool and then

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.210 
that out that would be cool and then
also<00:01:06.960> saw<00:01:08.510> Magic<00:01:09.510> Loop<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.710> seemed<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.549> be

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
also saw Magic Loop which seemed to be

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
also saw Magic Loop which seemed to be
like<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.430> innovation<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:16.280> two<00:01:17.280> Sox<00:01:17.790> at<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
like an innovation like a two Sox at the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.960 
like an innovation like a two Sox at the
same<00:01:18.479> time<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.470> needle<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.700> looks

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
same time on one needle that looks

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.960 
same time on one needle that looks
amazing<00:01:21.270> i<00:01:21.689> came<00:01:22.170> home<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.920> i<00:01:24.799> just<00:01:25.799> started

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
amazing i came home and i just started

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.499 
amazing i came home and i just started
looking<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> internet<00:01:29.119> cast<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
looking over the internet cast it on a

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.090 
looking over the internet cast it on a
couple<00:01:30.900> times<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.470> point<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.890> thinking

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
couple times at this point I'm thinking

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
couple times at this point I'm thinking
well<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.700> gonna<00:01:32.820> make<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.360> at<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> time

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
well I'm just gonna make one at a time

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.330 
well I'm just gonna make one at a time
eventually<00:01:34.590> I'll<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> two<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> time

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
eventually I'll get the two at a time

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.170 
eventually I'll get the two at a time
but<00:01:37.159> even<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.490> one<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but even with just one at a time I

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
but even with just one at a time I
couldn't<00:01:39.689> figure<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.140> what<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.590> doing

couldn't figure out what I was doing

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.480 
couldn't figure out what I was doing
there<00:01:41.369> were<00:01:41.460> quite<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> few<00:01:43.490> directions

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
there were quite a few directions

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.940 
there were quite a few directions
written<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:46.820> saying<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
written out saying how how to do it I

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.649 
written out saying how how to do it I
could<00:01:50.280> find<00:01:50.520> some<00:01:50.729> patterns<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> couldn't

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
could find some patterns but I couldn't

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
could find some patterns but I couldn't
understand<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> pattern<00:01:52.590> said<00:01:53.100> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
understand what the pattern said I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.260 
understand what the pattern said I
couldn't<00:01:54.210> figure<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.020> from<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> directions

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
couldn't figure out from the directions

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
couldn't figure out from the directions
what<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> was<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:59.119> found<00:02:00.770> knit
