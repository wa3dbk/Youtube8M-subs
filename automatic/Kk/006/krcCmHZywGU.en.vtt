hello<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.700> second<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> two<00:00:14.849> videos

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
hello this is the second of two videos

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.730 
hello this is the second of two videos
that<00:00:16.310> provides<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.550> overview<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.410> your<00:00:19.410> brain

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
that provides an overview of your brain

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.340 
that provides an overview of your brain
and<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.029> remember<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:21.900> video

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
and if you remember in the first video

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560 
and if you remember in the first video
we<00:00:22.650> cracked<00:00:22.949> open<00:00:23.160> Albert<00:00:23.699> skull<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.390> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
we cracked open Albert skull and I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
we cracked open Albert skull and I
showed<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.740> really<00:00:26.039> had<00:00:26.189> three

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
showed you that you really had three

brain and a human brain but today I
really<00:00:32.669> want<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.940> focus<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.739> the<00:00:34.969> midbrain<00:00:35.969> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
really want to focus on the midbrain and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.280 
really want to focus on the midbrain and

two<00:00:50.670> brains<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.270> work<00:00:51.449> together<00:00:53.570> but<00:00:54.570> often

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
two brains to work together but often

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.110 
two brains to work together but often
they<00:00:55.110> don't

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
they don't

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.319

for example this brain this brain

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
for example this brain this brain
