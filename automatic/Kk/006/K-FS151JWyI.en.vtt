00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:11.840
 Hello, I wanted to tell you about 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.840
 pruning and shaping in native just 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.970
 the grapes are Lebanese and therefore for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 he was comfortable looking after a man and 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:31.520
 came up with different shapes 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:33.120
 trim this is the power cordons to code 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.629
 vertical cordon 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 or right and here's another so furious 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.270
 horizontal cordon or 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.280
 vertical form but vertical form 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.280
 usually used for covering 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:58.890
 viticulture 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 there are still such forms as indefinitely 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.380
 shelter gazebos get beautiful 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.520
 a gazebo for large beautiful leaves and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.150
 grapes that hangs down 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.150
 dessert reception 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 there are features trimming everything is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:32.270
 to load the grapes normally and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.010
 get good quality at times 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.940
 if we cut the vine 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:46.610
 more than necessary if we lose uraza 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:49.170
 well we leave more we get u say 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.640
 substandard harvest ie small 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.600
 their brush will be many but it will be bad 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.259
 matured 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.860
 and will be badly flown one-year 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.710
 shoots 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 it will reload tasty thought 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.380
 interested get of course 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.380
 high-quality harvest 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:18.810
 that's why people came up with different forms 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:22.130
 pruning and forms a bush than is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.130
 bush formation 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.830
 did soo tone there is also polarity 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.730
 that is, if you take the escape which 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.640
 is located below and there will be an escape which 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.160
 be up this escape which 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.330
 the top will develop much stronger than 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:51.239
 below so people and form 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.769
 vine horizontal then 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.769
 shoots get develop will 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.769
 equally 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.850
 and now let's see how you can 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.160
 form us just 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.160
 for this we take let's say this form 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.630
 there are wines glad that grows very 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.220
 very tall 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:31.900
 quickly and there are grapes that grow 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:38.470
 more slowly it depends and here are the sorts 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:41.459
 grapes well there we will now 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.890
 form here it rocks strongly with 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:53.610
 let's say it means it takes less time 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:56.470
 if he grows weak it will take 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:03.250
 more time means let's say more 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:07.920
 years begin gradually begins 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.500
 form koh folk cusa cool 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.430
 the gift on top grows and reaches a little 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.160
 greater length 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.350
 we need his doctors sing it we 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:25.120
 form the headquarters 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:34.680
 usually it is from 67 to 108 network 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:38.090
 centimeters to give the opportunity to grow 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.090
 side lift 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.500
 there are forming shoulders with them 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:53.470
 cadal achieved not long needed 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:59.289
 us, too, acne puede although the extension 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:01.530
 stamp will also remove the green we 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.530
 shoots 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:13.750
 so that all the nutrients go away 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:21.250
 up when we made a nip 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:28.870
 the growth of lateral shoots begins wilted 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:34.830
 we form already time on the one hand with 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:39.280
 other side all the extra shoots are removed 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:43.180
 when paints are formed we can 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.259
 already cut them form on them 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.969
 then fruit links are fruit 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:56.789
 links this is usually escape on 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:01.630
 fruiting 68 buds and replacement 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:08.310
 this leaves beta 3 buds two or three 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:15.810
 buds here we have a bush formed 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:15.810
 other forms of bush are also forming 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.220
 by this principle 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.199
 thank you all the best of luck 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.199
