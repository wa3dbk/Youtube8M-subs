00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
sensitivity hi I found it a lot easier

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.699 
sensitivity hi I found it a lot easier
for<00:04:09.000> me<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.449> actually<00:04:09.840> detect<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.349> if<00:04:10.560> it's

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
for me to actually detect it if it's

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.589 
for me to actually detect it if it's
high<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.549> can<00:04:11.639> go<00:04:11.790> inside<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.269> whatever

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
high you can go inside to whatever

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.360 
high you can go inside to whatever
really<00:04:12.780> wants<00:04:13.139> even<00:04:13.620> very<00:04:14.009> high<00:04:14.189> if<00:04:14.340> you

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
really wants even very high if you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.129 
really wants even very high if you
really<00:04:14.879> like<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.269> I'm<00:04:15.629> just<00:04:15.689> gonna<00:04:15.870> set<00:04:16.019> to

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
really like to I'm just gonna set to

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.949 
really like to I'm just gonna set to
hide<00:04:16.370> then<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.549> judge<00:04:17.729> edge<00:04:18.359> position

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
hide then you can judge edge position

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.959 
hide then you can judge edge position
and<00:04:19.139> Heights<00:04:19.409> I<00:04:19.709> believe<00:04:20.159> yes<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.669> that's<00:04:20.789> not

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
and Heights I believe yes so that's not

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.909 
and Heights I believe yes so that's not
pro<00:04:21.180> version<00:04:21.389> so<00:04:22.289> actually<00:04:22.529> changed<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.830> right

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
pro version so actually changed it right

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.930 
pro version so actually changed it right
here<00:04:23.159> but<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.490> go<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.639> change<00:04:23.760> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
here but you can go and change the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.089 
here but you can go and change the
position<00:04:24.389> wherever<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.169> really<00:04:25.440> like<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.860> so

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
position wherever you really like to so

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.840 
position wherever you really like to so
I'm<00:04:26.159> gonna<00:04:26.250> put<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.490> right<00:04:26.520> there

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
I'm gonna put it right there

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.550 
I'm gonna put it right there
and<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.390> height<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.600> its<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.230> can<00:04:28.350> make<00:04:28.440> it

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and the height of its so you can make it

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.130 
and the height of its so you can make it
longer<00:04:28.770> or<00:04:28.920> shorter<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.970> that's<00:04:30.180> maybe<00:04:31.050> a

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
longer or shorter so that's maybe a

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.270 
longer or shorter so that's maybe a
little<00:04:31.170> bit<00:04:31.350> less<00:04:31.530> right<00:04:31.830> there<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.160> that's

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
little bit less right there so that's

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.350 
little bit less right there so that's
about<00:04:32.370> right

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
about right

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.880 
about right
