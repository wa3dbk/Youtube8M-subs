00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.650 

the<00:00:59.220> specifics<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> swim<00:01:00.180> set<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.510> quite

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the specifics of a swim set are quite

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.420 
the specifics of a swim set are quite
simple<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.680> find<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.190> hard

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
simple I think I don't find it very hard

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
simple I think I don't find it very hard
you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.150> you<00:01:03.210> start<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> warm-up<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you know you start with a warm-up you do

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
you know you start with a warm-up you do
a<00:01:04.320> preset<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:04.979> your<00:01:05.100> heart<00:01:05.280> rate<00:01:05.460> now

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a preset to get your heart rate now

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.070 
a preset to get your heart rate now
right<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.180> main<00:01:06.330> set<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:06.780> leads

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
right up for the main set which leads

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.390 
right up for the main set which leads
into<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> main<00:01:07.470> sec<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.800> do<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:08.010> main<00:01:08.160> set

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
into the main sec you do your main set

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.710 
into the main sec you do your main set
using<00:01:08.610> kik<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.060> some<00:01:09.210> strength<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
using kik and some strength of the you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
using kik and some strength of the you
do<00:01:09.840> cool<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.410> pretty<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> swim

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
do cool down that's pretty much a swim

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.660 
do cool down that's pretty much a swim
set<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.670> niceties

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
set so you know there that the niceties

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
set so you know there that the niceties
of<00:01:14.850> swimming<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> add<00:01:15.660> the

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
of swimming and then you add the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.900 
of swimming and then you add the
specifics<00:01:16.410> as<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> go<00:01:16.800> so<00:01:17.340> depending<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
specifics as you go so depending on the

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.160 
specifics as you go so depending on the
day<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> time<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> phase<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
day and the time and the phase of

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
day and the time and the phase of
training<00:01:19.500> at<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> beats<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.670> add

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
training at that beats are in you add

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:42.480 
training at that beats are in you add
the<00:01:20.940> specific<00:01:21.360> supper

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.870 

I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.829> the<00:01:44.890> surprising<00:01:45.399> thing<00:01:45.460> for<00:01:45.700> most

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
I think the surprising thing for most

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.760 
I think the surprising thing for most
people<00:01:46.180> is<00:01:46.270> going<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.540> be<00:01:46.659> that<00:01:46.869> bread<00:01:47.590> knife

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
people is going to be that bread knife

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.380 
people is going to be that bread knife
sat<00:01:48.070> down<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.399> spoken<00:01:48.759> a<00:01:48.820> lot<00:01:48.970> about<00:01:49.030> the

sat down and spoken a lot about the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.730 
sat down and spoken a lot about the
technical<00:01:49.659> aspects<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.290> all<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.560> three

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740

disciplines that we really need to work

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.610 
disciplines that we really need to work
