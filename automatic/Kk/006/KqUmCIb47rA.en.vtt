would work activision and infinity ward
would<00:00:40.770> ready<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> weapons<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:41.910> were

and<00:00:44.430> testing<00:00:44.600> this<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:45.960> transferring

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and testing this would mean transferring

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.639

with<00:00:52.320> 3d<00:00:52.710> modeling<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.340> creation<00:00:53.820> i<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.329> tell

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
with 3d modeling and creation i can tell

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
with 3d modeling and creation i can tell
you<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.020> wouldn't<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.500> very<00:00:55.530> difficult

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
you that that wouldn't be very difficult

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.860 
you that that wouldn't be very difficult
for<00:00:56.579> them<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.300> likely<00:00:57.510> if

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
for them to do and it's likely if

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
for them to do and it's likely if
they're<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> gun<00:00:58.859> dlc<00:00:59.039> they<00:00:59.640> already

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
they're going to gun dlc they already

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.599 
they're going to gun dlc they already
have<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:01.199> worry<00:01:01.440> i<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
have the only worry i could have is that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.460 
have the only worry i could have is that
if<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> developers<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.660> barely<00:01:04.019> balanced

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
if the developers can barely balanced

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.320 
if the developers can barely balanced
the<00:01:04.619> weapons<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> model<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:05.909> 3<00:01:06.090> now

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the weapons they have a model for 3 now

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.899 
the weapons they have a model for 3 now
then<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> could<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> shitstorm<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.520> add<00:01:08.670> more

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
then it could be a shitstorm to add more

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
then it could be a shitstorm to add more
but<00:01:09.689> if<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.049> will<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.290> fans<00:01:10.619> happy<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.189> by

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
but if it will make fans happy then by

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.810 
but if it will make fans happy then by
all<00:01:11.340> means<00:01:11.549> they<00:01:12.030> should<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:13.610> after<00:01:14.610> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
all means they should do it after all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390 
all means they should do it after all
the<00:01:14.970> weapon<00:01:15.270> files<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.810> ready<00:01:16.200> likely<00:01:17.040> prior
