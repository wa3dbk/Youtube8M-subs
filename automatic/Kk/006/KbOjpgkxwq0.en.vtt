00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.610
 hello to all guys and come back with 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.580
 a new appointment today I wanted 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.980
 talk to him as promised how 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.630
 stabilize at video cunico for the 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.840
 gopro I use two programs that precisely 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:33.489
 as I have already said they are hard on and ad hoc 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.280
 premier and as I have already said the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.180
 best to make a stable video 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.370
 it's definitely making the video stable 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.969
 exactly as in this case is enough 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.300
 attach the camera to a fixed point 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.940
 eo otherwise this is what 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.840
 happens for example I took this clip 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:59.170
 to show you that it is a video 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.510
 pretty choppy or become a newsstand 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.260
 both mobile Romans but then what can 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.260
 improve 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:28.700
 this is a video I made again 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 long ago I still had mine in this is 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.890
 what precisely then the programs are 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.270
 or just import the file that you give me 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.990
 gives the possibility to do directly 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.960
 correction with one click 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.850
 simply click on and 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.060
 then we can make the comparison between the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:56.420
 new issue the old version 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:58.640
 checking the movie quickly, yes 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.429
 can do or not we go immediately to do 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.069
 the correction with a click that he goes to 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.069
 make an alarm zoom immediately 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.759
 image adds sharpness 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.019
 balancing a contrast entry 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.810
 that this is the comparison here is the 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.859
 we see better by going a little bit more 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.450
 ahead anyway already known from asphalt 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.900
 quite the pest bicycle in front 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.200
 of gentlemen we can stop 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.810
 the differences you notice you can not 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.880
 live in eyes that obviously there is one 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.970
 loss of image quality because 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.579
 unfortunately bulerias is so we go to 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.260
 remove all the various improvements 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.760
 because it does not only concern the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.920
 obvious stabilization you can 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.530
 also fix the effects or 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.549
 go to adjust individually all 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:57.709
 various improvements and there remains therefore 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.989
 that going to save our file it 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.220
 we simply change more saves 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.930
 selecting the resolution what 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.520
 it's here in the drop-down menu and save there 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.790
 the teacher 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.470
 a second thing that gives as a possibility 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.580
 bol.it in once finished the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.950
 rescue is being able to do in the advanced 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.840
 the comparison with the saves both 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.090
 versions both the original and the one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.730
 improved within the same file 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.450
 that's what i 'll show you is the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.450
 result 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.720
 as you can see the original is enough 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.590
 last stabilizer being the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.670
 slightly with a little more inhuman e 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.480
 it is a firm port we say that for 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.030
 the small shocks are perfectly obvious that 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:01.490
 as in this case on the road 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.380
 completely unpaved where there are 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.520
 very many not very many i 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.250
 movements 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.250
 unfortunately you can't do miracles 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.880
 the second option to the premier 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.140
 here we have the timeline 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.860
 let's take our video which is precisely 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.960
 the first 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:31.470
 the omission of the in line and in the 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.870
 effects just go look for the master 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.550
 write stub wants to pass him dizer yes 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.260
 just call and drag 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.510
 directly above the video 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.460
 he begins his analysis in the background 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.030
 and you starting frame by 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.310
 frame that I can easily 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.990
 start working then there is start 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.860
 I can continue my work while 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:58.080
 he works in the background precisely 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.330
 we can go to choose the type of 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.870
 movement if we want those reforms that 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:09.400
 the percentage of type of method 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.400
 a scale the frame we have from da 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.910
 vary so many possibilities 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.690
 everyone will find the best and this is it 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.100
 the result 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.720
 as you see in a much more marked team 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.590
 but also stabilization 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:30.940
 picture is much much better not 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:35.460
 I know it is not said however it is as you see 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:39.430
 precisely even in the intarget areas 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.820
 disconnected seems to have a good one 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.820
 good result 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:03.179
 this is how I promised you 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:05.550
 see the chair results that I quote the 

00:06:03.179 --> 00:06:08.839
 video just put a like if there 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:13.669
 are questions just write a comment 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:16.409
 I believe I have given enough 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.339
 information is enough to just ask 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:22.769
 and then I just have to greet you 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:25.080
 I refer to the various links because not 

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.209
 only on youtube are cyprus but you find me 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.399
 also on twitter and on facebook, that's enough 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:31.399
 look for the Pope bye bye
