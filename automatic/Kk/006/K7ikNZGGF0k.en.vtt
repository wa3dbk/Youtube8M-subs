00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:02.919 
well we've been waiting for a new civic

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.340 
well we've been waiting for a new civic
type-r<00:00:03.249> for<00:00:03.489> quite<00:00:03.699> some<00:00:03.909> time<00:00:03.939> and<00:00:04.480> here<00:00:05.169> is

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
type-r for quite some time and here is

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.829 
type-r for quite some time and here is
it's<00:00:05.589> finally<00:00:05.980> arrived<00:00:06.540> although<00:00:07.540> actually

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 
it's finally arrived although actually

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.350 
it's finally arrived although actually
that's<00:00:08.230> just<00:00:08.860> a<00:00:08.950> concept<00:00:09.370> however<00:00:10.030> it<00:00:10.210> is

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
that's just a concept however it is

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.910 
that's just a concept however it is
pretty<00:00:10.780> close<00:00:11.020> to<00:00:11.230> what<00:00:11.350> the<00:00:11.410> production

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
pretty close to what the production

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.410 
pretty close to what the production
version<00:00:12.040> will<00:00:12.310> look<00:00:12.400> like<00:00:12.580> when<00:00:13.030> it<00:00:13.180> does

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
version will look like when it does

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.529 
version will look like when it does
arrive<00:00:13.570> next<00:00:14.470> year<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:15.550> Civic<00:00:15.850> type<00:00:16.029> r<00:00:16.240> has

this<00:01:32.770> concept<00:01:33.280> was<00:01:33.520> designed<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.030> Swindon<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
this concept was designed in Swindon the

this concept was designed in Swindon the
actual<00:01:35.320> production<00:01:35.440> car<00:01:35.950> is<00:01:36.130> being<00:01:36.340> designed

in<00:01:36.940> Japan<00:01:37.330> but<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.510> two<00:01:37.750> teams<00:01:38.020> are<00:01:38.200> currently

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
in Japan but the two teams are currently

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.440 
in Japan but the two teams are currently
working<00:01:38.680> very<00:01:38.890> closely<00:01:39.250> together<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.300> there's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
working very closely together so there's

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.730 
working very closely together so there's
