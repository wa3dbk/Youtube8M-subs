hello<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.800> is<00:00:04.860> learning<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.490> mark<00:00:05.790> Warren

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
hello this is learning with mark Warren

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.850 
hello this is learning with mark Warren
and<00:00:06.359> today<00:00:06.569> I've<00:00:06.690> got<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.930> quick<00:00:07.020> photography

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860 
and today I've got a quick photography

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.310 
and today I've got a quick photography
tip<00:00:08.069> video<00:00:08.430> for<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.960> we're<00:00:09.960> going<00:00:10.049> to<00:00:10.139> talk

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
tip video for you we're going to talk

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.230 
tip video for you we're going to talk
about<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.710> difference<00:00:11.100> of<00:00:11.340> distortion

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
about the difference of distortion

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.270 
about the difference of distortion
versus<00:00:12.690> compression<00:00:13.350> when<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> comes<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.010> lens

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
versus compression when it comes to lens

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.670 
versus compression when it comes to lens
selection<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.209> couple<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.080> weeks<00:00:16.230> ago<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.470> was

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
selection a couple of weeks ago I was

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.710 
selection a couple of weeks ago I was
teaching<00:00:16.980> my<00:00:17.100> photography<00:00:17.699> class<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.570> was

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
teaching my photography class and I was

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.599 
teaching my photography class and I was
explaining<00:00:19.110> to<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.500> students<00:00:20.099> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
explaining to the students the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.800 
explaining to the students the
difference<00:00:20.970> between<00:00:21.330> shooting<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
difference between shooting with

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.339 
difference between shooting with
wide-angle<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.949> telephoto<00:00:23.119> lenses

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
wide-angle and telephoto lenses

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.570 
wide-angle and telephoto lenses
basically<00:00:25.349> it<00:00:25.439> boils<00:00:25.710> down<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
basically it boils down to this if you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.429 
basically it boils down to this if you
shoot<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.999> wide-angle<00:00:27.390> lens<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.289> can

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
shoot with a wide-angle lens it can

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.759 
shoot with a wide-angle lens it can
distort<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.130> actual<00:00:29.579> view<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.300> see

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
distort the actual view that we see

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.690 
distort the actual view that we see
objects<00:00:31.769> tend<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> look<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.490> more

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
objects tend to look a little more

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.450 
objects tend to look a little more
rounded<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.410> get<00:00:34.740> this<00:00:34.950> bowing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
rounded and also you get this bowing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
rounded and also you get this bowing
type<00:00:35.699> effect<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.270> landscapes<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.590> that's<00:00:37.770> one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
type effect on landscapes so that's one

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
type effect on landscapes so that's one
of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> issues<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.030> can<00:00:39.180> run<00:00:39.360> into<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of the issues that you can run into with

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.740 
of the issues that you can run into with
shooting<00:00:40.739> wide-angle<00:00:41.520> granted<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.359> you<00:00:42.510> shoot

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
shooting wide-angle granted if you shoot

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
shooting wide-angle granted if you shoot
with<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.170> long<00:00:43.590> lens<00:00:43.949> like<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> hundred

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with a long lens like a hundred

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
with a long lens like a hundred
millimeter<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.359> 200<00:00:45.870> millimeter<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.949> get<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
millimeter or 200 millimeter you get a

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
millimeter or 200 millimeter you get a
compression<00:00:47.789> effect<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.449> basically<00:00:49.320> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
compression effect so basically your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.680 
compression effect so basically your
foreground<00:00:50.039> object<00:00:50.609> may<00:00:51.030> look<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.600> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
foreground object may look like it's a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.869 
foreground object may look like it's a
lot<00:00:51.930> closer<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.649> background<00:00:53.250> object<00:00:53.460> than

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
lot closer to the background object than

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.349 
lot closer to the background object than
it<00:00:54.000> really<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.429> choice<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
it really is so it's really a choice of

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.910 
it really is so it's really a choice of
which<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.079> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> go<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.679> would<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
which one you want to go with would you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.740 
which one you want to go with would you
rather<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.370> these<00:00:59.579> distortion<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
rather have these distortion or the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.849 
rather have these distortion or the
compression<00:01:01.260> effect

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
compression effect

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.369 
compression effect
well<00:01:02.550> after<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> class<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.719> next<00:01:03.899> week<00:01:04.170> when

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
well after that class the next week when

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.500 
well after that class the next week when
we<00:01:04.500> came<00:01:04.769> back<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.730> of<00:01:05.820> my<00:01:05.850> students<00:01:06.330> came

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
we came back one of my students came

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.540 
we came back one of my students came
back<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> said<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.140> understand<00:01:07.800> exactly<00:01:07.890> what

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
back and said I understand exactly what

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.620 
back and said I understand exactly what
you're<00:01:08.700> talking<00:01:08.850> about<00:01:09.060> when<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.450> talking

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you're talking about when you're talking

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.650 
you're talking about when you're talking
about<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.350> distorted<00:01:11.060> effects<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.300> also<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:12.660 
about the distorted effects and also the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.840 
about the distorted effects and also the
compression<00:01:13.110> effects<00:01:13.410> she<00:01:14.160> was<00:01:14.280> watching<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
compression effects she was watching the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
compression effects she was watching the
Olympics<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.690> was<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> downhill<00:01:16.500> skiing

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
Olympics and it was a downhill skiing

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.000 
Olympics and it was a downhill skiing
event<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.620> first-place

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
event and one of the the first-place

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.430 
event and one of the the first-place
winner<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> gold<00:01:20.820> medal<00:01:21.210> winner<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:22.050> coming

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
winner the gold medal winner was coming

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.440 
winner the gold medal winner was coming
up<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> line<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.550> then<00:01:23.760> they<00:01:23.910> had<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.120> shot

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
up on the line but then they had a shot

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.370 
up on the line but then they had a shot
of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.200> second<00:01:26.190> place<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> silver<00:01:27.000> finish

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
of the second place or the silver finish

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.920 
of the second place or the silver finish
person<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.650> behind<00:01:29.040> them<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.690> she<00:01:30.690> said

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
person right behind them so she said

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
person right behind them so she said
when<00:01:31.170> they<00:01:31.290> looked<00:01:31.560> at<00:01:31.710> him<00:01:31.890> straight<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.550> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
when they looked at him straight on to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
when they looked at him straight on to
the<00:01:32.850> camera<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.660> see<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:34.050> person<00:01:34.470> here

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the camera you could see one person here

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.990 
the camera you could see one person here
and<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.890> other<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.460> right<00:01:35.850> behind

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and the other one was like right behind

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400 
and the other one was like right behind
but<00:01:36.330> they<00:01:36.420> looked<00:01:36.660> like<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:36.960> were<00:01:37.020> really

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
but they looked like they were really

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.160 
but they looked like they were really
close<00:01:37.740> together<00:01:38.010> then<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.390> an<00:01:39.510> overhead

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
close together then they did an overhead

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.650 
close together then they did an overhead
shot<00:01:40.230> and<00:01:40.830> looking<00:01:41.730> at<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> overhead<00:01:42.420> they

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
shot and looking at the overhead they

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.780 
shot and looking at the overhead they
were<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.960> 50<00:01:43.470> feet<00:01:43.500> apart<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.550> really

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
were like 50 feet apart so it really

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.930 
were like 50 feet apart so it really
looked<00:01:45.090> like<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.480> was<00:01:45.630> more<00:01:45.810> like<00:01:46.080> this<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.940> she

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
looked like it was more like this so she

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.670 
looked like it was more like this so she
said<00:01:48.120> well<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.080> what<00:01:49.260> you're<00:01:49.410> talking

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
said well is that what you're talking

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.930 
said well is that what you're talking
about<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:50.040> compression<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
about with compression and the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.530 
about with compression and the
distortion<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:51.510> I<00:01:51.600> said<00:01:51.780> exactly<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.540> again

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
distortion and I said exactly so again

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.480 
distortion and I said exactly so again
when<00:01:54.870> you're<00:01:54.960> shooting<00:01:55.260> with<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.410> long<00:01:55.920> lens

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
when you're shooting with that long lens

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.280 
when you're shooting with that long lens
it<00:01:56.580> looks<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> objects<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.750> really

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it looks like the objects are really

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.010 
it looks like the objects are really
really<00:01:58.560> close<00:01:58.800> together<00:01:59.010> but<00:01:59.460> because<00:02:00.020> lenses

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
really close together but because lenses

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
really close together but because lenses
long<00:02:01.320> lenses<00:02:01.740> tend<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.130> compress<00:02:02.580> things<00:02:02.790> they

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
long lenses tend to compress things they

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.370 
long lenses tend to compress things they
make<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.510> look<00:02:03.720> like<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:04.080> really

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
make things look like they're really

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.370 
make things look like they're really
close<00:02:04.830> together<00:02:05.570> then<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.930> get<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.230> effect

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
close together then you get that effect

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
close together then you get that effect
so<00:02:07.830> we're<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.160> pull<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> couple<00:02:08.759> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so we're gonna pull up a couple of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.729 
so we're gonna pull up a couple of
images<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> computer<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.410> show<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
images here on the computer and show you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.039 
images here on the computer and show you
those<00:02:11.069> differences<00:02:11.670> between<00:02:12.420> shooting<00:02:12.959> with

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
those differences between shooting with

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.050 
those differences between shooting with
the<00:02:13.170> long<00:02:13.379> lens<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.769> a<00:02:14.010> short<00:02:14.280> lens<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.939> of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the long lens and a short lens and of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.430 
the long lens and a short lens and of
course<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.659> might<00:02:15.870> influence

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
course that might influence

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.770 
course that might influence
decisional<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.220> type<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.610> lens<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.000> use<00:02:18.240> for

decisional what type of lens to use for

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.130 
decisional what type of lens to use for
your<00:02:18.960> next<00:02:19.140> project<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:21.150> took<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> few<00:02:21.660> shots<00:02:21.870> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
your next project we took a few shots of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
your next project we took a few shots of
some<00:02:22.350> figurines<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.160> let<00:02:23.640> me<00:02:23.760> show<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.030> some

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
some figurines and let me show you some

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.300 
some figurines and let me show you some
of<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> differences<00:02:25.290> between<00:02:25.590> shooting<00:02:26.160> with

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
of the differences between shooting with

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.610 
of the differences between shooting with
a<00:02:26.490> wide<00:02:26.850> angle<00:02:27.180> lens<00:02:27.360> versus<00:02:28.050> shooting<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.590> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
a wide angle lens versus shooting with a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.610 
a wide angle lens versus shooting with a
telephoto<00:02:29.220> lens<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.270> our<00:02:30.390> first<00:02:30.630> example<00:02:31.260> here

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
telephoto lens so our first example here

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.890 
telephoto lens so our first example here
we<00:02:31.740> shot<00:02:31.980> with<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> 18<00:02:32.700> millimeter<00:02:33.210> lens

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
we shot with the 18 millimeter lens

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.230 
we shot with the 18 millimeter lens
let's<00:02:34.560> diagnose<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.460> look<00:02:35.640> at<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:35.970> image

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
let's diagnose and look at this image

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.920 
let's diagnose and look at this image
our<00:02:36.660> foreground<00:02:37.560> subject<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.970> really

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
our foreground subject here is really

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.540 
our foreground subject here is really
close<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.590> camera<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:41.250> makes<00:02:41.400> our

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
close to the camera and it makes our

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.760 
close to the camera and it makes our
background<00:02:42.180> object<00:02:42.780> or<00:02:42.900> subject<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.560> look

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
background object or subject here look

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.580 
background object or subject here look
like<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.130> really<00:02:44.490> far<00:02:44.760> away<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.410> were

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
like it's really far away now if I were

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
like it's really far away now if I were
to<00:02:46.650> put<00:02:46.890> these<00:02:47.070> figurines<00:02:47.540> side-by-side

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
to put these figurines side-by-side

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.750 
to put these figurines side-by-side
they're<00:02:49.050> almost<00:02:49.320> exactly<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.220> same<00:02:50.250> height

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
they're almost exactly the same height

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.720 
they're almost exactly the same height
but<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.300> one<00:02:51.480> looks<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.930> quite<00:02:52.710> a<00:02:52.740> bit<00:02:53.010> shorter

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
but this one looks a quite a bit shorter

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
but this one looks a quite a bit shorter
than<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:54.270> foreground<00:02:54.810> object<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:55.620> our

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
got going on here is look at the lines

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.750 
got going on here is look at the lines

to be bowed or arcing this is the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.450 
to be bowed or arcing this is the
distortion<00:03:07.560> effect<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.160> you're<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.430> to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
distortion effect that you're going to

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.700 
distortion effect that you're going to
get<00:03:08.700> when<00:03:08.940> shooting<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.330> wide-angle<00:03:10.320> lenses

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710

get when shooting with wide-angle lenses
now<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.250> can<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.550> corrected<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.480> software

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
now this can be corrected and software

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.430 
now this can be corrected and software
and<00:03:13.470> post-processing<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:15.150> again<00:03:15.900> typically

you're<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.020> get<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.320> distortion

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
you're going to get this distortion

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.850 
you're going to get this distortion
effect<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:21.660> there's<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.410> little<00:03:22.650> bit<00:03:22.739> of

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
effect now there's a little bit of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.410 
effect now there's a little bit of
perspective<00:03:23.190> difference<00:03:23.850> here<00:03:24.030> we<00:03:24.180> didn't

perspective difference here we didn't

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.720 
perspective difference here we didn't
shoot<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.720> exactly<00:03:25.440> 90<00:03:25.830> degrees<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.640> it

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
shoot this exactly 90 degrees on so it

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.340 
shoot this exactly 90 degrees on so it
looks<00:03:26.910> like<00:03:27.060> our<00:03:27.209> lines<00:03:27.450> are<00:03:27.690> kind<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.930> falling

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
looks like our lines are kind of falling

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.440 
looks like our lines are kind of falling
or<00:03:28.530> merging<00:03:29.040> together<00:03:29.190> converging<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.120> way

here<00:03:33.780> there's<00:03:33.989> not<00:03:34.230> clean<00:03:34.920> or<00:03:35.160> straight<00:03:35.640> lines

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
here there's not clean or straight lines

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.840 
here there's not clean or straight lines
here<00:03:36.360> on<00:03:36.630> these<00:03:36.870> objects<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> background

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
here on these objects in the background

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.340 
here on these objects in the background
so<00:03:38.850> let's<00:03:39.120> take<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.300> look<00:03:39.480> at<00:03:39.630> our<00:03:39.750> next<00:03:40.050> image

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
so let's take a look at our next image

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.260 
so let's take a look at our next image
that<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.680> shot<00:03:40.890> with<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> hundred<00:03:41.640> millimeter

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
that we shot with a hundred millimeter

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.240 
that we shot with a hundred millimeter
lens<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.750> show<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.140> differences<00:03:43.590> now

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
lens and show you the differences now

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.770 
lens and show you the differences now
there's<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.700> more<00:03:44.850> thing<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.209> also<00:03:45.390> want<00:03:45.720> to

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
there's one more thing I also want to

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.900 
there's one more thing I also want to
point<00:03:45.989> out<00:03:46.200> too<00:03:46.380> as<00:03:46.500> well<00:03:46.680> look<00:03:47.400> at<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.640> soap

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
point out too as well look at this soap

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.240 
point out too as well look at this soap
dispenser<00:03:48.510> bottle<00:03:48.870> here<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:50.040> distance

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
dispenser bottle here and the distance

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.270 
dispenser bottle here and the distance
between<00:03:50.760> these<00:03:51.120> these<00:03:51.540> objects<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.830> appears

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
between these these objects this appears

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.000 
between these these objects this appears
really<00:03:53.700> close<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.570> appears<00:03:55.410> quite<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.800> bit

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
really close this appears quite a bit

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.440 
really close this appears quite a bit
further<00:03:56.220> away<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.030> soap<00:03:57.269> dispenser

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
further away and the soap dispenser

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.470 
further away and the soap dispenser
bottle<00:03:58.170> appears<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.850> far<00:04:00.090> away

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
bottle appears to be really far away

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.750 
bottle appears to be really far away
here<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.320> because<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.769> this<00:04:01.890> wide-angle

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
here just because of this wide-angle

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.180 
here just because of this wide-angle
lens<00:04:03.000> let's<00:04:03.900> go<00:04:04.050> to<00:04:04.110> our<00:04:04.290> next<00:04:04.470> image<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:05.100> we

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
lens let's go to our next image that we

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.270 
lens let's go to our next image that we
shot<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.550> 100<00:04:05.970> millimeter<00:04:06.390> lens<00:04:06.980> now<00:04:07.980> let's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
shot with 100 millimeter lens now let's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.759 
shot with 100 millimeter lens now let's
look<00:04:08.430> at<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.700> difference<00:04:09.060> we<00:04:09.870> shot<00:04:10.110> these<00:04:10.350> so

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
look at the difference we shot these so

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.070 
look at the difference we shot these so
there<00:04:11.130> are<00:04:11.250> roughly<00:04:11.790> about<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> same<00:04:12.420> size

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
there are roughly about the same size

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.800 
there are roughly about the same size
and<00:04:13.739> or<00:04:14.519> at<00:04:14.640> least<00:04:14.790> our<00:04:14.940> foreground<00:04:15.180> subject

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
and or at least our foreground subject

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.780 
and or at least our foreground subject
it's<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.169> same<00:04:16.470> size<00:04:16.799> and<00:04:17.100> each<00:04:17.340> one<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
it's the same size and each one of the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.300 
it's the same size and each one of the
images<00:04:18.269> here<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.230> if<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.830> look<00:04:20.040> at<00:04:20.160> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
images here and if we look at the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.240 
images here and if we look at the
foreground<00:04:20.760> one<00:04:21.150> now<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.290> appears<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
foreground one now it appears that the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.480 
foreground one now it appears that the
background<00:04:23.790> one<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> lot<00:04:24.750> closer<00:04:25.260> together

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
background one is a lot closer together

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.670 
background one is a lot closer together
they're<00:04:27.000> almost<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.630> quite<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.229> same<00:04:28.440> height

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
they're almost not quite the same height

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.310 
they're almost not quite the same height
but<00:04:28.890> they

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
but they

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.140 
but they
to<00:04:29.440> be<00:04:29.590> about<00:04:29.860> just<00:04:30.160> about<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.580> same<00:04:30.820> height

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
to be about just about the same height

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150 
to be about just about the same height
now<00:04:31.350> versus<00:04:32.350> here<00:04:32.680> where<00:04:33.010> they're

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
now versus here where they're

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.870 
now versus here where they're
substantially<00:04:33.550> different<00:04:35.280> also<00:04:36.280> look<00:04:36.670> at<00:04:36.760> our

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
substantially different also look at our

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.310 
substantially different also look at our
soap<00:04:37.090> dispenser<00:04:37.630> bottle<00:04:37.960> here<00:04:38.170> in<00:04:38.230> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
soap dispenser bottle here in the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.500 
soap dispenser bottle here in the
background<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:39.100> appears<00:04:39.520> to<00:04:39.670> be<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.790> lot<00:04:40.120> closer

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
background it appears to be a lot closer

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.270 
background it appears to be a lot closer
to<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.900> background<00:04:41.380> object<00:04:41.620> here<00:04:42.040> and<00:04:42.160> even

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
to the background object here and even

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.460 
to the background object here and even
our<00:04:42.490> foreground<00:04:42.760> subject<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.660> appears<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.440> be

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
our foreground subject it appears to be

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.620 
our foreground subject it appears to be
a<00:04:44.560> lot<00:04:44.860> closer<00:04:45.220> than<00:04:45.640> what<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.180> does<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.540> our

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
a lot closer than what it does in our

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.990 
a lot closer than what it does in our
first<00:04:46.900> shot<00:04:47.140> here<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.580> this<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.910> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
first shot here so this is the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.820 
first shot here so this is the
difference<00:04:49.330> between<00:04:49.390> shooting<00:04:49.930> with<00:04:50.320> long

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
difference between shooting with long

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.070 
difference between shooting with long
lenses<00:04:51.190> versus<00:04:51.970> shooting<00:04:52.330> with<00:04:52.510> a<00:04:52.720> wide-angle

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080

another<00:04:54.790> thing<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.270> note<00:04:55.420> is<00:04:55.630> look<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:55.960> our

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
another thing to note is look at our

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.960 
another thing to note is look at our
lines<00:04:56.380> here<00:04:56.620> on<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.830> cabinet<00:04:57.310> they<00:04:57.460> seem<00:04:57.820> to

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
lines here on the cabinet they seem to

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.570 
lines here on the cabinet they seem to
be<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> lot<00:04:58.480> straighter<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.560> don't<00:05:00.190> have<00:05:00.430> the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
be a lot straighter and don't have the

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.430 
be a lot straighter and don't have the
bowing<00:05:00.940> or<00:05:01.030> arcing<00:05:01.600> effect<00:05:01.960> that<00:05:02.170> you<00:05:02.290> get

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
bowing or arcing effect that you get

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.130 
bowing or arcing effect that you get
with<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> wide-angle<00:05:03.040> lens<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:04.690> even<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
with the wide-angle lens so even the

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.110 
with the wide-angle lens so even the
front<00:05:05.380> object<00:05:05.770> or<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.310> front<00:05:06.550> counter<00:05:06.730> top

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
front object or the front counter top

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.630 
front object or the front counter top
here<00:05:07.420> it's<00:05:07.630> very<00:05:07.720> straight<00:05:08.410> clean<00:05:08.860> lines<00:05:09.220> all

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
here it's very straight clean lines all

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.120 
here it's very straight clean lines all
the<00:05:10.150> way<00:05:10.270> from<00:05:10.480> one<00:05:10.660> edge<00:05:10.870> to<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.140> other<00:05:11.260> so

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
the way from one edge to the other so

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.620 
the way from one edge to the other so
this<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.550> difference<00:05:12.910> between<00:05:13.000> shooting

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
this is the difference between shooting

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.500 
this is the difference between shooting
with<00:05:13.980> wide-angle<00:05:14.980> lenses<00:05:15.370> versus<00:05:15.940> shooting
