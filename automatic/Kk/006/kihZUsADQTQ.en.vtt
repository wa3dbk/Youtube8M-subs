00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.606
BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:10.860
A wise old bird once told me,
and I believe it's true, he

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.540
said the world's full of
different birds with different

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.860
points of view.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.890
But sometimes there's a job so
big, if we want to get it

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.490
done, we've got to bring
those birds together

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.850
and all work as one.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.765
And that's cooperation.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:30.577

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:31.710

BIG BIRD: [SINGING]

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:43.010
With just a little cooperation,
we can make it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.210
through, me and you.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.532

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:46.665

falcon and the finch.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.520
Even the proudest of
the peacocks knows

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.790
when to give an inch!

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.230
