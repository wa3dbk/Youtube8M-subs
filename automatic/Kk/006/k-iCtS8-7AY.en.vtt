00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.920 

once<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.970> get<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.240> terrace<00:03:29.510> score<00:03:29.750> high

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
once you get the terrace score high

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.990 
once you get the terrace score high
enough<00:03:29.960> it's<00:03:30.320> just<00:03:30.590> like<00:03:30.800> managing<00:03:31.490> a<00:03:31.610> city<00:03:31.850> on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
enough it's just like managing a city on

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.410 
enough it's just like managing a city on
your<00:03:32.120> home<00:03:32.270> planet<00:03:33.820> but<00:03:34.820> I<00:03:34.850> don't<00:03:35.030> have<00:03:35.270> any

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
your home planet but I don't have any

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.320 
your home planet but I don't have any
terraforming<00:03:36.080> tools<00:03:36.380> as<00:03:36.800> you<00:03:36.920> can<00:03:37.070> see

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
terraforming tools as you can see

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.150 
terraforming tools as you can see
hopefully<00:03:38.330> up<00:03:38.660> when<00:03:38.960> hopefully<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.770> can

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
hopefully up when hopefully all I can

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.490 
hopefully up when hopefully all I can
get<00:03:40.490> some<00:03:40.790> tools<00:03:41.600> at<00:03:41.840> some<00:03:42.020> point<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.410> then

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
get some tools at some point and then

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.760 
get some tools at some point and then
I'll<00:03:42.620> show<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.860> guys<00:03:42.980> how<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.190> do<00:03:43.400> that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.740 

but<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:52.010> guess<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.850> might<00:03:52.970> as<00:03:53.030> well<00:03:53.150> explain<00:03:53.570> how

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
but I guess I might as well explain how

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.270 
but I guess I might as well explain how
terraforming<00:03:54.320> works<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.620> see<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.070> lower

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280

where is that little red thought you

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.550 
where is that little red thought you
might<00:04:12.569> not<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.840> able<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.110> see<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.290> but<00:04:13.319> there's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
might not be able to see it but there's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.740 
might not be able to see it but there's
a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.739> red<00:04:13.950> dot<00:04:14.159> right<00:04:14.489> here<00:04:14.849> it's

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
a little red dot right here it's

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.080 
a little red dot right here it's
actually<00:04:15.959> outside<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.769> t1<00:04:18.560> range<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
actually outside of the t1 range and the

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.969 
actually outside of the t1 range and the
reason<00:04:21.570> apparently<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:22.139> seems<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.500> be<00:04:22.620> too

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
reason apparently it seems to be too

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.360 
reason apparently it seems to be too
little<00:04:23.250> atmosphere<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:24.650> it's<00:04:25.650> just<00:04:25.889> a<00:04:26.010> tad

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
little atmosphere and it's just a tad

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
little atmosphere and it's just a tad
too<00:04:26.699> cold<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:29.610> need<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.940> get<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.690> need

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
too cold so we need to get that you need

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.629 
too cold so we need to get that you need
to<00:04:31.199> get<00:04:31.320> more<00:04:31.470> atmosphere<00:04:32.070> hopefully<00:04:32.460> that

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
to get more atmosphere hopefully that

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.909 
to get more atmosphere hopefully that
one<00:04:32.910> too<00:04:33.630> and<00:04:35.419> we<00:04:36.419> need<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.660> get<00:04:37.320> plants<00:04:37.770> and

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
one too and we need to get plants and

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.870 
one too and we need to get plants and
animals<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.460> here<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:39.000> help<00:04:39.210> stabilize<00:04:39.539> that

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
animals in here to help stabilize that

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.250 
animals in here to help stabilize that
and<00:04:41.880> hopefully<00:04:42.449> I'll<00:04:42.690> be<00:04:42.720> able<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.990> show<00:04:43.169> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
and hopefully I'll be able to show you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.510 
and hopefully I'll be able to show you
how<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.470> do<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.620> later<00:04:43.919> for<00:04:44.130> now<00:04:44.250> I'm<00:04:44.340> going

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
how to do that later for now I'm going

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.390 
how to do that later for now I'm going
