knows he can hang back play it safe
plenty<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.330> time<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> clock

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
plenty of time on the clock

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.830 
plenty of time on the clock
okay<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:36.010> knock<00:02:36.250> down<00:02:36.280> here<00:02:36.940> we<00:02:37.060> Alberta<00:02:37.660> oh

you didn't have to challenge that and
here<00:02:40.660> comes<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:40.990> vortex<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.190> how<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.400> all

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
here comes the vortex this is how it all

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.850 
here comes the vortex this is how it all
goes<00:02:42.670> south<00:02:42.880> park'<00:02:43.270> Brad<00:02:43.540> -<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.650> is

these<00:03:11.200> two<00:03:11.409> characters<00:03:11.889> basically<00:03:12.370> they

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
these two characters basically they

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.720 
these two characters basically they

so<00:03:15.969> much<00:03:16.180> momentum<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.049> map<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:18.159> can't

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
so much momentum in this map but I can't

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.209 
so much momentum in this map but I can't
believe<00:03:19.359> computer<00:03:19.780> went<00:03:19.959> low<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.319> MP<00:03:20.769> jump<00:03:21.040> n

roll<00:03:21.430> like<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.620> at<00:03:23.739> least<00:03:23.920> explore<00:03:24.340> he

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
roll like that and at least explore he

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.119 
roll like that and at least explore he
rejected<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.780> damage<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.530> here<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:26.769> go<00:03:26.919> back

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
rejected the damage and here we go back

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:37.649 
rejected the damage and here we go back
to<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.340> vortex<00:03:33.689> hey<00:03:34.689> Brad<00:03:34.930> sometimes<00:03:36.659> talked

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:37.659 
to that vortex hey Brad sometimes talked

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.190 
to that vortex hey Brad sometimes talked
about<00:03:37.840> this<00:03:37.930> before<00:03:39.659> has<00:03:40.659> some<00:03:40.870> troubles<00:03:41.169> with

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
about this before has some troubles with

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:51.240 
about this before has some troubles with
the<00:03:42.989> drill<00:03:49.379> hard<00:03:50.379> to<00:03:50.500> imagine<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.950> any

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
the drill hard to imagine it any

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.119 
the drill hard to imagine it any
differently<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.299> now<00:03:52.569> just<00:03:53.169> like<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:53.560> we're

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129 
differently and now just like that we're

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.709 
differently and now just like that we're
looking<00:03:54.340> at<00:03:54.459> match<00:03:54.700> point<00:03:54.730> taquito<00:03:55.419> after

just<00:04:01.449> like<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.870> could<00:04:01.989> be<00:04:02.049> snap<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:08.260> we

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
just like that it could be snap here we

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.879 
just like that it could be snap here we
go<00:04:08.530> again

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
go again

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.219
