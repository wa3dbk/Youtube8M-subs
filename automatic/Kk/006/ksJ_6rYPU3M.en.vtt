meaning<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.570> life<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.930> was<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.409> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
meaning of life what was going on in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
meaning of life what was going on in
life<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> meaning<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> life<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
life and so the meaning of life is a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
life and so the meaning of life is a
little<00:01:45.750> hard<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.140> cover<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.530> five<00:01:46.710> laps<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
little hard to cover in five laps and I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.010 
little hard to cover in five laps and I
might<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.850> later<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.659> guys<00:01:48.810> end

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
might get to that later if you guys end

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080 
might get to that later if you guys end
up<00:01:49.049> liking<00:01:49.259> these<00:01:49.500> videos<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.909> I'll

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
up liking these videos but I think I'll

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.719 
up liking these videos but I think I'll
do<00:01:51.360> something<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.720> little<00:01:51.750> less<00:01:52.619> deep<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
do something a little less deep and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
do something a little less deep and
maybe<00:01:54.000> something<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.140> fun<00:01:55.530> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
maybe something a little more fun and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.749 
maybe something a little more fun and
that<00:01:56.369> would<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.790> us<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.869> superpower<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.890> would

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that would be us what superpower I would

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
that would be us what superpower I would
have<00:01:59.969> if<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.360> could<00:02:00.540> choose<00:02:00.689> any<00:02:00.960> superpower

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
have if I could choose any superpower

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.730 
have if I could choose any superpower
only<00:02:02.460> one<00:02:02.670> superpower<00:02:03.090> what<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.290> be<00:02:04.409> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
only one superpower what would it be and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.039 
only one superpower what would it be and
why<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.909> guys<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.329> leave<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> comment

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
why and so you guys can leave a comment

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.690 
why and so you guys can leave a comment
and<00:02:07.140> let<00:02:07.259> me<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.369> superpower

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and let me know what your superpower

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.910 
and let me know what your superpower
would<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.470> could<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.739> any

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
would be but if I could have any

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.950 
would be but if I could have any
superpower<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.550> entire

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
superpower in the entire

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.830 
superpower in the entire
world<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:12.860> be<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.370> never<00:02:13.790> have<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.420> sleep

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
world it would be to never have to sleep

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.530 
world it would be to never have to sleep
and<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.110> think<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:16.130> idea<00:02:16.400> took<00:02:16.970> hold<00:02:17.030> about

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
and I think this idea took hold about

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.390 
and I think this idea took hold about
four<00:02:17.810> years<00:02:17.990> ago<00:02:18.140> while<00:02:18.590> I<00:02:18.620> was<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.130> spring

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that interested me the most was that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.290 
that interested me the most was that
these<00:02:36.710> vampires<00:02:37.220> never<00:02:37.640> had<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.970> sleep<00:02:38.120> they

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
these vampires never had to sleep they

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.110 
these vampires never had to sleep they
weren't<00:02:38.510> amped<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:38.990> they<00:02:39.440> weren't<00:02:39.650> tired<00:02:40.120> they

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
weren't amped up they weren't tired they

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.210 
weren't amped up they weren't tired they
just<00:02:41.270> had<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> constant<00:02:41.900> energy<00:02:42.260> stream<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.160> so

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
just had a constant energy stream and so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
just had a constant energy stream and so
they<00:02:43.340> were<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.820> know<00:02:43.940> working<00:02:44.210> on<00:02:44.480> whatever

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
they were you know working on whatever

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.780 
they were you know working on whatever
they<00:02:45.110> were<00:02:45.170> hanging<00:02:45.770> out<00:02:45.860> but<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.190> mean<00:02:46.490> they

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
they were hanging out but I mean they

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.380 
they were hanging out but I mean they
just<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.390> half<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:48.230> spend<00:02:48.710> time<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:50.300> know

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390

went and took full advantage of nap time
in<00:02:59.240> preschool<00:03:00.160> now<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.340> I'm<00:03:01.430> in<00:03:01.550> high<00:03:01.700> school

my skin literally the feeling was a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.740

vibration and I felt like was I was
melting<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.470> kind<00:03:27.800> of<00:03:27.920> becoming<00:03:28.190> one<00:03:28.490> with<00:03:28.520> my

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
melting and kind of becoming one with my

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.880 
melting and kind of becoming one with my
pillow<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.570> when<00:03:29.690> people<00:03:29.930> say<00:03:30.110> that<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.380> melted

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
pillow so when people say that I melted

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.110 
pillow so when people say that I melted
into<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> sheets<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.520> understand<00:03:31.970> what<00:03:32.090> that

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
into the sheets I understand what that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.160 
into the sheets I understand what that
means<00:03:32.300> now<00:03:32.480> I've<00:03:32.600> never<00:03:32.720> had<00:03:32.960> that<00:03:32.990> feeling

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
means now I've never had that feeling

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.250 
means now I've never had that feeling
was<00:03:33.530> awesome<00:03:34.040> but<00:03:34.670> if<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.330> have<00:03:35.600> it<00:03:35.810> it's

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
was awesome but if you have it it's

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.380 
was awesome but if you have it it's
probably<00:03:36.500> not<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.010> awesome<00:03:37.220> leading<00:03:37.790> up<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.210> it

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
probably not so awesome leading up to it

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.240 
probably not so awesome leading up to it
and<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.930> after<00:03:39.320> this<00:03:39.440> all<00:03:39.620> nighter<00:03:39.830> of<00:03:40.010> course

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
and so after this all nighter of course

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.560 
and so after this all nighter of course
my<00:03:40.430> sleep<00:03:40.670> schedule<00:03:40.790> for<00:03:41.210> the<00:03:41.270> rest<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:41.480> the

my sleep schedule for the rest of the

my sleep schedule for the rest of the
week<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.900> thrown<00:03:42.170> off<00:03:42.290> fo<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.710> fanatic<00:03:43.130> into

the<00:03:43.760> hairpin<00:03:44.150> barrier<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.720> I'll<00:03:44.810> slip<00:03:45.050> by<00:03:45.170> he

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
the hairpin barrier and I'll slip by he

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.720 
the hairpin barrier and I'll slip by he
wanted<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.680> get<00:03:45.770> back<00:03:45.920> onto<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.370> racing<00:03:46.700> line

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
wanted to get back onto the racing line

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.670 
wanted to get back onto the racing line
but<00:03:47.390> he<00:03:47.450> realized<00:03:47.810> i<00:03:47.930> was<00:03:48.050> there<00:03:48.200> gave<00:03:48.410> me<00:03:48.530> some

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
but he realized i was there gave me some

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.170 
but he realized i was there gave me some
space<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.160> slipped<00:03:49.460> by<00:03:49.610> it'll<00:03:50.090> be

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
space and I slipped by it'll be

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
space and I slipped by it'll be
interesting<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.660> see<00:03:50.750> if<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.050> can<00:03:51.170> still<00:03:51.380> win

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
interesting to see if I can still win

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.810 
interesting to see if I can still win
with<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:51.710> penalty<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:52.220> think<00:03:52.460> he<00:03:52.550> didn't<00:03:52.760> take

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
with this penalty I think he didn't take

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.220 
with this penalty I think he didn't take
out<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.060> McLaren<00:03:53.420> he'll<00:03:53.540> probably<00:03:53.810> be

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
out the McLaren he'll probably be

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.380 
out the McLaren he'll probably be
penalized<00:03:54.710> for<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.760> some<00:03:55.880> considerate

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
penalized for that but some considerate

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.620 
penalized for that but some considerate
driving<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.840> appreciate<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.850> yeah<00:03:59.390> with

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
driving I appreciate it and so yeah with

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.540 
driving I appreciate it and so yeah with
the<00:03:59.780> all<00:03:59.870> nighter<00:04:00.140> my<00:04:00.920> sleep<00:04:01.160> schedule<00:04:01.280> is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
the all nighter my sleep schedule is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.100 
the all nighter my sleep schedule is
thrown<00:04:01.760> off<00:04:01.880> for<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.060> rest<00:04:02.210> of<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.510> week<00:04:02.690> and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
thrown off for the rest of the week and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.420 
thrown off for the rest of the week and
the<00:04:03.200> thing<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.440> I've<00:04:03.680> noticed<00:04:03.710> about<00:04:04.070> sleep

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
the thing that I've noticed about sleep

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.890 
the thing that I've noticed about sleep
deprivation<00:04:04.460> is<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.420> less<00:04:05.630> sleep<00:04:05.870> you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
deprivation is that the less sleep you

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.470 
deprivation is that the less sleep you
have<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.770> more<00:04:06.950> your<00:04:07.130> subconscious<00:04:07.790> begins

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
have the more your subconscious begins

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.410 
have the more your subconscious begins
to<00:04:08.660> take<00:04:08.900> over<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.650> make<00:04:10.460> decisions<00:04:11.000> for<00:04:11.240> you

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
to take over and make decisions for you

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.290 
to take over and make decisions for you
and<00:04:11.780> I've<00:04:11.930> only<00:04:12.140> slept<00:04:12.860> walked<00:04:13.400> once<00:04:13.850> before

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
and I've only slept walked once before

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.950 
and I've only slept walked once before
and<00:04:14.570> when<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.410> happened<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:16.010> ended<00:04:16.250> up

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:16.960 
and when that happened I ended up

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.720 
and when that happened I ended up
sleepwalking<00:04:17.960> to<00:04:18.140> my<00:04:18.290> younger<00:04:18.830> sister's<00:04:19.310> bed

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.110 
of a sudden and of course she's kind of
wondering<00:05:30.310> if<00:05:30.400> it's<00:05:30.550> all<00:05:30.640> right<00:05:30.670> for<00:05:31.000> me<00:05:31.060> to

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
wondering if it's all right for me to

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.280 
wondering if it's all right for me to

drive home and I don't know if I

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.840 
drive home and I don't know if I
mentioned<00:05:32.350> this<00:05:32.650> already<00:05:32.830> but<00:05:33.250> I'm<00:05:33.670> not

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850

sleeping for 24 hours some experts say

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.440 
sleeping for 24 hours some experts say
is<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.400> equivalent<00:05:36.670> of<00:05:37.000> having<00:05:37.180> a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450

blood-alcohol<00:05:37.720> level<00:05:38.440> of<00:05:38.620> ten<00:05:39.190> percent<00:05:39.670> so

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
blood-alcohol level of ten percent so

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.030 
blood-alcohol level of ten percent so
that's<00:05:40.540> a<00:05:40.690> lot<00:05:40.870> that's<00:05:40.900> like<00:05:41.260> drunk<00:05:41.560> driving

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
that's a lot that's like drunk driving

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
an hour the other day and i didn't

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.800 
an hour the other day and i didn't
realize<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:51.220> until<00:05:51.310> i<00:05:51.550> was<00:05:51.670> looking<00:05:52.000> down<00:05:52.030> but

the<00:05:53.200> more<00:05:53.350> sleep<00:05:53.560> i<00:05:53.680> have<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:53.950> slow<00:05:54.130> where<00:05:54.280> I

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
the more sleep i have the slow where I

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.090 
the more sleep i have the slow where I
go<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:55.300> less<00:05:55.450> control<00:05:55.840> I<00:05:55.870> have<00:05:55.990> over<00:05:56.200> my

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
go and the less control I have over my

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.950 
go and the less control I have over my
actions<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:57.880> I'll<00:05:58.000> have<00:05:58.210> conversations<00:05:58.870> with

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
actions so I'll have conversations with

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.420 
actions so I'll have conversations with
people<00:05:59.140> without<00:05:59.410> realizing<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.250> of

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
people without realizing it and of
