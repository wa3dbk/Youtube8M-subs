you<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.690> questions<00:00:01.140> are<00:00:01.290> good<00:00:01.469> points<00:00:01.949> he's

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
you guys questions are good points he's

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.190 
you guys questions are good points he's
saying<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.820> do<00:00:02.879> you<00:00:03.030> decide<00:00:03.389> when<00:00:03.629> aeration

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
saying how do you decide when aeration

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.230 
saying how do you decide when aeration
stops<00:00:04.470> and<00:00:04.740> slight<00:00:04.950> point<00:00:05.160> begins<00:00:05.609> the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
stops and slight point begins the

stops and slight point begins the
sliding<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.930> for<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.350> angle<00:00:07.740> that's<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.250> steep

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
sliding is for an angle that's so steep

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.940 
sliding is for an angle that's so steep
that<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.360> can't<00:00:09.690> make<00:00:09.900> it<00:00:09.960> unless<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.530> slide

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
that you can't make it unless you slide

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.570 
that you can't make it unless you slide
you<00:00:11.429> start<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.150> slide<00:00:12.540> cut<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.139> an<00:00:13.349> area

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
you start and you slide cut in an area

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
you start and you slide cut in an area
where<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.089> steeper<00:00:15.809> curve<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.529> you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
where it's so steeper curve that you

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.200 
where it's so steeper curve that you
can't<00:00:16.920> possibly<00:00:17.369> cut<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> on<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> straight<00:00:18.180> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
can't possibly cut it on the straight a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.310 
can't possibly cut it on the straight a
live<00:00:18.449> shark<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.800> don't<00:00:20.180> close<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.420> play<00:00:21.570> cut

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
live shark you don't close your play cut

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.890 
live shark you don't close your play cut
back<00:00:22.560> all<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> hair<00:00:23.490> off<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.689> need

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
back all that hair off right so you need

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.540 
back all that hair off right so you need
to<00:00:25.140> turn<00:00:25.880> look<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.330> look<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.550> in

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to turn look here look here look here in

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.269 
to turn look here look here look here in
here<00:00:30.179> he's<00:00:30.570> there<00:00:30.810> waiting<00:00:31.019> area<00:00:31.590> narrating

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
here he's there waiting area narrating

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
here he's there waiting area narrating
narrating<00:00:32.790> heritage<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.480> he's<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
narrating heritage now he's going to

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
narrating heritage now he's going to
have<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> hard<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> start<00:00:35.100> narrating<00:00:35.460> in

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
have a hard time to start narrating in

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450 
have a hard time to start narrating in
here<00:00:35.910> see<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.350> see<00:00:37.739> how<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.010> started<00:00:38.340> to

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
here see because see how it started to

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.660 
here see because see how it started to
curve<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:39.000> okay<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.590> follow<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
curve more okay you follow so at this

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
curve more okay you follow so at this
point<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.239> he's<00:00:42.329> starting<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.870> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
point where he's starting to make a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.020 
point where he's starting to make a
steeper<00:00:43.530> line<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.340> where<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> starts<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
steeper line it's where it starts to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
steeper line it's where it starts to
slide<00:00:45.350> okay<00:00:46.350> any<00:00:47.340> other<00:00:47.370> questions<00:00:48.590> crashing

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
slide okay any other questions crashing

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.740 
slide okay any other questions crashing
back<00:00:49.770> there<00:00:51.260> live<00:00:52.260> yes

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.660 

yeah<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.020> that's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> great<00:00:58.650> point<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:02.340> again

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
yeah so that's a great point and again

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
yeah so that's a great point and again
you<00:01:03.060> just<00:01:03.090> made<00:01:03.450> a<00:01:03.480> great<00:01:03.750> point<00:01:04.020> but<00:01:04.290> let's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you just made a great point but let's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
you just made a great point but let's
listen<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.010> her<00:01:05.130> point<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> let's<00:01:06.000> all<00:01:06.180> figure

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
listen to her point and let's all figure

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.210 
listen to her point and let's all figure
it<00:01:06.690> out<00:01:06.840> because<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.410> part<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.800> theory

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it out because this is part of theory

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.000 
it out because this is part of theory
it's<00:01:08.940> not<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> how<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.380> Y<00:01:10.590> or

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's not just the how but it's the Y or

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490 
it's not just the how but it's the Y or
the<00:01:11.160> why<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:11.940> all<00:01:12.480> together<00:01:12.720> here's

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the why and the how all together here's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.610 
the why and the how all together here's
what<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> said<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.810> need<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> guys<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> focus

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
what you said I need you guys to focus

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
what you said I need you guys to focus
on<00:01:16.800> this<00:01:16.980> because<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> learn

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
on this because you're going to learn

on this because you're going to learn
tons<00:01:17.940> from<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.740> she<00:01:19.740> said<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.520> whole<00:01:20.760> line<00:01:21.120> is

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
tons from it she said the whole line is

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.410 
tons from it she said the whole line is

out<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.390> ends<00:02:18.800> understand<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.390> first

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
out of the ends understand so the first

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.590 
out of the ends understand so the first
ones<00:02:21.960> very<00:02:22.230> overdrafted<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.220> was<00:02:23.430> this<00:02:24.270> left

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
ones very overdrafted this was this left

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.730

less<00:02:25.020> less<00:02:25.860> less<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.420> then<00:02:27.720> finally<00:02:28.230> zero

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
less less less and then finally zero

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.480 
less less less and then finally zero
because

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
because
