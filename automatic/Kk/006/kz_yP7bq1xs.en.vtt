00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.439
 photography is my passion for me is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.239
 more than one profession is an obsession 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.469
 who has received an assignment that does not 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.759
 have any 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:34.649
 I always have to take one with me 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.969
 you never know when you camera 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.969
 the chance of a shot will happen 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.219
 i love to walk the streets hunting for 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:50.359
 images of moments but I prefer to have 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.519
 a compact so confusing miter the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.659
 people find it easier to capture 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.659
 real moments 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.580
 28 mm is perfect for taking pictures in 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.380
 street forces you to intervene in 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 enter into intimacy with his subjects 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.170
 if you step back you can see 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.170
 the complete picture 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.260
 every single photograph is a gift of 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.240
 net 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.370
 and it's really great to watch them 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.700
 enlargements can distinguish each 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.700
 detail 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.860
 making beautiful photographs means being 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.050
 an observer agreement you have to make 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.090
 be careful and if you can capture that 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.320
 moment the camera will have to return 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.720
 the final image 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.720
 beautiful as when you felt it all 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.719
 your camera must be 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.450
 simple and become your second 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.729
 soul and because moments happen every 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 instant you have to be quick in moments 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.170
 they will never be repeated 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.720
 carefully arranging objects 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.910
 you could discover poetry 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:27.380
 image in any normal 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:28.970
 subject I do not separate what I do 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.519
 for work from what I do for myself 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.519
 himself I am always intent on observing 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.900
 I see photographs everywhere 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.940
 and some of my best works have 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.420
 hit my eyes when least me 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.420
 I expect 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.160
 Today continues to surprise the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.420
 being able to take a picture of me 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.030
 really like it 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.380
 if you prepare yourself if you pay attention 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.380
 you will be able to capture those moments
