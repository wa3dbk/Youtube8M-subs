Stonehaven<00:00:24.029> gameplay<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.869> picked<00:00:25.080> this

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
Stonehaven gameplay I just picked this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.929 
Stonehaven gameplay I just picked this
one<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.769> Stonehaven<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.550> no<00:00:26.760> one

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
one because it was Stonehaven and no one

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.099 
one because it was Stonehaven and no one
ever<00:00:27.210> uploads<00:00:27.539> don't<00:00:27.779> hate<00:00:27.930> them<00:00:27.990> because

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
ever uploads don't hate them because

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
ever uploads don't hate them because
it's<00:00:28.199> such<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.519> messy<00:00:29.760> map<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> think

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it's such a it's a messy map and I think

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.820 
it's such a it's a messy map and I think
they<00:00:30.570> give<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> quick<00:00:31.080> unit<00:00:31.380> lesson<00:00:31.679> how<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they give you a quick unit lesson how to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.770 
they give you a quick unit lesson how to
play<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.189> because<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> hard<00:00:33.239> flake<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
play it because it is hard flake and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
play it because it is hard flake and
this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> horrible<00:00:34.440> horrible<00:00:34.739> start<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.370> one

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
this is a horrible horrible start at one

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370 
this is a horrible horrible start at one
point<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:36.239> free<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.750> five<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.350> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
point I think I'm free and five and I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470 
point I think I'm free and five and I
pull<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> 27-6<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> pretty

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
pull it back to a 27-6 so it's a pretty

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.750 
pull it back to a 27-6 so it's a pretty
good<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.590> streak<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.219> there<00:00:41.370> somewhere

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
good you know streak in there somewhere

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.119 
good you know streak in there somewhere
one<00:00:42.059> would<00:00:42.239> assume<00:00:42.540> ESO<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> side<00:00:44.100> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
one would assume ESO I like that side of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.290 
one would assume ESO I like that side of
it<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.399> basically<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> play<00:00:45.180> this

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it so basically if you want to play this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
it so basically if you want to play this
map<00:00:45.510> slow<00:00:46.289> from<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> side<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> sport<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
map slow from the side I sport and the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.040 
map slow from the side I sport and the
one<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.700> currently<00:00:47.730> yet<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.329> only<00:00:48.690> play<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
one I'm currently yet I only play the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.389

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
kind of glide around call so i didn't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.030

have subscribe it but it's a really
strange<00:03:32.340> feeling<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.209> works<00:03:33.420> pretty<00:03:33.630> well

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
strange feeling and it works pretty well

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.320 
strange feeling and it works pretty well
so<00:03:34.170> kind<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.770> gliding<00:03:35.250> around<00:03:35.550> corners<00:03:36.180> if

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
so kind of gliding around corners if

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.090 
so kind of gliding around corners if
that<00:03:36.510> even<00:03:36.750> makes<00:03:36.780> sense<00:03:37.290> than<00:03:37.620> that's<00:03:37.800> what<00:03:38.040> i

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
that even makes sense than that's what i

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.830 
that even makes sense than that's what i
recommend<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.489> do<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.480> doesn't<00:03:39.690> make<00:03:39.750> any

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
recommend you do that doesn't make any

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.300 
recommend you do that doesn't make any
sense<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.200> and<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.380> does<00:03:40.560> confuse<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.100> then

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
sense you and that does confuse you then

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.330 
sense you and that does confuse you then
i'd<00:03:41.489> say<00:03:41.820> just<00:03:42.470> took<00:03:43.470> quick-draw<00:03:43.860> steady<00:03:44.160> aim

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
i'd say just took quick-draw steady aim

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.020 
i'd say just took quick-draw steady aim
and<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.570> go<00:03:45.720> out<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.200> can<00:03:46.500> really<00:03:47.030> use

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
and on the go out so you can really use

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.030 
and on the go out so you can really use
it<00:03:48.180> like<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.360> submachine<00:03:48.870> gun<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.739> doesn't<00:03:50.010> work

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
it like a submachine gun it doesn't work

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.740 
it like a submachine gun it doesn't work
quite<00:03:50.400> as<00:03:50.459> well<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.940> that<00:03:51.060> fashion<00:03:51.300> i<00:03:51.540> really

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
quite as well in that fashion i really

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.630 
quite as well in that fashion i really
would<00:03:51.870> make<00:03:51.900> wind<00:03:52.230> stalking<00:03:52.709> around<00:03:53.160> corners

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
would make wind stalking around corners

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.160 
would make wind stalking around corners
with<00:03:53.790> this<00:03:53.910> because<00:03:54.209> there's<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.780> Soul<00:03:55.140> Reaper

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170

when it is you know not the boss is
killing<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.320> mainly<00:03:58.680> does<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.640> works

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
killing it mainly does just it works

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.729 
killing it mainly does just it works
really<00:04:00.300> well<00:04:00.420> medium<00:04:00.810> long<00:04:00.959> range<00:04:01.200> close

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739
