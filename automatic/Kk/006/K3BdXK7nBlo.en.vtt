00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
have needed or something I don't know

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.590 
have needed or something I don't know
I've<00:01:14.130> been<00:01:14.340> using<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.729> program<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> while

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
I've been using this program for a while

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
I've been using this program for a while
and<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:17.840> not<00:01:18.840> found<00:01:19.049> any<00:01:19.320> issues<00:01:19.740> it's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and I have not found any issues it's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.450 
and I have not found any issues it's
always<00:01:20.520> run<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.689> fine<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.140> me<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> highly

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
always run just fine for me so I highly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
always run just fine for me so I highly
recommend<00:01:23.820> using<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.180> program<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.280> now

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
recommend using this program and now

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.399 
recommend using this program and now
let's<00:01:26.580> look<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.119> disk<00:01:27.509> defrag<00:01:28.080> again<00:01:30.350> okay<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
let's look at disk defrag again okay so

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
let's look at disk defrag again okay so
this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.920> disk<00:01:32.159> defrag<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
this is disk defrag and what this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929 
this is disk defrag and what this
program<00:01:33.659> does<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.860> organizes<00:01:35.670> your

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
program does is it organizes your

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.690 
program does is it organizes your
processor<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.799> makes<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> easier<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
processor and so it makes it easier to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
processor and so it makes it easier to
find<00:01:39.000> things<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.720> needs<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.409> makes

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
find things that it needs and it makes

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.999 
find things that it needs and it makes
it<00:01:40.950> quicker<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.939> performing<00:01:42.450> tasks<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it quicker when performing tasks so it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.350 
it quicker when performing tasks so it
doesn't<00:01:44.369> delete<00:01:44.700> anything<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.329> just

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
doesn't delete anything it just

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.499 
doesn't delete anything it just
organizes<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.729> makes<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
organizes it so that it makes it the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.999 
organizes it so that it makes it the
processor<00:01:49.610> easier<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.759> use<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.799> by<00:01:52.799> doing

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
processor easier to use and by doing

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.789 
processor easier to use and by doing
that<00:01:53.130> it'll<00:01:53.670> make<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.970> computer<00:01:54.210> faster<00:01:54.799> so

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
that it'll make your computer faster so

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
that it'll make your computer faster so
what<00:01:55.979> you'll<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:57.030> you'll<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
what you'll want to do is you'll just

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.319 
what you'll want to do is you'll just
want<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.750> click<00:01:57.930> here<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.439> defrag<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> then

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
want to click here on defrag and then

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.569 
want to click here on defrag and then
it'll<00:02:00.719> work<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.200> whole<00:02:01.350> system<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.100> it'll

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
it'll work the whole system and it'll

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.420 
it'll work the whole system and it'll
take<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> couple<00:02:03.060> minutes<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.689> then

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
take a couple minutes and then

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.300 
take a couple minutes and then
once<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:04.820> done<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:06.110> it'll<00:02:06.620> ask<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:06.890> to

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
once it's done then it'll ask you to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.880 
once it's done then it'll ask you to
restart<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:08.179> then<00:02:08.390> you'll<00:02:09.229> want<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.530> restart

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
restart and then you'll want to restart

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.570 
restart and then you'll want to restart
and<00:02:10.100> then<00:02:10.789> while<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:11.050> restarting<00:02:12.050> when<00:02:12.980> it

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
and then while it's restarting when it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.060 
and then while it's restarting when it
starts<00:02:15.490> coming<00:02:16.490> back<00:02:16.520> up<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:18.620> it'll

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
starts coming back up then it'll

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.150 
starts coming back up then it'll
actually<00:02:19.250> say<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> it's<00:02:20.060> defragging<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.160> so

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually say that it's defragging and so

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.800 
actually say that it's defragging and so
that's<00:02:22.550> how<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:22.790> know<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.209> process<00:02:23.660> is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that's how you know that the process is

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.040 
that's how you know that the process is
complete<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.760> that's<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.300> with<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.630> it's

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
complete and so that's it with that it's

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.050 
complete and so that's it with that it's
pretty<00:02:27.290> simple<00:02:27.650> program<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.880> highly

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
pretty simple program and I highly

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.250 
pretty simple program and I highly
recommend<00:02:29.450> using<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:31.840> all<00:02:32.840> right

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
recommend using it all right

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.530 
recommend using it all right
I<00:02:33.290> don't<00:02:33.620> recommend<00:02:33.920> using<00:02:34.520> ccleaner<00:02:35.360> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
I don't recommend using ccleaner and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.290 
I don't recommend using ccleaner and
disk<00:02:35.900> defrag<00:02:36.410> all<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.220> time<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.700> recommend

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
disk defrag all the time I recommend

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300 
disk defrag all the time I recommend
using<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.660> periodically<00:02:39.110> I<00:02:39.470> usually<00:02:40.070> do<00:02:40.190> it

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
using it periodically I usually do it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.330 
using it periodically I usually do it
about<00:02:40.489> once<00:02:40.790> every<00:02:41.660> one<00:02:42.260> or<00:02:42.380> two<00:02:42.530> months<00:02:42.950> or<00:02:43.100> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
about once every one or two months or so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.100 
about once every one or two months or so
you<00:02:43.370> don't<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.000> need<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.330> do<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:44.750> much

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
you don't really need to do it that much

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.890 
you don't really need to do it that much
it's<00:02:45.530> just<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.250> kind<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.670> get<00:02:46.880> your<00:02:47.060> computer<00:02:47.720> a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's just to kind of get your computer a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's just to kind of get your computer a
fresh<00:02:48.290> start

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
fresh start

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.760 
fresh start
so<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.130> recommend<00:02:49.610> doing<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.060> every<00:02:50.500> one<00:02:51.500> or<00:02:51.650> two

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
so I recommend doing it every one or two

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.010 
so I recommend doing it every one or two
months<00:02:51.950> or<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.400> but<00:02:53.360> now<00:02:53.480> I'd<00:02:53.570> like<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.780> talk

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
months or so but now I'd like to talk

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.680 
months or so but now I'd like to talk
about<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:55.160> program<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.360> really

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
about the program that I think really

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.640 
about the program that I think really
really<00:02:57.530> improves<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.220> helps<00:02:58.850> with<00:02:59.440> your<00:03:00.440> FPS

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
really improves and helps with your FPS

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.600 
really improves and helps with your FPS
in-game<00:03:01.459> experience<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.470> it's<00:03:03.470> called<00:03:03.739> game

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
in-game experience and it's called game

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.690 
in-game experience and it's called game
gain<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.330> lot<00:03:06.020> of<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.380> lot<00:03:06.680> of<00:03:06.800> videos<00:03:07.070> similar<00:03:07.370> to

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
gain a lot of a lot of videos similar to

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.449 
gain a lot of a lot of videos similar to
this<00:03:07.850> one<00:03:08.120> will<00:03:09.080> talk<00:03:09.380> about<00:03:09.560> game<00:03:09.980> booster

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
this one will talk about game booster

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.270 
this one will talk about game booster
and<00:03:10.670> I've<00:03:11.360> tried<00:03:11.660> using<00:03:11.870> game<00:03:12.230> booster<00:03:12.680> and<00:03:12.950> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
and I've tried using game booster and I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.430 
and I've tried using game booster and I
don't<00:03:14.150> know<00:03:14.209> why<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.780> does<00:03:14.810> not<00:03:15.170> work<00:03:15.410> for

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
don't know why but it does not work for

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.979 
don't know why but it does not work for
me<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.070> apparently<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.150> doesn't<00:03:17.269> work<00:03:17.750> for<00:03:17.930> a

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
me and apparently it doesn't work for a

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.060 
me and apparently it doesn't work for a
lot<00:03:18.019> of<00:03:18.230> other<00:03:18.350> people<00:03:18.650> too

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
lot of other people too

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.400 
lot of other people too
but<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.250> did<00:03:19.459> find<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:20.450> one<00:03:20.690> program<00:03:20.900> called

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
but I did find that one program called

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.860 
but I did find that one program called
game<00:03:21.620> gain<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.459> really<00:03:22.760> helps<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.390> I'll

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
game gain and it really helps and I'll

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.590 
game gain and it really helps and I'll
put<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.110> link<00:03:24.290> in<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.440> description<00:03:25.480> for<00:03:26.480> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
put a link in the description for the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.600 
put a link in the description for the
download<00:03:26.630> link<00:03:27.170> as<00:03:27.290> well<00:03:27.320> so<00:03:28.190> I'm<00:03:28.280> going<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.489> go

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
download link as well so I'm going to go

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.770 
download link as well so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.820> open<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.600> a

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
ahead and open that so this is just a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.800 
ahead and open that so this is just a
free<00:03:33.049> version<00:03:33.500> of<00:03:33.680> game<00:03:33.950> gain<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:35.450> what

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
free version of game gain and so what

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.449 
free version of game gain and so what
you<00:03:35.900> want<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.620> want<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.890> put<00:03:37.370> in

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.640 
have an AMD processor so I put that in
and<00:03:43.959> then<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.350> click<00:03:45.950> go<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:48.079> might<00:03:48.290> want

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
and then I click go and you might want

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.289 
and then I click go and you might want
to<00:03:48.709> try<00:03:48.890> moving<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.489> fastest<00:03:49.940> but<00:03:50.120> that

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
to try moving this to fastest but that

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.330 
to try moving this to fastest but that
that<00:03:50.900> won't<00:03:51.049> work<00:03:51.320> unless<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:51.829> actually<00:03:51.980> buy

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
that won't work unless you actually buy

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.490 
that won't work unless you actually buy
the<00:03:52.400> full<00:03:52.700> version<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.420> just<00:03:53.959> keep<00:03:54.140> this<00:03:54.320> down

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
the full version so just keep this down

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.930 
the full version so just keep this down
here<00:03:54.799> at<00:03:54.890> fast<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.549> then<00:03:56.299> click<00:03:56.630> go<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
here at fast and then click go and it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.180 
here at fast and then click go and it
will<00:03:59.209> start<00:04:00.110> working<00:04:00.350> and<00:04:00.739> then<00:04:00.860> once<00:04:01.040> it's

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
will start working and then once it's

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.640 
will start working and then once it's
done<00:04:01.280> it'll<00:04:01.760> ask<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.570> restart<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:03.260> like

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
done it'll ask you to restart just like

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.280 
done it'll ask you to restart just like
the<00:04:03.769> disk<00:04:03.950> defrag<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.760> so<00:04:05.720> if<00:04:06.049> you're<00:04:06.260> using

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
the disk defrag and so if you're using

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.360 
the disk defrag and so if you're using
disk<00:04:07.220> defrag<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:08.260> gain<00:04:09.260> gain<00:04:09.620> at<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:09.950> same

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
disk defrag and gain gain at the same

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.270 
disk defrag and gain gain at the same
time<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.850> recommend<00:04:11.590> doing<00:04:12.590> both<00:04:12.919> of<00:04:13.160> them

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
time I recommend doing both of them

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.620 
time I recommend doing both of them
before<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.579> restart<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.299> that<00:04:14.419> when<00:04:14.540> you

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
before you restart so that when you

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.479 
before you restart so that when you
restart<00:04:14.989> it<00:04:15.200> does<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.500> whole<00:04:15.650> thing<00:04:15.680> at<00:04:16.010> once

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
restart it does the whole thing at once

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.840 
restart it does the whole thing at once
and<00:04:16.840> this<00:04:17.840> really<00:04:18.350> helped<00:04:18.650> my<00:04:19.009> gaming

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
and this really helped my gaming

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.840 
and this really helped my gaming
experience<00:04:20.509> this<00:04:21.139> really<00:04:21.530> increased<00:04:22.220> my<00:04:22.400> FPS

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
experience this really increased my FPS

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.080 
experience this really increased my FPS
by<00:04:23.030> quite<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> bit<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:24.400> it<00:04:25.400> works<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.759> lot<00:04:25.849> better

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
by quite a bit and it works a lot better

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.960 
by quite a bit and it works a lot better
than<00:04:26.270> game<00:04:26.479> booster<00:04:26.720> in<00:04:27.080> my<00:04:27.229> opinion<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:30.970> with

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
than game booster in my opinion and with

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.200 
than game booster in my opinion and with
game<00:04:32.389> gain<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.660> recommend<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.830> use<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.340> more

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
game gain I recommend you use it more

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.420 
game gain I recommend you use it more
than<00:04:35.240> ccleaner<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.169> disk<00:04:36.530> defrag<00:04:37.099> I

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
than ccleaner and disk defrag I

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.089 
than ccleaner and disk defrag I
recommend<00:04:37.940> using<00:04:38.180> this<00:04:38.389> program<00:04:38.690> maybe<00:04:39.289> once

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:40.099 
recommend using this program maybe once

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.969 
recommend using this program maybe once
every<00:04:40.430> couple<00:04:40.580> weeks<00:04:41.080> because<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.500> really

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
every couple weeks because it really

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.100 
every couple weeks because it really
helps<00:04:43.849> with<00:04:43.970> your<00:04:44.150> gaming<00:04:44.330> experience<00:04:44.509> if

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
helps with your gaming experience if

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.140

your games seem really slow for some

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.540 
your games seem really slow for some
reason<00:04:47.449> one<00:04:47.599> day<00:04:47.810> like<00:04:48.740> in<00:04:49.009> a<00:04:49.099> case<00:04:49.280> where<00:04:49.490> you

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
reason one day like in a case where you
