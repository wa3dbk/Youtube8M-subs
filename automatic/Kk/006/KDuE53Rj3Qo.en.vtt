00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.330
 the company evrotrak offers your 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.599
 Attention wheel loader 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.780
 wagon 800 and tractor base mtz-82 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 front beam oil on this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 loader mounted reinforced 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.140
 hydraulic cylinder lifting 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.369
 thousand four hundred regular hydraulic cylinder 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 have a lifting capacity of 800 kilograms 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 loader unloading height 3 meters 60 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.500
 centimeters 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.090
 loader have a reinforced frame itself 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.120
 stretcher and not solid and tough 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 the structure is attached to the frame of the tractor in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.800
 front and middle parts as well as to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.020
 rear axle such a decision to do all 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 the design is durable and reliable reduces 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.559
 front axle load and and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 distributes it throughout the path 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 thereby ensure long-term operation 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.920
 all mechanisms for solving various 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.690
 tasks and one handler provided 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.789
 the ability to use a wide range 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.739
 on and again equipped with assembly and disassembly 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.530
 working bodies is carried out by one 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.379
 by turning the handle 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.270
 data handle releases the king pin 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.080
 after which the equipment can be 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.970
 extracted 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 it only remains to disconnect it from 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.619
 hydraulic loaders through 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 fast discontinuous couplings in this case 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.430
 fast discontinuous coupling not installed by 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 upon customerâ€™s request, the loader itself 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 can be easily removed from the tractor 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.470
 for this it is set paws 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.470
 inside of which there is a jack 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.520
 loader is removed central 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.549
 king pin 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 after which jacking up the tractor after 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.670
 this just leave handed 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 loader in this case the loader 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.789
 installed by an agricultural bill 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.170
 universally equipped buckets 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.079
 designed to capture and move 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.899
 silo salon of hay and manure rolls and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.729
 other bulk and non-bulk materials 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.740
 and can also be used for 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.909
 manure removal from livestock 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.909
 things of the premises
