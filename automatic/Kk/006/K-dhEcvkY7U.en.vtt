00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
know we already carrying the set and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.649

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and I think one thing that we tried to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
and I think one thing that we tried to
do<00:01:11.579> this<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.270> tribe<00:01:12.509> but<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.619> have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
do this we're going to tribe but we have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.050 
do this we're going to tribe but we have
done<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.009> year<00:01:14.249> was<00:01:14.369> asked<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.850> tried

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
done this year was asked but we tried

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
done this year was asked but we tried
doing<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.569> the<00:01:15.659> team's<00:01:15.899> well<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.409> know

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
doing that to the team's well you know

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.219 
doing that to the team's well you know
bring<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.069> the<00:01:17.759> special<00:01:18.149> bond<00:01:18.329> there<00:01:18.539> now<00:01:18.840> to

bring that the special bond there now to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.319 
bring that the special bond there now to
get<00:01:19.590> together<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.399> cross<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:21.149> do<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
get together and the cross how do you

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.410 
get together and the cross how do you
distinguish<00:01:21.719> between<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.140> two<00:01:22.319> I<00:01:23.119> guess<00:01:24.119> ask

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
distinguish between the two I guess ask

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.410 
distinguish between the two I guess ask
more<00:01:24.719> questions<00:01:24.749> than<00:01:25.229> anything<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.770> i<00:01:26.700> I've
