00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:15.330
 bounce very good such as he called 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.029
 before commenting and today I bring you now 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.330
 end the series of consciousness but and good 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.119
 This fierce one that you are going to see is my 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.820
 fierce first let's go the first fierce 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.470
 this month here and it's a streak and 45 with the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.430
 h terrestrial war brain solar 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.870
 domain and good led to break with 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:38.780
 with extended chargers 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.640
 hilt and butt if I'm not wrong and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.920
 if it is not carried butt of unwrapped 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:48.590
 fast and good is very fierce that that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.519
 when a little bit at the beginning and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 you will see later as a game more more 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.690
 tactical because not because I did not want to play 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.300
 wrong since I also set fierce because I was going 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.400
 to be the first one there and I wanted to get out on 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.280
 the sooner until then at the end already 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.320
 secured a little more the casualties and I get 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.810
 well the truth is that a 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.360
 streak of 45 to be the first we do 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.130
 here it's pretty good and good 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.830
 well in this letter and the truth is that 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.470
 I play most of the time there is 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.080
 they also kill me in a little way 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.980
 unfortunate but but good 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:32.480
 call the one who shared 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:35.950
 normal without it being double and nothing I the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:39.009
 drone with rockets and that I handle him 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.649
 at the beginning that at the beginning of the game 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.110
 yes that Saturday driving he read now 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.759
 I no longer no longer handle you carry the handle 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.409
 machine because I think they killed if 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.159
 even if you throw them in a good 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.640
 position and also wear the garbÃ­ if not 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.229
 I'm wrong if you control only 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.319
 I know if it will take you too with time is 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.020
 I think that what is controlled only 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.170
 and well, I 'll see you I'll explain 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 a little bit what we have to do to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.340
 the mites a fierce to 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.849
 at least try it and the first thing is 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.980
 know if the maps is very important 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.739
 know very little and when they leave 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 enemies where and if you kill one 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.569
 in its people responsible more or less for 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.780
 where will it come back good even though 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.340
 in this in this fierce I do not know myself 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.790
 on the map because they were from my first 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.790
 matches 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.930
 more or less said a little where they could 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.520
 go out and how to know this good there threw 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.430
 the drone is a good area to throw 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.280
 the gusts in case you want to know 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.299
 and well, how do you know a little? 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.550
 get out the enemies the enemies come out 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.890
 where there are spaces on the map 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.000
 that means that if your allies 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.710
 they are on the left side of a map 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.750
 what will continue where I am pointing 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.270
 now if it is in your allies in that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.910
 part what will happen is that the 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.310
 enemies have to come out yes or yes in the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.210
 part of empty state that is on the other 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.870
 side to the best 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.250
 and if for example I'm where I throw 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.470
 the streaks and they are all my way out 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.300
 then the enemies will come out in the 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.570
 another site that's if it's a yes is a way 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.950
 of game without flags and without objectives 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.330
 as it can be of the chubby its low 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.660
 confirmed 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.480
 and if it's with flags like it can be 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.570
 domain can be with objectives of 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.540
 link or that is a game mode with a 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:49.400
 I answer son that's more or less by 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.810
 know the map by a little intuition 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.440
 if you kill one for example 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.989
 to the left of the flag because the most 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.420
 sure it's going to the other side nearby 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.890
 of the flag also then pillaging 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.180
 is the answer the truth is that it comes 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.080
 very good because they do not go to maybe 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.480
 but there is my first fierce that already 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.470
 I was missing in these times 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.269
 that was a lot and well no no I 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.630
 roll more with the fair color but 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.510
 I'm going to leave them on the 15th and the 15th 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.090
 that I get more and better, I continue with what 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 I was saying that if you kill 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.960
 one on one side of the flag will come out 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.660
 in the other because he responds is like that in 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:41.139
 this game that you have to be careful 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.690
 because if the allies are involved 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.729
 completely in his flag he responds 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.080
 it will automatically change and you have to 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.840
 be careful because you can get out 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.009
 enemies from behind or even from the front 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.200
 of your face 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.690
 that would not be the first time that happens to me 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.070
 so here you know on the maps if 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.490
 you have a mat you can control is 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.920
 pretty good, well, this is the 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.350
 first episode little talking about the 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:12.830
 marks the next will be 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.350
 of the minimap and the allies because 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.780
 the allies can save the past 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.160
 of the third third episode will be about 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.110
 the enemies also tell you to go up and 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.450
 climb fierce with various weapons 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.760
 different in several maps with weapons 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.670
 rare also for you to see how it 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.260
 can play with difficult to use weapons 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.260
 how can the laser gun be 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.909
 and light machine gun called amÃ©n 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.250
 and the current ones also with the 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:47.310
 sniper that I have a run of 39 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.400
 also that I will upload you and I will treat you 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.580
 to explain how he plays with each with each 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.500
 arms like this with little-used difficult weapons 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.020
 and that you have to be very careful when 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.789
 take us I hope you liked it 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.860
 this series I ask you to support 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.159
 quite because the truth is that 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.990
 quite quite happened did not decide 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:13.020
 which is the model of the algebra have and 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.180
 although you get the 300 casualties and good 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.759
 here you see how we see great maternal so 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.680
 that are already common are the ones I ask 25 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.139
 likes I hope we get here I think that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.090
 yes we can hope that I have 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.800
 liked if so leave online comment
