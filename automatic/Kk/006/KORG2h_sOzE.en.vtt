the loop multi I'm going to show you how

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.990 
the loop multi I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> with<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.130> opti<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:14.820> news

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
to do it with the opti but the good news

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.670 
to do it with the opti but the good news
is<00:00:15.210> whether<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.900> any<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.260> these<00:00:16.350> reels

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
is whether you have any of these reels

is whether you have any of these reels
the<00:00:16.980> drag<00:00:17.580> change<00:00:18.180> process<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> same

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
the drag change process is the same

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.460 
the drag change process is the same
before<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.609> started<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.240> any<00:00:21.480> real<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
before we get started on any real what I

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.470 
before we get started on any real what I
recommend<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> crank<00:00:23.340> down<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> drag<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.359> make

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
recommend is crank down the drag to make

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
recommend is crank down the drag to make
sure<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.050> even<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> change<00:00:25.920> some

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
sure you don't even have to change some

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.620 
sure you don't even have to change some
people<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:26.820> confused<00:00:27.000> think<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.539> have

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
people get confused think they have

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
people get confused think they have
right<00:00:27.840> left<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.369> want<00:00:29.580> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
right left and so on you just want to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.540 
right left and so on you just want to
make<00:00:29.760> sure<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.660> your<00:00:30.929> drag<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.560> oriented<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
make sure that your drag is oriented a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.729 
make sure that your drag is oriented a
certain<00:00:33.329> way<00:00:33.480> right<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> left<00:00:34.500> hand

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
certain way right now this is left hand

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
certain way right now this is left hand
line<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.610> smooth<00:00:35.880> going<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.360> way

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
line because it's smooth going this way

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.970 
line because it's smooth going this way
and<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:37.020> some<00:00:37.140> resistance<00:00:37.620> going<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and there's some resistance going the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.740 
and there's some resistance going the
other<00:00:38.010> way<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.550> check<00:00:39.059> yours<00:00:39.270> first<00:00:39.540> before

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
other way so check yours first before

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
other way so check yours first before
you<00:00:39.930> go<00:00:40.020> through<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.290> process<00:00:40.530> let<00:00:41.399> me<00:00:41.460> show

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you go through this process let me show

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:56.230 
you go through this process let me show
you<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> done

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.550 

before<00:00:57.240> I<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.360> started<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.960> always<00:00:57.990> lay<00:00:58.350> out<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
before I get started I always lay out a

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.800 
before I get started I always lay out a
towel<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.220> cloth<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.670> some<00:00:59.850> sort<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.600> really

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.920 
as well so you want to align them
accordingly<00:03:53.859> so<00:03:54.069> they'll<00:03:54.220> fall<00:03:54.430> correctly<00:03:54.940> so

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
accordingly so they'll fall correctly so

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.860 
accordingly so they'll fall correctly so
now<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:56.470> aligned<00:03:56.769> we<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.400> put

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
now that I have it aligned we can put

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.660 
now that I have it aligned we can put
the<00:03:58.870> bearing<00:03:59.140> clutch<00:03:59.349> in<00:03:59.530> place<00:03:59.739> followed<00:04:00.640> by

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.700 
envision whom the lightest said setting
of<00:05:32.210> drag<00:05:32.420> that<00:05:32.600> I<00:05:32.630> would<00:05:32.780> probably<00:05:33.290> ever<00:05:33.410> use

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
of drag that I would probably ever use

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.560 
of drag that I would probably ever use
that's<00:05:34.520> good<00:05:34.790> we're<00:05:35.270> on<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.420> home<00:05:35.540> stretch
