00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.440
 Thank you 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:10.970
 How was the ride taste of Mayshaw Samson who formed the first combination? 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:17.000
 It was the best 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:21.500
 But the best was I Well start but together or with Sue after started off very nice 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.520
 It looked like it was lowered, but how was the response to that start ? 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.539
 Or 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.990
 Air Start I've got a really good start 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.579
 Well that's after all the horses around 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.600
 I thought about riding and seeing how to bend 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.790
 Mike horse came in and pushed in just the right position 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:45.950
 Hey I was I think really Do not have to take a position 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.440
 And I think that it was a strong way to the last straight market around 4 corners 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.840
 How was the name Yamamura from then on? 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.840
 So I was able to face the straight line so the good form 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.130
 With confidence to think only other really that of his horse 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.850
 Take a spurt early 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:07.780
 Well, when I put a whip , it really reacted and it grew 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:13.299
 I thought riding the I wonder if-to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:16.430
 It is said that Takesan is the best but I tried riding today and I felt the candid difference of the name Yamamura and felt 8 differences 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 Where is that? 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.170
 It is Toko who will respond to the expectations of the people 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.979
 It jumped out to go very much, and the martial arts rider himself also made an Emperor award Shun-Autumn together with this 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.610
 Most Thailand 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 We reached the tenth victory 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:42.420
 Because had you put in is so summer numerous name also in between really great to do this this way 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.600
 I think I'm really happy as a model to have it put 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:51.009
 I think it was really good to meet that expectation 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.340
 It goes on big race this fall to see the race the first time today towards the fan 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:02:01.750
 And I think that there are many who are thinking about the appearance of overseas Heisei that could not be accomplished this year 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.740
 Please leave a message for those fans who have it in the future 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.040
 Yes 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.240
 Why did you do a really big job today 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.679
 I think I was 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.520
 Next big thing 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.040
 It is called a goal 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.739
 Because what you have to do is waiting for you 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.739
