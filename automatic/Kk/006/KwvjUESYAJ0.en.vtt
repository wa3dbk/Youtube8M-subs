ago with one of the little winter
collections<00:00:21.449> but<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.660> thought<00:00:21.840> she'd<00:00:22.109> be

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
collections but I thought she'd be

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
collections but I thought she'd be
perfect<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.039> little<00:00:23.340> Valentine's<00:00:23.789> cards

perfect for a little Valentine's cards

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
perfect for a little Valentine's cards
so<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> inked<00:00:25.019> her<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.170> with<00:00:25.350> my<00:00:25.470> memento<00:00:25.980> tuxedo

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
so I inked her up with my memento tuxedo

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
so I inked her up with my memento tuxedo
black<00:00:26.430> ink<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.779> stamped<00:00:28.170> her<00:00:28.230> on<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
black ink and then stamped her on to

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.830 
black ink and then stamped her on to
some<00:00:29.099> heavyweight<00:00:29.609> Kovac<00:00:30.000> quality<00:00:30.269> cardstock

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
some heavyweight Kovac quality cardstock

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.340 
some heavyweight Kovac quality cardstock
and<00:00:31.109> again<00:00:32.120> resisted<00:00:33.120> my<00:00:33.239> OCD<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.870> purposely

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and again resisted my OCD and purposely

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.750 
and again resisted my OCD and purposely
stamped<00:00:34.710> her<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.160> off<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> side

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
stamped her a little off to the side

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
stamped her a little off to the side
instead<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.300> centering<00:00:36.690> her<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.320> I'm

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
instead of centering her and I'm

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
instead of centering her and I'm
actually<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:39.090> coloring<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.230> image<00:00:40.530> like

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
actually not coloring in this image like

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
actually not coloring in this image like
hardly<00:00:41.460> at<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.120> wanted<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> add<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
hardly at all I just wanted to add a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.560 
hardly at all I just wanted to add a
little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.700> pink<00:00:44.700> for<00:00:44.940> her<00:00:45.030> cheeks<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
little bit of pink for her cheeks and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.049 
little bit of pink for her cheeks and
then<00:00:46.170> while<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> little<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> shading<00:00:47.059> which

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
then while a little bit of shading which

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.330 
then while a little bit of shading which
again<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.629> me<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:49.170> weird<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.039> find<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
again for me really weird and I find it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.160 
again for me really weird and I find it
really<00:00:50.520> hard<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> create<00:00:51.360> cards<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
really hard to create cards like this

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.510 
really hard to create cards like this
because<00:00:52.410> you've<00:00:52.680> really<00:00:52.890> got<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.039> balance<00:00:53.250> out

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
because you've really got to balance out

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540 
because you've really got to balance out
the<00:00:53.550> design<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.960> I'd<00:00:55.110> seen<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.410> card<00:00:55.770> by<00:00:56.039> Amy

thought that was really cute so I

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.439 
thought that was really cute so I
decided<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.430> take<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.579> little<00:04:12.759> page<00:04:13.030> from<00:04:13.269> her

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.240 
decided to take a little page from her
book<00:04:13.629> and<00:04:13.900> do<00:04:14.049> kind<00:04:14.379> of<00:04:14.409> the<00:04:14.560> same<00:04:14.709> thing<00:04:15.009> so<00:04:15.219> I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
book and do kind of the same thing so I

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.800 
book and do kind of the same thing so I
lined<00:04:15.519> up<00:04:15.609> the<00:04:15.669> twine<00:04:15.969> where<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.299> wanted<00:04:16.659> it

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
lined up the twine where I wanted it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.289 
lined up the twine where I wanted it
poked<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.739> couple<00:04:18.009> holes<00:04:18.219> with<00:04:18.609> my<00:04:18.789> craft<00:04:19.180> knife

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
poked a couple holes with my craft knife

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.149 
poked a couple holes with my craft knife
and<00:04:19.750> then<00:04:19.959> I<00:04:20.199> just<00:04:20.409> threaded<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.859> twine

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
and then I just threaded the twine

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:23.519 
and then I just threaded the twine
through<00:04:21.190> with<00:04:21.699> a<00:04:21.729> needle<00:04:22.020> just<00:04:23.020> around<00:04:23.320> so

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:23.529 
through with a needle just around so

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.230 
through with a needle just around so
that<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.770> goes<00:04:23.889> right<00:04:24.099> pinal<00:04:24.550> image<00:04:24.789> there<00:04:25.029> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
that it goes right pinal image there and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.689 
that it goes right pinal image there and
I<00:04:25.360> really<00:04:25.599> like<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.779> so<00:04:26.349> yeah<00:04:27.099> I<00:04:27.130> like<00:04:27.460> really

like

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.080 
like
idea<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:29.290> type<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.890> bow<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.370> then

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
idea so type that in a bow and then

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.970 
idea so type that in a bow and then
popped<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.480> bunch<00:04:31.660> of<00:04:31.780> dimensionals<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.650> little

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
popped a bunch of dimensionals on little

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.650 
popped a bunch of dimensionals on little
main<00:04:33.190> panel<00:04:33.640> there<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.120> popped<00:04:34.390> up<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
main panel there so it's popped up a

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.120 
main panel there so it's popped up a
little<00:04:34.900> bit<00:04:35.020> because<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.290> just<00:04:35.410> gives<00:04:35.680> us<00:04:35.890> a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
little bit because it just gives us a

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.280 
little bit because it just gives us a
little<00:04:36.310> extra<00:04:36.550> something<00:04:37.150> without<00:04:37.930> going

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
little extra something without going

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.110 
little extra something without going
overboard<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.130> then<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.550> popped<00:04:39.820> up<00:04:40.000> the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
overboard and then I popped up the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.630 
overboard and then I popped up the
sentiment<00:04:40.630> as<00:04:40.780> well<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.530> then<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.490> little

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
sentiment as well and then the little

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.070 
sentiment as well and then the little
heart<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.120> just<00:04:43.300> used<00:04:43.480> half<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.870> little

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
heart I just used half a little

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.770 
heart I just used half a little
dimensional<00:04:44.590> there<00:04:44.770> and<00:04:45.670> pop<00:04:46.060> that<00:04:46.330> up<00:04:46.540> and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
dimensional there and pop that up and

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.720 
dimensional there and pop that up and
that's<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.110> for<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.350> card<00:04:47.620> front<00:04:47.770> so<00:04:48.280> then<00:04:48.700> I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
that's it for the card front so then I

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.700 
that's it for the card front so then I
went<00:04:49.030> back<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.480> do<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.990> inside<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.470> card

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
went back to do the inside of the card

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.880 
went back to do the inside of the card
so<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:50.950> grabbed<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.700> wider<00:04:52.260> strikes<00:04:53.260> again<00:04:53.590> and

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
so I grabbed the wider strikes again and

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.580 
so I grabbed the wider strikes again and
the<00:04:53.980> grow<00:04:54.160> grating<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:54.820> stamp<00:04:55.780> that<00:04:56.020> on<00:04:56.290> the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
the grow grating and stamp that on the

from the adoring you set and I got my
stamp<00:05:09.280> positioner<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.030> could<00:05:10.360> line<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.840> up

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.780 
I didn't like that there wasn't enough
space<00:05:16.960> around<00:05:17.890> the<00:05:18.040> sentiment<00:05:18.490> again<00:05:19.030> OCD<00:05:19.480> so

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790

space around the sentiment again OCD so
tilted<00:05:21.790> it<00:05:21.880> back<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.180> way<00:05:22.210> i<00:05:22.330> wanted<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.930> got

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.010 
a coffee filter for this just because I

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.070

can<00:05:30.250> reuse<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:30.730> and<00:05:31.030> reuse<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:31.270> reuse<00:05:31.720> it<00:05:31.750> and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
can reuse it and reuse it reuse it and

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.380 
can reuse it and reuse it reuse it and
then<00:05:32.230> I<00:05:32.470> always<00:05:32.590> filter<00:05:33.010> back<00:05:33.220> into<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.850> or

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
then I always filter back into the or

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.590 
then I always filter back into the or
funnel<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.960> back<00:05:35.140> into<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.800> container<00:05:36.160> and

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
funnel it back into the container and

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.750 
funnel it back into the container and
yeah<00:05:37.600> so<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.110> works<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.830> then<00:05:39.100> trim<00:05:39.580> down

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
yeah so that works and then trim down

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.630 
yeah so that works and then trim down
the<00:05:40.150> sentiment<00:05:40.600> after<00:05:40.960> it<00:05:41.140> was<00:05:41.890> melted<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
the sentiment after it was melted and

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.090 
the sentiment after it was melted and
cooled<00:05:42.820> off<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:44.200> got<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.650> way<00:05:44.710> I<00:05:44.740> wanted
