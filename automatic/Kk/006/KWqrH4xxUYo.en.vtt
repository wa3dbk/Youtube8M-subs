so<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.350> is<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.469> core<00:00:01.709> exercise<00:00:01.829> called<00:00:02.460> banned

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
so this is a core exercise called banned

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.249 
so this is a core exercise called banned
leg<00:00:03.030> lowering<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.780> I'm<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.080> show<00:00:04.200> you

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
leg lowering and I'm going to show you

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.570 
leg lowering and I'm going to show you
the<00:00:04.440> banned<00:00:04.620> leg<00:00:04.830> lower<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.279> then<00:00:05.370> I'm<00:00:05.460> going

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
the banned leg lower and then I'm going

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.889 
the banned leg lower and then I'm going
to<00:00:05.640> show<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.759> all<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.270> regressions

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
to show you all of the regressions

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.419 
to show you all of the regressions
normally<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.589> start<00:00:07.950> with<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> easiest

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
normally I start with the easiest

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.610 
normally I start with the easiest
exercise<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.210> show<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.540> progressions<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:10.290> I

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
exercise and show the progressions but I

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.839 
exercise and show the progressions but I
think<00:00:10.920> it'll<00:00:11.040> make<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> little<00:00:11.340> bit<00:00:11.519> more<00:00:11.639> sense

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
think it'll make a little bit more sense

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.549 
think it'll make a little bit more sense
if<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.059> show<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> most<00:00:12.809> difficult<00:00:13.170> one<00:00:13.290> first

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
if I show the most difficult one first

while keeping your low back

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.119 
while keeping your low back
pinned<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.289> want<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> make<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.949> little

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
pinned if you want to make this a little

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
pinned if you want to make this a little
bit<00:00:59.309> easier<00:00:59.489> that's<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> band<00:01:00.750> comes

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
bit easier that's where the band comes

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.789 
bit easier that's where the band comes
in<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:02.010> band<00:01:02.280> goes<00:01:02.550> underneath<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.480> foot

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
in the band goes underneath your foot

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.399 
in the band goes underneath your foot
again<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> assume<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.460> same<00:01:05.700> position<00:01:06.409> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
again you assume the same position and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.660 
again you assume the same position and
the<00:01:09.380> foot<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.650> being<00:01:10.950> held<00:01:11.159> by<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.340> band

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
the foot that's being held by the band

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
the foot that's being held by the band
is<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> stays<00:01:12.570> up<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> people

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
is the one that stays up a lot of people

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
is the one that stays up a lot of people
try<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.860> lower<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.490> raise<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.270> one<00:01:15.479> that's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
try to lower and raise this one that's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.840 
try to lower and raise this one that's
just<00:01:16.380> incorrect<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.180> you'll<00:01:18.330> lower<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.930> raise

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
just incorrect so you'll lower and raise

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
just incorrect so you'll lower and raise
the<00:01:20.850> foot<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.240> not<00:01:21.540> being<00:01:22.229> held<00:01:22.500> by<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the foot that's not being held by the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.920 
the foot that's not being held by the
band<00:01:23.000> again<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.210> want<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> even

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
band again if you want to make it even

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
band again if you want to make it even
easier<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:26.310> pull<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.790> knee<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
easier you can pull one knee to your

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.850 
easier you can pull one knee to your
chest<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.380> important<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
chest this is really important this is a

tough exercise as you can see I'm
struggling<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.100> feel<00:01:32.280> anything

assistance both legs up to make it a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.639 
assistance both legs up to make it a
little<00:02:00.450> bit<00:02:00.659> easier<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.229> put<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> band

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
little bit easier you can put a band

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
little bit easier you can put a band
around<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:01.950> foot<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.060> even<00:02:03.299> easier

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
around your foot to make it even easier

pull one knee to your chest and the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.399 
pull one knee to your chest and the
easiest<00:02:05.790> variation<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:07.079> foot<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
easiest variation is one foot on the

easiest variation is one foot on the

that's band leg lowering in all of its
