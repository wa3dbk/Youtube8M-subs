the way to win but we need to understand

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.030 
the way to win but we need to understand
that<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.550> win<00:00:38.840> not<00:00:39.840> only<00:00:40.170> because<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.829> play

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that we can win not only because we play

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.450 
that we can win not only because we play
always<00:00:41.879> well<00:00:42.829> because<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> first<00:00:44.219> half

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
always well because in the first half

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.420 
always well because in the first half
for<00:00:44.760> me<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.090> play<00:00:45.300> fantasy<00:00:45.809> football<00:00:46.430> but

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
for me we play fantasy football but

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.760 
for me we play fantasy football but
after<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.000> need<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> score<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.870> few<00:00:49.530> don't

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
after you need to score a few don't

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.729 
after you need to score a few don't
score<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.910> central<00:00:51.270> league<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:52.140> difficult

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
score in central league is difficult

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.180 
score in central league is difficult
because<00:00:53.149> every<00:00:54.149> game<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.360> meet<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:55.890> team

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
because every game you meet a top team

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.560 
because every game you meet a top team
and<00:00:56.660> if<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> consider<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.859> did<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> mistake

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
and if you consider you did a mistake

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.529 
and if you consider you did a mistake
after<00:01:00.570> could<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:01.680> difficult<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:03.359> some

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.270 

now<00:03:54.280> we<00:03:54.340> have<00:03:54.670> four<00:03:55.240> days<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:56.140> recover<00:03:56.680> after

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
now we have four days to recover after

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.270 
now we have four days to recover after
gently<00:03:58.240> the<00:03:58.420> problem<00:03:58.750> would<00:03:59.380> be<00:03:59.440> when<00:03:59.770> we<00:03:59.800> love

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
gently the problem would be when we love

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.640 
gently the problem would be when we love
all<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:00.700> three<00:04:00.910> days<00:04:01.110> four<00:04:02.110> days<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.320> think

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
all the three days four days I think

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.030 
all the three days four days I think
that<00:04:02.740> you<00:04:02.890> have<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.070> time<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.520> recover<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:05.230> I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
that you have a time to recover and I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.430 
that you have a time to recover and I
think<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.610> all<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:06.910> player<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:08.020> to<00:04:08.230> play

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
think that all this player just to play

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.470 
think that all this player just to play
every<00:04:08.770> three<00:04:09.010> or<00:04:09.040> four<00:04:09.130> days<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:10.000> normal<00:04:10.450> that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
every three or four days is normal that

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:20.580 
every three or four days is normal that
will<00:04:10.780> be<00:04:10.930> other<00:04:11.710> than<00:04:12.540> osteoma<00:04:17.070> utopia<00:04:19.290> if<00:04:20.290> I

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
will be other than osteoma utopia if I

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.140 
will be other than osteoma utopia if I
would<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:25.110> don't<00:04:26.110> know<00:04:26.200> about<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:27.090> don't<00:04:28.090> know

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
would I don't know about I don't know

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.180 
would I don't know about I don't know
what<00:04:28.390> can<00:04:28.720> happen<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.500> end<00:04:29.590> I<00:04:29.800> think<00:04:29.830> that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
what can happen in the end I think that

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.540 
what can happen in the end I think that
we<00:04:30.880> want<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.180> improve<00:04:31.480> last<00:04:32.350> season<00:04:32.740> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
we want to improve last season the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.760 
we want to improve last season the
season<00:04:33.730> we<00:04:34.080> we<00:04:35.080> were<00:04:35.200> in<00:04:35.350> second<00:04:35.950> position<00:04:36.660> but

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
season we we were in second position but

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.220 
season we we were in second position but
tell<00:04:38.770> for<00:04:39.370> difference<00:04:39.910> for<00:04:40.660> goal<00:04:40.870> difference

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
tell for difference for goal difference

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.730 
tell for difference for goal difference
I<00:04:42.060> think<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.180> this<00:04:43.330> year<00:04:43.570> we<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:44.200> a<00:04:44.410> chance

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
I think that this year we have a chance

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.030 
I think that this year we have a chance
to<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.370> improve<00:04:46.290> we<00:04:47.290> have<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.470> chance<00:04:47.710> maybe

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
to to improve we have a chance maybe

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.230 
to to improve we have a chance maybe
also<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:49.000> win<00:04:49.270> but<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.200> know<00:04:50.620> in<00:04:50.740> football

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
also to win but you know in football

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.470 
also to win but you know in football
football<00:04:52.240> strange<00:04:52.770> for<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:53.950> is<00:04:54.940> important

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
football strange for this is important

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.740 
football strange for this is important
that<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:56.169> believe<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:56.760> we<00:04:57.760> will<00:04:58.060> play<00:04:58.300> all

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
that we believe this we will play all

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.330 
that we believe this we will play all
the<00:04:59.080> games<00:04:59.490> to<00:05:00.490> win<00:05:01.080> this<00:05:02.080> is<00:05:02.290> this<00:05:02.830> important

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
the games to win this is this important

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.940 
the games to win this is this important
i<00:05:03.370> think<00:05:03.400> that<00:05:03.700> if<00:05:03.880> we<00:05:04.000> do<00:05:04.360> this<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.900> think<00:05:05.830> that

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
i think that if we do this I think that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:13.800 
i think that if we do this I think that
we<00:05:06.130> can<00:05:06.790> prove<00:05:07.000> that<00:05:07.060> season<00:05:12.270> at<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.390> moment<00:05:13.720> I

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
we can prove that season at the moment I

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.530 
we can prove that season at the moment I
i<00:05:13.990> don't<00:05:14.229> know<00:05:14.380> i<00:05:14.410> read<00:05:14.950> maybe<00:05:15.370> west<00:05:15.910> them<00:05:16.120> and

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
i don't know i read maybe west them and

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.640 
i don't know i read maybe west them and
also<00:05:16.750> for<00:05:17.140> when<00:05:17.440> is<00:05:17.680> better<00:05:18.400> to<00:05:18.760> go<00:05:18.940> to<00:05:19.690> unlearn

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
also for when is better to go to unlearn

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.360 
also for when is better to go to unlearn
in<00:05:20.890> championship<00:05:21.430> because<00:05:21.610> he<00:05:21.880> needs<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.180> play
