right not to feel right well but i would
say<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:16.430> Sir<00:02:17.430> Isaac<00:02:17.460> Newton<00:02:18.180> came<00:02:18.870> up<00:02:19.050> with

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
say this Sir Isaac Newton came up with

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.190 
say this Sir Isaac Newton came up with
concepts<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.490> will<00:02:20.700> overturn<00:02:21.240> behind<00:02:21.900> sign

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
concepts that will overturn behind sign

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.040 
concepts that will overturn behind sign
Einstein<00:02:23.130> came<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:23.580> with<00:02:24.090> concepts<00:02:24.630> that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
Einstein came up with concepts that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.440 
Einstein came up with concepts that
would<00:02:25.290> overturn<00:02:25.620> by<00:02:26.550> looking<00:02:27.120> called<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
would overturn by looking called the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.080 
would overturn by looking called the
Heisenberg<00:02:27.630> uncertainty<00:02:28.040> person<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.700> still

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
Heisenberg uncertainty person they still

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.560 
Heisenberg uncertainty person they still
teach<00:02:30.590> our<00:02:31.590> children<00:02:31.890> about<00:02:32.310> news<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.790> school

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
teach our children about news in school

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.290 
teach our children about news in school
they<00:02:34.140> don't<00:02:34.170> really<00:02:34.590> say<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:35.190> Newton's<00:02:36.060> his

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
they don't really say on Newton's his

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.199 
they don't really say on Newton's his
stuff<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.750> outdated<00:02:37.640> they<00:02:38.640> don't<00:02:38.820> say<00:02:39.030> that

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
stuff is outdated they don't say that

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.750 
stuff is outdated they don't say that
they<00:02:39.450> say<00:02:39.720> they<00:02:40.560> teaching<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.130> tony<00:02:41.310> mackay

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
they say they teaching and tony mackay

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.490 
they say they teaching and tony mackay
and<00:02:42.090> goes<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:42.990> great<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.410> they

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
and goes here and it's great and they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.020 
and goes here and it's great and they
say<00:02:43.680> well<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.610> theory<00:02:44.910> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
say well this is the theory of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.820 
say well this is the theory of
relativity<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:46.080> everything<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.620> learned

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
relativity and everything you learned

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.650 
relativity and everything you learned
about<00:02:46.920> Newton<00:02:47.400> doesn't<00:02:47.700> work<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
about Newton doesn't work in this

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.690 
about Newton doesn't work in this
overturns<00:02:49.320> all<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
overturns all of it then they take you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.610 
overturns all of it then they take you
into<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.030> uncertainty<00:02:51.930> principle<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.500> say

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
into the uncertainty principle and say

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.190 
into the uncertainty principle and say
well<00:02:52.800> this<00:02:52.950> override<00:02:53.790> both<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.300> those<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.050> they

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
well this override both of those so they

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.800 
well this override both of those so they
don't<00:02:55.380> feel<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> heat<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.640> tear<00:02:56.910> down<00:02:56.940> their

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
don't feel the heat to tear down their

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.560 
don't feel the heat to tear down their
leader<00:02:58.110> they<00:02:58.350> are<00:02:58.680> being<00:02:59.240> raised<00:03:00.240> their

leader they are being raised their

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.600 
leader they are being raised their
manhood<00:03:00.959> Isaac<00:03:01.380> Newton<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:02.100> level<00:03:02.340> of

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
manhood Isaac Newton to a level of

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.790 
manhood Isaac Newton to a level of
respectability<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.600> they<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.260> tear<00:03:04.590> down

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800
