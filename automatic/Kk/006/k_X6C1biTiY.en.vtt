00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
how about a set of douches for McNiff

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.370 
how about a set of douches for McNiff
and<00:00:08.580> Morgan<00:00:09.090> go<00:00:09.389> out<00:00:09.660> for<00:00:09.809> five<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.170> was<00:00:10.260> gonna

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and Morgan go out for five I was gonna

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
and Morgan go out for five I was gonna
say<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> mean<00:00:10.889> if<00:00:11.250> you're<00:00:11.429> not<00:00:11.460> gonna<00:00:11.700> flop<00:00:11.969> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
say I mean if you're not gonna flop a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180 
say I mean if you're not gonna flop a
set<00:00:12.410> you<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.799> flop

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
set you like this flop

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.900 
set you like this flop
don't<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:15.080> even<00:00:16.080> has<00:00:16.320> six<00:00:16.619> outs<00:00:16.800> versus<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> set

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
don't you even has six outs versus a set

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.510 
don't you even has six outs versus a set
yeah<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> guess<00:00:19.619> it'd<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.800> Morgan<00:00:20.250> against<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
yeah I guess it'd be Morgan against the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.330 
yeah I guess it'd be Morgan against the
chip<00:00:20.699> later<00:00:20.880> she's<00:00:21.060> gonna<00:00:21.150> check<00:00:21.330> call<00:00:21.570> us

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
chip later she's gonna check call us

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
chip later she's gonna check call us
certainly<00:00:23.340> not<00:00:23.460> gonna<00:00:23.550> fall<00:00:23.789> hold<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.840> don't

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
certainly not gonna fall hold I I don't

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.230 
certainly not gonna fall hold I I don't
think<00:00:25.410> he<00:00:25.470> generates<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
spot he could definitely could check

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.990 
spot he could definitely could check
raise<00:00:28.859> check<00:00:29.189> range<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.730> opponent

more now and you can see Morgan I mean

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
more now and you can see Morgan I mean
now<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.789> straight<00:00:48.149> draw<00:00:48.329> no<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.899> he<00:00:49.050> needs<00:00:49.350> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
now the straight draw no good he needs a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.700 
now the straight draw no good he needs a
five<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> only<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> five<00:00:51.170> actually<00:00:52.170> strangely

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
five and only a five actually strangely

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.180 
five and only a five actually strangely
enough<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:54.140> six<00:00:55.140> also<00:00:55.559> would<00:00:55.680> give<00:00:55.860> them<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> win

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
enough a six also would give them a win

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
enough a six also would give them a win
I<00:00:56.370> think<00:00:56.760> Morgan's<00:00:57.149> probably<00:00:57.510> gonna<00:00:57.600> bet<00:00:57.899> big

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.529 
I think Morgan's probably gonna bet big
here<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> maybe<00:00:59.160> hope<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> has<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> six

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539

here and maybe hope that it has a six

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
your opponent has a six that maybe you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.469 
your opponent has a six that maybe you

can get all the money in right here in

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
can get all the money in right here in
the<00:01:12.540> turn<00:01:12.750> off<00:01:16.610> even<00:01:17.610> more

the turn off even more

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
the turn off even more
yeah<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> force<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.350> case<00:01:19.500> he's<00:01:19.619> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
yeah like the force like in case he's a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200

six<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> force<00:01:20.610> him<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.790> push<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> back

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
six to kind of force him to push it back

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.700 
six to kind of force him to push it back
at<00:01:21.420> me<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.750> mean<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.140> ever<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.590> your

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
at me I mean you ever think your

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
at me I mean you ever think your
opponent<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> big<00:01:23.369> blind<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.939> has

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
opponent and the big blind actually has

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
opponent and the big blind actually has
sometimes<00:01:24.330> has<00:01:24.600> occasional<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.520> h3a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
sometimes has occasional like h3a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.340 
sometimes has occasional like h3a
survive<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.479> he's<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.750> gonna<00:01:27.990> fold<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
survive but he's probably gonna fold it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
survive but he's probably gonna fold it
anyway<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> bet<00:01:29.070> heavy<00:01:29.220> pot<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:30.000> it

bigger<00:01:53.130> full<00:01:53.399> house<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.390> normally<00:01:54.810> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
bigger full house now normally this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.240 
bigger full house now normally this
would<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> really<00:01:55.380> scary<00:01:55.680> board<00:01:56.009> because

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
would be a really scary board because

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.620 
would be a really scary board because
this<00:01:56.460> boat<00:01:57.360> though<00:01:57.860> boat<00:01:58.860> yeah<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.210> could

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this boat though boat yeah this could

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.999 
this boat though boat yeah this could
let's<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.140> how<00:02:01.229> big<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> pot<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.799> eight

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
let's see how big the pot is eight

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
let's see how big the pot is eight
hundred<00:02:02.310> thousand<00:02:02.640> got<00:02:02.790> two<00:02:02.939> million<00:02:03.149> behind

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
hundred thousand got two million behind

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.550 
hundred thousand got two million behind
the<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> they're<00:02:04.140> probably<00:02:04.380> gonna

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the I think that they're probably gonna

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200 
the I think that they're probably gonna
get<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.009> in<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.759> question<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.090> is

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
get this all in here the question is is

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.249 
get this all in here the question is is
he<00:02:06.299> gonna<00:02:06.390> lead<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:07.039> what's<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> play<00:02:08.429> I

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
he gonna lead now what's the play I

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.740 
he gonna lead now what's the play I
probably<00:02:10.259> lead<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> three<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.660> if

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
probably lead do you have a three but if

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.610 
probably lead do you have a three but if
he<00:02:13.140> checks

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
he checks

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.589 
he checks
he'd<00:02:13.769> be<00:02:13.890> scared<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.670> even<00:02:15.239> if<00:02:15.330> he<00:02:15.390> has<00:02:15.510> an

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
he'd be scared if it even if he has an

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.970 
he'd be scared if it even if he has an
overpair<00:02:15.959> he<00:02:16.049> might<00:02:16.200> check<00:02:16.379> back<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.830> for

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
overpair he might check back on the for

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.710 
overpair he might check back on the for
crushed<00:02:17.190> role<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.909> think<00:02:18.510> if<00:02:18.599> your

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
crushed role and then I think if your

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.390 
crushed role and then I think if your
McNiff<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.230> almost<00:02:19.409> have<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.650> raise<00:02:19.950> my<00:02:20.220> ass

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
McNiff you almost have to raise my ass

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800 
McNiff you almost have to raise my ass
because<00:02:20.670> his<00:02:20.790> opponent<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.420> want<00:02:21.599> to<00:02:21.690> raise

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
because his opponent you want to raise

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.509 
because his opponent you want to raise
to<00:02:22.049> get<00:02:22.170> value<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.890> straight<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.430> would

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
to get value out of a straight it would

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.160 
to get value out of a straight it would
be<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> great<00:02:23.849> call<00:02:24.060> he<00:02:24.420> could<00:02:24.720> call<00:02:24.989> here

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
be a great call he could call here

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.539 
be a great call he could call here
because<00:02:25.409> I<00:02:25.470> kept<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.860> lot<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.400> he's

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
because I kept a lot of the time he's

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.050 
because I kept a lot of the time he's
been<00:02:26.670> running<00:02:26.849> in<00:02:27.379> straight-6<00:02:28.379> a<00:02:29.040> lot<00:02:29.909> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
been running in straight-6 a lot of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.490 
been running in straight-6 a lot of
times<00:02:30.239> opponent<00:02:30.750> yeah<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.049> if<00:02:31.140> he<00:02:31.230> has<00:02:31.319> eight

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
times opponent yeah but if he has eight

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.759 
times opponent yeah but if he has eight
six<00:02:31.799> he<00:02:31.920> might<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.819> folding<00:02:34.099> might<00:02:35.099> be

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
six he might be that folding might be

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.869 
six he might be that folding might be
remember<00:02:37.769> McNiff<00:02:38.040> was<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.340> preflop<00:02:38.640> raiser

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
remember McNiff was there preflop raiser

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.250 
remember McNiff was there preflop raiser
how<00:02:39.000> many<00:02:39.150> threes<00:02:39.420> does<00:02:39.569> he<00:02:39.659> have<00:02:39.750> his<00:02:39.840> range<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
how many threes does he have his range I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.390 
how many threes does he have his range I
mean<00:02:40.379> you're<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:40.560> losing<00:02:40.799> them<00:02:41.099> much<00:02:41.190> if<00:02:41.310> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
mean you're not losing them much if you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.020 
mean you're not losing them much if you

right oh wow but he could be worried

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.979 
right oh wow but he could be worried
here<00:02:57.989> about<00:02:58.200> six<00:02:58.500> five<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.250> six<00:02:59.430> it's<00:03:00.390> fine<00:03:00.569> I

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
here about six five and six it's fine I

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.539 
here about six five and six it's fine I
think<00:03:01.500> six<00:03:01.769> four<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.099> hear<00:03:02.250> from<00:03:02.340> him<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
think six four you hear from him a

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.009 
think six four you hear from him a
little<00:03:02.579> bit<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> think<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.540> think<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.959> a

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
little bit I think I I think it's a

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.080 
little bit I think I I think it's a
really<00:03:04.140> odd<00:03:04.319> line<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.769> six<00:03:04.950> four<00:03:05.159> six<00:03:05.849> five

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
really odd line with six four six five

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.780 
really odd line with six four six five
makes<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.540> little<00:03:06.720> bit<00:03:06.900> could<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.340> call<00:03:08.579> here

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
makes a little bit could just call here

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.640 
makes a little bit could just call here
would<00:03:08.909> be<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> great<00:03:09.329> just<00:03:09.780> call<00:03:10.019> but<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> think<00:03:10.470> I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
would be a great just call but I think I

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.140 
would be a great just call but I think I
think<00:03:10.950> he's<00:03:11.040> gonna<00:03:11.129> call<00:03:11.340> here<00:03:11.579> pretty<00:03:11.879> fair

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
think he's gonna call here pretty fair

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.250 
think he's gonna call here pretty fair
amount<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.510> time<00:03:12.540> he's<00:03:12.810> wondering<00:03:13.109> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
amount of the time he's wondering the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.869 
amount of the time he's wondering the
thinkin<00:03:13.799> does<00:03:13.950> his<00:03:14.069> opponent<00:03:14.400> have<00:03:14.489> six<00:03:14.700> five

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
thinkin does his opponent have six five

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.160 
thinkin does his opponent have six five
versus<00:03:15.329> how<00:03:15.420> often<00:03:15.690> does<00:03:15.750> he<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:15.989> three

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
versus how often does he have a three

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.629 
versus how often does he have a three
and<00:03:16.230> even<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.530> he<00:03:16.620> does<00:03:16.769> have<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:16.950> three<00:03:17.220> he

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
and even if he does have a three he

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.940 
and even if he does have a three he
might<00:03:17.849> not<00:03:18.030> call<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.329> raise<00:03:18.660> I'm<00:03:19.139> with<00:03:19.349> you<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.829> I

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
might not call a raise I'm with you if I

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.009 
might not call a raise I'm with you if I
had<00:03:20.130> six<00:03:20.310> four<00:03:20.609> and<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.359> decided<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.840> play<00:03:21.989> it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
had six four and I decided to play it

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.170 
had six four and I decided to play it
this<00:03:22.169> way<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.530> wouldn't<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.099> don't<00:03:23.459> think<00:03:23.940> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
this way and I wouldn't I don't think I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
this way and I wouldn't I don't think I
think<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:24.959> probably<00:03:25.109> checking<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.500> river

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
think I'm probably checking the river

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.000 
think I'm probably checking the river
too<00:03:25.829> though<00:03:27.079> but<00:03:28.079> to<00:03:28.230> me<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.560> looks<00:03:28.769> like<00:03:28.950> a

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
too though but to me this looks like a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.920 
too though but to me this looks like a
three<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.519> con<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.000> looks<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.510> CH<00:03:30.540> three

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
three a con this looks like a CH three

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.900 
three a con this looks like a CH three
maybe<00:03:31.440> even<00:03:31.590> a<00:03:31.769> three<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.129> Hearts<00:03:32.400> Taipan<00:03:32.819> you

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
maybe even a three of Hearts Taipan you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.400 
maybe even a three of Hearts Taipan you
don't<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> mean<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.329> would<00:03:33.419> have<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:33.810> suit<00:03:34.200> oh
