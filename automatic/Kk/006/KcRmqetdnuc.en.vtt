00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
we're about five eighths off because

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.400 
we're about five eighths off because
this<00:00:53.330> piece<00:00:53.690> here<00:00:53.960> lines<00:00:54.470> up<00:00:54.850> with<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:55.970> pulley

this piece here lines up with the pulley
to<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.680> pulley<00:00:58.059> line<00:00:59.059> up<00:00:59.239> that<00:00:59.420> so<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.920> got<00:01:01.130> to

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
to this pulley line up that so we got to

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.340 
to this pulley line up that so we got to
take<00:01:01.400> this<00:01:01.640> piece<00:01:02.059> here<00:01:02.090> all<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.080> way<00:01:03.140> down

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
our new brake line who's that have been

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.170 
our new brake line who's that have been
waiting<00:02:18.019> for<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.829> a<00:02:18.860> while<00:02:19.100> and
