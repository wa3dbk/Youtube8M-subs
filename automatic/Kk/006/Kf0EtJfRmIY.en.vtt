them into X 52 so you can stack it you
must<00:01:19.950> also<00:01:20.189> make<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.670> pathway<00:01:21.090> while<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> while

must also make the pathway while I while

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.539 
must also make the pathway while I while
I<00:01:21.720> attacking<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.500> ensure<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.250> creeps

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
I attacking to ensure that the creeps

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
I attacking to ensure that the creeps
don't<00:01:23.820> block<00:01:24.060> themselves<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.840> that's<00:01:25.320> the

don't block themselves and that's the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.620 
don't block themselves and that's the
consequence<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:26.820> be<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
consequence of this would be that the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
consequence of this would be that the

crypts would endlessly attack you until

you move near the camp or if you kill
