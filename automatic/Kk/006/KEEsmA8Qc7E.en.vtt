look back through some video was quite a
few<00:00:24.450> times<00:00:24.920> because<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.130> didn't<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.540> which

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
few times because I didn't know which

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.570 
few times because I didn't know which
person<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.110> was<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.130> really

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
person I was going to go for was really

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.689 
person I was going to go for was really
difficult<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.420> few<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.900> choose<00:00:30.930> from

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
difficult it was a few to choose from

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.189 
difficult it was a few to choose from
like<00:00:32.699> i<00:00:32.820> whittled<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.660> few<00:00:33.690> and

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 
like i whittled it down to a few and

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.160 
like i whittled it down to a few and
then<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:36.269> thinking<00:00:36.629> that<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.780> might<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.140> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
then I was thinking that I might have to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.250 
then I was thinking that I might have to
have<00:00:37.410> more<00:00:37.650> than<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:37.980> minute<00:00:38.269> but<00:00:39.269> because<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
have more than one minute but because I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.979 
have more than one minute but because I
didn't<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.650> enough<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.970> good<00:00:42.600> prizes

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
didn't have enough we like good prizes

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.729 
didn't have enough we like good prizes
to<00:00:43.590> make<00:00:43.739> an<00:00:44.010> ice<00:00:44.580> pack<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.120> each<00:00:45.480> person<00:00:45.809> had

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to make an ice pack for each person had

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.030 
to make an ice pack for each person had
to<00:00:46.769> stick<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.729> unfortunately<00:00:48.530> so<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
to stick with one unfortunately so the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.399 
to stick with one unfortunately so the
winner<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.589> it's<00:00:52.769> y<00:00:52.890> axis<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.409> she

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
winner is I think it's y axis and she

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.700 
winner is I think it's y axis and she
did<00:00:55.559> three<00:00:55.890> looks<00:00:56.210> which<00:00:57.320> wasn't<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> reason

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
did three looks which wasn't the reason

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
did three looks which wasn't the reason
that<00:00:58.920> she<00:00:59.280> won<00:00:59.519> it's<00:00:59.879> not<00:01:00.089> because<00:01:00.360> she<00:01:00.479> did

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
that she won it's not because she did

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.890 
that she won it's not because she did
more<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:00.839> one<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.760> each<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.210> was
