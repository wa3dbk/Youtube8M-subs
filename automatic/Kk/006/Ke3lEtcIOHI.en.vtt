00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello dear friends just 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.730
 held a high-speed training new 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.160
 scooters two weeks have passed since 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.000
 how I broke my ribs 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:22.140
 were address two spam edges on here here 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.720
 location is hard on each leg well 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.340
 little dog and so more or less normal 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:35.320
 before training for half an hour talking to 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.050
 coach, honored coach of Russia 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.520
 Bereznyak Pavel Andreevich 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:48.950
 discussed the topic of the ring metro application 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:52.730
 junior team agreed that 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.920
 Need to do a little lesson with 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.680
 guys 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:04.570
 explain to them the functions that allow 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 determine c by a value 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.869
 heart rate at which 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.180
 there is a transition from the athlete 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:17.450
 aerobic work in anaerobic guys 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.130
 heart rate monitor have all models of all 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:25.280
 different but functions unfortunately not 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.510
 use thieves embedded 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.590
 such which allow to determine 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.150
 functional state of the body 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.040
 I 'll show you the results 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.610
 today's training that today 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.610
 happened 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.170
 polar rc x3 heart rate monitor with gps sensor 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:52.100
 dps remote 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.100
 So here we find today's training 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 here is the result of the workout pace or 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.909
 maximum coach that is tempo 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.979
 intensity training 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.299
 maximum intensity path through with 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.510
 maybe the item was look there is nothing 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:24.090
 interesting so it is automatic circles 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 the little circle is interesting 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.709
 two and a half kilometers the best time is 6 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.709
 minutes 42 seconds 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.810
 these are the zones through which 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.080
 zone training was performed 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:47.239
 determined before training time 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:53.280
 testing recovery 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:55.830
 not quite good ie borders 3 4 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.239
 zone 146 beats with good 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.530
 Recovery I have it somewhere around 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.120
 160 here and 146 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.920
 third zone one hundred twenty nine dash one hundred 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.780
 forty six that's what time i 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.400
 was in each zone 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.879
 time here is my speed 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.190
 training can be seen that in the third zone 22 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.510
 minutes in the fourth zone speed 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:25.220
 work 23 minutes and zone 5 is 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.889
 anaerobic creatine phosphate yazona 15 minutes 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:35.970
 5 zone 15 minutes zone is prohibited for 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:37.920
 trainings sport bike 1 since here 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.370
 there is no roller sport needed 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:46.950
 Choosing a bike 1:18 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.519
 average speed of 17 kilometers per hour 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.049
 maximum 42 and 8 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:55.950
 there are some calories and here 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.220
 Lost here is the average heart rate during 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.329
 workout 146 strokes 79 percent off 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.769
 honest as much as possible 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:09.510
 178 97 percent close to the maximum 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.359
 me one hundred eighty four hits on 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.310
 my age is certain 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.049
 experimental method in training 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.010
 reach today its maximum not 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:23.490
 could nâ€™t have recovered since 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.440
 its been two weeks from injury trauma 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.580
 back broke rib started with broken 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.789
 ribs ride all these days trained 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.650
 did not miss a single workout 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:40.860
 here is a summary 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:45.729
 duration 1:18 distance 2263 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:52.870
 here skeptics want to explain the average 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:53.440
 speed 17 3 is speed time 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.330
 acceleration 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.370
 acceleration going uphill continuous 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.940
 lifting 400 meters 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.770
 on a circle and the rest of the time here 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:11.110
 let's go speedy work goes somewhere 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:12.720
 about 2 minutes here i go out of the mountain 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.560
 the rest of the circle 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:20.880
 somewhere kilometer seven hundred kilometers 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.880
 eight hundred but plus 3 you like 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.830
 recovering on the pulse 120 130 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:30.150
 beats 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.860
 Here is such a training mora detail 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.940
 what are you saying then what is not
