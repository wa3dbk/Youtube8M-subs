you<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> watch<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.280> because

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
you got to watch what they do because

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
you got to watch what they do because
they<00:00:36.390> could<00:00:36.630> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.960> screw<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.010> do

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
they could kind of screw you and just do

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850 
they could kind of screw you and just do
a<00:00:38.370> half-assed<00:00:38.850> job<00:00:39.170> you<00:00:40.170> won't<00:00:40.290> even<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a half-assed job you won't even know it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.330 
a half-assed job you won't even know it
so<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.460> off<00:00:42.379> it's<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> radio<00:00:43.920> already

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so first off it's got the radio already

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 
so first off it's got the radio already
pulled<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.789> here's<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> factory<00:00:46.020> plug<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.469> at

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
pulled out here's the factory plug so at

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
pulled out here's the factory plug so at
least<00:00:46.649> they<00:00:46.860> didn't<00:00:47.100> cut<00:00:47.280> into<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:48.030> smart

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
least they didn't cut into that as smart

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.610 
least they didn't cut into that as smart
these<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> wire<00:00:49.170> adapter<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:51.410> for<00:00:52.410> some

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
these the wire adapter but for some

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.319 
these the wire adapter but for some
reason<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.489> plug<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.969> comes<00:00:54.210> off

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
reason this is the plug that comes off

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.790 
reason this is the plug that comes off
of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.629> radio<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.960> amp<00:00:58.230> turn<00:00:58.590> on

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of the radio and this is an amp turn on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.290 
of the radio and this is an amp turn on
well<00:00:59.570> somehow<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:01.309> put<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> crimp<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
well somehow they put a crimp in it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.710 
well somehow they put a crimp in it
instead<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.199> using<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.559> buck<00:01:04.799> connector<00:01:05.720> which

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
instead of using a buck connector which

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
instead of using a buck connector which
is<00:01:06.900> understandable<00:01:07.140> i<00:01:07.650> guess<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.400> then

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
is understandable i guess and then

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
is understandable i guess and then
instead<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.450> doing<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> proper<00:01:10.380> connection

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
instead of doing a proper connection

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
instead of doing a proper connection
they<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.220> peeled<00:01:11.490> back<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> sheathing<00:01:12.170> put

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
they just peeled back the sheathing put

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.870 
they just peeled back the sheathing put
this<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.740> grab<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.369> electrical<00:01:14.850> tape

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this on here grab some electrical tape

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.840 
this on here grab some electrical tape
on<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> zip<00:01:16.409> tie<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.979> let's<00:01:17.640> hit

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
on it put a zip tie on it let's hit

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
on it put a zip tie on it let's hit
tight<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.450> freaking<00:01:18.810> put<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.049> zip<00:01:19.350> tie<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
tight in freaking put the zip tie on the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.179 
tight in freaking put the zip tie on the
wire<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.880> hold<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> together<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:22.590> come<00:01:23.070> on

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
wire to hold it together like come on

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.560 
wire to hold it together like come on
seriously<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:25.020> down<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:26.240> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
seriously and then down here this is the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.649 
seriously and then down here this is the
wires<00:01:28.189> these<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> wires<00:01:29.670> coming<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.390> up

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
wires these are the wires coming back up

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.420 
wires these are the wires coming back up
to<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.960> 4<00:01:31.259> channel<00:01:31.820> every<00:01:32.820> connection<00:01:33.409> is

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
to the 4 channel every connection is

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
to the 4 channel every connection is
taped<00:01:35.430> every<00:01:36.420> single<00:01:36.689> one<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> them<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.320> taped

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
taped every single one of them is taped

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.130 
taped every single one of them is taped
I'm<00:01:37.920> pretty<00:01:38.159> sure<00:01:38.340> they're<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.610> soldered

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
I'm pretty sure they're not soldered

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.240 
I'm pretty sure they're not soldered
haven't<00:01:40.140> looked<00:01:40.320> at<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:43.140> fricking<00:01:43.890> tape

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
haven't looked at them the fricking tape

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.230 
haven't looked at them the fricking tape
come<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:45.049> are<00:01:46.049> these<00:01:46.229> people<00:01:46.439> thinking<00:01:47.240> let's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
come on are these people thinking let's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.560 
come on are these people thinking let's
pull<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> tape<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:50.570> no

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
pull that the tape a little bit here no

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.130 
pull that the tape a little bit here no
I<00:01:51.930> don't<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.439> any<00:01:52.590> solder<00:01:52.829> on<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> wire<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
I don't see any solder on that wire I

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.010 
I don't see any solder on that wire I
probably<00:01:55.140> pull<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.409> wire<00:01:55.649> part<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.250> easily

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
probably pull that wire part for easily

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.349 
probably pull that wire part for easily
yeah<00:01:58.770> yeah<00:01:59.310> they<00:01:59.609> just<00:01:59.759> got<00:01:59.939> wrapped<00:02:00.210> around

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
yeah yeah they just got wrapped around

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:04.249 
yeah yeah they just got wrapped around
no<00:02:00.840> solder<00:02:01.820> they<00:02:02.820> got<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.149> along<00:02:03.539> every

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
no solder they got that along every

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.399 
no solder they got that along every
connection<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.270> then<00:02:06.270> here's<00:02:06.719> another<00:02:07.049> amp

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
connection and then here's another amp

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.420 
connection and then here's another amp
remote<00:02:08.280> wire<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:09.690> blue<00:02:10.229> wire<00:02:10.500> which<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.250> don't

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
remote wire this blue wire which I don't
