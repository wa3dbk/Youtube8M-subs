00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi all bob 777 welcome in 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.370
 this thirty-seventh episode of the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.160
 my broken glories you see someone they the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.380
 true striker diego costs he will do 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 report together with star then attack of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.070
 what was rage had asked of 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.289
 suggest which attacker to buy at 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.539
 mind place that eventually two more 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.150
 commented were diego costa and remy 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 but let's say that what you swept 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.269
 so between the two I went to 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 buy him because it doesn't cost anyway 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.219
 not even that much and I want to have it 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.910
 but before starting this episode 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.380
 very important because we're going to do 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.239
 two games that we will see now 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.820
 I ask you to suggest another 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.879
 striker to use for turnover 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 so let's say panchinaro though 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.000
 it is not nice to departments because naro 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 anyway I would like to let him play sometimes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 but above all this time it must not 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 cost a lot that's why now I would 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 thought of rowing but you anyway 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 suggest me who to buy 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.329
 I wouldn't want to spend so much though 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 now let's move on to important things 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.039
 because this is the situation at the moment 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 we have two games we must win 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.530
 a 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.240
 we are practically at the same point 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.640
 of the first time we have 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.619
 made this division 4 we needed a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 certain result and we have failed 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.090
 this time we will succeed 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.290
 and then without saying anything else we go to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.840
 see who our first opponent is 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.490
 but first I remember you as always of 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 like this video to get 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.869
 other episodes of this blog route I have 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.360
 finally after an hour between one 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.119
 opponent of move and his team 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.390
 83 of evaluation also well 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.350
 ok then i don't want to draw 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 by force 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.700
 the victory goes the salinis vice a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.520
 originate solis withheld May 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.899
 better for us xvi I don't have to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.619
 wrong happened the exact same 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.110
 thing 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.790
 the first time is when I stop 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.729
 the penalty then I failed to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 mark and summary manuscript division yes 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 repeats the story 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.670
 let's try to change some of it 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.840
 let us always explain it as the pope of 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.579
 cat the parade is then returned 10 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.369
 however a heart attack 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.250
 One to zero for us fabregas had 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.250
 parade to his idea that after gestures 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.110
 not much with are in this world 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.250
 fortunately the ball will enter 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:21.299
 launched sorry sorry sorry charlie g20 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.629
 forty-fourth we are not there 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.790
 let's lose this great daniel I say what 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.650
 however, it is a bit invisible so far 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.540
 the important thing is that we are winning e 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 convincing with a double advantage 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.280
 that's what I can break through 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.530
 coast goes against Rocco now that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.819
 already punished 30 st diego costs out 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.879
 I wanted to do everything there was also 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.120
 companion could be 30 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.329
 sergi calmly recovers to 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.359
 register them as early as the forty-fifth 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.150
 3 0 the first perfect time 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.920
 just what i wanted i cost it 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.030
 the red to play up before turning 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 with costs here it is against 0 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.790
 the first signing with our diego club 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.209
 costs but the ball on this ridge 5 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.680
 no no no no no no outside oscar countries already 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.660
 where can I do it before the midfield 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.889
 diego costs help sturridge 5 to 0 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.319
 enough is done let's go into division three 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:29.310
 sir attention or who does his 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.370
 factory this time 51 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.060
 ok yet there is a big margin for or not 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.180
 diego costs 5 2 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.359
 oh well then I tell you nothing we are 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900
 we are just shut up and that's enough for 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.620
 infinity 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.780
 the ball still turned 6 to 2 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.819
 ok it's not offside i thought so 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.849
 the opposite is not the case 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.040
 62 for us ball inside for twenty and that 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.329
 just entered benteke goes down another 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:04.109
 rigor that makes us fabregas 72 I still go 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:07.440
 inside sells the goalkeeper jumping 82 83 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.549
 euro is in the is just waiting for a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.139
 whistle 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.669
 let the flagship let it go first 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:17.370
 that we remain in ten mirai at 84 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.670
 and now those who succeed and strong end here 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.270
 I didn't want to risk it 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.190
 on that goal 8 to 4 we go in for 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.930
 division between however we still have the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.630
 the opportunity to win this 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.360
 division 4 ok so there is nothing to 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.660
 say we are in division iii we succeed to 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.400
 get there and we still have a game 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.680
 to make three more points there 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.110
 they would guarantee to win this one 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.720
 division 4 is seen to have the money 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.480
 we suck pro whites 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.980
 here is his opponent's area 82 in 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.500
 rotation another premier 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.010
 ok this one more like mine than yours 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.020
 module 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.530
 let's see if we can win these 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:01.690
 more money loses paul more silently 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.270
 10 diego costa 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.220
 don't let the opportunity slip away 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.680
 look here failed to find the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.600
 goalkeeper what then fails 1 0 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.610
 for us after three minutes 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.070
 mom my mom my sturridge my mom 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.400
 street is law and two to zero and behold 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.860
 another goleada and that perhaps has ris 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.370
 but what is a bug what were difficulties 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:31.470
 well what happened 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:34.060
 petrified help him free of 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.820
 success and pay us 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.090
 ok come back to life i'm here st curls 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:43.840
 he goes into the sturridge shooting area 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:53.140
 oscar 21 45 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:55.720
 ok, okay speeches 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:59.260
 ok Parisian or business goes down another 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:02.170
 rigor is how rigorous it takes st 3 ok 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:05.520
 there is still cesc fabregas 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:11.890
 I think part 3 to 1 for us yet 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:16.060
 stanley 85th 41 credits credits 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:18.900
 credit and 542 tells we are I am 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.550
 far from doing this game 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.220
 it was already quite useless at the beginning 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.320
 then we are also winning so okay 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.080
 hope the tax and low happy here 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.490
 42 Now let's go and see everything 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.380
 why 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.069
 we are in division iii and we do it by 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.650
 winners of the division 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:40.259
 ok doctors has little to see why we are 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.270
 finally this new division with the 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.280
 damn it's over we did two 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.130
 sometimes the important though that 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:50.819
 we managed to finish it now but there is 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.580
 a new challenge division iii now begins 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.289
 to be a little more complicated with 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.840
 the opponent stronger, etcetera 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.880
 but I think you know it then 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.280
 I still remember to suggest which one 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.440
 panchinaro which substitute to buy must 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.960
 being an attacker must be strong and 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.639
 it must be cheap and if you like it 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.349
 like to join my channel e
