a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> attention<00:00:44.010> I've<00:00:44.520> noticed<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.440> lot<00:00:46.440> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
a lot of attention I've noticed a lot a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
a lot of attention I've noticed a lot a
lot<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.100> older<00:00:47.430> gentleman<00:00:48.090> liked<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:48.629> of

lot of older gentleman liked the look of
it<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.460> difficult<00:00:50.460> part<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.730> me<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.180> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it the difficult part for me is that it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.160 
it the difficult part for me is that it
has<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.809> hard<00:00:52.170> body<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.629> means<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
has a hard body and so that means if it

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.610 
has a hard body and so that means if it
flips<00:00:55.680> her<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.579> anything<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.660> scratch

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
flips her or anything it's gonna scratch

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
flips her or anything it's gonna scratch
the<00:00:58.920> paint<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.309> show<00:00:59.879> through<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> white

the paint and show through the white
plastic<00:01:00.870> underneath<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.399> that's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.940> big<00:01:03.719> big

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
plastic underneath so that's a big big

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.800 
plastic underneath so that's a big big
problem<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.100> me<00:01:05.489> especially<00:01:06.000> when<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.570> like

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
problem for me especially when I like

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.289 
problem for me especially when I like
the<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> looks<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.619> much<00:01:08.030> we'll<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.180> how

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
not that it needs much travel but you

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.770 
not that it needs much travel but you
only<00:02:38.989> got<00:02:39.290> maybe<00:02:40.030> less<00:02:41.030> than<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.299> quarter<00:02:41.599> inch

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
in the way the manual suggests so I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.399 
in the way the manual suggests so I
ended<00:02:46.640> up<00:02:46.790> cutting<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.180> bump<00:02:47.510> stops<00:02:47.810> out<00:02:48.079> and

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
ended up cutting the bump stops out and

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.740 
ended up cutting the bump stops out and
done<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.609> actually<00:02:50.599> put<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> piece<00:02:51.349> up<00:02:51.650> top

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
done I actually put a piece up top

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.059 
done I actually put a piece up top
because<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.049> wheels<00:02:54.440> were<00:02:54.560> severely

bit<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.879> kind<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.359> correct<00:03:02.659> it<00:03:02.930> but<00:03:03.200> they<00:03:03.799> were

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
bit to kind of correct it but they were

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.940 
bit to kind of correct it but they were
sitting<00:03:04.579> at<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> severe<00:03:05.090> angle<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:05.950> research

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
for me the wheels are painted purple I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.809 
for me the wheels are painted purple I
tried<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.440> dye<00:03:24.650> them<00:03:24.980> black<00:03:25.310> they're

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
tried to dye them black they're

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.059 
tried to dye them black they're
originally<00:03:26.209> yellow<00:03:26.599> I<00:03:26.810> tried<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.680> dye<00:03:27.829> them

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
originally yellow I tried to dye them

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.439 
originally yellow I tried to dye them
black<00:03:28.310> but<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.000> went<00:03:29.419> badly<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:32.239> wheels

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
black but that went badly the the wheels

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.619 
black but that went badly the the wheels
almost<00:03:32.889> melted<00:03:34.150> actually<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.239> can<00:03:35.389> almost

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
almost melted actually you can almost

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.809 
almost melted actually you can almost
see<00:03:36.049> it's<00:03:36.199> they're<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.250> little<00:03:37.609> out<00:03:37.790> of

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
see it's they're just a little out of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.110 
see it's they're just a little out of
circle<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> quickly<00:03:40.069> got<00:03:40.400> him<00:03:40.549> out<00:03:40.699> of<00:03:40.730> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
circle so I quickly got him out of the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.589 
circle so I quickly got him out of the
dye<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.810> then<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.590> purple<00:03:42.949> dye<00:03:43.129> just<00:03:43.669> washed

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
dye and then the purple dye just washed

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.640 
dye and then the purple dye just washed
right<00:03:45.019> off<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.889> then<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.940> tried<00:03:47.239> a<00:03:47.269> couple<00:03:47.780> of

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
right off so then I tried a couple of

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.550 
right off so then I tried a couple of
other<00:03:48.769> things<00:03:49.299> no<00:03:50.299> good<00:03:50.569> so<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.019> ended<00:03:51.349> up<00:03:51.500> just

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
other things no good so I ended up just

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.009 
other things no good so I ended up just
cleaning<00:03:52.459> them<00:03:52.579> up<00:03:52.699> real<00:03:52.940> good<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.180> painting

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
cleaning them up real good and painting

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.439 
cleaning them up real good and painting
them<00:03:54.230> with<00:03:54.260> to<00:03:54.859> me<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> polycarbonate<00:03:55.849> purple<00:03:56.269> a

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
them with to me a polycarbonate purple a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.689 
them with to me a polycarbonate purple a
little<00:03:56.989> bit<00:03:57.440> different<00:03:57.829> than<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.099> body<00:03:58.310> but

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
little bit different than the body but

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:02.229 
little bit different than the body but
um<00:03:58.989> kind<00:03:59.989> of<00:04:00.079> still<00:04:00.290> matches<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.980> was<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.030> little

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
um kind of still matches I was a little

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.610 
um kind of still matches I was a little
skeptical<00:04:02.569> while<00:04:02.959> they're<00:04:03.169> at<00:04:03.319> while<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.500> was

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
skeptical while they're at while I was

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.589 
skeptical while they're at while I was
painting<00:04:03.889> but<00:04:04.190> it<00:04:04.310> turned<00:04:04.519> out<00:04:04.669> okay

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
painting but it turned out okay

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.140 
painting but it turned out okay
I<00:04:05.629> think<00:04:06.349> they<00:04:06.500> match<00:04:06.709> well<00:04:07.040> enough<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.639> I

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
I think they match well enough and I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.680 
I think they match well enough and I
like<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.690> look<00:04:08.810> up<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.859> wheels<00:04:10.220> are<00:04:10.690> another

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
like to look up the wheels are another

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.680 
like to look up the wheels are another
thing<00:04:12.229> that<00:04:12.470> I've<00:04:12.590> seen<00:04:12.799> with<00:04:13.400> then<00:04:13.639> with<00:04:14.449> the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
thing that I've seen with then with the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.539 
thing that I've seen with then with the
CCO<00:04:15.409> one<00:04:15.849> there<00:04:16.849> is<00:04:16.970> no<00:04:17.239> foam<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:17.989> them<00:04:18.549> which

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
CCO one there is no foam in them which

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.129 
CCO one there is no foam in them which
doesn't<00:04:20.120> seem<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.329> be<00:04:20.449> a<00:04:20.479> problem<00:04:20.750> at<00:04:21.019> this

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
doesn't seem to be a problem at this

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.370 
doesn't seem to be a problem at this
point<00:04:21.669> but<00:04:22.669> actually<00:04:23.270> these<00:04:23.510> wheels<00:04:23.870> actually

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
point but actually these wheels actually

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.160 
point but actually these wheels actually
aren't<00:04:24.560> even<00:04:24.830> glued<00:04:25.130> on<00:04:25.490> they<00:04:25.820> fit<00:04:26.060> tight<00:04:26.450> and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 
aren't even glued on they fit tight and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.510 
aren't even glued on they fit tight and
I<00:04:27.200> actually<00:04:27.350> don't<00:04:27.620> see<00:04:27.740> them<00:04:27.980> moving<00:04:28.220> or

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520
