00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that because this has been my split

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.789 
that because this has been my split
routine<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> past<00:01:27.750> year<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> year

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
routine for like the past year to a year

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.100 
routine for like the past year to a year
and<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> half<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.400> I've<00:01:29.520> been<00:01:29.610> doing<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and a half so I've been doing this and I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.760 
and a half so I've been doing this and I
would<00:01:31.650> say<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.189> almost<00:01:32.640> 60<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> 75%<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.650> my

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
would say that almost 60 to 75% of my

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.060 
would say that almost 60 to 75% of my
gains<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.490> been<00:01:35.520> within<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.270> split<00:01:37.070> within

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
gains have been within that split within

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.050 
gains have been within that split within
that<00:01:38.340> year<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> year<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> half<00:01:39.509> arm

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
that year to a year and a half arm

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.710 
that year to a year and a half arm
definitely<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.150> I've<00:01:42.210> been<00:01:42.360> training<00:01:42.689> for

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
definitely and I've been training for

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.280 
definitely and I've been training for
only<00:01:43.020> 3<00:01:43.320> years<00:01:43.560> 3<00:01:44.340> years<00:01:44.369> ago<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.049> first

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
only 3 years 3 years ago is when I first

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620 
only 3 years 3 years ago is when I first
started<00:01:46.590> lifting<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.430> think<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.939> firt<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
potential that I had I don't know I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.950 
potential that I had I don't know I
wasn't<00:02:18.370> getting<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.730> gains<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.540> was<00:02:19.780> I

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960

could have been reaching um I had some
lagging<00:02:22.420> points<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.020> thought<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.410> know

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
lagging points and I thought you know

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.310 
lagging points and I thought you know
what<00:02:23.740> why<00:02:24.340> not<00:02:24.370> put<00:02:24.910> my<00:02:25.180> lagging<00:02:25.570> points<00:02:25.990> give

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
what why not put my lagging points give

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.920 
what why not put my lagging points give

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.920 
everybody's body reacts differently to
what<00:03:24.580> they're<00:03:24.880> doing<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.360> workouts<00:03:25.720> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
what they're doing in the workouts that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.620 
what they're doing in the workouts that
they're<00:03:26.110> doing<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.710> with<00:03:27.100> me<00:03:27.370> a<00:03:27.640> seven-day

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
they're doing and with me a seven-day

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.450 
they're doing and with me a seven-day
split<00:03:28.960> is<00:03:29.140> what<00:03:29.500> makes<00:03:29.680> my<00:03:29.830> body<00:03:30.040> grow<00:03:30.340> the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
split is what makes my body grow the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.460 
split is what makes my body grow the
best<00:03:30.640> if<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.000> was<00:03:31.150> doing<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.480> three-day<00:03:31.900> split<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
best if I was doing a three-day split I

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.500 
best if I was doing a three-day split I
wouldn't<00:03:33.160> be<00:03:33.220> reaching<00:03:33.550> my<00:03:33.670> full<00:03:33.700> potential

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
wouldn't be reaching my full potential

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.690 
wouldn't be reaching my full potential
and<00:03:34.740> that's<00:03:35.740> what<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.010> want<00:03:36.250> people<00:03:36.610> to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
understand is that early on they need to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.400
