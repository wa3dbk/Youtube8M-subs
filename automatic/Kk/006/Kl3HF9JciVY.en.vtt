different way of holding the yarn maybe

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.300 
different way of holding the yarn maybe
they<00:01:57.289> have<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.469> slightly<00:01:57.859> different<00:01:58.130> way<00:01:58.249> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
binding off maybe they finish them

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.859 
binding off maybe they finish them
differently<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:01.069> if<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.340> have<00:02:01.549> a<00:02:01.719> number<00:02:02.719> of

you're<00:02:05.149> necessarily<00:02:05.389> going<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.319> get<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.499> little

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
you're necessarily going to get a little

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.010 
you're necessarily going to get a little
bit<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.009> variance<00:02:07.579> in<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.850> sizes<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:08.990> shapes

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
of the finished pieces and in something

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.420 
of the finished pieces and in something
like<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> blanket<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:12.980> something<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.340> a

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
like a blanket and something like a

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.670 
like a blanket and something like a
modular<00:02:14.000> blanket<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.930> really<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> have

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
modular blanket you really want to have

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.910 
modular blanket you really want to have
those<00:02:15.860> finished<00:02:16.190> pieces<00:02:16.520> be<00:02:16.819> as<00:02:17.680> identical<00:02:18.680> as

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
those finished pieces be as identical as

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
those finished pieces be as identical as
possible<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.850> limit<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.450> make<00:02:20.600> your<00:02:20.750> finishing

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
possible to limit to make your finishing

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.490 
possible to limit to make your finishing
as<00:02:21.290> smooth<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.950> could<00:02:22.160> be<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.170> i'm<00:02:24.170> going<00:02:24.410> to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
as smooth as it could be so i'm going to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.420 
as smooth as it could be so i'm going to
show<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.650> here<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.000> sort<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:26.990> our<00:02:27.470> 6<00:02:28.129> inch

show you here this is sort of our 6 inch
square<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.680> ideal<00:02:30.680> 6<00:02:31.040> inch<00:02:31.220> square<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.849> we

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
square are ideal 6 inch square that we

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:32.920 
square are ideal 6 inch square that we
want<00:02:32.180> but<00:02:32.689> we

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
want but we

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.289 
want but we
might<00:02:33.049> get<00:02:33.260> pieces<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.950> are<00:02:34.129> you<00:02:34.879> know<00:02:34.969> an

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
might get pieces that are you know an

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.420 
might get pieces that are you know an
inch<00:02:35.569> sort<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.959> short<00:02:36.500> on<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:36.980> end<00:02:37.159> or<00:02:37.310> you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
inch sort of short on one end or you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.009 
inch sort of short on one end or you
might<00:02:37.579> get<00:02:37.730> pieces<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.269> are<00:02:38.359> an<00:02:38.450> inch<00:02:38.599> short

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
might get pieces that are an inch short

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.959 
might get pieces that are an inch short
all<00:02:39.200> around<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:40.129> what<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.549> do<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.730> even

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
all around so what can you do to even

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.000 
all around so what can you do to even
them<00:02:41.150> up<00:02:41.359> well<00:02:41.599> one<00:02:42.109> thing<00:02:42.349> that<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.590> could<00:02:42.769> do

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
them up well one thing that you could do

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.479 
them up well one thing that you could do
is<00:02:43.510> try<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.540> even<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.109> out<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.409> blocking<00:02:45.739> you

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
is try to even it out in blocking you

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.220 
is try to even it out in blocking you
know<00:02:46.609> and<00:02:46.760> especially<00:02:47.030> with<00:02:47.599> natural<00:02:48.019> fiber

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
know and especially with natural fiber

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.410 
know and especially with natural fiber
yarns<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.859> wool<00:02:49.099> that<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.849> really<00:02:50.120> make<00:02:50.389> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
yarns like wool that can really make a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.020 
yarns like wool that can really make a
big<00:02:50.510> difference<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:52.189> second<00:02:52.609> thing<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:52.819> you

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
big difference the second thing that you

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.369 
big difference the second thing that you
could<00:02:53.180> do<00:02:53.389> is<00:02:53.540> actually<00:02:53.719> just<00:02:53.959> go<00:02:54.109> ahead<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
could do is actually just go ahead and

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.039 
could do is actually just go ahead and
add<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:55.010> some<00:02:55.310> knitting<00:02:55.549> so<00:02:56.239> for<00:02:56.659> example<00:02:56.719> on

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
add on some knitting so for example on

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.990 
add on some knitting so for example on
this<00:02:57.230> green<00:02:57.439> square<00:02:57.769> I'm<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.549> just<00:02:58.790> pick

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
this green square I'm going to just pick

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.429 
this green square I'm going to just pick
up<00:02:59.120> some<00:02:59.269> stitches<00:02:59.599> along<00:02:59.719> this<00:02:59.989> edge<00:03:00.049> and

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
up some stitches along this edge and

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.949 
up some stitches along this edge and
just<00:03:00.590> knit<00:03:00.829> another<00:03:01.250> inch<00:03:01.549> or<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:01.909> and<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.810> can

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
just knit another inch or so and you can

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.420 
just knit another inch or so and you can
do<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.379> color<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.650> matches<00:03:03.950> but<00:03:04.370> I

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
do it in a color that matches but I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.069 
do it in a color that matches but I
think<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.939> can<00:03:05.060> add<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.269> little<00:03:05.629> bit<00:03:05.870> a

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
think that it can add a little bit a

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.920 
think that it can add a little bit a
sort<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.650> organic<00:03:07.629> creativity<00:03:08.629> to<00:03:08.810> your

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
sort of organic creativity to your

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.929 
sort of organic creativity to your
blanket<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.530> use<00:03:09.950> another<00:03:10.220> contrast<00:03:10.730> color

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
blanket to use another contrast color

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.580 
blanket to use another contrast color
here<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.209> so<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:12.019> for<00:03:12.109> a<00:03:12.169> quick<00:03:12.349> refresher

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
here and so just for a quick refresher

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.890 
here and so just for a quick refresher
in<00:03:12.950> picking<00:03:13.280> up<00:03:13.370> stitches<00:03:13.609> I'm<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.569> going<00:03:14.780> to

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
in picking up stitches I'm just going to

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.500 
in picking up stitches I'm just going to
show<00:03:15.889> you<00:03:15.950> hear<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.519> all<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.879> want<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.269> is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
show you hear that all you want to do is

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.940 
show you hear that all you want to do is
look<00:03:18.500> for<00:03:18.560> your<00:03:18.950> bind<00:03:19.250> off<00:03:19.489> loops<00:03:20.829> insert<00:03:21.829> your

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
look for your bind off loops insert your

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.920 
look for your bind off loops insert your
needle<00:03:23.349> in<00:03:24.370> through<00:03:26.139> those<00:03:27.139> two<00:03:27.469> loops<00:03:27.680> wrap

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
needle in through those two loops wrap

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.690 
needle in through those two loops wrap
your<00:03:29.930> yarn<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.819> then<00:03:31.819> pull<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.359> through<00:03:32.540> and

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
your yarn and then pull it through and

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.809 
your yarn and then pull it through and
you<00:03:34.700> can<00:03:34.849> do<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:36.069> for<00:03:37.069> every<00:03:37.310> single<00:03:37.609> bind

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
you can do that for every single bind

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.460 
you can do that for every single bind
off<00:03:37.970> stitch<00:03:38.239> and<00:03:38.629> then<00:03:38.659> you<00:03:39.049> would<00:03:39.169> just<00:03:39.199> go

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
off stitch and then you would just go

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.710 
off stitch and then you would just go
ahead<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:39.979> pick<00:03:40.519> up<00:03:40.669> all<00:03:40.909> along<00:03:41.269> this<00:03:41.479> edge

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
ahead and pick up all along this edge

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.360 
ahead and pick up all along this edge
and<00:03:42.019> then<00:03:42.650> you<00:03:42.799> could<00:03:42.949> knit<00:03:43.129> in<00:03:43.220> whatever

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
and then you could knit in whatever

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.920 
and then you could knit in whatever
fancy<00:03:43.729> stitch<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.239> want<00:03:44.269> it<00:03:44.569> or<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.720> could

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
fancy stitch you want it or you could

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.420 
fancy stitch you want it or you could
match<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.290> pattern<00:03:45.680> or<00:03:45.919> you<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.129> keep<00:03:46.280> it

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
match the pattern or you can keep it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.399 
match the pattern or you can keep it
very<00:03:46.579> subtle<00:03:47.000> with<00:03:47.569> just<00:03:48.139> a<00:03:48.229> plain

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
very subtle with just a plain

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.429 
very subtle with just a plain
stockinette<00:03:48.680> stitch<00:03:48.979> or<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> garter<00:03:49.699> stitch<00:03:50.439> so

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 
stockinette stitch or a garter stitch so

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.679 
stockinette stitch or a garter stitch so
that's<00:03:51.680> pretty<00:03:51.979> straightforward<00:03:52.310> if<00:03:53.000> you

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
that's pretty straightforward if you

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.990 
that's pretty straightforward if you
have<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> piece<00:03:54.290> that's<00:03:54.590> short<00:03:55.099> on<00:03:55.250> both<00:03:55.609> sides

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
have a piece that's short on both sides

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.599 
have a piece that's short on both sides
I'll<00:03:56.659> compare<00:03:57.560> this<00:03:57.709> pink<00:03:57.979> squared<00:03:58.340> to<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
I'll compare this pink squared to the

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.280 
I'll compare this pink squared to the
yellow<00:03:58.879> square<00:03:59.239> if<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.870> have<00:03:59.959> a<00:03:59.989> piece<00:04:00.169> that's

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
yellow square if you have a piece that's

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.020 
yellow square if you have a piece that's
short<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.650> both<00:04:00.889> sides<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.609> have<00:04:01.639> a<00:04:01.790> choice

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
short on both sides you have a choice

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.960 
short on both sides you have a choice
you<00:04:02.090> can<00:04:02.419> either<00:04:02.479> pick<00:04:02.900> up<00:04:03.109> stitches<00:04:03.349> along

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
you can either pick up stitches along

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.920 
you can either pick up stitches along
this<00:04:04.970> edge<00:04:05.269> and<00:04:05.599> and<00:04:06.639> this<00:04:07.639> edge<00:04:07.879> so<00:04:08.569> going<00:04:08.810> in

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
this edge and and this edge so going in

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.960 
this edge and and this edge so going in
this<00:04:09.049> direction<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.370> direction<00:04:10.729> and

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
this direction to this direction and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.550 
this direction to this direction and
then<00:04:11.120> work<00:04:11.269> back<00:04:11.509> and<00:04:11.689> forth<00:04:11.750> mitering<00:04:12.319> this

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
then work back and forth mitering this

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.490 
then work back and forth mitering this
corner<00:04:12.859> out<00:04:13.009> or<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:14.120> could<00:04:14.389> knit<00:04:15.019> all<00:04:15.199> the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
corner out or you could knit all the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.259 
corner out or you could knit all the
pick<00:04:15.769> up<00:04:15.889> stitches<00:04:16.070> all<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.549> way<00:04:16.669> around<00:04:16.820> and

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
pick up stitches all the way around and

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.210 
pick up stitches all the way around and
then<00:04:17.299> might<00:04:17.750> are<00:04:17.870> all<00:04:18.049> four<00:04:18.380> corners<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:18.949> knit

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
then might are all four corners and knit

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.949 
then might are all four corners and knit
in<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.340> round<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.820> in<00:04:20.269> order<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.539> do<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.900> you

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
in the round and in order to do that you

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.629 
in the round and in order to do that you
could<00:04:21.259> use<00:04:21.380> either<00:04:21.409> double<00:04:22.009> pointed<00:04:22.310> needles

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
could use either double pointed needles

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.659 
could use either double pointed needles
and<00:04:23.349> you<00:04:24.349> would<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:24.650> this<00:04:24.860> exactly<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.490> same

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
and you would do this exactly the same

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.670 
and you would do this exactly the same
way<00:04:25.849> you<00:04:26.539> would<00:04:26.630> just<00:04:26.840> pick<00:04:26.990> up<00:04:27.139> in<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> bind

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
way you would just pick up in the bind

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.410 
way you would just pick up in the bind
off<00:04:27.830> loops<00:04:28.130> with<00:04:28.370> your<00:04:28.490> contrast<00:04:28.880> color

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.050 

and<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.140> on<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:35.400> would<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.520> pick<00:04:35.790> up<00:04:35.940> on

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
and so on and you would just pick up on

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.520 
and so on and you would just pick up on
all<00:04:36.270> four<00:04:36.510> sides<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:37.110> then<00:04:37.320> you<00:04:37.440> would

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
all four sides and then you would

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.930 
all four sides and then you would
increase<00:04:37.890> at<00:04:38.040> each<00:04:38.160> corner<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.670> make<00:04:38.790> sure

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
increase at each corner to make sure

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.990 
increase at each corner to make sure
that<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> are<00:04:39.270> maintaining<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.870> square<00:04:40.200> shape

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
that you are maintaining a square shape

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.310 
that you are maintaining a square shape
so<00:04:42.000> once<00:04:42.300> all<00:04:42.480> your<00:04:42.630> pieces<00:04:42.810> are<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.290> same

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
so once all your pieces are the same

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.890 
so once all your pieces are the same
size<00:04:43.800> how<00:04:44.520> do<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.760> put<00:04:44.940> them<00:04:45.030> together<00:04:45.150> well

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
size how do you put them together well

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.100 
size how do you put them together well
there<00:04:46.200> are<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.350> couple<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.740> different<00:04:47.070> ways<00:04:47.100> and

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
there are a couple of different ways and

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.150 
there are a couple of different ways and
obviously<00:04:49.110> you<00:04:49.230> know<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.590> mattress<00:04:49.980> stitch

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
obviously you know the mattress stitch

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.470 
obviously you know the mattress stitch
is<00:04:50.340> one<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:50.610> first<00:04:50.820> things<00:04:50.910> that<00:04:51.120> we<00:04:51.270> learn

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
is one of the first things that we learn

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.300 
is one of the first things that we learn
as<00:04:52.080> knitters<00:04:52.470> who<00:04:52.620> are<00:04:52.710> learning<00:04:52.830> about<00:04:53.040> how

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
as knitters who are learning about how

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.240 
as knitters who are learning about how
to<00:04:53.370> finish<00:04:53.580> our<00:04:53.850> garments<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:56.010> order<00:04:56.160> to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
to finish our garments and in order to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.220 
to finish our garments and in order to
do<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.670> you<00:04:56.910> want<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> kind<00:04:57.390> of<00:04:57.510> match<00:04:57.690> up<00:04:58.020> the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
do that you want to kind of match up the

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.720 
do that you want to kind of match up the
two<00:04:58.530> bottom<00:04:58.800> corners<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.580> your<00:04:59.790> knitting<00:05:00.110> and

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
two bottom corners of your knitting and

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.600 
two bottom corners of your knitting and
then<00:05:02.730> you're<00:05:02.880> going<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.830> stay<00:05:04.830> within<00:05:05.100> this

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
then you're going to stay within this

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.170 
then you're going to stay within this
kind<00:05:05.910> of<00:05:05.970> one<00:05:06.330> stitch<00:05:07.200> edge<00:05:10.940> you're<00:05:11.940> going<00:05:12.120> to

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
kind of one stitch edge you're going to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.580 
kind of one stitch edge you're going to
pick<00:05:12.390> up<00:05:12.540> two<00:05:13.820> horizontal<00:05:14.820> bars<00:05:15.380> from<00:05:16.380> one

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
pick up two horizontal bars from one

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.390 
pick up two horizontal bars from one
piece<00:05:17.030> pull<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.180> yarn<00:05:18.360> through<00:05:20.750> and<00:05:22.400> then

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
piece pull the yarn through and then

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.700 
piece pull the yarn through and then
pick<00:05:23.640> up<00:05:23.790> to<00:05:24.210> corresponding<00:05:25.140> horizontal<00:05:25.710> bars

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
pick up to corresponding horizontal bars

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.070 
pick up to corresponding horizontal bars
hopefully<00:05:28.710> you<00:05:28.770> can<00:05:28.890> see<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.250> there<00:05:29.490> and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
hopefully you can see that there and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.920 
hopefully you can see that there and
pull<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.200> yarn<00:05:31.410> through<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:33.630> would<00:05:33.750> keep

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
pull the yarn through and you would keep

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.920 
pull the yarn through and you would keep
doing<00:05:34.290> this<00:05:34.440> all<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:36.240> way<00:05:37.080> up<00:05:37.670> and<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.900> course

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
doing this all the way up and of course

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.660 
doing this all the way up and of course
I'm<00:05:40.170> using<00:05:40.350> a<00:05:40.440> contrasting<00:05:40.800> color<00:05:40.980> so<00:05:41.580> that

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
I'm using a contrasting color so that

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.850 
I'm using a contrasting color so that
you<00:05:41.760> can<00:05:41.910> see<00:05:42.060> this<00:05:42.180> really<00:05:42.390> clearly<00:05:42.840> but<00:05:43.620> you

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you can see this really clearly but you

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.260
