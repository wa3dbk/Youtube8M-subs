00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
my own and I usually end up using dollar

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.340 
my own and I usually end up using dollar
tree<00:06:21.310> items<00:06:21.610> thrifted<00:06:22.060> items<00:06:22.390> found<00:06:23.050> items

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
tree items thrifted items found items

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.290 
tree items thrifted items found items
are<00:06:23.680> like<00:06:23.800> common<00:06:24.190> household<00:06:24.640> items<00:06:25.120> so

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
are like common household items so

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.150 
are like common household items so
they're<00:06:25.450> very<00:06:25.480> affordable<00:06:26.290> and<00:06:26.590> it's<00:06:26.980> just

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
they're very affordable and it's just

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.860 
they're very affordable and it's just
something<00:06:27.520> that<00:06:27.700> I<00:06:28.060> think<00:06:28.180> is<00:06:28.480> so<00:06:28.690> much<00:06:28.840> easier

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
something that I think is so much easier

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.260 
something that I think is so much easier
to<00:06:29.380> do<00:06:29.560> than<00:06:30.010> buying<00:06:30.430> things<00:06:30.820> from<00:06:30.910> stores

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
to do than buying things from stores

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.000 
to do than buying things from stores
because<00:06:31.420> they're<00:06:31.630> usually<00:06:31.960> very<00:06:32.170> overpriced

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
because they're usually very overpriced

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.910 
because they're usually very overpriced
so<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.090> next<00:06:34.270> video<00:06:34.750> that<00:06:35.140> I<00:06:35.170> will<00:06:35.590> have<00:06:35.770> will

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
so the next video that I will have will

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.330
