00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
do you think about this interesting I

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.420 
do you think about this interesting I
think<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.360> interesting<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.440> I'm<00:00:44.070> very

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
think it is interesting I think I'm very

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.139 
think it is interesting I think I'm very
skeptical<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.690> think<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.370> lot<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.120> go

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
skeptical I think that a lot can go

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
skeptical I think that a lot can go
wrong<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.870> you're<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.559> very

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
wrong and you're going to be very

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
wrong and you're going to be very
limited<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.879> what<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.050> eat

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
limited in what you can do and and eat

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830 
limited in what you can do and and eat
and<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.280> course<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.699> who's<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:53.910> recipes

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and of course like who's in recipes

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
and of course like who's in recipes
though<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.070> what<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.610> entire

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
though that's what your what your entire

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
though that's what your what your entire
kitchen<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.050> be<00:00:58.199> geared<00:00:58.530> towards

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
kitchen has to be geared towards

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
kitchen has to be geared towards
allowing<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.430> robot<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.090> its<00:01:00.270> thing<00:01:00.359> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
allowing this robot to do its thing and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.299 
allowing this robot to do its thing and
that<00:01:00.809> may<00:01:00.960> mean<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.800> makes<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.190> hard

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
that may mean that it makes it very hard

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
that may mean that it makes it very hard
for<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> cook<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.270> own<00:01:03.510> kitchen<00:01:03.750> may

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
for you to cook in your own kitchen may

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
for you to cook in your own kitchen may
be<00:01:04.650> impossible<00:01:05.339> it's<00:01:06.119> possible<00:01:06.180> yeah<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> mean

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
be impossible it's possible yeah I mean

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
be impossible it's possible yeah I mean
the<00:01:07.110> robotic<00:01:07.650> hands<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.490> 20<00:01:08.850> motors<00:01:09.210> 24

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the robotic hands will have 20 motors 24

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
the robotic hands will have 20 motors 24
joins<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> 129<00:01:10.979> sensors<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> super

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
joins and 129 sensors it's like a super

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.780 
joins and 129 sensors it's like a super
involved<00:01:12.750> intricate<00:01:13.320> robot<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
involved intricate robot and maybe the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
involved intricate robot and maybe the
infrastructure<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.810> which<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.680> has<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> be

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
infrastructure on which it has to be

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.590 
infrastructure on which it has to be
built<00:01:17.310> would<00:01:17.580> make<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.330> kitchen

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
built would make it so that this kitchen

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109 
built would make it so that this kitchen
is<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.439> easy<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.979> use<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
is not too easy to use if you want to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.990 
is not too easy to use if you want to
manually<00:01:21.689> cook<00:01:22.140> something<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.490> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
manually cook something I think that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
manually cook something I think that
that<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.330> probably<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> case<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that would probably be the case now it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.770 
that would probably be the case now it
is<00:01:26.159> interesting<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.119> wonder<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.479> much<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
is interesting and I wonder how much it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
is interesting and I wonder how much it
would<00:01:28.020> cost<00:01:28.610> is<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
would cost is it going to be

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.289 
would cost is it going to be
cost-effective<00:01:31.700> should<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.119> out

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
cost-effective should you just go out

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.719 
cost-effective should you just go out
and<00:01:33.329> eat<00:01:33.600> instead<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.890> know<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.340> think

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and eat instead but you know I think

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.649 
and eat instead but you know I think
that<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> Americans<00:01:37.409> have

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
that a lot of Americans have

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.749 
that a lot of Americans have
unfortunately<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.960> learned<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.650> cook<00:01:41.430> not

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
unfortunately not learned to cook not

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.060 
unfortunately not learned to cook not
spend<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> time<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> kitchen<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.470> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
spend a lot of time in the kitchen and I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590 
spend a lot of time in the kitchen and I
don't<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.610> making<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.000> any<00:01:45.180> better<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
don't see this making it any better I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330 
don't see this making it any better I
mean<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.439> think<00:01:46.770> everyone<00:01:46.860> should

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
mean I think I think everyone should

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
mean I think I think everyone should
know<00:01:47.369> how<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.729> cook<00:01:47.820> yeah<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.509> course<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
know how to cook yeah of course and I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
know how to cook yeah of course and I
enjoy<00:01:49.530> cooking<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.159> sometimes<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.149> it's

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
enjoy cooking but sometimes it is it's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.330 
enjoy cooking but sometimes it is it's
it's<00:01:51.689> getting<00:01:51.899> late<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.680> schedule<00:01:53.159> gets

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
it's getting late and my schedule gets

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.280 
it's getting late and my schedule gets
all<00:01:53.579> mixed<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.540> home<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
all mixed up and when I get home it is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.620 
all mixed up and when I get home it is
more<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:55.920> easier<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.670> order<00:01:57.000> delivery

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
more it is easier to order delivery

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.800 
more it is easier to order delivery
through<00:01:57.899> seamless<00:01:58.439> or<00:01:58.560> something<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.040> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
through seamless or something like that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.730 
through seamless or something like that
so<00:02:00.810> maybe<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.409> an<00:02:01.530> interesting

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
so maybe this is an interesting

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.709 
so maybe this is an interesting
alternative<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.670> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> obvious<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
alternative it is kind of obvious to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.209 
alternative it is kind of obvious to
expect<00:02:04.290> stuff<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.950> though<00:02:05.189> right

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
expect stuff like this though right

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.670 
expect stuff like this though right
intelligent<00:02:06.030> homes<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:06.960> control<00:02:07.469> your

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
intelligent homes you can control your

intelligent homes you can control your

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.220 
remotely via mobile applications we've
had<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.720> room

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
had the room

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.280 
had the room
robotic<00:02:14.099> vacuums<00:02:14.640> for<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> long<00:02:15.239> time<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.930> don't

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
robotic vacuums for a long time I don't

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.070 
robotic vacuums for a long time I don't
think<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.890> this<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.510> people<00:02:18.510> push<00:02:18.780> back

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
think that this is people push back

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.070 
think that this is people push back
against<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.769> veracity<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:21.080> automatic

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
against the veracity of automatic

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.009 
against the veracity of automatic
autonomous<00:02:22.920> vehicles<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:24.510> still<00:02:24.810> think

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
autonomous vehicles and I still think

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.059 
autonomous vehicles and I still think
that<00:02:25.080> eventually<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.709> something<00:02:25.950> we're

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
that eventually it's something we're

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.740 
that eventually it's something we're
going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:26.940> seems<00:02:27.269> like<00:02:27.390> something

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
going to have this seems like something

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960 
going to have this seems like something
far<00:02:28.230> more<00:02:28.260> obvious<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> home<00:02:29.670> will

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
far more obvious that the home will

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.790 
far more obvious that the home will
become<00:02:30.120> increasingly<00:02:30.870> automated<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
become increasingly automated in the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.270 
become increasingly automated in the
next<00:02:32.040> five<00:02:32.250> years<00:02:32.989> probably<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.349> would<00:02:35.010> much

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
next five years probably I would much

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.140 
next five years probably I would much
rather<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.269> Star<00:02:36.690> Trek<00:02:36.720> type<00:02:37.290> food

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
rather see that Star Trek type food

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.820 
rather see that Star Trek type food
creation<00:02:39.150> system<00:02:39.510> that's<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> mater

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
creation system that's like a mater

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.009 
creation system that's like a mater
compiler<00:02:41.610> right<00:02:41.849> we're<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.569> just<00:02:42.750> build

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
compiler right we're and just build

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.170 
compiler right we're and just build
stuff<00:02:43.379> from<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.830> ground<00:02:44.099> up<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
stuff from the ground up at the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.809 
stuff from the ground up at the
molecular<00:02:45.510> level<00:02:45.830> right<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.519> we<00:02:47.670> have

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
molecular level right I think we have

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.670 
molecular level right I think we have
obviously<00:02:48.569> very<00:02:48.750> far<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.410> technology

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
obviously very far from that technology

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.280 
obviously very far from that technology
however<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.760> would<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.780> would<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:52.049> much

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
however that would be that would be much

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.800 
however that would be that would be much
better<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.890> ok<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.790> know<00:02:53.910> I'd<00:02:54.030> love<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.450> I

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
better but ok you know I'd love to I

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.750 
better but ok you know I'd love to I
would<00:02:55.260> eat<00:02:55.380> a<00:02:55.410> meal<00:02:55.680> created<00:02:56.130> by<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.430> robot

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
would eat a meal created by this robot

do you welcome this general type of

do you welcome this general type of

technological change I mean aside from
you<00:03:01.440> would<00:03:01.590> eat<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.799> meal<00:03:02.099> do<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.760> welcome

you would eat the meal do you welcome
the<00:03:03.420> further<00:03:03.720> automation<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.799> use<00:03:04.980> of

the further automation and use of

the further automation and use of
technology<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:05.910> homes<00:03:06.180> or<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:06.630> worry<00:03:06.900> like

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
technology in homes or do you worry like

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.479 
technology in homes or do you worry like
some<00:03:07.440> people<00:03:07.709> do<00:03:07.799> with<00:03:07.950> every<00:03:08.160> new<00:03:08.280> technology

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
some people do with every new technology

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.870 
some people do with every new technology
that<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> can<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.840> used<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.500> commit<00:03:11.040> crimes<00:03:11.519> or

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
that it can be used to commit crimes or

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.990 
that it can be used to commit crimes or
to<00:03:12.030> somehow<00:03:12.329> hurt<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.840> homeowner<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:14.000> probably

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to somehow hurt the homeowner I probably

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.580 
to somehow hurt the homeowner I probably
could<00:03:15.360> hurt<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.630> homeowner<00:03:15.989> but<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.290> still

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
could hurt the homeowner but I still

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.289 
could hurt the homeowner but I still
support<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.099> I<00:03:17.250> think<00:03:17.310> we<00:03:17.609> are<00:03:17.730> advancing

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
support this I think we are advancing

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.569 
support this I think we are advancing
and<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.569> is<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.829> step<00:03:19.829> that<00:03:20.010> we<00:03:20.130> need<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.400> take

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
and this is a step that we need to take

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.460 
and this is a step that we need to take
to<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.940> that<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.630> while<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.900> would<00:03:22.290> not

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
to do that and so while I would not

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.460 
to do that and so while I would not
purchase<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.819> these<00:03:23.970> robot<00:03:24.359> chefs<00:03:24.690> yes<00:03:25.260> I

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
purchase one of these robot chefs yes I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.340 
purchase one of these robot chefs yes I
do<00:03:25.709> support<00:03:26.160> it
