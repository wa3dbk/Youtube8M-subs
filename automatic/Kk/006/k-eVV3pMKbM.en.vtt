in order to get to that I removed which
normally<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.710> go<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.250> intake

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
normally would go to the intake

frame<00:02:09.780> rail<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.830> once<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.250> those<00:02:11.430> out

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
frame rail so once you have those out

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.300 
frame rail so once you have those out
you<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.090> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
you got a little bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.770 
you got a little bit
more<00:02:12.400> working<00:02:12.760> room<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.150> should<00:02:13.360> be<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> little

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
more working room and should be a little

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.559 
more working room and should be a little
bit<00:02:14.010> smoother<00:02:15.010> from<00:02:15.190> here<00:02:15.520> okay<00:02:16.180> next<00:02:16.390> thing

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569

place of the factory oh you got the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.060 
place of the factory oh you got the
battery<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.190> got<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.579> clamp<00:04:18.850> on<00:04:19.000> top<00:04:19.299> I

battery in I got the clamp on top I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
battery in I got the clamp on top I
coolant<00:04:21.070> reservoir<00:04:21.190> in<00:04:21.700> there<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.060> just

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
coolant reservoir in there and it just

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.420 
coolant reservoir in there and it just
slides<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:22.659> in<00:04:22.990> make<00:04:23.740> sure<00:04:23.890> your<00:04:24.070> battery

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
slides right in make sure your battery

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.650 
slides right in make sure your battery
terminals<00:04:24.940> are<00:04:25.030> nice<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.360> tight

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
terminals are nice and tight

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.090 
terminals are nice and tight
before<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.170> do<00:04:26.350> anything<00:04:26.530> else<00:04:26.740> because<00:04:27.010> you

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
before you do anything else because you

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.620 
before you do anything else because you
probably<00:04:27.250> won't<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:27.610> access<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:28.030> a<00:04:28.180> master

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
probably won't have access to a master

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.070 
probably won't have access to a master
and<00:04:29.580> once<00:04:30.580> again<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:30.910> put<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> positive<00:04:31.450> on<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
and once again I put the positive on the

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080 
and once again I put the positive on the
driver's<00:04:32.440> side<00:04:32.470> negative<00:04:33.340> on<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.700> other<00:04:33.820> side

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
driver's side negative on the other side

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.880 
driver's side negative on the other side
because<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.480> just<00:04:34.660> worked<00:04:34.840> better<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.350> didn't

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
because it just worked better I didn't

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.320 
because it just worked better I didn't
want<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.130> stretch<00:04:36.400> or<00:04:36.610> kink<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:36.940> cable<00:04:37.240> or

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
want to stretch or kink the cable or

lower

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.640 

I'm<00:05:39.759> gonna<00:05:40.030> smash<00:05:40.689> some<00:05:40.960> gears<00:05:41.229> out<00:05:41.409> right

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
I'm gonna smash some gears out right

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.350 
I'm gonna smash some gears out right
here<00:05:41.860> hopefully<00:05:42.759> you<00:05:42.789> can<00:05:42.909> get<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.090> good

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
here hopefully you can get a good

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.080 
here hopefully you can get a good
indication<00:05:44.319> of<00:05:44.500> what<00:05:44.560> it<00:05:44.740> sounds<00:05:44.889> like

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
indication of what it sounds like

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.570 
indication of what it sounds like
VTEC<00:05:46.719> crossover<00:05:47.349> is<00:05:47.469> pretty<00:05:47.710> aggressive<00:05:47.919> so

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
VTEC crossover is pretty aggressive so

00:05:48.580 --> 00:06:30.159 
VTEC crossover is pretty aggressive so
here<00:05:48.939> it<00:05:49.030> goes

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:32.199 

Oh
