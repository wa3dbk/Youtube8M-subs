00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:11.300
 greeting continuing video parsing 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:14.099
 the boxes that I had shattered at 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.869
 race on the race 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:27.140
 402 meters in total box already I 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:29.300
 cut him apart from what I saw 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.680
 halted 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:41.790
 box all bye-bye 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:46.010
 laid out but I see so far all 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.440
 gears like a whole whole 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:54.410
 switch kinematics as it were all on 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.770
 place backing gear even all 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:05.309
 I do not see any chips 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:08.490
 I see nothing without it, but now 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.490
 I see it all bolts in place 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.860
 so this is not bolts unscrew now I'm 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.840
 I will shoot these all my head 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.170
 unscrew these plugs 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.110
 switching speeds and from this from 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.110
 the star behind which is 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 differential 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:45.470
 need to watch something so well I shot 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 shafts good condition 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:53.189
 no slaughter dents mean bullshit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.259
 There are no bushes synchronizers like 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:05.630
 have a whole look now here 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:16.160
 about stamping so took gear look 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:20.430
 the axis itself is broken and here is a piece of it 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:24.780
 fell off you can't see it 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 Here are the serious things he did 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:34.880
 banged here here and for doing more by 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:40.280
 bolt head so much from him yet 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.280
 snap ring now look here 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.160
 asterisks 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:53.819
 differential wear bit too 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:57.950
 It was a good axis so I can not yet 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:02.280
 stick out one hand 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.760
 just another shoots but everyone needs 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.760
 now buy this one this one 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.549
 gear differential put everything on 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.549
 place box to brew with argon brew 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.370
 the whole thing and will collect box 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.609
 lay in stock 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.290
 no matter how strong the consequences 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.090
 happened box restore i think 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.630
 can 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.630
 but that's all good luck for now
