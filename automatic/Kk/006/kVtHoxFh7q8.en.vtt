00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 because he questions how their inclusion is 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.080
 I bring you how to install the shaders to 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.870
 I'm sorry I took so long this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.550
 one thing I want to clarify is that it is not 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 need to have a supercomputer 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 to be able to run the shaders this with 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.260
 have a computer about 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.449
 how many three years to this I think that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.460
 yes you can run the shaders this one 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 be minimally good obviously if 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.859
 you have a netbook that will be loaded in the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.779
 super 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.310
 obviously you're not going to be a bastard 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.529
 it's not going to run you so not even 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 think about installing those shaders 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 then you know this the only thing 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.239
 we're going to need are these two files 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.920
 that we have here that are java this one at 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.320
 moment to download them is going to tell you that 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.360
 maybe it damages the computer but there's no 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 no problem are not downloaded from 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 official forum then there is no 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 problem please ignore everything be 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 Of course I have so let's go 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.379
 starting we will not see here here 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.989
 I have both this the two pages where 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.969
 they are going to download the two files 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.489
 this in this case I'm going to close 1.6 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.260
 point 4 as you can notice but it works 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.560
 for newer versions not so so no 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.020
 there is no problem 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.180
 will continue and will continue very well 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.979
 they work very well this tutorial no no 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.479
 there's no problem well let's 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.450
 download it here we will lower the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.039
 mod shaders first good we're going to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.720
 be first what is the fox and what 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.700
 It is the first thing that you have to download 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 install so we're going to download in 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.240
 this case is from the version in which 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.850
 you want to install it in this case it's going to be 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.799
 the 1.6 point 4 always download in the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.320
 never recommended the newest always 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.380
 download in the recommended this one go down 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.110
 this is this the installer in this 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.640
 case I have it so this one here 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.860
 I'm going to leave him not just give him in 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.450
 download installer remember that you have 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.130
 that being the installer does not have to 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.200
 to be something else has to be the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.439
 installer the installer since then they 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.479
 will save a lot of time this 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.700
 again here you will receive a click here 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.979
 in to download the shaders mod the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.319
 send to another page and download here 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.399
 where it is here is downloaded 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.950
 similarly it was dismounted equally 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.780
 they are going to send you the fly here 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.160
 they give to continue and they download that is 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.940
 all already having these two files 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.680
 they give the installer double click to this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.960
 that is already going to simply double-click 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.790
 is going to open this little window and 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.530
 They give accept to install the client 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.480
 help I have it so I do not want to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.520
 that there is conflict and that shit be done 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.410
 to my minecraft then this is what 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.960
 let's just leave they should accept 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.510
 install client never server this 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.580
 simple always on customer lamented me 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 speak I do not know what happens to me no no no no no 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.320
 I can say words I do not know what's wrong with me 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.200
 Well then and now is not installed 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.930
 just give this one to the molds now 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.520
 they are just going to run is now 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.620
 same I'm in windows 8 I do not know that I do not 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.510
 I agree how the others are this but 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.360
 well you know how to execute not just 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.160
 execute give you adapt not percent 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.580
 apt is percent give you to accept 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.940
 send them here when roaming here open the 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.070
 point folder minecraft and be in mode 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.030
 if there is no folder that is memos 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:12.000
 create an east and here they put this what 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.230
 which is the mod leaders, we do not have it here 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.750
 we just put it here 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.580
 we already have the shaders right now 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.349
 we have no package of shaders 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.659
 there is only the mod 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.299
 then it does not come with any shader or 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.739
 nothing then now just install 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.870
 the shaders what we have here the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.310
 shaders folder packs not me like 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.190
 you can see we already have a loading dock 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.310
 shaders but then this to download 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.680
 right here where but what happened there 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.010
 right here on the first page that that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.750
 I sent them this they go down and here 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.209
 down you get the shaders packs like 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.470
 you can notice here there is everything there from 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.019
 the more this with pendejada and average as 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 with the most basic for computers not 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.680
 very with many resources not 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.420
 so I do have a very good 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.390
 computer I highly recommend 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.840
 the sil tours this I recommend it a lot 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.569
 if they have a good computer but this one 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.930
 I recommend the sonic and diverse as 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 say this one they go here and they give him here 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.419
 we have 3.2 even if it says 1.6 point 2 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.760
 works perfectly good I do not know by 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.280
 what sent me here, I think that the 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.990
 links are wrong but well I tell them if 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.210
 has good computer down Hindus 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.919
 lower this if you have a very good 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.500
 computer and if you have a computer 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.419
 normal and work this sonic but what 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.040
 another egg that there is a very good one but I 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.750
 agreement which one for example this one 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.540
 works for almost any computer 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.220
 that is minimally good this and also 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.710
 this name is that he did not locate them by the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.900
 first name 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.490
 but this is a bit advanced this 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.960
 it's like a good caricature and you 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.450
 they can see which one is 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.950
 like they install they weigh very little 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.900
 notice this is the most advanced of all 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.140
 and see how much it weighs I want it to 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.360
 Set how much a stray pack weighs 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.670
 undo does not weigh practically anything 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.870
 so I think it weighs about a kilo 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.280
 white I think I'm not sure good 23 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.800
 kilobytes but there are some that weigh like 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.660
 10 kilobytes or you're shit that's not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.850
 nothing of maybe you are on your computer 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.250
 you forget to forget it I do not know is 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.750
 that is nothing that and I tell you since what 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.310
 download here then for example since 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.600
 download it only put in this one 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.000
 put in the package that in this case that 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.520
 is the package what do you put in the shaders pack 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.950
 not here I do this and the new thing to the 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.850
 shaders packs good what but I'm going to 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.850
 download how stupid 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:38.919
 and open up and there we are there we put it and 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.479
 already the xeresa package is going to be 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.580
 when it will be in the minecraft removes 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.620
 I'm going to show you this we open minecraft 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.660
 already to finish I think that same or 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.820
 long the video I'm sorry 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.890
 but I always like to explain this well 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.380
 I do not like to explain how crazy 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.380
 let's force who can you 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.840
 select for zion profile this choose 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.490
 for if they fix that says this the version 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.990
 that they have downloaded to the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.840
 force not here are fixed in this case is 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.240
 of 1.6 point 4 as they give you accept it 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.970
 dan play this wait moments for 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.670
 to open and without any problem 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.009
 they must have him 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.229
 he collapsed 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.919
 this is opening how nice as 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.439
 Afternoon cabrona put him and there we are 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:27.729
 now we go in options and here we have 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:29.469
 this new icon or this new one is 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.300
 you give click and as you can see here 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.219
 we have all the packages of shaders 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.990
 obviously if I tell them they have nothing 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.470
 Well, he's just going to say non 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.660
 internal 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.550
 and well, here you only choose 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.140
 the shaders that want the 6 packets 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.790
 who want to obviously have to 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.340
 install those of those who want 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.540
 impossible trying little by little and know 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.450
 which one do better with your 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.280
 computer which they like more and others 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:53.570
 so then, well, I'm going to leave 

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.910
 this here so I hope there will be 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.910
 liked and see you until next time
