00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.849
 release 3 they will be out of here so I took 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.480

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.480

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.080
 and diamonds 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.830
 Today I will review the beer corona 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.940
 extra 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.410
 Here are a lot of people asked to do it with 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.750
 there are lovers among our subscribers 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.160
 this beer although beer probably called 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.290
 it's wrong that the label 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.410
 written beer drink 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.100
 However, in the beer market it is the brand 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.400
 crowns 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.440
 caron by the way from mexican beer now 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.620
 send a separate talk to the crown 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.129
 included in the top 5 most popular brands 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.589
 beer is generally on the market in the world and in general 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.930
 almost the very first in level 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.990
 beer consumption in the United States that is amerikos 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.570
 loves the crown though i drink mexican here 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.460
 as you know mexicans for amerikosov 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.750
 from the gray that we have for example there Tajiks 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.960
 I do not want Uzbeks 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 insult here but the relationship with the Americans 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.650
 to mexicans about the same that is 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.729
 how do we come to emigrants from middle asia 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.990
 recorded that the crown stage you drink 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.670
 I honestly do not know why the composition 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.420
 not enough flax tour however insertion and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 corn 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.640
 Well, I understand the mix of spit corn such 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.140
 the burrito is basically understandable in principle 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.539
 still say that the crown is very good 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.060
 use 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.789
 the crown is good to use in summer in the heat of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.729
 she quenches thirst well and 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.909
 true mexicans are true true 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.829
 crown lovers they usually consume 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.450
 a bottle of crown for a slice of lime 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.219
 here by the way the volume of the bottle is always 033 I 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.289
 did not see the cows in large bottles 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.359
 maybe it's just some cakes 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.130
 of our market maybe maybe maybe 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.899
 be in other countries have a friend to you 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.970
 really but we sell for 033 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.550
 and sold by the way to say that much 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.920
 cheap 70 rubles is an average bottle 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.130
 such here of course often occur 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 Any shares there are some 4 there for the price 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.390
 3 so on bang pretty expensive 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.190
 especially provided that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 use it is necessary to no one 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.720
 the amount of one thing here 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.690
 take it with you to the nature in drawers 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.080
 large packs and then maybe from 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.319
 he will be understood from but let him 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.319
 try 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.849
 beer by the way this is not a finger brewed 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:52.830
 the idea is imported by the sun 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.170
 inbev is our beloved factory of 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.090
 the bottles have already smelled like there and not 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.739
 absolutely this beer is not quite this hop and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.140
 malt such that there is such an additive 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.480
 It may be just out of this corn here 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.410
 which is part but the smell is not so 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.690
 very expensive and completely faceless 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.090
 some kind without some raisin by the way 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.569
 they say that there is almost no hangover from the crown 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.989
 appreciate her 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.030
 people for having a drink there 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.840
 10-15 as the people write on the 10 bottle all 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.360
 but all three liters from three liters of another 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.250
 hangover dumplings will be bright 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.400
 some folded there skillfully 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.200
 recently drank three cans here is not so 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.030
 quite hard for it was not in the morning 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.410
 I just drank three cans I was 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.209
 hard well corona corona don't know right away 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.650
 eyes catches thorough carbonation 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.510
 a lot of bubbles it is clear that this 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.010
 carbonization is unnaturally clear that 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.230
 this 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.440
 carbonate with carbon dioxide here 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.260
 foam is almost no foam 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.489
 that when they naturally absolutely 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.599
 shurka smells like something ugly 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.359
 reminds me of siberian crown lime 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.540
 it seems something drank like lovers 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:09.419
 such brands as the world course light then 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.549
 There is a course by the way, too, he is in the top 5 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.849
 best selling iv territory 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.979
 the United States is good at quenching thirst 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.970
 type here but this beer is the same that is 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.910
 it is moderately watery and bitter 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.400
 without some characteristic taste then 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.260
 well, I don't know for me 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:33.290
 no beer at all absolutely that is 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:35.290
 it is liquid and here we are well cooled 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.900
 its principle is more pleasant to me to drink 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:41.150
 if she was warm she would be 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.580
 disgusting well actually it is such 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.000
 option 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.270
 no real option for summer heat 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.120
 a picnic that is, if you are a major and you can 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.490
 afford them a long time company on 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.610
 kebabs take a beer at 200 there with 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.160
 small rubles per liter 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.140
 that is, as if the 003 bottle is 70 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.420
 rubles, respectively, a liter costs about 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.040
 200 rubles and if you can afford it 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.530
 let you get something 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.180
 pleasure but again I like that 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.490
 very expensive for so well because 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.620
 This beer can drink a lot 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:22.850
 there is a liquid beer watery not much 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:25.580
 drunk i don't know don't know to lovers 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.150
 such a drink for everyday 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.680
 of use I relate to me and and yet 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.419
 price-quality ratio on me 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.620
 a little annoying but it would be necessary of course 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.240
 try was to drink it layers mom but 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.669
 I unfortunately have no lime but also in 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.470
 In principle, it is clear that you have api 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.820
 such a faceless enough the only thing 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.479
 it has it like bitterness 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.910
 a little bit so specific and probably 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.650
 really a slice of lime she can this 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.720
 bitterness somehow reveal maybe 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.470
 complement that is what you taste like 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.540
 mouth soldered 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.250
 but again it will be more delicious than that 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.810
 the beer you used to drink 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:06.650
 that's not what you see beer 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.900
 Well, yes, Peter finish it off because nothing 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.090
 repulsive in him there is no but assessment to him 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.320
 high degree was set to 6 points 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.830
 at school beer varii 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:18.100
 and say that beer lovers well here 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.770
 actually probably all 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.860
 today is not a big deal to tell 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.660
 nothing and wait for new reviews with benefits 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.000
 nothing much to do is write them down 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.750
 big quantity and thank you all for 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.750
 attention all bye
