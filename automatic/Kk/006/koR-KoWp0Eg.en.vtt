00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
got this at t.j.maxx and it just looks

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.680 
got this at t.j.maxx and it just looks
like<00:00:57.679> this<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.249> it<00:00:58.489> just<00:00:58.519> inspect<00:00:58.940> evil<00:00:59.179> and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
like this and it just inspect evil and

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.470 
like this and it just inspect evil and
it<00:01:00.079> has<00:01:00.320> plastic<00:01:00.829> like<00:01:01.190> material<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.030> what<00:01:02.449> I

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
it has plastic like material and what I

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.729 
it has plastic like material and what I
really<00:01:02.749> like<00:01:02.870> about<00:01:02.899> this<00:01:03.140> plastic-like

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
really like about this plastic-like

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.649 
really like about this plastic-like
material<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:04.370> that<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.640> is<00:01:04.820> water<00:01:05.089> resistant

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
material is that it is water resistant

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.840 
material is that it is water resistant
so<00:01:05.840> if<00:01:05.960> water<00:01:06.140> does<00:01:06.260> get<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.220> will<00:01:07.670> not

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
so if water does get on this it will not

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.190 
so if water does get on this it will not
damage<00:01:08.450> anything<00:01:08.870> inside<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.860> the<00:01:10.340> back<00:01:11.200> so

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
damage anything inside of the back so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.719 
damage anything inside of the back so
that's<00:01:12.650> what<00:01:12.860> I<00:01:12.890> really<00:01:13.100> like<00:01:13.220> about<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:13.550> you

and I guess we'll get into it ok so the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.399 
and I guess we'll get into it ok so the
first<00:01:22.759> thing<00:01:22.909> that<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.149> have<00:01:23.390> in<00:01:23.509> here<00:01:23.720> is<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:24.110> hat

I do keep hats in here and I've been

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.780 
I do keep hats in here and I've been
really<00:01:26.840> liking<00:01:26.990> floppy<00:01:27.500> hats<00:01:27.829> but<00:01:28.219> floppy

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
really liking floppy hats but floppy

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.580 
really liking floppy hats but floppy
hats<00:01:29.060> are<00:01:29.299> a<00:01:29.329> little<00:01:29.509> big<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:30.110> bring<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
hats are a little big to bring to the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.980 
hats are a little big to bring to the
beach<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.070> decided<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.700> I<00:01:32.090> would<00:01:32.689> stick

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
beach so I decided that I would stick

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.840 
beach so I decided that I would stick
with<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.229> fedora<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.070> got<00:01:34.219> this<00:01:34.310> Fedora<00:01:34.670> at

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
with a fedora and I got this Fedora at

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.490 
with a fedora and I got this Fedora at
Target<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:35.930> is<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.259> looks<00:01:36.409> like

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
Target and this is what it looks like
