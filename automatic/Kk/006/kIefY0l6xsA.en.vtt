00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.440
 this diffuser 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.180
 the bus many complain that here in 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.310
 There is a noise making ball. 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:28.189
 so you have to use a key and christmas 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:31.219
 door fits pulling pulls out easy 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.489
 Now I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:46.400
 put you so 10 is not easy me 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:49.400
 fit to preserve and here is the diffuser 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.280
 onyx air on the driver's side already 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.360
 Disassembled in the panel is that you can 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.250
 see that he has only four 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.290
 Presidents of these steel that are 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.050
 That's where you're stuck, just for this and that 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.149
 air diffuser here company with three 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.149
 screws here 12 but the third side 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:15.049
 I've said is there are feral 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:19.250
 It's very easy just to pound there. 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:25.880
 now I get this part here and ok 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:28.190
 Let's go to the next step is to notice the 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.720
 Okay, okay. I 'm not coming in. 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.979
 Ben there in the middle has a pin that he can 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.340
 see bottom to top ta 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.080
 He has a break from his own band but 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.010
 This slack noise comes from what 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.890
 so much noise down to up as the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.200
 vertically and horizontally and is also 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.830
 I do not know, it will not be easy for this ball anymore. 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.540
 I'll I do what I did here 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.790
 disassemble this letter that looks good on the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:06.229
 through the air diffuser here where a 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.929
 pin I pasted a piece of foam is just 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.180
 foam and self adhesive I have heart 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.209
 on one side I had to say just one 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.879
 little because in my thick and 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.629
 then finishing is with it eliminates 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.790
 the gap that lies between the pin and this 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.680
 support here for you to have idea 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.360
 Alpine I'm talking about is the one that is 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.300
 right in the middle here 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.150
 this pina here and that support runs 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.010
 inside it is fit and can do 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.840
 noise 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.950
 basically that's what I did 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.790
 I ran a test and it eliminates the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.950
 noise 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.560
 now the final assembly process of the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.820
 galley is now already mounted there diffuse 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.430
 is mounted on that frame there 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.890
 so that foam that I put on the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.520
 means of those media that runs between the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 she gave support and no more 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.239
 noise 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.000
 I already did the test though by messing up 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.800
 lateral account is that small noise that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.310
 it was not always that it happened more than 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.650
 a lot of people complains is in my case 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.100
 while mounting a fixed panel 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.100
 car now
