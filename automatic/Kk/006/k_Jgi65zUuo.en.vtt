00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.370 
you're gonna take your hand flip it and
then<00:01:47.430> you're<00:01:48.149> gonna<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.600> down<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:50.090> swoop<00:01:51.380> just

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
then you're gonna go down and swoop just

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
then you're gonna go down and swoop just
like<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.189> do<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.549> really<00:01:53.759> quickly

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
like that and you do this really quickly

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
like that and you do this really quickly
because<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:55.290> straightener<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:56.070> hot

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
because the straightener is really hot

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.080 
because the straightener is really hot
so<00:01:57.799> yeah<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.250> reason<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.939> don't

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
so yeah that's the reason and you don't

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
so yeah that's the reason and you don't
want<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> be<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.659> super<00:02:01.020> curly<00:02:01.229> then

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
want it to be like super curly then

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.959 
want it to be like super curly then
you're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> go<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.490> bottom<00:02:02.670> section
