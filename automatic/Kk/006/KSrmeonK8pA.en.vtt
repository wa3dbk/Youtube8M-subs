I'm going to use MIDI to sequence the

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.829 
I'm going to use MIDI to sequence the
pedal<00:00:08.619> for<00:00:08.919> foot<00:00:09.280> free<00:00:09.459> control<00:00:09.879> this<00:00:10.719> is

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
awesome I've been having a lot of fun

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.450 
awesome I've been having a lot of fun
doing<00:00:28.450> that<00:00:28.660> for<00:00:28.840> live<00:00:28.960> shows<00:00:28.990> and<00:00:29.680> just<00:00:30.010> want

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
doing that for live shows and just want

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.680 
doing that for live shows and just want
to<00:00:30.550> show<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.789> a<00:00:30.850> few<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.119> possibilities

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
to show you a few of the possibilities

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.139 
to show you a few of the possibilities
here<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.649> have<00:00:33.429> a<00:00:33.460> couple<00:00:33.670> of<00:00:33.760> drum<00:00:33.940> loops

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.149 
here so I have a couple of drum loops

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.520 
here so I have a couple of drum loops
and<00:00:34.480> this<00:00:34.600> would<00:00:34.749> be<00:00:34.870> kind<00:00:35.050> of<00:00:35.079> how<00:00:35.230> you<00:00:35.289> would

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
and this would be kind of how you would

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.619 
and this would be kind of how you would
probably<00:00:36.219> sequence<00:00:36.640> your<00:00:37.089> pedals<00:00:37.359> too

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
probably sequence your pedals too

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.329 
probably sequence your pedals too
backing<00:00:37.989> tracks<00:00:38.289> or<00:00:38.499> to<00:00:38.589> a<00:00:38.620> click<00:00:38.890> track<00:00:39.069> that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
backing tracks or to a click track that

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:42.450 
backing tracks or to a click track that
you<00:00:39.460> feed<00:00:39.819> to<00:00:39.969> your<00:00:40.030> drummer<00:00:40.329> and<00:00:41.339> you<00:00:42.339> would

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
you feed to your drummer and you would

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.880 
you feed to your drummer and you would
make<00:00:42.609> MIDI<00:00:42.789> tracks<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:44.230> your<00:00:44.350> pedals<00:00:44.649> and

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
make MIDI tracks for your pedals and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.119 
make MIDI tracks for your pedals and
your<00:00:45.190> FX<00:00:45.429> switchers<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.120> have<00:00:47.019> one<00:00:47.260> set<00:00:48.039> up

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
your FX switchers and have one set up

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.919 
your FX switchers and have one set up
here<00:00:48.309> for<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.579> timeline<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.120> so<00:00:49.749> already

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
here for the timeline and so already

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.959 
here for the timeline and so already
named<00:00:50.199> it<00:00:50.319> then<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.249> have<00:00:51.370> several<00:00:51.729> little

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
named it then I have several little

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.059 
named it then I have several little
clips<00:00:52.300> which<00:00:52.719> are<00:00:52.870> each<00:00:52.989> going<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.379> do<00:00:53.889> some

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.069 
clips which are each going to do some

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.049 
clips which are each going to do some
different<00:00:54.159> things<00:00:54.370> here<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:54.850> this<00:00:55.329> first<00:00:55.510> clip

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
different things here so this first clip

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.750 
different things here so this first clip
this<00:00:58.059> is<00:00:58.239> basically<00:00:58.539> just<00:00:58.809> going<00:00:58.989> to<00:00:59.139> have<00:00:59.350> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this is basically just going to have a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.900 
this is basically just going to have a
little

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.540 
little
off<00:01:01.970> on<00:01:02.870> off<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.200> control<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.190> pedal<00:01:04.460> so

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
off on off on control of the pedal so

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.190 
off on off on control of the pedal so
it's<00:01:04.670> going<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.879> activate<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.390> bypass<00:01:05.810> and

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
it's going to activate and bypass and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.080 
it's going to activate and bypass and
you'll<00:01:07.040> see<00:01:07.220> why<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:07.520> relevant<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.030> a

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
you'll see why that's relevant in a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.670 
you'll see why that's relevant in a
moment<00:01:09.640> let's<00:01:10.640> see<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.060> we're<00:01:11.240> going<00:01:11.450> to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
moment let's see then we're going to

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.870 
moment let's see then we're going to
start<00:01:12.680> looping<00:01:12.920> we're<00:01:13.220> going<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.400> control<00:01:13.610> the

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
start looping we're going to control the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.060 
start looping we're going to control the
timelines<00:01:14.360> looper<00:01:14.780> to<00:01:14.930> start<00:01:15.530> recording<00:01:15.860> a

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
timelines looper to start recording a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.040 
timelines looper to start recording a
loop<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.490> then<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.210> this<00:01:17.300> next<00:01:17.540> clip<00:01:17.750> here

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
loop and then in this next clip here

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.430 
loop and then in this next clip here
we're<00:01:18.979> going<00:01:19.130> to<00:01:19.510> playback<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:20.690> loop<00:01:20.869> at<00:01:21.110> CC

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
we're going to playback that loop at CC

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.330 
we're going to playback that loop at CC
86<00:01:21.950> and<00:01:22.220> then<00:01:22.910> over<00:01:23.869> here<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:25.010> going<00:01:25.190> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
86 and then over here this is going to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.160 
86 and then over here this is going to
change<00:01:25.460> presets<00:01:25.729> notice<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.390> says<00:01:26.510> program<00:01:26.930> 2

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
change presets notice it says program 2

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.609 
change presets notice it says program 2
and<00:01:27.380> this<00:01:28.040> one<00:01:28.220> over<00:01:28.340> here<00:01:28.630> program<00:01:29.630> 1<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.500> in

and this one over here program 1 so in
this<00:01:30.710> clip<00:01:30.890> starts<00:01:31.250> it's<00:01:31.369> going<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.580> change

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
this clip starts it's going to change

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.870 
this clip starts it's going to change
presets<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.660> it's<00:01:33.110> also<00:01:33.320> going<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.979> stop<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
presets and it's also going to stop the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.639 
presets and it's also going to stop the
looper<00:01:35.180> with<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.450> CC<00:01:35.810> message<00:01:36.140> right<00:01:36.290> here

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
looper with the CC message right here

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.830 
looper with the CC message right here
85<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:39.039> let's<00:01:40.039> see<00:01:40.340> what<00:01:40.580> else<00:01:40.729> this<00:01:41.509> next

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
85 and let's see what else this next

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.410 
85 and let's see what else this next
clip<00:01:42.050> here<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.530> going<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.009> start<00:01:43.729> recording<00:01:44.149> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
clip here is going to start recording a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.020 
clip here is going to start recording a
new<00:01:44.450> loop<00:01:45.289> again<00:01:45.560> it's<00:01:45.740> going<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.890> be<00:01:45.979> a<00:01:46.030> longer

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
new loop again it's going to be a longer

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.460 
new loop again it's going to be a longer
loop<00:01:47.300> here<00:01:47.539> than<00:01:47.720> this<00:01:47.840> first<00:01:48.080> loop<00:01:48.350> we

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
loop here than this first loop we

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.859 
loop here than this first loop we
recorded<00:01:48.950> back<00:01:49.310> here<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.420> be<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> longer

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
recorded back here so to be a longer

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.779 
recorded back here so to be a longer
loop<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:51.800> when<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.190> starts<00:01:52.430> playback

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
loop and then when it starts playback

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.999 
loop and then when it starts playback
over<00:01:53.060> here<00:01:53.509> we're<00:01:54.200> going<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.500> few

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
over here we're going to do a few

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.210 
over here we're going to do a few
interesting<00:01:55.250> things<00:01:55.670> actually<00:01:56.890> let's<00:01:57.890> see<00:01:58.190> I

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
interesting things actually let's see I

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.550 
interesting things actually let's see I
have<00:01:58.490> this<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:59.240> little<00:01:59.780> bit<00:01:59.960> of<00:02:00.050> automation

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
have this a little bit of automation

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.139 
have this a little bit of automation
here<00:02:00.770> which<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.070> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.369> control<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.789> tape

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
here which is going to control the tape

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.510 
here which is going to control the tape
speed<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.110> timelines<00:02:03.590> D<00:02:03.890> tape<00:02:04.130> echo

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
speed on the timelines D tape echo

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.570 
speed on the timelines D tape echo
effect<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:05.959> it's<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.289> pit<00:02:06.890> shift<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
effect so it's going to pit shift the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.330 
effect so it's going to pit shift the
pitch<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:09.229> delay<00:02:09.679> repeats<00:02:10.009> up<00:02:10.190> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
pitch of the the delay repeats up and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.620 
pitch of the the delay repeats up and
down<00:02:10.490> it's<00:02:10.849> going<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> do<00:02:11.090> some<00:02:11.300> interesting

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
down it's going to do some interesting

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.809 
down it's going to do some interesting
little<00:02:11.959> things<00:02:12.260> there<00:02:12.500> you'll<00:02:13.459> hear<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.760> in

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
little things there you'll hear that in

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.830 
little things there you'll hear that in
a<00:02:13.910> moment<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.420> let's<00:02:15.319> see<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.420> this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
a moment and let's see and then this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.230 
a moment and let's see and then this
last<00:02:18.130> clip<00:02:19.130> when<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.400> loops<00:02:19.580> still<00:02:19.880> looping

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
last clip when the loops still looping

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.600 
last clip when the loops still looping
it's<00:02:21.080> going<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.620> start<00:02:21.860> increasing<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
it's going to start increasing the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.100 
it's going to start increasing the
feedback<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.420> it's<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.750> get<00:02:23.840> really

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
feedback and it's going to get really

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.690 
feedback and it's going to get really
intense<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.709> then<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.130> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> pull<00:02:25.550> off

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
intense and then it's going to pull off

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.640 
intense and then it's going to pull off
right<00:02:25.849> at<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.090> end<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.480> also<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.230> this<00:02:27.349> clip

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
right at the end and also in this clip

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.390 
right at the end and also in this clip
let's<00:02:27.970> see<00:02:28.970> there's<00:02:29.739> going<00:02:30.739> to<00:02:30.860> be<00:02:30.980> some

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
let's see there's going to be some

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.070 
let's see there's going to be some
reverse<00:02:33.250> reverse<00:02:34.250> looping<00:02:34.910> happening<00:02:35.660> that

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
reverse reverse looping happening that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.510 
reverse reverse looping happening that
the<00:02:36.290> loop<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.739> playback<00:02:37.040> in<00:02:37.220> Reverse

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
the loop is going to playback in Reverse

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.430 
the loop is going to playback in Reverse
so<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.599> going<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.750> happen<00:02:38.870> in<00:02:39.050> this<00:02:39.140> clip

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so that's going to happen in this clip

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.290 
so that's going to happen in this clip
and<00:02:39.680> then<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.640> drums<00:02:40.849> are<00:02:40.940> going<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.120> cut<00:02:41.209> out

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
and then the drums are going to cut out

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.440 
and then the drums are going to cut out
and<00:02:41.420> that's<00:02:41.540> pretty<00:02:41.750> much<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:43.060> let's<00:02:44.060> test

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
and that's pretty much it so let's test

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.570 
and that's pretty much it so let's test
it<00:02:44.630> out<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.810> see<00:02:44.870> if<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.290> see<00:02:46.190> if<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.400> actually

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it out and see if I see if this actually

00:02:46.580 --> 00:04:07.420 
it out and see if I see if this actually
works

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.410 

okay<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:08.610> worked<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:08.909> better<00:04:09.120> than

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
okay that worked out better than

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.539 
okay that worked out better than
expected<00:04:09.720> first<00:04:10.590> try

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
expected first try

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.110 
expected first try
pretty<00:04:12.120> easy<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.420> lot<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.930> fun<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.440> can<00:04:14.120> explore

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
pretty easy a lot of fun you can explore

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.180 
pretty easy a lot of fun you can explore
some<00:04:15.290> amazing<00:04:16.290> creative<00:04:16.530> potential<00:04:17.010> by

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
some amazing creative potential by

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.099 
some amazing creative potential by
controlling<00:04:17.639> your<00:04:17.669> effects<00:04:18.000> from<00:04:18.389> Ableton<00:04:18.690> so

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
controlling your effects from Ableton so

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.289 
controlling your effects from Ableton so
you<00:04:19.169> don't<00:04:19.440> have<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.620> focus<00:04:19.949> on<00:04:20.299> pressing

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
you don't have to focus on pressing

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.150 
you don't have to focus on pressing
buttons<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.900> rocking<00:04:22.410> expression<00:04:22.889> pedals

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
buttons and rocking expression pedals

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.120 
buttons and rocking expression pedals
back<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.520> forth<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.389> automate<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.500> very

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
back and forth you can automate it very

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.030 
back and forth you can automate it very
very<00:04:26.490> complicated<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.360> interesting<00:04:28.350> effects

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
very complicated and interesting effects

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.500 
very complicated and interesting effects
changes<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.669> all<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:29.790> have<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:29.970> do<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.180> play

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
changes and all you have to do is play

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.590 
changes and all you have to do is play
pretty<00:04:30.720> much<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.699> really<00:04:32.699> cool<00:04:32.880> people<00:04:33.540> are

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
pretty much so really cool people are

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.310 
pretty much so really cool people are
going<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.750> do<00:04:33.840> some<00:04:33.990> really<00:04:34.110> interesting

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
going to do some really interesting

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.529 
going to do some really interesting
stuff<00:04:34.770> when<00:04:34.919> this<00:04:35.070> when<00:04:35.370> people<00:04:35.669> start<00:04:36.419> on

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
stuff when this when people start on

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.080 
stuff when this when people start on
tapping<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:36.990> potential<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:37.979> that's<00:04:38.880> it

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
tapping this potential so that's it

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.920 
tapping this potential so that's it
