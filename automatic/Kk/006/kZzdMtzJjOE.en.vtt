00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
anything just yet may still be under

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.869 
anything just yet may still be under
development<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:56.129> doesn't<00:00:56.460> seem<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
development it doesn't seem like it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.569 
development it doesn't seem like it
respond<00:00:57.210> even<00:00:57.360> e<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.719> touches<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
respond even e my touches but this is a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.310 
respond even e my touches but this is a
beta<00:00:59.820> version<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.539> guessing<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
beta version so I'm guessing that that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.009 
beta version so I'm guessing that that
is<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.340> supposed<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.780> let's<00:01:03.930> go

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is what it's supposed to do so let's go

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.479 
is what it's supposed to do so let's go
into<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> maps<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.830> start<00:01:05.040> out<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.189> right

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
into the maps to start out with right

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.969 
into the maps to start out with right
here<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.470> completely

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
here as you can see it is completely

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
here as you can see it is completely
different<00:01:08.270> I'm<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> search<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:10.049> address

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
different I'm going to search an address

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.020 
different I'm going to search an address
let's<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.040> go<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.729> eiffel<00:01:12.659> tower

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.840 

right<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.500> let's<00:01:19.500> go<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.979> 3d<00:01:20.310> view<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
right there let's go into the 3d view it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
right there let's go into the 3d view it
has<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> 3d<00:01:21.689> button<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> can

if<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:28.110> zoom<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:30.710> huh<00:01:32.540> not<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.960> how<00:01:34.170> all

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
if i zoom in huh not really sure how all

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.390 
if i zoom in huh not really sure how all
of<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.860> functions<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:36.060> yet<00:01:37.159> here<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.250> go

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
of this functions just yet here we go

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
of this functions just yet here we go
here's<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> flyover<00:01:39.420> view<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:42.619> like<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
here's the flyover view I think like I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.200 
here's the flyover view I think like I
said<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.159> sure<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.000> this<00:01:45.090> works

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
said I'm not sure how any of this works

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
said I'm not sure how any of this works
at<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.659> don't<00:01:45.869> guess<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.710> has<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
at all I don't guess that it has some of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
at all I don't guess that it has some of

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
that if you set a contact for this then

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.920 
that if you set a contact for this then
they<00:06:38.110> will<00:06:38.229> call<00:06:38.680> will<00:06:38.889> still<00:06:39.039> come<00:06:39.220> through
