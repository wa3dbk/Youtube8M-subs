00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
now we don't want the color to be too

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.290 
now we don't want the color to be too
tight<00:05:17.260> but<00:05:17.590> if<00:05:17.710> it's<00:05:17.889> too<00:05:18.099> loose<00:05:18.340> callers<00:05:19.180> have

tight but if it's too loose callers have

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.149 
tight but if it's too loose callers have
a<00:05:19.360> tendency<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.080> slip<00:05:20.320> over<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.710> head<00:05:20.919> of<00:05:21.070> the
