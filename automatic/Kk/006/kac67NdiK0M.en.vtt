support um maybe you'll like them I
think<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.210> times<00:00:33.980> we<00:00:34.980> probably

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
think that a lot of times we probably

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.910 
think that a lot of times we probably
don't<00:00:35.760> give<00:00:36.329> people<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> chance<00:00:36.920> it's

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
don't give people a chance it's

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.229 
don't give people a chance it's
impossible<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.489> us<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> know<00:00:38.940> everybody

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
impossible for us to know everybody

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.959 
impossible for us to know everybody
right<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:41.250> generally<00:00:41.760> tie

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
right because we we generally tie

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.720 
right because we we generally tie
ourselves<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.160> genre<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.399> we

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
ourselves into this one genre that we

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.770 
ourselves into this one genre that we
that<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:46.079> or<00:00:46.829> whatever<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
that we're into or or whatever and I

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.709 
that we're into or or whatever and I
think<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.250> acoustic<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.940> amazing<00:00:51.239> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
think that acoustic is pretty amazing a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
think that acoustic is pretty amazing a
lot<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.980> lot<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.520> guys<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:54.030> go

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
lot of these a lot of these guys they go

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
lot of these a lot of these guys they go
play<00:00:54.449> acoustic<00:00:54.989> shows<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.590> they<00:00:56.129> play<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> lot

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
play acoustic shows and they play a lot

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.040 
play acoustic shows and they play a lot
of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> songs<00:00:57.030> from<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> heavy<00:00:57.629> stuff<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of the songs from the heavy stuff that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.439 
of the songs from the heavy stuff that
we<00:00:58.140> listen<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.520> turns<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.879> amazing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we listen to and that turns out amazing

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.549 
we listen to and that turns out amazing
and<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.340> why<00:01:03.019> these<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
and I think that's why these people that

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.330 
and I think that's why these people that
I'm<00:01:04.680> about<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.010> bring<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:06.710> are<00:01:07.710> worth

very fond of still am but he was an

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.050 
very fond of still am but he was an
amazing<00:01:33.060> singer<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> band<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.060> despite

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
amazing singer in that band and despite

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.410 
amazing singer in that band and despite
the<00:01:36.180> brutality<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:38.220> music<00:01:38.610> itself<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the brutality of the music itself and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
the brutality of the music itself and
the<00:01:39.540> happiness<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.729> felt<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.299> every

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the happiness of it I felt like every

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.550 
the happiness of it I felt like every
time<00:01:42.659> he's<00:01:42.780> saying<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
time he's saying that there was a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.490 
time he's saying that there was a
certain<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:44.210> soothing<00:01:45.210> quality<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.350> his

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
certain like soothing quality to his

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.590 
certain like soothing quality to his
voice<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.000> translates

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
voice and I think that really translates

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
voice and I think that really translates
well<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.960> acoustic<00:01:49.579> Devon<00:01:50.579> left<00:01:50.759> Vanna<00:01:51.000> in

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
well to acoustic Devon left Vanna in

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.080 
well to acoustic Devon left Vanna in
February<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> 2012<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.189> he<00:01:53.310> could<00:01:53.490> pursue<00:01:53.909> this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
February of 2012 so he could pursue this

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.749 
February of 2012 so he could pursue this
project<00:01:54.710> I<00:01:55.710> don't<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.490> when<00:01:56.670> he

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
project I don't really think when he

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.340 
project I don't really think when he
left<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> band<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.509> he<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
left the band that he was really on the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.580 
left the band that he was really on the

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
because it's still unknown it's still I

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.670 
because it's still unknown it's still I
guess<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:21.930> could<00:05:22.050> say<00:05:22.199> it's<00:05:22.319> still<00:05:22.529> in<00:05:22.589> the

planning<00:05:22.889> phases<00:05:23.219> at<00:05:23.460> this<00:05:23.610> point<00:05:23.960> but<00:05:24.960> I

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
planning phases at this point but I

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.579 
planning phases at this point but I
think<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.190> music<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.610> amazing<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:27.150> think<00:05:27.589> just

think the music is amazing I think just

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.469 
think the music is amazing I think just
like<00:05:28.710> Evan<00:05:29.099> that<00:05:29.310> he<00:05:29.490> has<00:05:29.639> the<00:05:29.789> heart<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.180> soul

like Evan that he has the heart and soul

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.540 
like Evan that he has the heart and soul
that<00:05:31.199> translates<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.949> an<00:05:32.069> acoustic<00:05:32.520> guitar

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550
