00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.240 

tissues<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.080> I'm<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> cut<00:00:16.920> them<00:00:17.130> into

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
tissues here I'm going to cut them into

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.490 
tissues here I'm going to cut them into
the<00:00:17.490> water<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:18.119> more<00:00:18.330> soon<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.900> that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the water have more soon see that

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
the water have more soon see that
there's<00:00:19.800> something<00:00:20.220> very<00:00:20.460> special<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:21.210> one

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
there's something very special about one

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.560 
there's something very special about one
of<00:00:21.630> them

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.870 

so<00:00:26.110> this<00:00:26.320> tissue<00:00:26.590> here<00:00:26.980> has<00:00:27.250> had<00:00:27.490> a<00:00:27.520> nano

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
so this tissue here has had a nano

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.430 
so this tissue here has had a nano
coating<00:00:28.449> applied<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:29.020> it<00:00:29.170> which<00:00:29.860> is

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
coating applied to it which is

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.340 
coating applied to it which is
the<00:00:30.590> surface<00:00:31.100> energy<00:00:31.520> of<00:00:31.790> that<00:00:32.000> tissue<00:00:32.350> now

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
the surface energy of that tissue now

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.200 
the surface energy of that tissue now
this<00:00:33.530> means<00:00:33.830> it<00:00:34.040> changes<00:00:34.490> the<00:00:34.640> way<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.820> water

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
this means it changes the way the water

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.700 
this means it changes the way the water
molecules<00:00:35.720> will<00:00:35.930> interacts<00:00:36.470> with<00:00:36.590> the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
molecules will interacts with the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.830 
molecules will interacts with the
surface<00:00:37.090> instead<00:00:38.090> of<00:00:38.300> being<00:00:38.510> absorbed

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
surface instead of being absorbed

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.440 
surface instead of being absorbed
they're<00:00:39.560> forming<00:00:40.010> droplets<00:00:40.130> can<00:00:41.000> simply

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
they're forming droplets can simply

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.740 
they're forming droplets can simply
we're<00:00:41.690> rolling<00:00:42.140> off<00:00:43.090> now<00:00:44.090> that's<00:00:44.300> not<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:44.540> very

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
we're rolling off now that's not a very

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.690 
we're rolling off now that's not a very
good<00:00:44.900> tissues<00:00:45.410> but<00:00:45.710> your<00:00:46.100> electronic<00:00:46.670> devices

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
good tissues but your electronic devices

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.729 
good tissues but your electronic devices
this<00:00:47.660> can<00:00:47.840> be<00:00:47.960> really<00:00:48.260> really<00:00:48.500> helpful

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
this can be really really helpful

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.930 
this can be really really helpful
because<00:00:49.370> if<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.360> put<00:00:50.629> some<00:00:50.950> liquid<00:00:51.950> onto<00:00:52.309> and

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
because if I put some liquid onto and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.299 
because if I put some liquid onto and
everyday<00:00:53.330> device<00:00:53.870> we<00:00:54.620> can<00:00:54.770> see<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.160> it's

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
everyday device we can see that it's

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.700 
everyday device we can see that it's
press<00:00:55.730> down<00:00:56.059> on<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.300> surface<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:57.290> computer

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
press down on the surface and computer

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.470 
press down on the surface and computer
reaction<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.309> pulling<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.940> throughout<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
reaction is pulling it in throughout the

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.119 
reaction is pulling it in throughout the
electronics<00:01:00.110> that's<00:01:00.680> going<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:00.950> cause

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
electronics that's going to cause

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.620 
electronics that's going to cause
long-term<00:01:01.430> corrosion<00:01:02.270> damage<00:01:04.210> on<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> device

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
long-term corrosion damage on a device

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.270 
long-term corrosion damage on a device
which<00:01:05.870> has<00:01:05.900> been<00:01:06.200> treated<00:01:06.650> with<00:01:06.770> dust<00:01:06.980> flash

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
which has been treated with dust flash

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.200 
which has been treated with dust flash
Bruce<00:01:07.640> nano-coating<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:09.170> can<00:01:09.350> see<00:01:09.560> that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
Bruce nano-coating you can see that

Bruce nano-coating you can see that
water<00:01:11.210> reacts<00:01:11.690> in<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.020> very<00:01:12.290> different<00:01:12.590> way<00:01:12.920> it

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
water reacts in a very different way it
