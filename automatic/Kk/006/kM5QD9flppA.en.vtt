here<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.649> 77<00:00:35.460> HP<00:00:36.860> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> front<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
here the 77 HP this is the front of it

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.720 
here the 77 HP this is the front of it
it's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.450> tone<00:00:42.989> generator<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.890> continuity

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
it's a tone generator and continuity

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.750 
it's a tone generator and continuity
tester<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.739> i'm<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.309> abuse<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
tester but i'm going to abuse the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.459 
tester but i'm going to abuse the
continuity<00:00:48.510> mode<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:51.860> provide<00:00:52.860> talk<00:00:53.190> battery

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
continuity mode to provide talk battery

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.160 
continuity mode to provide talk battery
for<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> circuit<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.840> anything

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
for the circuit so you can use anything

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.930 
for the circuit so you can use anything
that's<00:00:58.500> equivalent<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:01.399> line<00:01:02.399> tester

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
that's equivalent to this a line tester

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.609 
that's equivalent to this a line tester
that<00:01:03.090> has<00:01:03.239> like<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> continuity<00:01:03.930> mode<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that has like a continuity mode on it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
that has like a continuity mode on it
should<00:01:04.799> provide<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.430> talk<00:01:05.640> battery<00:01:08.750> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
should provide the talk battery this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
should provide the talk battery this

little block that everything is hooked
up<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:25.400> it's<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:27.150> block<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:29.119> input

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
up to it's just a block with the input

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.910 
up to it's just a block with the input
here<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.310> five<00:01:32.310> jacks<00:01:33.770> they're<00:01:34.770> all

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
here and five jacks they're all

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.090 
here and five jacks they're all
connected<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> same<00:01:36.000> thing<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:37.439> i<00:01:37.680> plugged

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
connected to the same thing so i plugged

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.719 
connected to the same thing so i plugged
in<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.579> i<00:01:39.439> talk<00:01:40.439> i<00:01:40.710> plugged<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.430> device

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
in the i talk i plugged in the device

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
in the i talk i plugged in the device
that<00:01:41.970> provides<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.390> talk<00:01:42.600> battery<00:01:43.049> into<00:01:43.350> this

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
that provides a talk battery into this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.719 
that provides a talk battery into this
and<00:01:46.340> plug<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.549> dreamcast<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> my<00:01:48.329> modem<00:01:48.750> into

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and plug my dreamcast and my modem into

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.620 
and plug my dreamcast and my modem into
the<00:01:50.729> jacks<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.909> three<00:01:54.119> left<00:01:54.270> over

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the jacks then you have three left over

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.389 
the jacks then you have three left over
if<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> provide<00:01:55.500> some<00:01:55.829> other<00:01:55.979> stuff

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.410 

that's<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.700> simple<00:02:00.090> part<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:03.180> make<00:02:03.390> sure

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
that's the simple part just make sure

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's the simple part just make sure
everything<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.079> hooked<00:02:04.140> together<00:02:04.969> and<00:02:05.969> when

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
everything is hooked together and when

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350 
everything is hooked together and when
you<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.960> use<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.409> dreamcast<00:02:08.330> make<00:02:09.330> sure

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you want to use the dreamcast make sure

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.619 
you want to use the dreamcast make sure
