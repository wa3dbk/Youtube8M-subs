come there and boom you got yourself a
snow<00:01:35.299> cone<00:01:35.569> and<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:36.229> have<00:01:36.409> effects<00:01:36.829> on<00:01:36.979> them

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
snow cone and these have effects on them

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.629 
snow cone and these have effects on them
too<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.609> like<00:01:38.539> so<00:01:38.569> this<00:01:38.869> one<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.109> speed
