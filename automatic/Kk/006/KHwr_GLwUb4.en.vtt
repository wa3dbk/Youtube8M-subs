layers of leaves one this is second
layer<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.809> Luther<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.010> then<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> top<00:01:06.060> layer

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
layer here Luther and then the top layer

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
layer here Luther and then the top layer
sort<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> randomized<00:01:07.549> so<00:01:08.549> yeah<00:01:08.729> three<00:01:08.970> layers

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
sort of randomized so yeah three layers

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
sort of randomized so yeah three layers
of<00:01:09.240> leaves<00:01:10.040> are<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> wall<00:01:11.430> colors<00:01:11.729> are<00:01:11.880> uses

always want to do one as I said and I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
always want to do one as I said and I
tried<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.799> add<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.130> another<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
tried to add like another in a way to

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.399 
tried to add like another in a way to
make<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.110> may<00:01:37.229> look

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
make it look around a bit just may look

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.440 
make it look around a bit just may look
stupid<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> as<00:01:38.909> close<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.390> could

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
stupid so this is as close as I could

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.440 
stupid so this is as close as I could
really<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.490> guess<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.880> looks<00:01:41.909> somewhat

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
really get so I guess it looks somewhat

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
really get so I guess it looks somewhat
like<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.689> pineapple<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.979> seed<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
like a pineapple and the seed for this

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.950 
like a pineapple and the seed for this
map<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:44.909> use<00:01:45.090> i<00:01:45.240> thought<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.540> pretty<00:01:45.720> cool

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
map i use i thought it was pretty cool

hi a Polish to me like a time the
notley's<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.439> normally<00:02:16.799> be<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.760> sort<00:02:17.999> of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
notley's would normally be like sort of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.989 
notley's would normally be like sort of
darker<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.799> this<00:02:19.799> looks<00:02:20.040> more<00:02:20.129> pineapple

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
darker and this looks more pineapple

darker and this looks more pineapple
color<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.689> guess<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.709> Minecraft<00:02:23.159> ones<00:02:23.370> are

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
color I guess the Minecraft ones are

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.459 
color I guess the Minecraft ones are
basically<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.239> fluro<00:02:24.689> everything

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
basically just fluro everything

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.160 
basically just fluro everything
basically<00:02:25.859> when<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.790> zoom<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.209> its<00:02:27.329> really<00:02:27.629> HD

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
basically when you zoom in its really HD

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.530 
basically when you zoom in its really HD
which<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.469> pretty<00:02:28.650> cool<00:02:28.889> I<00:02:29.150> always<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.299> stay

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
which is pretty cool I always just stay

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.530 
which is pretty cool I always just stay
with<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.719> basic<00:02:31.139> texture<00:02:31.500> back<00:02:31.939> but<00:02:32.939> yeah<00:02:33.209> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
with the basic texture back but yeah I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.879 
with the basic texture back but yeah I
think<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.019> this<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.379> looks<00:02:34.530> pretty<00:02:34.739> cool

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
think it this one looks pretty cool

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.679 
think it this one looks pretty cool
makes<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.609> part<00:02:35.819> will<00:02:36.000> look<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.540> or

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
makes the part will look more or

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.020 
makes the part will look more or
pineapple<00:02:37.170> ish<00:02:37.530> i<00:02:37.680> guess<00:02:37.859> i<00:02:38.069> could<00:02:38.639> have<00:02:38.879> had

pineapple ish i guess i could have had
this<00:02:39.180> all<00:02:39.419> orange<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.139> more<00:02:40.799> realistic<00:02:41.430> but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
this all orange but more realistic but

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.069 
this all orange but more realistic but
if<00:02:41.879> I<00:02:42.000> had<00:02:42.120> orange<00:02:42.329> would<00:02:42.599> look<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:43.019> of

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
if I had orange would look kind of

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.250 
if I had orange would look kind of
boring<00:02:43.879> so<00:02:44.879> yeah<00:02:45.150> if<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.510> have<00:02:45.599> any<00:02:45.810> things<00:02:46.079> in
