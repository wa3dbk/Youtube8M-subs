00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
other side it's definitely in the middle

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.289 
other side it's definitely in the middle
until<00:01:25.270> I<00:01:25.810> do<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.140> secret<00:01:26.500> move<00:01:26.650> that's<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.760> so

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
little game of two card monte instead of

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.469 
little game of two card monte instead of
three-card<00:01:47.829> Monte<00:01:48.189> I<00:01:48.220> will<00:01:48.490> eliminate<00:01:48.759> one<00:01:49.360> of

three-card Monte I will eliminate one of
the<00:01:49.570> losing<00:01:49.900> cards<00:01:50.200> so<00:01:50.710> all<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.070> do

the losing cards so all you have to do

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.160 
the losing cards so all you have to do
now<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.490> watch<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:52.150> black<00:01:52.329> ace<00:01:52.540> out<00:01:52.780> of<00:01:52.990> two

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
now is watch the black ace out of two

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.080 
now is watch the black ace out of two
cards<00:01:53.530> I'll<00:01:53.890> put<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.189> black<00:01:54.369> ace<00:01:54.579> in<00:01:54.759> my<00:01:54.790> left

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
cards I'll put the black ace in my left

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.880 
cards I'll put the black ace in my left
hand<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.630> red<00:01:55.869> ace<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.229> losing<00:01:56.530> card<00:01:56.740> in<00:01:56.829> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
hand the red ace the losing card in the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.490 
hand the red ace the losing card in the
right<00:01:57.040> hand<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.460> I'll<00:01:57.880> switch<00:01:58.240> then<00:01:59.140> switch

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
right hand and I'll switch then switch

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.380 
right hand and I'll switch then switch
them<00:01:59.649> again<00:01:59.890> but<00:02:00.460> then<00:02:00.579> I<00:02:00.610> do<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.880> secret<00:02:01.210> move

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
them again but then I do the secret move

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.289 
them again but then I do the secret move
that<00:02:02.320> was<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.649> so<00:02:03.220> now<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.430> black<00:02:03.759> ace<00:02:03.939> is<00:02:04.119> not

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
that was it so now the black ace is not

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.999 
that was it so now the black ace is not
here<00:02:04.600> it's<00:02:05.020> not<00:02:05.140> here<00:02:05.500> when<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.770> weren't

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
here it's not here when you weren't

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.130 
here it's not here when you weren't
looking<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.490> put<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.360> down<00:02:07.479> on<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.630> table<00:02:07.840> and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
looking I put it down on the table and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.440 
looking I put it down on the table and
that's<00:02:08.560> all<00:02:08.769> there<00:02:08.920> is<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.160> it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that's all there is to it

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:19.670 
that's all there is to it
three-card<00:02:10.450> Monte
