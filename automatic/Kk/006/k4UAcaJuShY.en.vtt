the system I still have yet to pick out
the<00:00:38.460> protein<00:00:39.460> skimmer<00:00:39.900> but<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.110> is<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> very

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
the protein skimmer but this is a very

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.139 
the protein skimmer but this is a very
nice<00:00:41.770> sump<00:00:42.190> I<00:00:42.489> saw<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:43.270> on<00:00:43.390> Stelio<00:00:44.850> saw<00:00:45.850> his

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
nice sump I saw it on Stelio saw his

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
these other pieces so we'll go through

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.589 
these other pieces so we'll go through
them<00:01:37.179> let<00:01:37.450> me<00:01:37.539> pull<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:37.749> out<00:01:39.270> alright<00:01:40.270> here<00:01:40.569> we

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
them let me pull it out alright here we

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.309 
them let me pull it out alright here we
go<00:01:40.719> it's<00:01:41.049> out<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.349> box

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
go it's out of the box

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.690 
go it's out of the box
alright<00:01:44.319> so<00:01:44.619> it's<00:01:44.799> 36<00:01:45.749> long<00:01:46.749> by<00:01:47.319> 18<00:01:47.799> wide<00:01:48.249> by<00:01:48.579> 15

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
alright so it's 36 long by 18 wide by 15

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.169 
alright so it's 36 long by 18 wide by 15
high<00:01:50.249> it's<00:01:51.249> got<00:01:51.579> two<00:01:53.609> drains<00:01:55.349> here<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:57.729> it

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
high it's got two drains here when it

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.379 
high it's got two drains here when it
comes<00:01:58.419> with<00:01:58.630> two<00:01:58.810> filter<00:01:59.200> socks<00:01:59.939> let<00:02:00.939> go<00:02:01.209> and

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:01.389 
comes with two filter socks let go and

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
comes with two filter socks let go and
here<00:02:01.659> somehow

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
here somehow

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.949 
here somehow
I'll<00:02:02.679> have<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:02.889> figure<00:02:03.069> that<00:02:03.189> out<00:02:06.719> right<00:02:07.719> here

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
I'll have to figure that out right here

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.460 
I'll have to figure that out right here
and<00:02:08.140> then<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.979> where<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:10.020> plan<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.230> put

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and then this is where the plan to put

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.850 
and then this is where the plan to put
the<00:02:12.599> protein<00:02:13.599> skimmer<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:14.110> once<00:02:14.349> I<00:02:14.470> pick<00:02:14.680> one

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
the protein skimmer one once I pick one

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.490 
the protein skimmer one once I pick one
out<00:02:14.890> thinking<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.670> buying<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.230> they're<00:02:17.230> true

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
out thinking of buying they they're true

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.540 
out thinking of buying they they're true
they're<00:02:17.770> tight<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.550> skimmer

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
they're tight and skimmer

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.310 
they're tight and skimmer
fit<00:02:19.760> in<00:02:19.910> here<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.330> lot<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.660> things<00:02:20.780> should<00:02:21.110> fit

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
fit in here a lot of things should fit

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
fit in here a lot of things should fit
in<00:02:21.410> here<00:02:21.620> skimmer<00:02:22.160> wise<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.840> then<00:02:24.130> we<00:02:25.130> have<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
in here skimmer wise and then we have a

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.530 
in here skimmer wise and then we have a
refugee<00:02:26.120> M<00:02:26.890> right<00:02:27.890> here<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.440> then<00:02:31.250> they

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
refugee M right here right and then they

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.910 
refugee M right here right and then they
suggest<00:02:32.540> maybe<00:02:32.840> one<00:02:33.320> way<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.530> feed<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
suggest maybe one way to feed the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.820 
suggest maybe one way to feed the
refugee<00:02:34.430> M<00:02:34.550> or<00:02:34.790> refugium<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.380> split

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
refugee M or refugium is that you split

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.390 
refugee M or refugium is that you split
off<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.340> drain<00:02:41.020> into<00:02:42.020> here<00:02:42.230> also<00:02:42.410> right<00:02:43.130> and

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
off the drain into here also right and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.510 
off the drain into here also right and
though<00:02:44.020> refugium<00:02:45.020> water<00:02:45.320> overflows<00:02:46.190> back

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
though refugium water overflows back

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.360 
though refugium water overflows back
into<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.030> sump<00:02:47.650> back<00:02:48.650> into<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.040> protein

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
into the sump back into the protein

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.640 
into the sump back into the protein
skimmer<00:02:49.520> section<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:50.630> flows<00:02:51.620> through

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
skimmer section and then flows through

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.270 
skimmer section and then flows through
this<00:02:52.370> channel<00:02:54.280> through<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.490> filter<00:02:56.450> pad<00:02:57.280> it

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
this channel through this filter pad it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.830 
this channel through this filter pad it
looks<00:02:58.520> like<00:02:58.700> they<00:02:58.940> have<00:02:59.090> a<00:02:59.120> little<00:02:59.300> shelf<00:02:59.660> in

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
looks like they have a little shelf in

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.600 
looks like they have a little shelf in
