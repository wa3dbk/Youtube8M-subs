00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.559 
I think it's chocolate blow dry cream on
to<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.149> section<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.829> make<00:01:22.399> sure<00:01:22.429> to<00:01:22.850> really

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
get the section kind of saturated with

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.319 
get the section kind of saturated with
the<00:01:27.649> cream<00:01:30.100> because<00:01:31.100> I<00:01:31.369> don't<00:01:31.610> want<00:01:31.969> any

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
the cream because I don't want any

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.980 
the cream because I don't want any
damage<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.670> I<00:01:35.119> want<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.450> evenly<00:01:35.810> distribute

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.670 

so<00:02:35.230> here<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> started<00:02:36.160> off<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:38.140> think<00:02:38.350> it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
so here I started off with I think it

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.490 
so here I started off with I think it
was<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> low<00:02:39.220> heat<00:02:39.820> at<00:02:40.030> first<00:02:40.540> just<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> few

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
was a low heat at first just for a few

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.230 
was a low heat at first just for a few
seconds<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> wanted<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.460> see<00:02:42.730> how<00:02:43.030> my<00:02:43.210> hair

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
seconds I wanted to see how my hair

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.940 
seconds I wanted to see how my hair
would<00:02:43.600> do<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:44.220> low<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.470> was<00:02:47.740> gonna

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
would do on low but it really was gonna

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.210 
would do on low but it really was gonna
take<00:02:48.250> forever<00:02:48.520> so<00:02:48.910> eventually<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:50.440> kicked<00:02:51.040> up

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
take forever so eventually I kicked up

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:16.730 
take forever so eventually I kicked up
the<00:02:51.340> speed

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.710 

medium<00:03:17.740> heat<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.190> good<00:03:18.490> and<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:18.760> duly<00:03:19.180> hold<00:03:19.480> the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
medium heat is good and I duly hold the

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.070 
medium heat is good and I duly hold the
roots<00:03:20.250> as<00:03:21.250> much<00:03:21.610> as<00:03:21.760> possible<00:03:22.030> when<00:03:22.930> I'm

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
roots as much as possible when I'm

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.140 
roots as much as possible when I'm
blow-drying<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.830> that<00:03:24.069> just<00:03:24.310> keeps<00:03:24.580> it<00:03:24.790> from

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
blow-drying it that just keeps it from

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:53.559 
blow-drying it that just keeps it from
getting<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.930> little<00:03:26.470> bit<00:03:27.090> extra<00:03:28.090> puffy<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.840> found

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.710 

so<00:03:54.569> once<00:03:54.810> I've<00:03:55.019> done<00:03:56.480> blow-drying<00:03:57.480> that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so once I've done blow-drying that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.470 
so once I've done blow-drying that
section<00:03:58.140> I'm<00:03:58.319> just<00:03:58.530> going<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.069> twist<00:03:59.849> or<00:04:00.209> braid

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
section I'm just going to twist or braid

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.220 
section I'm just going to twist or braid
it<00:04:00.689> off<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:02.239> secure<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.360> back<00:04:03.510> up<00:04:03.750> so<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.049> can

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
it off and secure it back up so I can

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
it off and secure it back up so I can
start<00:04:04.470> with<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.650> other<00:04:04.829> sections<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.640> I'm

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
don't put anything else on it but that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.550

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and then I'll detain go that section if

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800 
and then I'll detain go that section if
it's<00:04:28.770> feeling<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.370> little<00:04:29.520> bit<00:04:29.820> tangled<00:04:30.630> and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
it's feeling a little bit tangled and

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.580 
it's feeling a little bit tangled and
then<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.560> blow-dry<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:34.110> do<00:04:34.260> that<00:04:34.440> with

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
then I blow-dry it and I do that with

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.150 
then I blow-dry it and I do that with
each<00:04:34.770> section<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.699> a<00:04:35.760> secure<00:04:36.180> each<00:04:36.360> section

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
each section and a secure each section

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.770 
each section and a secure each section
afterwards<00:04:38.160> just<00:04:38.820> to<00:04:39.000> keep<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.419> out<00:04:39.570> of<00:04:39.600> the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
afterwards just to keep it out of the

00:04:39.780 --> 00:05:01.190 
afterwards just to keep it out of the
way<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.289> can<00:04:40.470> move<00:04:40.590> on<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.070> next<00:04:41.250> section

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.960 

and<00:05:02.200> probably<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.800> next<00:05:02.830> time<00:05:03.250> I<00:05:03.280> do<00:05:03.430> this<00:05:03.730> I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
and probably the next time I do this I

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.670 
and probably the next time I do this I
won't<00:05:04.120> wear<00:05:04.300> my<00:05:04.450> glasses<00:05:04.690> because<00:05:05.170> they<00:05:05.440> kept

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
won't wear my glasses because they kept

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:49.700 
won't wear my glasses because they kept
slipping

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.200 

so<00:05:50.310> again<00:05:50.580> go<00:05:50.789> around<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.449> each<00:05:51.479> section<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:53.210> put

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
so again go around to each section I put

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.659 
so again go around to each section I put
on<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.449> blow-dryer<00:05:54.870> cream<00:05:55.229> I<00:05:55.620> generally<00:05:56.070> hold

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
on the blow-dryer cream I generally hold

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.070 
on the blow-dryer cream I generally hold
my<00:05:56.970> roots<00:05:57.350> down<00:05:58.350> as<00:05:58.830> much<00:05:59.220> as<00:05:59.370> possible<00:05:59.580> as<00:06:00.240> I

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
my roots down as much as possible as I

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.600 
my roots down as much as possible as I
dry<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:06.590> just<00:06:07.590> kind<00:06:07.800> of<00:06:07.830> keeps<00:06:08.009> my<00:06:08.160> hair<00:06:08.430> from

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
dry it just kind of keeps my hair from

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
dry it just kind of keeps my hair from
flying<00:06:08.850> all<00:06:09.090> over<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:09.389> place

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.150

I think this was the first time using a
blow-dryer<00:06:43.340> cream<00:06:43.970> by<00:06:44.180> Carol's<00:06:44.570> Daughter<00:06:44.810> and
