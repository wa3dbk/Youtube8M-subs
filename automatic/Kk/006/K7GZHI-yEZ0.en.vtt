00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
tuning you can do with the third fret

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
tuning you can do with the third fret
and<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.309> will<00:00:35.430> sound<00:00:35.579> good<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:37.790> am<00:00:38.790> changing<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and it will sound good I am changing the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.619 
and it will sound good I am changing the
chords<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> match<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.160> capo<00:00:41.550> settings<00:00:41.910> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
chords to match the capo settings so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.130 
chords to match the capo settings so
here<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:44.070> two<00:00:44.489> three<00:00:44.520> four<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.660> just

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
here we have one two three four I just

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.389 
here we have one two three four I just
find<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> easier<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:47.100> way<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.469> string<00:00:49.860> 7th

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
find it easier that way so a string 7th

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.779 
find it easier that way so a string 7th
fret<00:00:50.539> D<00:00:51.539> string<00:00:51.570> fifth<00:00:52.289> fret<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:54.440> starts<00:00:55.440> off

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
fret D string fifth fret and starts off

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:08.420 
fret D string fifth fret and starts off
you<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:56.940> pluck<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> two<00:00:57.420> notes

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.740 

and<00:01:09.430> that's<00:01:09.640> where<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:09.970> get<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.119> little<00:01:10.390> tricky

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
and that's where you get a little tricky

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.319 
and that's where you get a little tricky
a<00:01:10.780> little<00:01:11.130> pattern<00:01:12.130> that<00:01:12.189> he<00:01:12.310> does<00:01:12.490> it's<00:01:13.000> five

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
a little pattern that he does it's five

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.730 
a little pattern that he does it's five
and<00:01:13.689> four<00:01:13.990> by<00:01:14.170> the<00:01:14.200> way<00:01:14.380> for<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.860> notes<00:01:19.740> does

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
and four by the way for the notes does

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.419 
and four by the way for the notes does
that<00:01:21.539> so<00:01:22.539> altogether<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.530> verse<00:01:24.100> part<00:01:24.250> just

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
that so altogether the verse part just

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.770 
that so altogether the verse part just
start<00:01:27.429> this<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.649> beautiful<00:01:30.460> girl<00:01:30.780> two

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
start this and a beautiful girl two

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.090 
start this and a beautiful girl two
things<00:01:32.200> not<00:01:32.710> what<00:01:33.280> this<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.810> we<00:01:34.899> stand<00:01:35.289> at<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
things not what this so we stand at the

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.570 
things not what this so we stand at the
edge<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:40.709> so<00:01:41.709> after<00:01:42.009> that<00:01:42.159> part<00:01:42.429> we

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
edge and so after that part we

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.020 
edge and so after that part we
transition<00:01:43.539> into<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.799> strumming<00:01:45.310> of<00:01:45.700> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
transition into the strumming of the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.440 
transition into the strumming of the
right<00:01:47.020> hand<00:01:47.229> what<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.409> did<00:01:47.619> there<00:01:47.770> at<00:01:47.860> the<00:01:47.950> end

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
right hand what I did there at the end

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.380 
right hand what I did there at the end
is<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.740> same<00:01:50.740> picking<00:01:51.039> pattern<00:01:51.240> but<00:01:52.240> with

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
is just same picking pattern but with

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.740 
is just same picking pattern but with
the<00:01:52.479> C<00:01:52.780> chord<00:01:53.080> instead<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.590> D<00:01:54.069> chord<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.600> then

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the C chord instead of D chord so then

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.630 
the C chord instead of D chord so then
he<00:01:56.170> goes<00:01:56.319> into<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.860> strumming<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.340> same

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
he goes into the strumming the same

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:15.220 
he goes into the strumming the same
exact<00:01:58.360> chords<00:01:58.899> and<00:01:59.319> it'll<00:01:59.830> just

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.500 

and<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.680> there's<00:02:17.670> also<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:18.000> little<00:02:18.210> bit<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and so there's also a little bit of a

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.860 
and so there's also a little bit of a
debate<00:02:18.690> as<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.960> whether<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.880> five<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.300> open

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
debate as to whether it's five for open

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.850 
debate as to whether it's five for open
court<00:02:22.500> or<00:02:22.800> an<00:02:23.220> action<00:02:23.580> d<00:02:23.970> chord<00:02:24.830> it<00:02:25.830> sounds

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
court or an action d chord it sounds

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.020 
court or an action d chord it sounds
good<00:02:26.400> either<00:02:26.550> way

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
good either way

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:42.550 
good either way
so<00:02:27.240> whichever<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.320> find<00:02:28.560> easier

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.510 

there's<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.710> a<00:02:43.770> whole<00:02:43.950> lot<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.190> difference

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
there's not a whole lot of difference

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.120 
there's not a whole lot of difference
there<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.830> for<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.890> verse<00:02:48.800> you're<00:02:49.800> gonna<00:02:49.920> say

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
there so for the verse you're gonna say

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.670 
there so for the verse you're gonna say
it's<00:02:50.550> all<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.450> same<00:02:51.630> chords<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.560> gonna

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
it's all the same chords you're gonna

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:27.199 
it's all the same chords you're gonna
start<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:59.100> start<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.580> E

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.570 

you<00:03:28.209> does<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.420> twice<00:03:28.930> while<00:03:29.260> singing<00:03:29.590> also

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
you does that twice while singing also

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.820 
you does that twice while singing also
you<00:03:30.640> may<00:03:30.880> have<00:03:30.910> noticed<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.540> had<00:03:31.840> my<00:03:32.050> ring

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
you may have noticed I had my ring

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.699 
you may have noticed I had my ring
finger<00:03:33.160> up<00:03:33.340> here<00:03:33.670> on<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.630> E<00:03:34.660> string<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.560> was

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
finger up here on the E string that was

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.050 
finger up here on the E string that was
just<00:03:35.920> muting<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.459> so<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.270> I<00:03:37.360> can<00:03:37.420> hit<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
just muting it so that I can hit it and

just muting it so that I can hit it and
nothing<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:41.980> all<00:03:42.099> that<00:03:42.280> is<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.610> don't

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
nothing so that is all that is I don't

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.840 
nothing so that is all that is I don't
want<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.120> throw<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.430> do<00:03:45.550> that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
want that to throw you so you do that

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.390 
want that to throw you so you do that
that<00:03:46.000> riff<00:03:46.180> twice<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.950> then<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.190> to<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that riff twice and then you get to the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.970 
that riff twice and then you get to the
pre-chorus<00:03:49.020> which<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> little<00:03:50.680> bit<00:03:50.830> of<00:03:50.920> a

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
pre-chorus which is a little bit of a

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:12.190 
pre-chorus which is a little bit of a
trick

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.710 

so<00:04:13.200> basically<00:04:14.160> we<00:04:14.340> have

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.790 

three<00:04:17.440> two<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:19.299> then<00:04:19.570> sissy<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.800> back

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
three two and then sissy and then back

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.010 
three two and then sissy and then back
to<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.040> II<00:04:24.090> know<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.150> didn't<00:04:25.840> really<00:04:25.900> play

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
to the II know you didn't really play

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.680 
to the II know you didn't really play
here<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:30.670> then<00:04:31.330> up<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.750> d<00:04:32.760> c--<00:04:33.790> fairly

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
here and then up to the d c-- fairly

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:43.060 
here and then up to the d c-- fairly
simple<00:04:35.110> but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.120 

that<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.400> pre-chorus<00:04:44.940> chorus<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:46.680> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
that is the pre-chorus chorus is the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.070 
that is the pre-chorus chorus is the
same<00:04:47.340> as<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.640> intro<00:04:48.030> with<00:04:48.510> when<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
same as the intro with when the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:05:04.820 
same as the intro with when the
strumming<00:04:49.440> kicked<00:04:49.980> in

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:19.390 

that<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.190> chorus<00:05:06.940> riff

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.460 

so<00:05:20.400> very<00:05:21.120> standard<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.780> lot<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.229> same

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
so very standard a lot of the same

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.960 
so very standard a lot of the same
chords<00:05:22.979> it's<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.370> different<00:05:23.669> order<00:05:23.940> than

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
chords it's a different order than

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.260 
chords it's a different order than
they've<00:05:24.270> been<00:05:24.300> in<00:05:24.600> this<00:05:24.990> whole<00:05:25.169> song<00:05:25.410> and<00:05:26.270> it's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
they've been in this whole song and it's

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.930 
they've been in this whole song and it's
a<00:05:27.360> brilliantly<00:05:27.810> written<00:05:28.110> bridge<00:05:29.070> over<00:05:29.820> you

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940
