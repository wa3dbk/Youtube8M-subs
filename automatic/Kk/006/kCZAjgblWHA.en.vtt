00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.829
 of the game engine glaciers denim and the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.969

 multi fps strategy game and pink in 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.079
 general the team imagined a character 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.190
 deeper and darker than those of 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.320
 the time on pc games 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.390
 he wanted a badass not politically 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.970
 okay then they had the idea 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.980
 of a hitman whom they loved 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.600
 the concept of the incarnation of the wicked 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.740
 and were inspired by many 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.570
 comics and hong kong movie 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.640
 they quickly decided to make one 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.260
 clone he wants but the idea that the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.640
 character is not from roots they 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.740
 be manipulated by its creators 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 it made him the ultimate assassin 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.700
 by the way and runs a long 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.650
 moment before it's decided that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.940
 Agent 47 warms up at the base 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 it was even a grumpy old man 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.270
 he's also gone through a stage where he 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.820
 wore a pair of high-tech glasses 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 of ice before time appearance 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 general and the face of the character are 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 inspired by David Bateson who gives him 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.440
 also his voice in all episodes duke 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.790
 drives and heats this is maybe there 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.020
 the origin of the baldness of the character's skull 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.510
 a few months before the release of the game a 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.010
 commercial site announcement has by mistake to 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.050
 all people having pre-ordered 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.370
 the cancellation of his exit that made 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.570
 quickly go around the web of cons 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.700
 number of players 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 happily eidos interactive the publisher 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.430

 game let's move on to the second episode good 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.150
 pity little info on this album that is 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.350
 by the way my favorite just does it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.420
 only at a time of development 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.310
 the watchdog model and the one 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.290
 guards this inversèrent which gave 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.489
 army dogs walking in the level 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.269
 sometimes smoking a cigarette 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.950
 scary not a lot of info either 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.260
 the rich man against axis is original 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.299
 faf larage the french rapper is him 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.890
 on the bo is yes at the last 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.170
 game mission we can hear at the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.650
 radio one of his songs entitled mr 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.879
 claude in this episode we can 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.859
 see a ghost 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.409
 indeed in a room where a murder 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.239
 sordid was perpetrated by watching the 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.069
 mirror we see an ectoplasm appear 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.510
 So must the victim who made a last 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.319
 blow let's get to hitman blood money for 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.180
 this episode 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.040
 the team went far in the details 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.749
 they even sent members of 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.430
 the team in each city take some 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.319
 references like the shapes of the handles 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.090
 door and mouth good directories 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.489
 also simply to reproduce 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.510
 architecture of places 1 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.549
 the team is really focused on 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.230
 details finally except for the description 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.689
 of a cage is in the level a dance 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.650
 furious who is just alan adds the 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.650
 description please 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.170
 the white house was added to the game 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.659
 because nobody had done it until then 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.120
 and that it was a little daring we like 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.889
 what is daring interactive 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.480
 moreover it is a place known for everything 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.549
 the world but nobody knows 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.499
 really that allowed the team to 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.739
 change the environment at will without 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:29.840
 that it shocks anyone he was 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.269
 originally not intended that the agent of the 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.980
 cia carleton smith is a more role 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.749
 important than in the other episodes 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.730
 but because of his presence in all 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:40.040
 the episodes the team even though she 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.900
 did not like it resolved to grant him 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.439
 more importance all that create a 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.909
 new character for the occasion the 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.859
 Mardi Gras level was done almost 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.599
 only for the playstation 2 in 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.980
 effect the team wanted to prove that he 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.959
 was possible to make a system of 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.370
 crowd on playstation 2 in order to 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.870
 to respond to those who advocated 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.150
 quality of the new consoles and 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.189
 their crowd system good suddenly as 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.849
 the game is also released on xbox 360 and 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.889
 pc it's less funny there is a easter 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.599
 egg with rats playing poker 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.459
 in fact it's just that one of 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.049
 animators animation player myself 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.880
 Boca on the rats and has a lot of fun 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.860
 with the program 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.570
 of the gameplay they decided that there was 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.680
 enough free space on the memory for 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.320
 add this little joke 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.330
 yeah the team loves the easter egg in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.160
 talking about that in the 25th mission 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.320
 amendment if you run three times the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.750
 bag of a woman in the fireplace of 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.380
 marines will arrive will line up is in 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.870
 his camp 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 nice in the same kind during 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.160
 the emission until death if the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.350
 player shoots a ball into the room at 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.790
 waterside side of the men's mansion 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.460
 fighting will put themselves in 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.600
 slip will arrive and learn in their 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.710
 hands and hop we're talking now about 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.050
 last episode dated 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.270
 hitman absolution the team started on 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.890
 work on this episode as early as 2006 which 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.320
 make him the game with the most 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.880
 long development of the series 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.140
 one of the goals of the team was to create 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.450
 a real development of history 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.200
 around 47 and make sure of the 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.000
 make endearing 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.330
 which is difficult when the character 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.010
 is a ruthless killer the team has 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.150
 quickly decided that the game of going to 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.490
 unfold largely in a 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.660
 huge city hesitated to which city 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.090
 then choose chicago 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.160
 it touches art deco story and its 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.300
 general architecture 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.070
 Moreover, it is important to know that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.750
 levels are first created with blocks 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.980
 to test the round of stations 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.200
 hiding places and whatnot 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.010
 you have to optimize the team 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.300
 artistic adds the decor 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.610
 inevitably the game is full of history 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.960
 aig for example in a level you 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.610
 can shoot the slack of a bomb 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.610
 atomic which will give 7 that of sin 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.169
 yes it is lynch of gannan line 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.490
 was even developer can 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.180
 by the way find kane another 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.590
 moment of the game there is also reference to 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.120
 solid gear metal with a point 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.460
 of exclamation that appears when one 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.660
 shoot a strange yves pig 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.430
 laughs and gets around to finish this mr 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.290
 aig if you kill all the vultures in 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.639
 the mission in the desert the target are 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.169
 were aware of it before being 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.940
 violently crushed by a truck of 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:12.479
 ice merchants always beware 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.979
 good ice cream merchants it's not 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.660
 really an easter egg but at the 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.370
 announced trailer of the game we can see a 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.270
 ference tattoo barcode 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.860
 the agent 47 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.139
 except that this barcode once scanned 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.500
 gives access to an amazon page for a 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:27.540
 bag to god brothers bag for sextoys the 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.110
 draw string doubled guild to rings 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.520
 to be precise I guess the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.300
 most of you are aware of 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.160
 first film 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.500
 you also need to know that a second movie 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.720
 is in preparation titled agent 47 he 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.520
 will be directed by alexander bac which this

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.070
 lies there is also a game of the 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.139

 supposed to go out on psp and ds and his 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.050
 development started in 2006 

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:18.150
