together<00:04:21.350> all<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.280> season<00:04:22.670> like<00:04:22.820> this

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
together all the season like this

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.480 
together all the season like this
basically<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.540> 0-0<00:04:24.080> game<00:04:24.170> because<00:04:24.800> it's<00:04:25.400> just

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
basically a 0-0 game because it's just

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.550 
basically a 0-0 game because it's just
more<00:04:25.820> of<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.940> fried<00:04:26.210> game<00:04:26.540> then<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:27.380> doesn't

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
more of a fried game then it doesn't

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.500 
more of a fried game then it doesn't
matter<00:04:27.830> if<00:04:27.920> we<00:04:28.580> have<00:04:28.790> everything<00:04:29.060> moves<00:04:29.390> or

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
matter if we have everything moves or

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.210 
matter if we have everything moves or
they<00:04:29.600> don't<00:04:29.720> have<00:04:29.900> anything<00:04:30.140> you<00:04:30.710> want<00:04:31.160> to

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
they don't have anything you want to

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.830 
they don't have anything you want to
definitely<00:04:31.490> again<00:04:31.760> becomes<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.180> robbery<00:04:32.630> game

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
definitely again becomes a robbery game

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.690 
definitely again becomes a robbery game
so<00:04:33.050> all<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.410> other<00:04:33.590> stuff<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:34.070> doesn't<00:04:34.190> matter

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
so all the other stuff it doesn't matter

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.130 
so all the other stuff it doesn't matter
