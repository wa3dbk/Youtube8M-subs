feature today we're taking a look at

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.110 
feature today we're taking a look at
pacman<00:00:10.260> which<00:00:10.469> was<00:00:10.650> made<00:00:10.920> by<00:00:11.160> Musel<00:00:11.700> now<00:00:11.820> he<00:00:12.000> is

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
pacman which was made by Musel now he is

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.629 
pacman which was made by Musel now he is
listed<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> co-creator<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.190> I'm<00:00:14.370> not

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
listed as a co-creator so I'm not

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.760 
listed as a co-creator so I'm not
entirely<00:00:15.089> sure<00:00:15.299> if<00:00:15.509> he<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> original

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
entirely sure if he is the original

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
entirely sure if he is the original
author<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.279> map<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.760> gonna<00:00:17.850> list

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
author of the map but we're gonna list

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.970 
author of the map but we're gonna list
his<00:00:18.270> name<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:19.020> good<00:00:19.170> intentions<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> hope

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
his name with good intentions and hope

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
his name with good intentions and hope
that<00:00:20.130> he<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.970> original<00:00:21.330> author<00:00:21.480> anyways

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
that he is the original author anyways

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.109 
that he is the original author anyways
this<00:00:22.769> maps<00:00:23.010> pretty<00:00:23.220> cool<00:00:23.369> obviously<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
this maps pretty cool obviously it is a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.300 
this maps pretty cool obviously it is a
pacman<00:00:24.869> map<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.260> i<00:00:25.350> said<00:00:25.529> earlier<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> can

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
pacman map as i said earlier so you can

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370 
pacman map as i said earlier so you can
only<00:00:26.430> imagine<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> works<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.260> works

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
only imagine how it works it works

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
only imagine how it works it works
exactly<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:29.010> original<00:00:29.490> pac-man<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.480> spawn

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
exactly like original pac-man you spawn

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.569 
exactly like original pac-man you spawn
as<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> pacman<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.920> guess<00:00:32.070> that's<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> proper

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
as a pacman I guess that's the proper

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.340 
as a pacman I guess that's the proper
term<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.230> around

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
term for it right and you go around

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.810 
term for it right and you go around
you're<00:00:34.620> trying<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> click<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.250> pieces<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
you're trying to click little pieces of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910 
you're trying to click little pieces of
food<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.570> guess<00:00:36.870> those<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.320> those<00:00:37.680> were<00:00:37.800> other

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
food I guess those with those were other

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.770 
food I guess those with those were other
little<00:00:38.190> dots<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.640> never<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.390> sure<00:00:39.600> what

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little dots I never really was sure what

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
little dots I never really was sure what
exactly<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.440> were<00:00:40.500> but<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
exactly they were but they do have the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.920 
exactly they were but they do have the
cherries<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.329> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> pick<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
cherries in this so if you pick up the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.779 
cherries in this so if you pick up the
little<00:00:43.050> red<00:00:43.200> dot<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:43.860> around<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
little red dot you can go around and you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190 
little red dot you can go around and you
can<00:00:44.969> eat<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.149> ghosts<00:00:45.510> but<00:00:45.780> again<00:00:46.020> they're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can eat the ghosts but again they're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.600 
can eat the ghosts but again they're
gonna<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.469> chasing<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.950> obviously<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
gonna be chasing you obviously this is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
gonna be chasing you obviously this is
pac-man<00:00:47.850> everyone<00:00:48.480> knows<00:00:48.629> out<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.840> life<00:00:48.960> Ahmed

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
pac-man everyone knows out of life Ahmed

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.930 
pac-man everyone knows out of life Ahmed
and<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.800> works<00:00:49.950> exactly<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.520> what's<00:00:50.670> cool<00:00:50.789> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
and it works exactly know what's cool is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880 
and it works exactly know what's cool is
he's<00:00:51.120> even<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> teleporters<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
he's even got the teleporters and the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.830 
he's even got the teleporters and the
point<00:00:53.100> system<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.730> believe<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> same<00:00:54.360> as

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
point system I believe it's the same as

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
point system I believe it's the same as
the<00:00:55.020> original<00:00:55.440> point<00:00:56.010> system<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
the original point system and and as a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
the original point system and and as a
bonus<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.500> got<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> same<00:00:58.859> layout<00:00:59.190> as

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bonus it's got the same layout as

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.639 
bonus it's got the same layout as
pac-man<00:00:59.879> too<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.230> completely

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
pac-man too so it's a completely

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
pac-man too so it's a completely
faithful<00:01:01.890> remake<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.879> pac-man<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.600> only

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
faithful remake of pac-man now my only

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.219 
faithful remake of pac-man now my only
complaint<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.790> is<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.780> forced

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
complaint is is that you are not forced

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.649 
complaint is is that you are not forced
to<00:01:07.409> move<00:01:07.560> forward<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.310> sometimes<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.180> feels<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to move forward and sometimes it feels a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.140 
to move forward and sometimes it feels a
little<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.380> clunky<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.280> character<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.729> get

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
little bit clunky your character can get

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.390 
little bit clunky your character can get
kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.630> stuck<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> walls<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.950> as

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
kind of stuck to the walls a bit and as

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.620 
kind of stuck to the walls a bit and as
a<00:01:14.430> result<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.210> those<00:01:15.330> tight

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
a result when you're in those tight

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.850 
a result when you're in those tight
situations<00:01:16.320> where<00:01:16.470> you've<00:01:16.560> got<00:01:16.680> people

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
situations where you've got people

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.490 
situations where you've got people
coming<00:01:17.220> after<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.750> sometimes<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> die

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
coming after you sometimes you will die

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
coming after you sometimes you will die
you'll<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.520> eaten<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> shouldn't<00:01:21.630> have

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
you'll get eaten when you shouldn't have

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.090 
you'll get eaten when you shouldn't have
when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> should<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.140> been<00:01:22.200> moving<00:01:22.590> forward

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
when you should have been moving forward

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a nice little game completely remade

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.300

just<00:01:49.229> another<00:01:49.470> example<00:01:49.619> of<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> power<00:01:50.159> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just another example of the power of

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
project spark so I thought that was

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
project spark so I thought that was
pretty<00:01:52.140> interesting<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> was<00:01:53.520> pretty

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
pretty interesting and I was pretty

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
pretty interesting and I was pretty

for longer map features that i can do
because<00:02:08.759> i<00:02:08.849> really<00:02:09.090> don't<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.450> doing<00:02:10.050> these
