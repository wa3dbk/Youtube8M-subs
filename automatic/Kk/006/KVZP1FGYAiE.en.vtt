00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 deal with the sequel is not very popular 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.719
 crazy taxi on android which in its 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.329
 the queue is nothing more than a copy on 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.510
 popular crazy taxi driver compass 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 also created sega teams in the distant 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.649
 two thousandths if the first part had 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.500
 a bunch of problems with running and optimizing on 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.390
 many devices then everything is smooth and 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.030
 no apparent problems detected 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.159
 except that he donat a considerable whine on himself 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.509
 does not affect the gameplay and mean MNA 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.509
 fan part of it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 so if there are those who do not 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.789
 never heard of this game 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
 write literally in a nutshell you 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.679
 play as a taxi driver who represents 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.679
 the exact opposite of the taxi driver 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.890
 in real life it is an image of the secret desire of all 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.459
 Drivers puffing traffic jams to hell with everything 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.929
 all on ram yes without consequences 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.119
 the only condition during bring 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.880
 passengers who just cum from 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.579
 pleasures with your frills and you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.220
 you get bonuses for tricks as well 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.979
 that drive on traffic rules and up 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.250
 smashing everything and everyone casually looking at 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.659
 time timer 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.390
 despite the fact that the game is not 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.319
 racing is not devoid of and many attributes 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.049
 serious games 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.540
 for example there are five cars that you 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.519
 will gradually acquire the truth for 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.760
 game currency is available only three of 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.670
 of them 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.530
 the rest for majors will be like in life 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.500
 we and improve our performance 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.690
 vehicle so much for its 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 indestructibility machine can hardly be called well, 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.799
 tuning elements are also present 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.650
 which further transform your car 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.959
 into something armor piercing with cool 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.940
 but we earn on upgrades and tuning 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.370
 will be on several maps which 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.709
 open in order to open 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.410
 new need to bring important people with 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.180
 previous is in the game and random 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.430
 passengers who can also 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.859
 earn some money plus everything 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:57.090
 new characters are also opening 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.280
 add bonus departure more pro 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.069
 functional talk and nothing all 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.379
 attention directly 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.459
 on the road I will immediately note the management 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.790
 which may initially be 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.799
 somewhat uncomfortable but after quickly 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.439
 you get used to it and everything comes back to normal 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.530
 it is borrowed from ra temper where there is no 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.299
 the gateway is moving along the lanes 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.909
 appearance of the game in the spirit of sega it means 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.639
 everything is very juicy colorful dynamic 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.370
 perky and bright graphics with cool 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:27.650
 animation can not leave indifferent 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.870
 Well, about the music in the game a separate speech 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.180
 crazy taxi is an example of how 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.819
 the right music can 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.919
 change gameplay 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.349
 perky rock compositions just at times 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.840
 raise the positive from the local atmosphere 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:46.010
 but until another from sega wait and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.609
 not necessary as a result of the game turned out 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.549
 with a bang 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.280
 if you are bored or just want to drive something 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.319
 games about this will certainly help you well 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.199
 you can not play it without a smile on your face 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.689
 believe the word one minus donat 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:01.430
 if you want a powerful machine or super 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.010
 cool tuning you have to go to 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.519
 terminal and although where are the games now without 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.919
 of this 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.519
 glad that there are no gas canisters with 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.780
 driving restrictions and at least thanks 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.299
 ride for fun and not 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.459
