00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.890
 hello everyone then a schedule 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.750
 so need fast map and the 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.240
 pure and simple cards are ideal for 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.130
 we always talk about a base of 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.439
 cards actually it's me who called 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.349
 pure and simple soccer because in 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.670
 English we say yes again a map to 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.110
 a thick and I found that it was 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.750
 not very nice so I call 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.440
 more a simple pure because that is that 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.449
 cardboard 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:37.090
 I think most of the time 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.010
 white cardboard or vanilla is simple because 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.640
 that it is done very quickly and very 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.350
 simply 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.580
 it's often the anchoring techniques 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.699
 so we'll see today we're going 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.559
 work from home stencils then 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.629
 I took mena perforator circus a 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.879
 to be or again and if I believe this is 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.409
 circle an inch no matter 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.479
 and then I perform on a street 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:57.430
 of arles the cardstock then 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.650
 I was taking a scrap paper and 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.909
 I punctured my narrow circle still there 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.900
 in there too and I'm going to 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.140
 explain why 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.000
 so I go with painters and christmas 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.119
 but I liked a lot 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.729
 the other color model that I you 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:16.000
 offer here it's very pretty I think 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.060
 it's a different look so carom 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.730
 caracol swimming pool and olive green here 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.370
 and I was leaning with my vow in black 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.830
 to stop bossi with the vow goffri in 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.280
 money so that would have reminded the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.440
 small the small crystals then lasted 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.960
 wrapped it out very important and we 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.330
 comes complete with the smooth I'm going 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 show now the version that I you 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.820
 shows today she is no longer the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.860
 more traditional core though I have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.570
 kept caracol carom because I 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 found that it gave punch that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.210
 gives energy and it changes us from 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.220
 traditional red green blue glass and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.710
 probably blue night or something 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.570
 like that I find that his pocket but 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.240
 I admit that I have a weakness for this one 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.830
 which is very modern but good I have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 all my expenses are ready 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.490
 so I take my nice house choice 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.849
 why I took the card stock 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.849
 because I'm just going to come 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.220
 spend my sponge here jean crd in 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.120
 carembault because because and I saw 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.799
 circular way and I like to keep 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.540
 where it's a bit darker than 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.420
 others but all came to do 13 and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.150
 equals look if these egos I did 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.010
 there is forgiveness so that's what it gives 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.900
 and working a little paper 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.909
 hardback 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.409
 it allows me to be able to go enough 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.530
 loud enough fast enough without my 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.030
 leaf moves as it is a cardboard box 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.569
 be careful to get out of our 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.299
 zoned 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.250
 here it is this armed risk is there I 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.650
 always take the same nightmare but 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.290
 know that if for example in the city 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.690
 zen a dozen to do probably 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.970
 that believes him to end up stained and do 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.260
 a mix of brand because when we 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.329
 uses complementary colors 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.390
 together it ends up making bronze 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.239
 this destiny probably so we have 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.819
 I keep seals in the game 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.069
 left of my creation 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.069
 you can vary in letters everywhere if 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.390
 you need and it is done very quickly you 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.040
 have seen how to know more and more 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.209
 of ink so it seems a little bit 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.489
 I'm trying to shift but circle in fact 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.980
 I do not think too much when I do 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.410
 I would have a minute and if I leave if 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.419
 I minute without speaking without explaining 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.130
 nothing there I can do several 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.549
 several in ten minutes that is very 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.209
 good 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.160
 so here I show you why yes we 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.410
 could add I want to show that 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.810
 do not know it's obligatory but I find 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.819
 how nice is the smallest circle 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.650
 actually come back in letters and I 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.639
 overlaps the colors that makes paul 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.069
 and at all the overlap like this 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:53.310
 son-in - law is perhaps better towards here for 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.549
 just make a quick reminder 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.069
 ok so let's go with festive rice that 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.459
 is very beautiful I took the smallest 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.370
 flake and why am I taking my country where 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.940
 he takes my box just 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.519
 because in nana and too bad if I have a 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.620
 cardboard I have a lot of effort there goes there 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.099
 have a holy demarcation along the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.799
 circle 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.840
 what I do not want to have ok then we 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.239
 do all the same colors it's this 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.080
 would be done twice 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.849
 it was our being of course me I 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.949
 my unhappy temples next door 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:33.180
 my stand and from here comes the waves 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.389
 when I always take the same 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.889
 I could have done different too 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.599
 the others are bigger but stop 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.630
 pretty in having only a part yesterday 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.160
 so if you have the time you can 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.810
 make efforts 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.610
 look how pretty I was going 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.319
 forget that it takes us a 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.259
 envelope with that and there we will go to 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.599
 added our ve as I said I them 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.130
 pray in black 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.979
 me it comes here from the game I like 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.840
 so much timeless view get yourself 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.880
 the iie really great and many 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.919
 different writing several lengths 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.710
 and thickness of wants so I'm going 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.949
 overlapping little bit I repeat the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:20.490
 waffles and as I said earlier and 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:23.210
 then have completed with crystals of 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.210
 reign 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.919
 I call and put them simply as 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:32.190
 here in the center of my flakes do you see 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.039
 where I went randomly like here 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:40.710
 I find that no matter it's done I 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:43.979
 I 'll go to the center 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.219
 flakes and we can add some too 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.680
 in our smallest circuses 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.419
 do you see start to take the time 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.520
 and complete with the touch flute 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.380
 to know if the shimmer besnier which 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.130
 father sells this temp and here I come 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.810
 to open my to open it when we brew 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.090
 I recommend the arm is like 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.819
 that from left to right and not from high to 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.940
 down it's going to prevent this from being brought to 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:12.180
 what to block in the small contribution to 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.849
 actors people do not see much about 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.310
 the wall white wall that can bring out 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.169
 a little bit I will show when we 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.030
 puts thick but it makes the dimension 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.009
 that you can look pretty the most 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.490
 big tasks you'll see on the 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.650
 pics 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.259
 so we of course make an envelope 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.849
 to complete and we also put 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.409
 sweet fly look trends 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.260
 evoking turning but also on 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:35.690
 English 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.880
 then the modern version and the version 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.220
 more classic but still 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.920
 with the touch of modernity brought by 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.360
 caracol carom so I hope that 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.360
 you like good day
