the siege lets you build really stupid
things<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.689> build<00:00:03.870> anything<00:00:04.170> but<00:00:04.560> often

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980

great I mean just take this level you
meant<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.120> destroy<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> thing<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.290> way

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
meant to destroy the thing all the way

meant to destroy the thing all the way
up<00:00:13.590> there<00:00:13.830> on<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.340> hilltop<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.150> could

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
up there on the hilltop now could

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.599 
up there on the hilltop now could
construct<00:00:15.900> something<00:00:16.199> really<00:00:16.740> complicated

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
construct something really complicated

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730

to<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.000> there<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.840> instead<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.380> build

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
to get up there but instead I just build

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.609 
to get up there but instead I just build
this<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.970> no<00:00:21.150> ways<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.570> elegant<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.170> smart

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this and in no ways it elegant or smart

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.640 
this and in no ways it elegant or smart
but<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.760> works<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> editor<00:00:27.750> now<00:00:28.170> there<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
but it works but the editor now there is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.160 
but it works but the editor now there is
elegant<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.340> smart<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.449> let<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.750> build<00:00:30.929> with

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
elegant and smart you let you build with

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
elegant and smart you let you build with
ease<00:00:31.349> really<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.520> your<00:00:32.669> mind<00:00:32.880> running

add<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.290> oh<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.489> lots<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.570> rotating

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
add to this oh I know lots of rotating

add to this oh I know lots of rotating
saw<00:00:40.440> blades<00:00:40.800> they'll<00:00:41.250> work<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:46.610> don't<00:00:47.610> work

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
saw blades they'll work I don't work

Pistons

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
Pistons

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.760 
Pistons
you<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:54.750> need<00:00:54.899> wheels<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.500> he'd<00:00:55.620> got

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you don't need wheels when he'd got

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.580 
you don't need wheels when he'd got
Pistons<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:57.000> somehow<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.480> managed<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.379> make

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Pistons but somehow I managed to make

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.610 
Pistons but somehow I managed to make
the<00:00:58.800> Pistons<00:00:59.340> work<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.239> jump<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.199> make<00:01:01.379> its

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the Pistons work and jump and make its

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
the Pistons work and jump and make its
way<00:01:01.680> around<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.910> buildings<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
way around to all these buildings and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.940 
way around to all these buildings and
burn<00:01:03.899> them<00:01:04.260> down<00:01:04.880> brilliant<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.710> level

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
burn them down brilliant and this level

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.980 
burn them down brilliant and this level
you<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> kill<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.939> arches<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.420> destroy

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

you have to kill the arches and destroy
the<00:01:10.229> tower<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.130> I've<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.700> wanted<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the tower and I've really wanted to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
the tower and I've really wanted to
build<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.570> flying<00:01:13.049> bomber<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.549> did<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
build a flying bomber so I did and of

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.999 
build a flying bomber so I did and of
course<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.450> didn't<00:01:18.630> work<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:19.950> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
course it didn't work first time but I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.700 
course it didn't work first time but I
kept<00:01:20.280> working<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.970> him<00:01:21.180> kept<00:01:21.960> adding<00:01:22.380> pieces

kept working on him kept adding pieces

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.929 
kept working on him kept adding pieces
taking<00:01:23.549> pieces<00:01:24.000> away<00:01:24.150> till<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> had<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.700> no<00:01:26.700> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
taking pieces away till I had it no it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.200 
taking pieces away till I had it no it
wasn't<00:01:27.299> perfect<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.259> pretty<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> worked

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.450 

not<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> levels<00:01:34.530> are<00:01:34.620> about<00:01:34.890> destroying

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
not all the levels are about destroying

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.880 
not all the levels are about destroying
things<00:01:35.850> though<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.080> level<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.590> was

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
things though or this level was was

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.280 
things though or this level was was
moving<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:38.880> wood<00:01:38.910> up<00:01:39.510> onto<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> middle

platform as if you could do that you
could<00:01:42.510> move<00:01:42.690> on<00:01:42.960> built<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.770> Mars<00:01:44.010> robot

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
could move on built this Mars robot

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.630

well that still counts now it's time for

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.370 
well that still counts now it's time for
the<00:01:53.520> greatest<00:01:53.880> thing<00:01:54.210> I've<00:01:54.510> ever<00:01:54.630> built<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the greatest thing I've ever built the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.460 
the greatest thing I've ever built the
mech<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.940> pure<00:01:57.360> killing<00:01:57.780> machine<00:01:58.200> has<00:01:58.440> the

mech this pure killing machine has the
ability<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.220> punch<00:01:59.670> yourself<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.390> face

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
ability to punch yourself in the face

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.340 
ability to punch yourself in the face
which<00:02:01.650> might<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:01.979> sound<00:02:02.280> useful<00:02:03.350> when

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
which might not sound useful when

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.340 
which might not sound useful when
because<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.860> isn't<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.369> Lex<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.330> sort<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.050> work

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
because it isn't a Lex that sort of work

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.520 
because it isn't a Lex that sort of work
okay<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.550> wheels<00:02:08.820> on<00:02:09.119> them<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:10.140> I'm<00:02:10.259> still

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
okay I put wheels on them but I'm still

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.390 
okay I put wheels on them but I'm still
