00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
encryption module from the separatists

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
encryption module from the separatists
and<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> reason<00:00:15.240> why<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.660> needed<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.049> do

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
and the reason why they needed to do

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.680 
and the reason why they needed to do
this<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.609> Jedi<00:00:17.910> Council<00:00:18.119> are

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
this was because the Jedi Council are
intercepted<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.560> message<00:00:19.710> from<00:00:20.100> General

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
Grievous however they can't decode the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.420 
Grievous however they can't decode the
message<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.490> Jedi<00:00:23.670> Council<00:00:23.939> fear<00:00:24.480> that

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
message and the Jedi Council fear that

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.679 
message and the Jedi Council fear that
pretty<00:00:26.430> much<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.789> separatists<00:00:27.150> are<00:00:27.359> planning

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
encryption module so that they can be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.569 
encryption module so that they can be
able<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.450> decipher<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.020> message<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.649> within

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
me it's been a long day so pretty much

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.390 
me it's been a long day so pretty much
you<00:03:55.930> know<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.230> whole<00:03:56.410> thing<00:03:56.680> with<00:03:56.859> stuff<00:03:57.160> and

infiltration into the separatist ship I

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.520 
infiltration into the separatist ship I
thought<00:03:59.859> was<00:04:00.100> pretty<00:04:00.549> well<00:04:00.850> done<00:04:00.880> and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
thought was pretty well done and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.170 
thought was pretty well done and
the<00:04:03.310> ending<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.700> know<00:04:03.790> there<00:04:03.910> wasn't<00:04:04.060> really

pretty cool to see you know the droid

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.350

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
was cool to see r2d2 an important

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.270 
was cool to see r2d2 an important
position<00:05:37.600> where<00:05:38.229> you<00:05:38.560> know<00:05:38.710> with<00:05:38.919> this<00:05:39.039> new

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
position where you know with this new

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.710 
position where you know with this new
arcs<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.729> his<00:05:39.910> pretty<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.390> it's<00:05:40.510> going<00:05:40.600> to<00:05:40.660> be

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
arcs and his pretty so it's going to be

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.540 
arcs and his pretty so it's going to be
under<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.020> four-part<00:05:41.650> arc<00:05:41.890> because<00:05:42.310> I<00:05:42.430> have

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
under the four-part arc because I have

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.980 
under the four-part arc because I have
to<00:05:42.669> say<00:05:42.850> first<00:05:43.090> of<00:05:43.240> all<00:05:43.419> I'm<00:05:43.479> surprised<00:05:43.870> that

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
to say first of all I'm surprised that

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.510 
to say first of all I'm surprised that
with<00:05:44.200> this<00:05:44.380> season<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:44.800> they<00:05:45.039> go<00:05:45.220> on<00:05:45.280> about

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
with this season that they go on about

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.120 
with this season that they go on about
this<00:05:45.880> by<00:05:46.120> arcs<00:05:46.510> because<00:05:47.140> in<00:05:47.320> the<00:05:47.380> past<00:05:47.530> seasons

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
this by arcs because in the past seasons

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.469 
this by arcs because in the past seasons
what<00:05:48.370> they<00:05:48.460> did<00:05:48.669> was<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:48.970> they<00:05:49.030> would<00:05:49.270> have

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
what they did was that they would have

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.810 
what they did was that they would have
individual<00:05:50.470> episodes<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:51.160> then<00:05:51.340> they'll

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
individual episodes and then they'll

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.120 
individual episodes and then they'll
have<00:05:52.000> like<00:05:52.210> an<00:05:52.390> arc<00:05:52.630> here<00:05:52.960> and<00:05:53.110> now<00:05:53.410> they<00:05:53.740> used

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
have like an arc here and now they used

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.490 
have like an arc here and now they used
to<00:05:54.220> be<00:05:54.280> like<00:05:54.370> what<00:05:54.550> two<00:05:54.729> arcs<00:05:55.120> per<00:05:55.390> season<00:05:55.750> or

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
to be like what two arcs per season or

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.800 
to be like what two arcs per season or
something<00:05:56.950> like<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.100> two<00:05:57.610> or<00:05:57.729> three<00:05:57.789> but<00:05:58.630> you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
something like that two or three but you

like about it predictions for the cloaca
mando<00:07:18.820> Gregor<00:07:19.090> when<00:07:19.360> he<00:07:19.510> introduced<00:07:19.930> when<00:07:20.289> he

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410 
mando Gregor when he introduced when he

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.589 
mando Gregor when he introduced when he
gets<00:07:20.620> introduced<00:07:20.979> later<00:07:21.130> on<00:07:21.430> and<00:07:21.789> I'm

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 
gets introduced later on and I'm

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.240 
gets introduced later on and I'm
actually<00:07:22.840> it's<00:07:23.620> actually<00:07:23.950> interesting

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
actually it's actually interesting

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.440 
actually it's actually interesting
because<00:07:24.520> if<00:07:24.940> this<00:07:25.060> is<00:07:25.180> going<00:07:25.270> to<00:07:25.360> be<00:07:25.419> a

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
because if this is going to be a

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.450 
because if this is going to be a
four-part<00:07:28.020> mark<00:07:29.020> I<00:07:29.260> think<00:07:29.740> that<00:07:29.919> perhaps<00:07:30.130> may

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
four-part mark I think that perhaps may

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.610 
four-part mark I think that perhaps may
be<00:07:30.520> in<00:07:31.090> next<00:07:31.419> week's<00:07:31.690> episode<00:07:31.780> the<00:07:32.289> droids<00:07:32.530> are

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
be in next week's episode the droids are

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.230 
be in next week's episode the droids are
going<00:07:32.770> to<00:07:32.830> go<00:07:32.919> after<00:07:33.099> the<00:07:33.280> sip<00:07:33.639> and<00:07:33.669> then<00:07:33.940> they

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
going to go after the sip and then they

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.909 
going to go after the sip and then they
gonna<00:07:34.419> land<00:07:34.630> on<00:07:34.750> Tatooine<00:07:35.380> because<00:07:35.650> I<00:07:35.710> think

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
gonna land on Tatooine because I think

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.770 
gonna land on Tatooine because I think
that's<00:07:36.099> when<00:07:36.760> they<00:07:36.880> had<00:07:37.000> to<00:07:37.090> preview<00:07:37.539> with<00:07:37.690> the

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:37.780 
that's when they had to preview with the

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.750 
that's when they had to preview with the
clone<00:07:37.990> commando<00:07:38.470> I<00:07:38.770> believe<00:07:39.220> the<00:07:39.310> planet<00:07:39.639> was

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:39.760 
clone commando I believe the planet was

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.969 
clone commando I believe the planet was
on<00:07:39.910> Kathleen<00:07:40.510> so<00:07:40.750> maybe<00:07:40.930> that<00:07:41.169> happens<00:07:41.590> who

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:41.979 
on Kathleen so maybe that happens who

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:44.850 
on Kathleen so maybe that happens who
knows<00:07:42.220> but<00:07:42.520> um<00:07:43.240> yeah<00:07:43.810> it<00:07:44.169> does<00:07:44.320> not<00:07:44.530> belong

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860 
knows but um yeah it does not belong

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.980 
knows but um yeah it does not belong
