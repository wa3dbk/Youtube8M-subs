around eyebrows and mouth

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
around eyebrows and mouth
I<00:01:58.140> guess<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:59.640> type<00:01:59.909> of<00:01:59.939> serious

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I guess this type of serious

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.590 
I guess this type of serious
surprisingly<00:02:01.289> works<00:02:01.649> well<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.299> those<00:02:03.299> tiny

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
surprisingly works well for those tiny

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.999 
surprisingly works well for those tiny
hairs<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:05.299> are<00:02:06.299> left<00:02:06.569> behind<00:02:07.069> when<00:02:08.069> you

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
hairs that are left behind when you

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.000 
hairs that are left behind when you
chase<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.280> eyebrows<00:02:12.470> once<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:15.739> brush<00:02:16.739> with

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
chase for eyebrows once you brush with

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.030 
chase for eyebrows once you brush with
it<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.819> can<00:02:18.030> easily<00:02:18.450> shave<00:02:19.230> them<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
it you can easily shave them this is the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.759 
it you can easily shave them this is the
blockage<00:02:27.950> they'd<00:02:28.950> never<00:02:29.130> seen<00:02:30.030> before

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
blockage they'd never seen before

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.539 
blockage they'd never seen before
I'm<00:02:31.769> guessing<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:34.069> get<00:02:35.069> under<00:02:35.250> your

I'm guessing this is to get under your
nails<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.480> clean<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:37.340> or<00:02:38.340> something<00:02:38.670> like
