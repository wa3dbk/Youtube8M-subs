00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
like your traditional front-facing

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.480 
like your traditional front-facing
cameras<00:00:15.599> so<00:00:15.929> I'm<00:00:16.500> gonna<00:00:16.619> be<00:00:16.800> testing<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.190> all

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
cameras so I'm gonna be testing out all

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.460 
cameras so I'm gonna be testing out all
of<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.510> eight<00:00:18.720> megapixel<00:00:18.900> camera

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
of this and the eight megapixel camera

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.609 
of this and the eight megapixel camera
on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> back<00:00:19.830> videos<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.760> photos<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:21.900> video

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
on the back videos and photos so video

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.120 
on the back videos and photos so video
and<00:00:23.510> the<00:00:24.510> front-facing<00:00:24.810> camera<00:00:25.529> takes

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and the front-facing camera takes

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.359 
and the front-facing camera takes
wide-angle<00:00:27.029> shots<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.539> well<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.109> stills<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
wide-angle shots as well on stills so it

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.429 
wide-angle shots as well on stills so it
does<00:00:29.519> pretty<00:00:29.760> good<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.539> looks<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.960> good

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
does pretty good and it looks very good

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
but as you can see here the 8 megapixel

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.520 
but as you can see here the 8 megapixel
camera<00:00:33.690> has<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> 2.0<00:00:34.890> f-stop<00:00:35.880> camera<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.260> it's

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the same camera that they've been

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.470 
the same camera that they've been
putting<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> ACC<00:00:39.840> One<00:00:40.050> X<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.360> really<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
putting in the ACC One X and really the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.900 
putting in the ACC One X and really the
big<00:00:42.660> competitor<00:00:43.230> here<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.160> Nokia<00:00:44.760> Lumia

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
big competitor here is the Nokia Lumia

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
big competitor here is the Nokia Lumia
920<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.020> has<00:00:46.230> optical<00:00:46.649> stabilization<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
920 which has optical stabilization and

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.270 
920 which has optical stabilization and
really<00:00:48.750> good<00:00:48.930> low-light<00:00:49.200> photography<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.190> if

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
really good low-light photography but if

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.220 
really good low-light photography but if
you<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.820> images<00:00:51.300> are<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.660> crisp

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
you see here the images are really crisp

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.750 
you see here the images are really crisp
and<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> looks<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.309> good

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
and it looks really good

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.080 
and it looks really good
probably<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> best<00:00:54.899> Windows<00:00:55.410> Phone

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
probably one of the best Windows Phone

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
probably one of the best Windows Phone
cameras<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.329> I've<00:00:57.480> seen<00:00:57.809> besides<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.620> Nokia

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
cameras that I've seen besides the Nokia

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.160 
cameras that I've seen besides the Nokia
Lumia<00:00:59.070> 920<00:00:59.789> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:00.840> gives

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
Lumia 920 and I think this really gives

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.479 
Lumia 920 and I think this really gives
it<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> run<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.680> its<00:01:01.800> money<00:01:01.829> look<00:01:02.280> at<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it a run for its money look at the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
it a run for its money look at the
low-light<00:01:02.850> performance<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.739> yeah<00:01:04.739> shows

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
low-light performance here yeah shows

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.039 
low-light performance here yeah shows
some<00:01:05.339> grain<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> what

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
some grain here and there and what

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.050 
some grain here and there and what
camera<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.619> doesn't<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.640> does<00:01:08.760> pretty

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
camera really doesn't but it does pretty

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
camera really doesn't but it does pretty
good<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.510> low-light<00:01:09.840> conditions<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.590> mean

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
good in low-light conditions I mean

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
good in low-light conditions I mean
these<00:01:11.210> are<00:01:12.210> definitely<00:01:12.570> passable<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
these are definitely passable and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
these are definitely passable and
they're<00:01:13.710> usable<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:15.270> know<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> good

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
they're usable and you know it's a good

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
they're usable and you know it's a good
pocket<00:01:16.140> camera<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.250> even<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.670> harsh

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
pocket camera to have and even in harsh

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
pocket camera to have and even in harsh
lighting<00:01:18.360> conditions<00:01:18.840> like<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.229> LED<00:01:19.619> light

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
lighting conditions like this LED light

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.730 
lighting conditions like this LED light
is<00:01:20.100> still<00:01:20.369> focused<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> took<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:22.590> at

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
is still focused and took it and here at

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.550 
is still focused and took it and here at
Disney<00:01:23.130> World<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.560> noisy

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
Disney World you can see it is noisy

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.249 
Disney World you can see it is noisy
little<00:01:26.280> grainy<00:01:26.610> but<00:01:27.000> these<00:01:27.330> shots<00:01:27.659> definitely

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
little grainy but these shots definitely

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
little grainy but these shots definitely
pass<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.390> it'll<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.840> okay<00:01:31.320> even

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
pass and I think that it'll be okay even

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.890 
pass and I think that it'll be okay even
if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> were<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.000> dark<00:01:33.329> but

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
if you were to use this in the dark but

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600 
if you were to use this in the dark but
flash<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.439> kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> another<00:01:34.890> story<00:01:35.220> here's<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
flash is kind of another story here's a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.330 
flash is kind of another story here's a
shot<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.479> no<00:01:36.689> flash<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> then<00:01:37.920> taken

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
shot here with no flash and then taken

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
shot here with no flash and then taken
with<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.670> flash<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> flash<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:40.079> exposes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
with the flash so the flash over exposes

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.800 
with the flash so the flash over exposes
but<00:01:41.040> that's<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.490> most<00:01:41.880> mobile<00:01:42.210> cameras

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
but that's like most mobile cameras

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.109 
but that's like most mobile cameras
there's<00:01:43.049> nothing<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.710> different<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
there's nothing really different but you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
there's nothing really different but you
can<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.990> flash<00:01:46.290> definitely

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
can see here that the flash definitely

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.590 
can see here that the flash definitely
is<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> little<00:01:47.579> weak<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:47.939> then<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
is a little weak but then when it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
is a little weak but then when it
sometimes<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.380> tends<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> overexpose<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
sometimes it tends to overexpose but the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
sometimes it tends to overexpose but the
1080p<00:01:51.810> video<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.710> definitely<00:01:53.009> something

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
1080p video here is definitely something

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.139 
1080p video here is definitely something
to<00:01:53.640> talk<00:01:53.820> about

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to talk about

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.929 
to talk about
look<00:01:54.509> at<00:01:54.689> how<00:01:54.840> clean<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.590> video<00:01:55.979> looks<00:01:56.369> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
look at how clean this video looks and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.249 
look at how clean this video looks and
really<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> best<00:01:58.049> lighting

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
really it's not the best lighting

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.530 
really it's not the best lighting
condition<00:01:58.829> outside<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.430> was<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> cloudy<00:01:59.880> day<00:02:00.030> at

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
condition outside it was a cloudy day at

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.080 
condition outside it was a cloudy day at
Epcot<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> see<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.729> just

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
Epcot and you can see here that it just

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
Epcot and you can see here that it just
looks<00:02:03.780> stunning<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.320> mean<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.560> think<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
looks stunning I mean I think that it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.180 
looks stunning I mean I think that it
translated<00:02:05.939> even<00:02:06.149> better<00:02:06.390> off<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.860> device

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
translated even better off the device

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.320 
translated even better off the device
because<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.640> looked<00:02:08.789> really<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because it looked really good on the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.080 
because it looked really good on the
device<00:02:09.629> but<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.929> think<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> looks<00:02:10.440> much

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
device but I think it looks much

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.290 
device but I think it looks much
here<00:02:12.020> than<00:02:12.349> I<00:02:12.470> expected<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.340> look<00:02:13.610> at<00:02:13.730> how<00:02:13.910> good

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
here than I expected so look at how good

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.780 
here than I expected so look at how good
it<00:02:14.599> is<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.349> let<00:02:15.500> me<00:02:15.590> let<00:02:15.800> you<00:02:15.830> listen<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
it is and let me let you listen to the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.940 
it is and let me let you listen to the
sound<00:02:17.120> here<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.319> microphone<00:02:18.770> does<00:02:18.920> a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
sound here for the microphone does a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:27.410 
sound here for the microphone does a
good<00:02:19.099> job<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.430> well

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.869 

now<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.480> 8<00:02:28.750> megapixel<00:02:29.409> camera<00:02:29.830> on<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.040> ACCA

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
now the 8 megapixel camera on the ACCA

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.910 
now the 8 megapixel camera on the ACCA
Tech's<00:02:31.299> does<00:02:31.569> support<00:02:31.959> continuous<00:02:32.560> autofocus

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
Tech's does support continuous autofocus

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.789 
Tech's does support continuous autofocus
and<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:34.209> can<00:02:34.390> see<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.019> autofocus<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
and you can see that it autofocus is

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.199 
and you can see that it autofocus is
very<00:02:36.099> quickly<00:02:36.430> actually

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
very quickly actually

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.569 
very quickly actually
so<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.780> autofocus<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.500> definitely<00:02:39.069> good<00:02:39.310> and

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
so the autofocus is definitely good and

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.729 
so the autofocus is definitely good and
even<00:02:40.090> on<00:02:40.209> moving<00:02:40.569> subjects<00:02:41.170> such<00:02:41.349> as<00:02:41.379> this

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
even on moving subjects such as this

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.430 
even on moving subjects such as this
duck<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.459> looks<00:02:42.730> really<00:02:43.150> good<00:02:43.329> and<00:02:43.629> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
duck it looks really good and I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.640 
duck it looks really good and I
definitely<00:02:44.950> give<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.370> top-notch<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:47.019> 1080p

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
definitely give a top-notch to the 1080p

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.960 
definitely give a top-notch to the 1080p
video<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.269> HTC<00:02:49.989> 8x<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:51.010> I<00:02:51.370> think<00:02:51.700> that<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
video on the HTC 8x and I think that the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.449 
video on the HTC 8x and I think that the
video<00:02:52.269> is<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.569> little<00:02:52.780> crisper<00:02:53.379> than<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.129> Nokia

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
video is a little crisper than the Nokia

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.640 
video is a little crisper than the Nokia
Lumia<00:02:54.489> 920<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.780> can<00:02:55.900> see<00:02:55.989> here<00:02:56.140> even<00:02:56.319> in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
Lumia 920 and you can see here even in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.369 
Lumia 920 and you can see here even in
low-light<00:02:57.069> conditions<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:58.180> not<00:02:58.720> much<00:02:59.019> light

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
low-light conditions here not much light

this camera I mean you guys own an 8x or
thinking<00:03:16.420> about<00:03:16.599> getting<00:03:16.780> an<00:03:17.019> 8x<00:03:17.470> but<00:03:18.040> you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430
