00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 Last night I dreamed about San Pedro 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.200
 It's like I've never left, I knew the song 

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:23.201
 A young woman with eyes like the desert 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.500
 Everything seemed like yesterday, Not so distant. 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.000
 The breeze of the tropical island Filled with wild and free nature 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.400
 This is where I want to be, The beautiful island 

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:43.101
 And when it sounds like samba The sun sets on high 

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:47.502
 It resounds in my ears and it sticks in my eyes Your Spanish whisper. 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.700
 I fell in love with San Pedro 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.700
 A warm wind lulled the sea, it called me: 

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:11.601
 "He told you I love you" 

00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:16.702
 I prayed that the days would last But these went away so fast 

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.403
 The breeze of the tropical island Filled with wild and free nature 

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:26.504
 This is where I want to be, The beautiful island 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.000
 And when it sounds like samba The sun sets on high 

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:35.501
 It resounds in my ears and it sticks in my eyes Your Spanish whisper. 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.000
 I want to be where the sun warms the sky 

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:54.701
 When it's nap time you can watch them go by 

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:59.502
 Beautiful faces, No worries in this world 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 Where a girl loves a boy, And the boy ... 

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.501
 ... love the girl. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.800
 Last night I dreamed about San Pedro 

00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.201
 Everything seemed like yesterday, very close. 

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:30.902
 The breeze of the tropical island Filled with wild and free nature 

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:36.203
 This is where I want to be, The beautiful island 

00:02:36.604 --> 00:02:40.904
 And when it sounds like samba The sun sets on high 

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:45.705
 It resounds in my ears and it sticks in my eyes Your Spanish whisper. 

00:02:46.906 --> 00:02:50.906
 The breeze of the tropical island Filled with wild and free nature 

00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:56.507
 This is where I want to be, The beautiful island 

00:02:56.908 --> 00:03:01.108
 And when it sounds like samba The sun sets on high 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.409
 It resounds in my ears and it sticks in my eyes Your Spanish whisper. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Your Spanish whisper. 

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.701
 Your Spanish whisper.
