00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
this study from Bordeaux were calm and

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.960 
this study from Bordeaux were calm and
i'll<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.460> doing<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.700> review<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> kingston

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
i'll be doing a review of the kingston

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.200 
i'll be doing a review of the kingston
UHS<00:00:08.970> 1<00:00:09.300> 2<00:00:09.960> 3<00:00:09.990> 3<00:00:10.800> x<00:00:11.040> card<00:00:11.429> so<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.030> their

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
UHS 1 2 3 3 x card so this is their

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.600 
UHS 1 2 3 3 x card so this is their
highest<00:00:12.929> flash<00:00:13.380> card<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.009> get<00:00:14.250> from

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
highest flash card you can get from

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.640 
highest flash card you can get from
kingston<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.780> reason<00:00:16.080> why<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.289> is

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
kingston and this is reason why this is

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.880 
kingston and this is reason why this is
not<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> 10th<00:00:17.900> class<00:00:18.900> 10<00:00:19.230> card<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
not a 10th class 10 card this is a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
not a 10th class 10 card this is a
higher<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.460> tap<00:00:20.670> class<00:00:20.970> 10<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> now<00:00:22.140> why<00:00:22.529> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
higher than tap class 10 and now why is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.710 
higher than tap class 10 and now why is
this<00:00:22.980> important<00:00:23.820> why<00:00:23.910> should<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.150> pick<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> if

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this important why should I pick this if

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.390 
this important why should I pick this if
you<00:00:24.900> know<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.080> can<00:00:25.260> get<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> class<00:00:25.619> 10<00:00:25.859> card<00:00:26.130> for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you know I can get a class 10 card for

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.849 
you know I can get a class 10 card for
say<00:00:26.609> slightly<00:00:26.910> cheaper<00:00:27.359> well<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.470> thing<00:00:28.650> here

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
say slightly cheaper well the thing here

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.490 
say slightly cheaper well the thing here
is<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.220> you're<00:00:29.369> into<00:00:29.699> video<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.500> photography

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
is if you're into video of photography

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
storage and use a flash card this is
this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> best<00:00:51.840> card<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.739> for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this is the best card for you to get for

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
this is the best card for you to get for
my<00:00:53.550> money<00:00:53.760> anyway<00:00:54.149> now<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.289> card

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
my money anyway now what this card

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
my money anyway now what this card
allows<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.129> do<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.460> simply<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.510> your

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
allows you to do is simply this your

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.099 
allows you to do is simply this your
Tech's<00:00:58.559> cards<00:00:59.039> usually<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.850> read<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
Tech's cards usually have a read and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.709 
Tech's cards usually have a read and
write<00:01:01.289> speed<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.920> about<00:01:02.070> 15<00:01:02.850> megabits<00:01:03.420> per

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
write speed of about 15 megabits per

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.289 
write speed of about 15 megabits per
second<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.240> for

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
second so that's what you get for

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.620 
second so that's what you get for
transferring<00:01:07.140> videos<00:01:07.530> writing<00:01:08.040> writing

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
transferring videos writing writing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
transferring videos writing writing
recording<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.770> your<00:01:10.950> card<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.369> well<00:01:11.400> as

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
recording on to your card as well as

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
recording on to your card as well as
transfer<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:12.240> computer<00:01:12.420> things<00:01:13.020> like

transfer it to your computer things like

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.210 
transfer it to your computer things like
that<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> card<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:17.070> get

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that now with this card you get you get

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.960 
that now with this card you get you get
a<00:01:17.280> right<00:01:17.880> speed<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> 16<00:01:20.430> megabits<00:01:20.880> per

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
a right speed of up to 16 megabits per

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
a right speed of up to 16 megabits per
second<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.540> then<00:01:21.990> you'll<00:01:22.140> read<00:01:22.350> speeds<00:01:22.740> about

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
second and then you'll read speeds about

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
second and then you'll read speeds about
thirty<00:01:23.100> five<00:01:23.280> megabits<00:01:23.640> per<00:01:23.790> second<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
thirty five megabits per second so this

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.800 
thirty five megabits per second so this
does<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:25.170> good<00:01:25.590> job<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.540> recording<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
does a very good job and recording and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.550 
does a very good job and recording and
and<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:29.240> play<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> playback<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.290> fast

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and also play a playback at very fast

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
and also play a playback at very fast
speeds<00:01:31.890> equal<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.700> with

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
speeds equal to what you have with

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
speeds equal to what you have with
inbuilt<00:01:33.450> storage<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.009> something<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
inbuilt storage so that's something to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
inbuilt storage so that's something to
take<00:01:35.790> note<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
take note and also to have here the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.020 
take note and also to have here the
other<00:01:37.740> cool<00:01:37.950> thing<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.490> card<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
other cool thing about this card is that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.310 
other cool thing about this card is that
reason<00:01:39.329> whether<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> few

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
reason whether this is one of the few

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780 
reason whether this is one of the few
cards<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.860> allows<00:01:41.189> if<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.670> have<00:01:41.759> a

that some transfer this over now it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.980 
that some transfer this over now it
should<00:02:20.530> read<00:02:20.800> probably<00:02:21.190> canon<00:02:21.780> because<00:02:22.780> we've

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
should read probably canon because we've

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.310 
should read probably canon because we've
used<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.530> canon<00:02:23.860> m<00:02:24.240> m<00:02:25.240> 50<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.080> which

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
used it for the canon m m 50 here which

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.200 
used it for the canon m m 50 here which
will<00:02:26.500> do<00:02:26.650> review<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.190> but<00:02:27.490> just<00:02:27.940> wanted<00:02:28.120> to

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
will do review for but just wanted to

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.610 
will do review for but just wanted to
show<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> card<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.050> use<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.440> this

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
show you the card that we use with this

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
show you the card that we use with this
because<00:02:30.040> this<00:02:30.580> has<00:02:30.790> 8<00:02:31.000> gigabytes<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.450> storage

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
because this has 8 gigabytes of storage

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.780 
because this has 8 gigabytes of storage
in<00:02:31.930> here<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.590> we've<00:02:32.710> got<00:02:32.740> this<00:02:32.980> 32<00:02:33.430> gigabyte

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
in here and we've got this 32 gigabyte

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.960 
in here and we've got this 32 gigabyte
card<00:02:34.030> which<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.990> us<00:02:35.080> works<00:02:35.650> well<00:02:35.890> there's<00:02:36.850> no

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
card which for us works well there's no

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.490 
card which for us works well there's no
different<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.630> mean<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.990> feel<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.320> it's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
different I mean we feel like it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.290 
different I mean we feel like it's
actually<00:02:38.770> even<00:02:38.860> faster<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.550> actually<00:02:40.000> reading

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
actually even faster in actually reading

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.360 
actually even faster in actually reading
and<00:02:40.660> transferring<00:02:41.170> video<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.950> that's<00:02:42.130> pretty

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and transferring video so that's pretty

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.060 
and transferring video so that's pretty
cool<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.660> again<00:02:43.750> this<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> very<00:02:44.470> solid

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
cool but again this is a very solid

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.130 
cool but again this is a very solid
simple<00:02:45.580> card<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.660> can<00:02:46.870> get

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
simple card that you can you can get

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.190 
simple card that you can you can get
from<00:02:47.440> Kingston<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.130> out<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.700> use<00:02:49.660> for<00:02:49.690> your

and to show you some of the transfer

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.080 
and to show you some of the transfer
rates<00:03:29.080> on<00:03:29.320> here<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:29.830> we<00:03:30.040> have<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.220> file<00:03:30.730> here<00:03:30.910> we

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
rates on here so we have a file here we

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.970 
rates on here so we have a file here we
take<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:31.360> file<00:03:31.600> i<00:03:31.810> won<00:03:32.410> over<00:03:32.560> videos<00:03:32.830> will<00:03:32.950> be

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
take this file i won over videos will be

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.520 
take this file i won over videos will be
added<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.430> properties<00:03:34.180> see<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.110> file<00:03:35.290> size<00:03:35.500> is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
added in properties see the file size is

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.880 
added in properties see the file size is
248<00:03:36.220> megabits<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.540> it's<00:03:37.660> pretty<00:03:37.840> pretty<00:03:38.650> large

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
248 megabits so it's pretty pretty large

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.080 
248 megabits so it's pretty pretty large
and<00:03:39.160> we're<00:03:39.310> going<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.459> transfer<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.850> just<00:03:40.000> the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
and we're going to transfer it just the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
that drop it right there you can see its

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:07.110 
that drop it right there you can see its
speed<00:04:02.049> at<00:04:02.890> 17<00:04:03.850> 18<00:04:05.220> maximo<00:04:06.220> me<00:04:06.280> get<00:04:06.459> sore<00:04:06.670> for

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
speed at 17 18 maximo me get sore for

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.750 
speed at 17 18 maximo me get sore for
around<00:04:07.330> 20<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:08.980> you<00:04:09.070> get<00:04:09.190> some<00:04:09.310> good<00:04:09.400> speeds

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
around 20 so you get some good speeds

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.699 
around 20 so you get some good speeds
and<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.209> took<00:04:10.480> about<00:04:10.600> five<00:04:11.019> seconds<00:04:11.590> to

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
and that took about five seconds to

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.449 
and that took about five seconds to
transfer<00:04:12.130> 248<00:04:12.850> could<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:14.530> my<00:04:14.680> file<00:04:14.950> yeah

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
transfer 248 could make my file yeah

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.640 
transfer 248 could make my file yeah
even<00:04:15.940> if<00:04:16.000> we<00:04:16.180> do<00:04:16.330> larger<00:04:16.780> file<00:04:16.989> set<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:17.440> if<00:04:17.530> we

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
even if we do larger file set so if we

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.599 
even if we do larger file set so if we
take

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
take

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.300 
take
bunch<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.299> this<00:04:19.479> files<00:04:19.750> here<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.409> this

files in total and your properties of
all<00:04:30.520> six<00:04:30.879> see<00:04:31.270> what<00:04:31.389> we<00:04:31.509> have<00:04:31.659> it<00:04:31.900> we<00:04:32.020> have<00:04:32.050> a

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
all six see what we have it we have a

all six see what we have it we have a
full<00:04:32.919> cake<00:04:33.240> gagan<00:04:34.240> seven<00:04:34.629> so<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.900> transfer

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
full cake gagan seven so we transfer

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:40.350 
full cake gagan seven so we transfer
that<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.530> desktop<00:04:37.319> and<00:04:38.849> see<00:04:39.849> speeds<00:04:40.240> again

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
that to desktop and see speeds again

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.270 
that to desktop and see speeds again
that's<00:04:40.689> still<00:04:41.020> around<00:04:41.139> the<00:04:41.379> same<00:04:41.620> you're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
that's still around the same you're

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.399 
that's still around the same you're
getting<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.699> drop<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.330> speeds<00:04:43.750> there<00:04:44.050> is<00:04:44.289> it

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
getting a drop in speeds there is it

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.200 
getting a drop in speeds there is it
take<00:04:44.770> about<00:04:44.979> a<00:04:45.039> minute<00:04:45.280> four<00:04:45.610> gig<00:04:45.879> which<00:04:46.060> is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
take about a minute four gig which is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.929 
take about a minute four gig which is
pretty<00:04:46.389> good<00:04:46.860> at<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.129> rate<00:04:48.310> we're<00:04:48.490> looking<00:04:48.759> so

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
pretty good at the rate we're looking so

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.240 
pretty good at the rate we're looking so
let's<00:04:49.180> just<00:04:49.300> see<00:04:49.419> how<00:04:49.539> long<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:49.930> takes<00:04:50.250> it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
let's just see how long this takes it

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.350 
let's just see how long this takes it
looks<00:04:51.400> like<00:04:51.520> this<00:04:51.580> would<00:04:51.699> be<00:04:51.729> less<00:04:52.090> than<00:04:52.120> a

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
looks like this would be less than a

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.350 
looks like this would be less than a
minute<00:04:52.629> but<00:04:53.490> we'll<00:04:54.490> check<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.699> out<00:04:54.819> so<00:04:55.150> yes

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
minute but we'll check that out so yes

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.200 
minute but we'll check that out so yes
sir<00:04:55.719> files<00:04:55.930> dropped<00:04:56.879> speed<00:04:57.879> up<00:04:59.490> it<00:05:00.490> meant<00:05:01.090> a

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
sir files dropped speed up it meant a

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.360 
sir files dropped speed up it meant a
maximum<00:05:01.750> about<00:05:01.960> 45<00:05:02.229> megabits<00:05:02.770> per<00:05:02.949> second<00:05:03.310> so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
maximum about 45 megabits per second so

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.119 
maximum about 45 megabits per second so
you<00:05:03.460> can<00:05:03.580> see<00:05:03.759> how<00:05:03.789> well<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.569> does<00:05:05.529> it<00:05:05.740> speeds

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
you can see how well it does it speeds

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.100 
you can see how well it does it speeds
and<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.759> boosts<00:05:07.000> up<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.300> certain<00:05:07.629> area<00:05:07.900> so

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
and it boosts up a certain area so

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.730 
and it boosts up a certain area so
actually<00:05:08.500> help<00:05:09.069> the<00:05:09.430> process<00:05:09.669> and<00:05:10.169> yeah<00:05:11.169> took

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
actually help the process and yeah took

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.529 
actually help the process and yeah took
about<00:05:11.979> maybe<00:05:12.219> about<00:05:12.460> 45<00:05:12.969> seconds<00:05:13.330> there's

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
about maybe about 45 seconds there's

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.469 
about maybe about 45 seconds there's
transfer<00:05:14.129> of<00:05:15.129> data<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.610> that's<00:05:16.180> pretty<00:05:16.360> much

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
transfer of data so that's pretty much

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.760 
transfer of data so that's pretty much
