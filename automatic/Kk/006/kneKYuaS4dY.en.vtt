00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.900
 A familiar Christmas song sounds in 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.850
 this occupation something unusual the 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.300
 innsbrucker bohemian dared to be around 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.320
 one year a musical experiment 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.140
 together with the concert pianist 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 Tobias forster became traditional 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.800
 alpine music with jazz and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.800
 Classic elements combined 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.680
 you also for the first time for the innsbrucker 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.840
 that they work with pianists as guest 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.420
 and for me it is the first time 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.160
 together with his brass band 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.740
 what to do and that was the question 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.020
 yes it fits together how does it mix 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 good and so but I think it is us 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.280
 quite well done 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.829
 the musicians find the new mix 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.170
 enriching and welcome 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.729
 a change to the musical everyday life 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.039
 But they also want to border 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:30.310
 pass musically and 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:36.340
 geographically for one army to different ones 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.140
 places different influences therefore and 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.780
 how can you musically before 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.329
 different directions ago that there are 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.539
 the folk music of us play in the 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.240
 she has a lot to do with tobias orchestra 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.240
 Chase is a very busy one 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.630
 well-known klazz brothers member 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.520
 been is a founding member and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 yes gives the special charm 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.950
 the innsbruck bohemian flowers 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.590
 concert grand piano has its own language 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.880
 develop and your audience 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.550
 traditional advent songs on high 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.750
 provide musical level 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.750
 Of course, that is assuming that you 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.160
 the craft well mastered so more 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.170
 that's why you also study that then 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 later maybe so musical 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.090
 can do experiments like that in the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.739
 I just fall off this symbiosis 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.470
 classical piano and concert pianist 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.640
 to join together with brass music and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 the arrangements are also very 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.200
 challenging for us and that was it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.850
 really a challenge in the studio 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.510
 and of course this music is live as well 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.510
 to play again 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.120
 new and yet familiar sound 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.310
 tunes like that innsbrucker 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.470
 bohemian and tobias forster that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.860
 audience in their own way on christmas 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 tune
