 do not hesitate in the comments 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.069
 at the end of the video to tell me what 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.390
 you thought of this small team 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.099
 I chat listening any proposed 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.269
 new team I'm one of the genes 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.610
 dk next team 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.989
 do not worry everything is going on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.290
 so here I kiss you 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.030
 enjoy it for later smart bomb 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 and here we are again the warders left and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.950
 partly in new cuts 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.849
 with this new team of dns pdl I 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.580
 looking for an opponent 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.970
 so frankly the team to tell you 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.570
 clearly with houellebecq 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.530
 I really thought more about it 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.650
 I know a lot of people my 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.630
 say yes no but did not play with 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.500
 welbeck and frankly it's not taken a 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.090
 huge pleasure 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.310
 so I'm going to come across a big 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.370
 game entry team here's remy 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.560
 oscar sturridge is rhesus mass 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.540
 so a team rather focused on the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.430
 speed with a very good defense on 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 can see a few beasts of the letten benz 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.680
 benz benz of the coach was born towards your gun 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.020
 of the walker is the trough ferment pass 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.910
 Fernando is indignant it looks like it 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.680
 starts with an action on my part the 4th 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.900
 minute with henderson carwin ball in 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.020
 depth on welbeck houellebecq small 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.910
 goal sow this time the opponent with 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.760
 rémi caron to a depth our friend 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.870
 sturridge but shao the cats where he went 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.690
 sarr the passa to walker the fast job 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.690
 dinho parents who shifts results navas 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.730
 rhesus the base that goes here who hooks 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.230
 even and who is trying to make a flight 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.180
 walker and again tomorrow we have to 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.570
 to try to break free but beat when 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.160
 we manage to push the ball so we 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.010
 can see frankly very complicated the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.010
 match we can see a two to asa who 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.570
 will refer to sterling teirlinck 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.130
 now that they are going to chain on a 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.170
 little hitching that makes a 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.390
 big bridge and that rolls up the left and 1 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.370
 0 in the 21st minute 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.140
 so here I was happy because 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.299
 last I thought it smells bad 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 a very good team like that I'm 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.269
 am told with this team especially that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.170
 it was the first game I did 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.430
 with this one so I said good 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.470
 it's cool it's good this price really 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.190
 very good really very very swift 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.220
 as a player really nothing to say it is 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.540
 sees well on the local action a big 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.840
 bridge i think it's a big bridge over 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.260
 blow in little guy really nothing to 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.560
 say 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.810
 so we can see the 41st minute this 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.510
 purist who does poor control who 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.600
 is shows returns on Oscar Oscar 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.130
 who chained a big hit and that 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.830
 do full skylight then your account 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.650
 who did not know how to stop 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.470
 so that live after a 17th game at this 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.449
 who plays it in time since 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 since offensively speaking but it has 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.039
 been rather a very very nice match of the 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.039
 physical of a middle of a standard 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.199
 I was very surprised very good middle of 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.590
 tinqueux that the cottage that arrived 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.020
 just manage the big players one 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.889
 can see the half time the half time was 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.090
 very fast 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.410
 I made three thirds a ground squared 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.840
 a goal my opponent did four 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.330
 hours hits the target goal 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.430
 so yeah I got ball possession 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.370
 it was a lot to turn the ball and that 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.620
 continuous direct took with his loïc 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.990
 remy who makes a big shot but 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.270
 our plant case is going to be in front of the ball 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.280
 so that's cool joe henderson and stone 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.320
 we see on welbeck houellebecq at 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.760
 ouarzazate who sends his road where they 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.340
 join who had made a deep 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.260
 on striking sterling gardens and who 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.550
 make a strike and a shot from the left 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.520
 almost in closed angle 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.990
 in the corner in the pole of a pole 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.290
 which on his side nearest 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.090
 and that's 2 1 1 50th minute so that makes 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.590
 really it's really fun 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.360
 because instantly I was there right 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.520
 sterling there anyway there is agreement to 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.290
 heavy 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.400
 jal to do what I want with a 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.810
 duty are four dry sets 7 which has 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.540
 really struggling to stop the ball 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.950
 it's really a very nice action 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.480
 it was played at a touch of ball is 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.390
 almost in the middle of this stuff 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.550
 did a 2 2 tons of salt was cool on 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.280
 receives the voice over zac 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.810
 depth on relics and I'm doing 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.970
 a pause follows him to the mans to be able to 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.890
 make changes and what berra 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.990
 give to the opponent I told myself 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.340
 I do not know why he did that 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.830
 because he had the opportunity to 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.540
 pass in front of 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.610
 we can see that sterling man of the match 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.400
 2 goals is after each has made a 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.460
 going to see a little 107 that makes two 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.220
 stops and that I had when that did 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.230
 basic of so a relatively match 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.030
 correct 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.380
 so we'll see the end stats we can 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.850
 see that I made four shots 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.910
 framed two goals my opponent did 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.810
 five shooting shots a goal when % of 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.510
 possession of bullet of a pure minus 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.470
 opponents 52% for me and then 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.940
 that's probably what went well 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.140
 gone so I give you go the 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.810
 next week guys for the 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.980
 cayenne sp we will try to go on 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.750
 further away with this team 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.130
 kiss you wear well do not hesitate 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.120
 not that it has a small comment 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.180
 it's always a pleasure 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.180
 it was 6 or 33 hours of ads
