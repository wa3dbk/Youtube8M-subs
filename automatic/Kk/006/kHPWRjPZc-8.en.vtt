 I will save it on me 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.280
 sometimes you have state your 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480
 other files 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.360
 this is my aunt solo here you decide what is an archive 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.890
 here and in you have found 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.540
 of the three classes 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.810
 so I finished and in europe 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.940
 entry into your personal library ie your nickname 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.080
 your folder with your nickname the text has been crossed step 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 mann leaflets 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 in the Libyan folder you will become regional thanks to jarama de 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500
 sharepoint jar points 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.630
 as a press 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.390
 in view of the people who lay Thursday 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410
 for you the archers of the ccme and china 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.960
 here is 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.640
 and yet you have chart accounting all the sick of your 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.060
 can be same card 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 what are we going to do now so 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.920
 move the body then the great classics of their order on the water 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
 example the wrong party bar point files 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.020
 so obviously you have it against but I wrote but not 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.920
 desperate 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.370
 I know they are not divers 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.350
 at first all that I wanted to move in% 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.910
 in the apple folder these will replace if necessary 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.830
 we will fix all that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.080
 here 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.530
 you close pro to 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.520
 the folder 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.230
 in the race week 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.670
 for christine pool the company made by apple 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.570
 I told myself this is obviously there after a year after the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.770
 launching 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920
 I'm turning 24 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.799
 jeanine payers 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.469
 so you are creating a new world at the Italian club at the moment 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.089
 here 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.999
 so you see so you're and% a little message too then 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.179
 a small receiver who says look to show his whole life 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:38.230
 to tell the truth 10 26% 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.230
 in europe installing these or visiting class 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.139
 you can therefore deleted 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.439
 far from the 10-point class that does not work that to stab by 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.439
 year 5 0 minus we did several tests obviously before you 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.549
 show this rate and every time it does not work 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.949
 so once you have in your nose you can quote the hacker 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:04.309
 but you have 10% 

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.029
 the appetite of order entries 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:11.019
 paris does want to show a very simple flight order to fly just 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.959
 to press the button 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.759
 because by space 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.209
 and you fly by it's no longer to jump but you actually want 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.519
 you move with the arrow keys 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.140
 for the cnl 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.600
 you can fly again this is how it is and I will show you% and 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.620
 our order by the fesci june harper the flight you write you do 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.779
 on the other hand because their parents 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:35.979
 spy 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.889
 Alas 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.459
 I'll give you 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.749
 a command that allow you to undermine anyone I'm actually a 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:48.029
 physical and the cube part of the crates m6 just enter constant setting 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.889
 here 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.889
 woon 30 million and for its operation 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:58.219
 and you then I am of opinion 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.169
 here is digging our grave in the sense then some young pursuing 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.730
 the stone the earth no need to have bac 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.819
 we almost failed 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.129
 adapt them like for example that 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.829
 basically by the region in the next 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.509
 that's why you have to be careful when digging damas 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.229
 of course it does not cause the beautiful dress style the only 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.309
 the only obstacle to his grandmother on the eve of the crisis 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:35.490
 johanne butcher there was young runner 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.529
 all this does not work we still pass 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.489
 I will explain as asta the solo attackers on a full match for 

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.259
 my grace includes you 5 0 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.069
 high k -o
