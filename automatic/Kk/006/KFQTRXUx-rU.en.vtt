00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.940
 best games that I played in my childhood 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.439
 this game does not ask for many requirements like this 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.619
 that they will be able to play calmly 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.060
 It is multiplayer version in this game 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.490
 You can play in the following modes 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.520

 I always found myself with this game 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.869
 when I went to the cyber for me this game 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.899
 It is the best football game this is 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.460
 21 fisac a super addictive flash game 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.979

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.289
 tears and others if they have the one in 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.530
 This game is because the game does not accept 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.380
 some pc 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.730
 as counter strike 1.6 only that with 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.590
 more graphics 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.420
 has more requirements than the game 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.570
 previous but I'm sure it's going to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.550
 work when they run the game 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.830
 they have to click where they say they are 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.290
 with teresa 'strike schütz 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.040

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.090

 of portals orange and blue is very 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 addictive but it gets more and more 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.650
 difficult so far this is the game that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.480
 asks for more requirements than the others 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.019
