we<00:00:04.520> wanted<00:00:04.880> the<00:00:05.000> color<00:00:05.240> sensor<00:00:05.510> to<00:00:05.870> find<00:00:06.140> the

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
we wanted the color sensor to find the

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.770 
we wanted the color sensor to find the
edge<00:00:06.560> of<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.010> line<00:00:07.250> by<00:00:07.580> going<00:00:07.910> from<00:00:08.120> white<00:00:08.540> to

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
edge of the line by going from white to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.820 
edge of the line by going from white to
black<00:00:10.389> we<00:00:11.389> can<00:00:11.599> do<00:00:11.780> this<00:00:11.990> by<00:00:12.260> stopping<00:00:12.740> the

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
black we can do this by stopping the

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.220 
black we can do this by stopping the
motor<00:00:13.010> which<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:13.429> left<00:00:13.910> on<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:14.660> screen<00:00:15.019> and

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
motor which is left on the screen and

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.310 
motor which is left on the screen and
only<00:00:15.920> having<00:00:16.369> the<00:00:16.490> motor<00:00:16.730> on<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.180> right<00:00:17.420> going

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
only having the motor on the right going

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.260 
only having the motor on the right going
like<00:00:18.680> this<00:00:20.800> to<00:00:21.800> send<00:00:22.100> these<00:00:22.340> commands<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.150> the

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
like this to send these commands to the

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.890 
like this to send these commands to the
robot<00:00:23.660> we'll<00:00:24.529> start<00:00:24.920> up<00:00:25.100> Lego<00:00:25.609> Mindstorms<00:00:26.240> as

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
robot we'll start up Lego Mindstorms as

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.130

usual<00:00:28.449> we<00:00:29.449> will<00:00:30.640> file<00:00:31.640> left-click<00:00:32.629> on<00:00:32.780> file

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
usual we will file left-click on file

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.100 
usual we will file left-click on file
left<00:00:33.920> click<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.400> new<00:00:34.610> project<00:00:37.600> we've<00:00:38.600> used<00:00:38.930> the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
left click on new project we've used the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.500 
left click on new project we've used the
move<00:00:39.530> tank<00:00:39.860> command<00:00:39.980> a<00:00:40.550> lot<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:41.000> we<00:00:41.120> can<00:00:41.300> use

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
move tank command a lot and we can use

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.560 
move tank command a lot and we can use
that<00:00:41.660> again<00:00:43.809> we<00:00:44.809> want<00:00:45.309> one<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.340> these<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:47.210> stop

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
that again we want one of these to stop

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.680 
that again we want one of these to stop
we<00:00:48.200> can<00:00:48.379> either<00:00:48.530> move<00:00:48.829> that<00:00:49.100> zero<00:00:49.760> like<00:00:50.450> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
we can either move that zero like that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.220 
we can either move that zero like that
and<00:00:51.789> the<00:00:52.789> other<00:00:52.940> one<00:00:53.030> will<00:00:53.570> change<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:54.170> our

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and the other one will change to our

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.020 
and the other one will change to our
usual<00:00:54.530> testing<00:00:55.190> speed<00:00:55.460> around<00:00:55.670> about<00:00:56.120> 50<00:00:56.600> and

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
usual testing speed around about 50 and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.439 
usual testing speed around about 50 and
we<00:00:59.030> don't<00:00:59.270> want<00:00:59.539> one<00:00:59.780> rotation<00:01:00.910> we<00:01:01.910> don't<00:01:02.149> know

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
we don't want one rotation we don't know

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.499 
we don't want one rotation we don't know
how<00:01:02.750> many<00:01:02.809> wheel<00:01:03.170> rotations<00:01:03.890> our<00:01:04.879> robot<00:01:05.330> will

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
how many wheel rotations our robot will

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.710 
how many wheel rotations our robot will
have<00:01:05.690> to<00:01:05.840> go<00:01:06.050> until<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.770> light<00:01:07.729> sensor<00:01:08.330> sees

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
have to go until the light sensor sees

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.500 
have to go until the light sensor sees
the<00:01:08.990> black<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.580> have<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.909> change<00:01:11.210> that

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
the black and so we have to change that

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.109 
the black and so we have to change that
from<00:01:11.900> on<00:01:12.170> rotations<00:01:12.950> till<00:01:13.790> on<00:01:14.740> okay

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
from on rotations till on okay

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.999 
from on rotations till on okay
so<00:01:17.119> we've<00:01:18.110> put<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.500> motor<00:01:18.710> on<00:01:19.009> its<00:01:20.710> z1<00:01:21.710> motor

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
so we've put the motor on its z1 motor

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.670 
so we've put the motor on its z1 motor
is<00:01:22.250> zero<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.360> other<00:01:23.509> motor<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:24.080> a<00:01:24.110> moderate

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
is zero the other motor is a moderate

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.859 
is zero the other motor is a moderate
speed<00:01:24.799> of<00:01:25.100> 50<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.729> that'll<00:01:26.060> turn<00:01:26.240> it<00:01:26.450> round<00:01:26.630> a

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
speed of 50 so that'll turn it round a

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.070 
speed of 50 so that'll turn it round a
bit<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.850> we'll<00:01:28.850> remember<00:01:29.360> from<00:01:29.540> our<00:01:29.659> sumo

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
bit and we'll remember from our sumo

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.580 
bit and we'll remember from our sumo
lesson<00:01:30.470> that<00:01:30.950> if<00:01:31.220> we<00:01:31.610> downloaded<00:01:32.299> this<00:01:32.590> it

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
lesson that if we downloaded this it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.319 
lesson that if we downloaded this it
will<00:01:33.710> go<00:01:33.890> through<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.990> program<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.439> quickly

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
will go through the program so quickly

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.399 
will go through the program so quickly
1/100<00:01:38.329> of<00:01:38.390> a<00:01:38.509> second<00:01:38.840> or<00:01:38.930> something<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:39.350> that

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
1/100 of a second or something like that

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.620 
1/100 of a second or something like that
that<00:01:39.829> our<00:01:40.189> little<00:01:40.400> robot<00:01:40.759> probably<00:01:41.420> won't

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
that our little robot probably won't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.340 
that our little robot probably won't
even<00:01:41.780> move<00:01:42.159> so<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:43.280> have<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.670> go<00:01:44.600> down<00:01:44.869> here

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
even move so we have to go down here

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.550 
even move so we have to go down here
have<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.799> orange<00:01:46.310> one<00:01:46.729> going<00:01:47.060> up<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.409> pull<00:01:48.409> a

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
have the orange one going up and pull a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.740 
have the orange one going up and pull a
loop<00:01:48.920> in<00:01:50.170> we'll<00:01:51.170> pull<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.040> loop<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:53.299> we'll

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
loop in we'll pull the loop in and we'll

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.550 
loop in we'll pull the loop in and we'll
move<00:01:53.990> our<00:01:54.350> motor<00:01:54.680> commands<00:01:55.250> inside<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.560> this

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
move our motor commands inside and this

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
move our motor commands inside and this
will<00:01:57.740> mean<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.280> ev3<00:01:58.670> goes<00:01:59.600> around<00:02:00.079> this

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
will mean that the ev3 goes around this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.760 
will mean that the ev3 goes around this
loop<00:02:00.680> continuously<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.350> keeping<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> motor

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
loop continuously and keeping the motor

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.130 
loop continuously and keeping the motor
going<00:02:04.100> that<00:02:04.790> eight<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.299> its<00:02:05.479> side<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.990> an

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
going that eight on its side is an

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.310 
going that eight on its side is an
infinity<00:02:06.710> sign<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.700> goes<00:02:08.149> unlimited<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.049> keeps

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
infinity sign it goes unlimited it keeps

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.930 
infinity sign it goes unlimited it keeps
going<00:02:09.560> around<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.369> loop<00:02:10.700> forever<00:02:11.680> okay<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
going around that loop forever okay and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.760 
going around that loop forever okay and
that's<00:02:13.940> pretty<00:02:14.420> much<00:02:14.540> exactly<00:02:14.870> what<00:02:15.379> you<00:02:15.530> want

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
that's pretty much exactly what you want

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.559 
that's pretty much exactly what you want
it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.690 
I've divide that by two and we'll get 38
and<00:05:00.170> 38<00:05:01.170> is<00:05:01.380> what<00:05:01.920> we'll<00:05:02.100> put<00:05:02.340> in<00:05:02.490> here<00:05:03.230> however

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
and 38 is what we'll put in here however

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.370 
and 38 is what we'll put in here however
your<00:05:05.700> values<00:05:06.210> will<00:05:06.420> be<00:05:06.450> different<00:05:07.020> to<00:05:07.170> light

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
your values will be different to light

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.290 
your values will be different to light
in<00:05:07.590> every<00:05:07.890> room<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.310> different<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.880> you<00:05:09.000> won't

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
in every room is different and you won't

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.110 
in every room is different and you won't
get<00:05:09.540> 38<00:05:09.960> you<00:05:10.380> you<00:05:11.040> may<00:05:11.220> get<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.460> higher<00:05:11.760> or<00:05:12.060> lower

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
get 38 you you may get a higher or lower

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.060 
get 38 you you may get a higher or lower
value<00:05:13.160> in<00:05:14.160> my<00:05:14.580> room<00:05:14.850> if<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:16.290> light<00:05:16.530> value<00:05:16.920> is

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
value in my room if the light value is

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.570 
value in my room if the light value is
greater<00:05:17.400> than<00:05:17.520> 38<00:05:18.000> it's<00:05:18.390> on<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.750> white<00:05:19.020> and

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
greater than 38 it's on the white and

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.940 
greater than 38 it's on the white and
when<00:05:20.580> it's<00:05:20.730> on<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.150> white<00:05:21.360> what<00:05:22.230> we<00:05:22.410> wanted<00:05:22.800> to

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
when it's on the white what we wanted to

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.390 
when it's on the white what we wanted to
do<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.850> do<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:24.290> to<00:05:25.290> curve<00:05:25.530> round<00:05:25.890> looking

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
do is to do this to curve round looking

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.960 
do is to do this to curve round looking
for<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.030> black<00:05:27.210> okay<00:05:28.230> and<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.310> what<00:05:29.730> will

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
for the black okay and so what will

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.200 
for the black okay and so what will
happen<00:05:30.360> is<00:05:30.570> that<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:32.430> will<00:05:32.490> come<00:05:32.850> through<00:05:32.880> here

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
happen is that it will come through here

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.040 
happen is that it will come through here
it<00:05:33.750> will<00:05:33.900> see<00:05:34.140> white<00:05:35.010> the<00:05:35.670> value<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.210> probably

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
it will see white the value is probably

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.940 
it will see white the value is probably
in<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.320> 70s

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
in the 70s

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.860 
in the 70s
it'll<00:05:38.580> be<00:05:38.670> greater<00:05:38.970> than<00:05:39.420> 38<00:05:40.130> it'll<00:05:41.130> curve<00:05:41.870> go

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
it'll be greater than 38 it'll curve go

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.610 
it'll be greater than 38 it'll curve go
around<00:05:43.200> greater<00:05:44.040> than<00:05:44.250> 38<00:05:44.580> keep<00:05:45.000> curving<00:05:45.620> keep

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
around greater than 38 keep curving keep

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.990 
around greater than 38 keep curving keep
curving<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.960> eventually<00:05:49.280> it<00:05:50.280> will<00:05:50.520> find<00:05:50.850> the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
curving and eventually it will find the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.180 
curving and eventually it will find the
black<00:05:51.240> and<00:05:51.480> go<00:05:51.720> down<00:05:51.960> here<00:05:52.440> at<00:05:52.590> the<00:05:52.710> moment<00:05:52.740> we

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:53.190 
black and go down here at the moment we

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.110 
black and go down here at the moment we
do<00:05:53.340> nothing<00:05:54.110> okay<00:05:55.110> but<00:05:55.740> let's<00:05:55.950> just<00:05:56.400> download

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
do nothing okay but let's just download

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:08.059 
do nothing okay but let's just download
that<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.330> our<00:05:57.660> Eve<00:05:57.960> III<00:05:58.470> and<00:05:58.680> see<00:05:59.100> what<00:05:59.280> happens

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.239 

what<00:06:09.069> we<00:06:09.279> want<00:06:09.550> to<00:06:09.610> happen<00:06:09.879> is<00:06:10.210> that<00:06:10.839> the<00:06:11.249> robot

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:12.249 
what we want to happen is that the robot

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.010 
what we want to happen is that the robot
would<00:06:12.429> turn<00:06:12.699> in<00:06:12.909> the<00:06:13.029> direction<00:06:13.059> indicated<00:06:13.599> by

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
would turn in the direction indicated by

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.369 
would turn in the direction indicated by
the<00:06:14.139> arrow<00:06:15.330> what<00:06:16.330> actually<00:06:16.749> happens<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.349> that

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
the arrow what actually happens is that

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.820 
the arrow what actually happens is that
it<00:06:17.649> goes<00:06:18.429> this<00:06:18.879> way<00:06:19.139> which<00:06:20.139> is<00:06:20.169> the<00:06:20.349> opposite

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
it goes this way which is the opposite

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.919 
it goes this way which is the opposite
to<00:06:20.979> what<00:06:21.009> you<00:06:21.339> want<00:06:21.580> this<00:06:22.179> video<00:06:22.569> is<00:06:22.629> hidden

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:22.929 
to what you want this video is hidden

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:24.269 
to what you want this video is hidden
over<00:06:23.080> long<00:06:23.379> so<00:06:23.649> we'll<00:06:23.770> show<00:06:23.949> you<00:06:24.039> how<00:06:24.189> to

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
over long so we'll show you how to

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:28.499 
over long so we'll show you how to
correct<00:06:24.669> that<00:06:24.849> in<00:06:24.999> the<00:06:25.029> next<00:06:25.119> video<00:06:25.629> thank<00:06:26.349> you
