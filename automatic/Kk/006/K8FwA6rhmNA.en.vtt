00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.700
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel how 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.680
 I do now I bring you more than a tip 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.720
 an advice on how to give more and better 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.250
 uses to your water but either because it 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.110
 they were without gas or in a hurry and 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.119
 they need to make a quick breakfast for 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.770
 you and your children and make it more 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.109
 consistent and not just a bread with 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.849
 jam or something like this with this advice 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.949
 They can prepare a full breakfast in 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.750
 minutes and without messing many frets already 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.550
 that everything will be full water since 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.260
 As you can see they are usually two 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.090
 or four spaces to make the waffles 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.220
 and that's where we will put everything 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.219
 let's prepare in this case it will be egg 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.570
 scrambled an egg a sausage all at 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.460
 same time let's see how it is done 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.650
 we turn on our water flora so that it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 Warm up in this case mine 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.010
 has an indicator that tells me when 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.989
 is ready to put the mixture of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.760
 uav I suppose that in the same way 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.470
 simple will have a similar indicator 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 so they know when to throw this mixture 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.610
 in this case I'm going to put egg 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.250
 scrambled alone but you can 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.860
 put ham sausage mushrooms 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.720
 vegetable or what they like most there is only 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.220
 to sanction him before he throws salt and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.200
 pepper or some other species that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.140
 you want to put it and just beat it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.430
 so that everything is mixed perfectly 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.440
 apart from the egg we are going to put a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.330
 sausage to be cold and UAVs will 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.830
 which in this case is already done but if 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 you have the mixture ready 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
 from before they can throw him 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.410
 time and it will cook as if the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 put alone you have to have a bit of 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.070
 butter almost melted to put 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.869
 to the surface of the full water so that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.680
 Apart from not sticking anything, give more 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.750
 taste 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.040
 since the indicator turns on and is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.690
 ready for us to throw all the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.250
 ingredients in value we give the 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.110
 surface with butter where 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 let's go put the egg that in this 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.610
 case as they are two will use two spaces 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.170
 then we apply generously both 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.210
 in the bottom as in the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.070
 up we do this because despite 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.020
 that this flower sometimes gets to stick 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.790
 then so apart from avoiding that it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.890
 paste gives more flavor since it is 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.780
 butter in this case can be 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.850
 butter with or without salt like you 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 prefer it we also pass it to the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.360
 where we will put the sausage and 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.070
 as on this occasion the guaje is already 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.020
 done it is not necessary to put butter 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.850
 in this part only that we did it to 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.940
 from the mixture if necessary 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.340
 put a little 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.930
 we take the egg or the mixture that we have 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.420
 done and we put it in the space that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.070
 we have designated for this we add the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.990
 sausage in the other space so that it 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.760
 brown and finally we throw the egg 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.740
 distributing it evenly to the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.600
 two leftover spaces so that everything 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.070
 cook at the same time and thus save time and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.260
 we associate more frets more than the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.210
 agua flare try not to overflow 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.220
 since it is going to inflate and it may be that 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.900
 come out from the sides and to everything 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.520
 we close the lid and wait for some 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.890
 minutes to cook everything at the same 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.540
 time as you see here I had to put 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.070
 a handle since it broke the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.690
 sure of my device but you 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.140
 close the normal way and it will remain 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.140
 perfectly 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.019
 since he spent the necessary time 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.519
 we lift the lid and we can see that 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.829
 the eggs were made in egg form 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.420
 then your children will love it already 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.430
 who will think that all their breakfasts are 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.859
 handsome and let's be honest to anyone who does not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.750
 like the handsome guy and he's hot and ready 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.670
 to serve and like the sausage and 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.439
 is perfectly golden and the best of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.359
 everything is made with almost nothing 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.340
 fat you may or may not put 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.530
 butter but as it is flower it is not 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.260
 so then it will be even healthier than 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.609
 if we did it with a frying pan with and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.560
 I will leave a little more time 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.150
 eggs since I like them more golden but 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.870
 that is already to your liking and like you 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 want to do it 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.470
 the time has passed so that they remain 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.360
 more golden we only serve them in the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.460
 where we are going to put it and how 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.680
 can see they come out easily without having 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.980
 stuck for nothing and believe me they know very 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.980
 all right 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.260
 as you could see in just a matter of 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.330
 minutes we have a full breakfast with 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.550
 an egg uav that on this occasion 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.560
 They were just scrambled but as I told you 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.190
 before you can put mushrooms 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.170
 ham bacon sausage vegetables finally 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.910
 that you like more and apart 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.250
 we also made a golden sausage with 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.930
 almost no fat and the best of all is 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.880
 that we do not dirty many frets since 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.800
 everything was done in one place and we can 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600
 put more immediately because as 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.310
 this flower is nothing sticking in the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.950
 surface and so we can make several 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.750
 breakfasts quickly and easily what 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.340
 only thing that was missing was the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.470
 maple honey and you're ready to 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.470
 Enjoy it freshly made and hot 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.090
