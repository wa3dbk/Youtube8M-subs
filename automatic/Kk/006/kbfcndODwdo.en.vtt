00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
turquoise color which I really liked I

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.980 
turquoise color which I really liked I
thought<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> came<00:01:09.270> out<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.600> um<00:01:10.250> it's<00:01:11.250> red

thought that came out well um it's red

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.289 
thought that came out well um it's red
it's<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.260> red<00:01:13.590> food<00:01:13.860> dye<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.220> its<00:01:14.520> own<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it's just red food dye on its own and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's just red food dye on its own and
this<00:01:15.450> orangey<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.200> which<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:17.570> red<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.930> yellow

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
this orangey one which is red and yellow

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.060 
this orangey one which is red and yellow
this<00:01:19.979> turquoise<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.439> green<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.650> blue<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this turquoise one is green and blue and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.130 
this turquoise one is green and blue and
the<00:01:23.520> perfectly<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> course<00:01:24.330> blue<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the perfectly one is of course blue and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
the perfectly one is of course blue and
red<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.009> more<00:01:26.250> blue<00:01:26.430> than<00:01:26.460> red<00:01:26.700> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
red but it was more blue than red I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.179 
red but it was more blue than red I
think<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:27.900> why<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.140> came<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.710> really<00:01:28.890> dark

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
think that's why it came out really dark

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.810 
think that's why it came out really dark
like<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.110> orange<00:01:31.820> this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
like that this one is also orange this

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.230 
like that this one is also orange this
one<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.619> purple<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:35.970> not
