00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.440
 very good girls that so welcome to 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.600
 a new video of colo fit japan's 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.130
 warfare in which I will teach you the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.490
 new camouflages that have introduced 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.839
 today same day May 5 , 2015 men 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.239
 important and the upcoming date people who 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.560
 comes an uncle and sees it in 2017 you have to 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.660
 make it clear when you have these 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 camouflages the case guys are camouflages 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.040
 that already leaked a while ago and I 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 surprise me and I expected others 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.730
 camouflages honestly but I do not know why 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 what have surprised me I like them 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.720
 quite because I see them much more 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.820
 pretty that I saw them in that one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.649
 filtration is that then there are people 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.929
 that later you can have them in weapons 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.010
 let's say hackers and things and I had 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.420
 I've seen some videos but they've 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 surprised because I see them even more 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.170
 nice you are going to see them in different 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.089
 weapons and on different maps so that 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.339
 well you can see it in the best way 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.050
 possible the contrasts the shadows the 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.940
 illumination of different maps and in 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.949
 every camouflage you're going to see with two 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.120
 different weapons that remain pretty 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.039
 same and the first one that you can this is 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.780
 the psychedelic the truth is that it remains 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.370
 really well it's my favorite because 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.469
 they always like cau flashes very 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.269
 colorful that stand out a lot and that 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.379
 camouflage is the example of what you 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.570
 I just said 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.470
 They are worth two euros so they only come with 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.050
 the camouflage 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 weapons and packages put my ex 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.370
 I heard all that but really camouflage 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 of weapons is what interests ya 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.670
 I say my favorite is the psychedelic one they're worth 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.980
 two euros each and they're just 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 available in xbox you already know that in 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.750
 around a month they come out in the rest 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.720
 platforms on playstation and on pc the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.570
 psychedelic my favorite and then already the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 the three remaining ones I would not know to put them in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 order because I think we equally 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.350
 pimps more or less man is true and the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.110
 of llamas the last one that I'm going to show you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.790
 it's very cool the flares then 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.229
 yes I would like more than the magma that is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.119
 you know you're great from the first 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.560
 package but they're pretty cool 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.960
 all and I already tell you that I liked 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 more than when I saw them filtered 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.590
 we are in detroit here with the sniper 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.300
 This I think is the camouflage in lagoons 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 and it is that these camouflages have already 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.110
 seen in some sexes that were 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.940
 touching on the packages and let's say that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.460
 they had them saved then to put them 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 in the store by means of the pack nou for 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 get a little bit of currency here you have 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.250
 the one of flares in the knock are going 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.860
 to see the next weapon is 19 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.870
 that was super cool or canned 19 is 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.560
 a weapon that if you chrome all the weapon of the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.000
 camouflage 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.560
 and also the flares all 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.450
 camouflages are in motion by the way 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.940
 in some it shows more and in others less 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.370
 but here you see the tag 19 is super 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.080
 super cool with the camouflage of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 flares is that nothing guys later 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.650
 or extract the video from the new weapon 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 press that on xbox one have not yet 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 put the patch is funny because it's 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.930
 in 360 but in xbox one not so 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.090
