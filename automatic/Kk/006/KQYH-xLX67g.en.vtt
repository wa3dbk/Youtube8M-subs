00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
yeah Cahill played really well in the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.580 
yeah Cahill played really well in the
second<00:00:12.059> half<00:00:12.090> here<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.630> actually<00:00:13.230> Cole

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
second half here and actually Cole

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
second half here and actually Cole
played<00:00:13.799> well<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> guys<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.330> midfield

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
know it Barcelona I've always not always

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.979 
know it Barcelona I've always not always
come<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.309> top<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:47.670> then<00:00:48.030> four<00:00:48.360> times<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
come out on top but then four times and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.139 
come out on top but then four times and
knockout<00:00:49.410> stage<00:00:49.739> they've<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.940> top

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
knockout stage they've come out on top

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.450 
knockout stage they've come out on top
three<00:00:51.480> times<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.469> fully<00:00:52.680> expect<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
three times and I fully expect them to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
three times and I fully expect them to
come<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.000> top<00:00:54.030> again<00:00:54.390> even<00:00:55.020> though<00:00:55.230> if

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
come out on top again even though if

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.010 
come out on top again even though if
Chelsea<00:00:56.520> scoring<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> Newcomb<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.719> think

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Chelsea scoring on the Newcomb I think

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.130 
Chelsea scoring on the Newcomb I think
Barcelona<00:00:58.739> scored<00:00:59.129> three<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.550> four<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> they

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
Barcelona scored three or four and they

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
Barcelona scored three or four and they
you<00:01:01.440> think<00:01:02.090> yeah<00:01:03.090> absolutely

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you think yeah absolutely

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.119 
you think yeah absolutely
yeah<00:01:04.080> absolutely<00:01:04.290> they<00:01:04.710> could<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.979> scored

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
yeah absolutely they could have scored

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
yeah absolutely they could have scored
them<00:01:05.339> tonight<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.299> were<00:01:06.390> very<00:01:06.659> very

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
them tonight they were very very

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
them tonight they were very very
wasteful<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.860> saw<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> Guardiola's<00:01:08.820> reaction

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
wasteful we saw a Guardiola's reaction

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.520 
wasteful we saw a Guardiola's reaction
on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> sidelines<00:01:10.020> he<00:01:10.140> couldn't<00:01:10.409> believe

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
on the sidelines he couldn't believe

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.480 
on the sidelines he couldn't believe
what<00:01:10.680> he<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.070> watching

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
what he was watching

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.000 
what he was watching
they<00:01:11.909> were<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.210> wasteful<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.560> man's<00:01:13.799> right

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
they were so wasteful but a man's right

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
they were so wasteful but a man's right
Chelsea<00:01:14.549> had<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> game<00:01:15.030> plan<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:16.049> stuck

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Chelsea had a game plan and they stuck

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.980 
Chelsea had a game plan and they stuck
to<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:17.340> pushed<00:01:17.670> Barcelona<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.659> wide

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
to it they pushed Barcelona out wide

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
to it they pushed Barcelona out wide
they<00:01:19.409> were<00:01:19.470> happy<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.100> Barcelona<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.330> out

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they were happy for Barcelona to go out

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
they were happy for Barcelona to go out
wide<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.259> through<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> middle<00:01:22.890> where

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wide not down through the middle where

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.700 
wide not down through the middle where
they're<00:01:23.280> very<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.670> strong<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.530> that's<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
they're very very strong and that's the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.350 
they're very very strong and that's the
Mourinho<00:01:26.130> plan<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.729> isn't<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.210> was

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
Mourinho plan really isn't but it was

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.580

the<00:01:27.540> Mourinho<00:01:27.930> plan<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.380> how<00:01:28.530> he

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the Mourinho plan that's how he

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.440 
the Mourinho plan that's how he
frustrated<00:01:29.159> them<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.759> he<00:01:29.880> beat<00:01:30.180> them

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
frustrated them that's how he beat them

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
frustrated them that's how he beat them
in<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> semi-final<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> Champions
