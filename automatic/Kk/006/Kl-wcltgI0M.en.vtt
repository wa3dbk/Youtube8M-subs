so there's a lot you can do with this

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.270 
so there's a lot you can do with this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
little device so let's go ahead and

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:55.770 
little device so let's go ahead and
unbox<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.030> check<00:00:43.180> it<00:00:43.210> out<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.570> first

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
unbox in and check it out and the first

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.660 
unbox in and check it out and the first
thing<00:00:55.930> I<00:00:56.050> noticed<00:00:56.470> is<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.769> this<00:00:57.070> device<00:00:57.400> is<00:00:57.640> a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
thing I noticed is that this device is a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.350 
thing I noticed is that this device is a
lot<00:00:57.940> heavier<00:00:58.150> than<00:00:58.479> most<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:59.250> it's<00:01:00.250> metal<00:01:00.760> so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
lot heavier than most and it's metal so

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.990 
lot heavier than most and it's metal so
it's<00:01:01.870> aluminum<00:01:02.379> so<00:01:02.620> that's<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> plus

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
it's aluminum so that's really a plus

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's aluminum so that's really a plus
and<00:01:07.000> you<00:01:07.479> don't<00:01:07.600> see<00:01:07.840> many<00:01:08.020> devices<00:01:08.409> like<00:01:08.770> this

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
and you don't see many devices like this

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.960 
and you don't see many devices like this
that<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.310> aluminum<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:12.520> on<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.670> side

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
that are aluminum and here on the side

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.010 
that are aluminum and here on the side
you<00:01:13.270> have<00:01:13.390> two<00:01:13.690> USB<00:01:14.020> ports<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.850> one<00:01:16.090> SD<00:01:16.719> card

slot on the back you have an OTA for

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.940 
slot on the back you have an OTA for
that's<00:01:25.210> for<00:01:25.270> flash<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.869> device<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:26.560> have

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
that's for flash in the device you have

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.370 
that's for flash in the device you have
hdmi<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:29.049> have<00:01:29.200> optical<00:01:30.039> audio<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.689> well<00:01:31.750> as

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
hdmi you have optical audio as well as

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.520 
hdmi you have optical audio as well as
Ethernet<00:01:33.359> this<00:01:34.359> is<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.869> power<00:01:35.560> adapter<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
Ethernet this is the power adapter and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.599 
Ethernet this is the power adapter and
most<00:01:38.530> control<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.619> imagine<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.369> little

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
most control and imagine a little

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.719 
most control and imagine a little
control<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:50.530> see<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.890> double<00:01:51.219> or<00:01:51.310> triple<00:01:51.490> a

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
control take see the double or triple a

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.870 
control take see the double or triple a
batteries<00:01:52.829> triple<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.950> batteries<00:01:54.399> two<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.329> them

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
batteries triple a batteries two of them

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.020 
batteries triple a batteries two of them
so<00:01:57.880> go<00:01:58.030> ahead<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.240> put<00:01:58.359> that<00:01:58.390> softer<00:01:58.990> now

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
so go ahead and put that softer now

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.370 
so go ahead and put that softer now
alright<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:01.210> let's<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.539> this<00:02:01.689> device<00:02:02.049> hooked

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
alright so let's get this device hooked

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.520 
alright so let's get this device hooked
up<00:02:02.880> alright<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.090> setup<00:02:04.479> is<00:02:04.659> really<00:02:04.929> simple<00:02:05.229> I
