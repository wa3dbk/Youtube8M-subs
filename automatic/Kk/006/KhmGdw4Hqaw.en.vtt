00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.830 

this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.920> video<00:00:02.550> on<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.270> make<00:00:03.510> four

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
this is a video on how to make four

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.050 
this is a video on how to make four
different<00:00:04.110> Metroid's<00:00:04.470> based<00:00:04.710> on<00:00:05.060> complexity

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
different Metroid's based on complexity

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.379 
different Metroid's based on complexity
from<00:00:06.420> ridiculously<00:00:07.410> simple<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.189> my<00:00:09.179> most

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
from ridiculously simple to my most

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.350 
from ridiculously simple to my most
complex<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:10.500> for<00:00:11.130> each<00:00:11.280> design<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:12.090> will<00:00:12.179> need

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
complex so for each design you will need

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.180 
complex so for each design you will need
four<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:13.650> spike<00:00:14.040> pieces<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:16.190> don't

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
four of these spike pieces and don't

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.540 
four of these spike pieces and don't
need<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.580> few<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> these<00:00:18.029> pieces<00:00:19.340> alright<00:00:20.340> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
need a few of these pieces alright so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.279 
need a few of these pieces alright so
the<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:20.670> design<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.109> said

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
the first design just like I said

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.750 
the first design just like I said
ridiculously<00:00:22.859> simple<00:00:23.100> take<00:00:23.880> one<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.150> these

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
ridiculously simple take one of these

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.419 
ridiculously simple take one of these
then<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.029> attach<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.769> into<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.160> four

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
then you just attach these into the four

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.360 
then you just attach these into the four
holes<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> bottom<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.190> then<00:00:35.280> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
holes on the bottom here so and then you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130 
holes on the bottom here so and then you
just<00:00:35.550> spaced<00:00:35.850> them<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.570> look<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.870> much

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
just spaced them out to look as much

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.119 
just spaced them out to look as much
like<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.530> might<00:00:37.620> write<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:37.980> possible<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:40.129> here

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
like I might write as possible so here

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.080 
like I might write as possible so here
you<00:00:41.190> go<00:00:41.250> okay<00:00:42.059> second<00:00:43.020> design<00:00:43.850> you'll<00:00:44.850> be

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
you go okay second design you'll be

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
you go okay second design you'll be
needing<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.899> as<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.309> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
needing one of these as you can get in a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
needing one of these as you can get in a
lego<00:00:47.579> fan<00:00:47.850> taco<00:00:48.149> set<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.660> unfortunately<00:00:49.050> is

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
lego fan taco set which unfortunately is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.950 
lego fan taco set which unfortunately is
not<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.710> stores<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.780> one

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
not in stores but if you don't have one

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
not in stores but if you don't have one
maybe<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.410> buy<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.890> ebay<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> want

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
two of these pieces with a little pincer

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.240 
two of these pieces with a little pincer
thing<00:02:10.140> on<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.319> top<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> one<00:02:10.979> stud

okay then you also need one of these

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.910 
okay then you also need one of these
metal<00:02:17.770> pieces<00:02:18.010> which<00:02:18.610> be<00:02:18.730> using<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.270> body

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
metal pieces which be using for the body

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.520 
metal pieces which be using for the body
has<00:02:21.120> four<00:02:22.120> studs<00:02:22.480> one<00:02:22.780> on<00:02:22.870> each<00:02:22.960> side<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.470> on

the top and then then you just touch
them<00:02:33.520> together<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.090> make<00:02:34.390> something<00:02:34.810> like

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
them together to make something like

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:44.400 
them together to make something like
this<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.810> put<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.350> in<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.590> middle<00:02:41.770> or<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
bottom of the piece like that okay and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.560 
bottom of the piece like that okay and
then<00:02:50.980> for<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.250> last<00:02:51.430> one<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.880> do<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.239> same
