00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.490
 if you Robert Senk victim in Günzburg in the Alexander Böhm Street 1 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.969
 you want to visit first you tremble 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.339
 the reason the man 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:13.759
 there is no house here 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.179
 is the number two 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.570
 and opposite 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 because it's just a kind of noise barrier 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.400
 and exactly dollars 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.419
 actually, Robert is a business economist in Kottern 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.779
 but already for 20 years dealt with passive house construction after normal 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.140
 He came to the house five years ago 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 I've found 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.240
 then an intensive study of the passive house concept 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.490
 that under certain conditions the concept both 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.610
 thermally and economically even can optimize 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.390
 Of course, this is only possible under certain conditions 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 and one of the possibilities one has is just the earth 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.010
 to use 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.810
 the earth reserves the name 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.819
 the whole 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:57.950
 on one more 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.650
 Myles thermal pants bring 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.150
 who now expects Robert to be a god to enter a dark cave 40 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.130
 Thanks to a wide window facing south, the entire house is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.460
 lichtdurchflutet 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.910
 He has been living underground for four years now 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.470
 his expectations have been completely fulfilled 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.789
 I can proudly say that we do not have all the advantages 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.070
 the me before 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.410
 Percent on currently the team has joined 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.990
 especially regarding energy savings now 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.150
 and in particular, I am also very happy with the goal in the summer 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.240
 stay cool 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.730
 This is partly due to the more than one meter thick layer of earth 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.009
 on the other hand at the ventilation system 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.459
 In the summer she leads hikers aviation and through the Cap Manke 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:43.760
 cooled air too 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.700
 In winter, the cold outside air flows through a heat exchanger so that it flows in 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.690
 House living swarm stays 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.280
 For home automation Robert Zingg Gotter only needs a small chamber 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.540
 you take the most space of solar water heating 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.790
 He has installed a small water heater only for emergencies 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.340
 I also saved on many other corners and ends 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.289
 for example on the facade this piece is no less elaborate due to this 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.360
 Green roofs 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.640
 I use small animals I need to recognize came to build 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.859
 enough even later to renovate can be solved there are almost no 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.889
 Window sills Kenneth gutters know attic fire 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.669
 Daseep percent 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.269
 pays off very well 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.579
 if a heater needs supremacy godter also not 47 of the rich for 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.790
 the winter 30 pieces a day make even at minus temperatures sufficient 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.399
 warm 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:34.859
 so building a passive house does not cost more than building one 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.049
 comparable not energy saving from St 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.299
 quite apart from the experience in the Erdhaus 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.369
 reacted to nature 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.419
 Like the weather outside there are tabletops in the tears and you live a lot with us 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.749
 the rhythm of nature 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:51.079
 and secondly, until Sundays were recovered 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.319
 What you do not feel that I am rated by stones and earth 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.709
 but percent but a man begins to feel very secure and protected 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.889
 in Günzburg Robert Senk was able to realize under four passive money houses 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.739
 Elsewhere, the approval authorities are not ready yet
