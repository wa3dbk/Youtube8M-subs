00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
as Logan I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.480 
as Logan I'm gonna show you how to
replace<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.299> motor<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.810> hubsan<00:00:07.230> x4<00:00:07.490> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
replace a motor on a hubsan x4 the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.520 
replace a motor on a hubsan x4 the
reason<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.760> knew<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.000> motor<00:00:09.179> was<00:00:09.330> bad<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.870> when

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
reason I knew the motor was bad is when

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.890 
reason I knew the motor was bad is when
I<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:10.980> like<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.420> back<00:00:12.660> here

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I them like this this one back here

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.709 
I them like this this one back here
doesn't<00:00:13.290> quite<00:00:13.500> spin<00:00:14.460> right<00:00:14.700> now<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.360> still

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
doesn't quite spin right now it still

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.450 
doesn't quite spin right now it still
spins<00:00:16.940> but<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> thing<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.630> won't<00:00:19.410> quite<00:00:19.859> fly

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
spins but the thing just won't quite fly

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.099 
spins but the thing just won't quite fly
right<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.240> sometimes<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.900> one

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
right and sometimes if you have one

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.540 
right and sometimes if you have one
that's<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.439> spinning<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.010> all<00:00:23.100> that'll

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
that's not spinning at all that'll

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.790 
that's not spinning at all that'll
indicate<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.090> bad<00:00:24.269> motor<00:00:24.539> too<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
indicate a bad motor too but this one I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.500 
indicate a bad motor too but this one I
can<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.130> tell<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.550> its<00:00:26.730> way<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:27.090> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
can just tell it's on its way out so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.919 
can just tell it's on its way out so
it's<00:00:28.019> time<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> replace<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> small<00:00:30.090> Jewish

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it's time to replace it so small Jewish

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.850 
it's time to replace it so small Jewish
screwdriver<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:33.079> take<00:00:34.079> these<00:00:34.290> three

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
screwdriver and then take these three

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:47.299 
screwdriver and then take these three
screws<00:00:35.309> out<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:46.039> okay<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.100> got

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
screws out right back here okay you got

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.869 
screws out right back here okay you got
the<00:00:47.460> back<00:00:47.670> off<00:00:48.230> now<00:00:49.230> you'll<00:00:49.469> notice<00:00:49.879> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the back off now you'll notice the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
the back off now you'll notice the
motors<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.300> different<00:00:51.690> color<00:00:51.930> wires<00:00:52.500> going

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
motors have different color wires going

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.650 
motors have different color wires going
out<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.030> important<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.480> match

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
out of them and it's important to match

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
out of them and it's important to match
the<00:00:54.930> wire<00:00:55.110> color<00:00:55.440> with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> new<00:00:56.820> motor<00:00:57.030> you're

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the wire color with the new motor you're

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
the wire color with the new motor you're
putting<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:58.039> otherwise<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.280> motor<00:00:59.489> will

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
putting in otherwise your motor will

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.469 
putting in otherwise your motor will
burn<00:00:59.820> out<00:00:59.940> quite<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> quick<00:01:00.420> quite<00:01:01.170> quickly

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.649 

there<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.750> pull<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> motor<00:01:07.770> out

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.780 

oK<00:01:12.659> we've<00:01:12.750> got<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> fresh<00:01:13.229> motor<00:01:16.549> just<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> kind

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
oK we've got a fresh motor just to kind

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
oK we've got a fresh motor just to kind
of<00:01:17.880> tend<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> ends<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:19.020> fresh<00:01:19.290> leather

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of tend the ends get some fresh leather

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.730 
of tend the ends get some fresh leather
on<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:20.510> feed<00:01:21.510> these<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:22.409> mind<00:01:22.619> it's

on there feed these to your mind it's
gonna<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.009> black<00:01:24.200> rest<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> wire<00:01:25.530> right<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
gonna be black rest the wire right on

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.660 
gonna be black rest the wire right on
top<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.720> little<00:01:27.720> solder<00:01:28.020> pad<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.500> there

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
top of the little solder pad right there

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.180 
top of the little solder pad right there
get<00:01:29.670> your<00:01:29.820> soldering<00:01:30.149> iron<00:01:30.649> nice<00:01:31.649> and<00:01:31.890> clean

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I got a pretty big tip on this one too

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.430 
I got a pretty big tip on this one too
it's<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.300> needle<00:01:42.690> find<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.289> can

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
chick is having the wire pressed up

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
chick is having the wire pressed up
against<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:52.009> solder<00:01:53.009> pad<00:01:53.340> before<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:54.530> touch

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
