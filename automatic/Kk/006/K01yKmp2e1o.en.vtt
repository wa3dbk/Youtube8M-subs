00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.511
 Video release force of the day 

00:00:01.511 --> 00:00:02.763
 Release with video 

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:04.101
 Well 

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.538
 Video release force of the day 

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.179
 With laptop 

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:08.490
 Desktop computer 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.180
 Or not only two PCs 

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:13.208
 I think that many people do not own 

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.246
 If you have two PCs 

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.252
 You often work at the same time 

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:18.493
 At that moment 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.820
 Two PC mouse and keyboard 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.631
 I have to operate separately 

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:23.971
 Well, a little bothersome 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.140
 Laptop keyboard when working with laptop 

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.261
 In the case of desktop PC 

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.870
 Desktop keyboard 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.702
 this 

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:33.521
 I want to operate either 

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.446
 Have you ever thought so? 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.380
 We received this offer from Mr. Inateck 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.590
 USB hub 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.837
 If you use this 

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:41.669
 Trouble of operation of two PCs 

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:42.799
 It will be eliminated 

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.731
 Eh, just a USB hub, right? 

00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:46.356
 There is no reason to solve this, right? 

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:48.280
 This is with the ugly thing 

00:00:48.418 --> 00:00:50.418
 This port is written as M-Port 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.660
 It seems to say that it is magic port 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.279
 so 

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:54.601
 You can use magic 

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.821
 First of all, this USB hub 

00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.751
 Connect to the main PC 

00:00:58.751 --> 00:00:59.785
 Then 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.420
 Naturally, it is also recognized as a USB 3.0 hub 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.147
 But 

00:01:04.356 --> 00:01:06.356
 It is recognized as a magic port 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.280
 First, connect the USB cable to the magic port 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.894
 And a laptop 

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.822
 Toward the sub PC 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.880
 Connect USB on the other side of the magic port 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.920
 Now two PCs are connected. 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.456
 What can this do? 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.820
 First of all, share mouse and keyboard 

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.166
 Both mouse and keyboard 

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.201
 Shared 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.720
 Move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.367
 Toward the next PC 

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.994
 The mouse cursor moves 

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:33.018
 And vice versa 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.840
 When you move the mouse cursor from the next computer to the original computer 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.365
 The mouse cursor moves 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 It can control with one keyboard and mouse 

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.668
 People using desktops and laptops 

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:44.975
 Operability at home 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.400
 It's good, I use a desktop computer. 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.442
 At that moment 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.320
 You can use your laptop computer with desktop operability 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.558
 I think it is a good thing 

00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:53.872
 After, copy paste 

00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:55.707
 Copy paste of each other's PC 

00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:56.636
 Will be reflected 

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:57.973
 This is also convenient 

00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:00.316
 What I recorded on the desktop 

00:02:00.654 --> 00:02:02.654
 I want to enter it on my laptop 

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:04.102
 You can copy and paste 

00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:06.035
 Send by e-mail 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 There is no need to save it as a file and send it 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.700
 After that, you can also drag and drop files 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.627
 Desktop files 

00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:14.264
 I want to transfer to a laptop computer 

00:02:14.264 --> 00:02:15.905
 Laptop files 

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:17.444
 I want to copy to the desktop 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.860
 A little inconvenience of two PCs 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.198
 I will eliminate it 

00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:22.522
 Actually this function 

00:02:22.522 --> 00:02:24.171
 If you have some knowledge 

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.124
 It is possible by combination of free software 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.560
 But you need to set up each other's PCs, right? 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.391
 Such setting is troublesome 

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.856
 I want to do everything automatically 

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:32.686
 In that case 

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:33.792
 Inateck 

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:35.435
 Magic port hub 

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:36.858
 It is convenient to use this 

00:02:36.887 --> 00:02:38.887
 Oh, there were other scenes 

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:40.203
 Suddenly on the go 

00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:41.737
 I want to exchange files 

00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:43.299
 Help me to set up a little 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.440
 If this is connected in this case too 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.460
 Exchange files on your own PC and the other's PC 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.781
 You can do it freely 

00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:51.723
 At home or on the go 

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.938
 Someone who is good at using two personal computers 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.580
 Please try using this hub with magic port 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.300
 I did this on Windows and Mac this time 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.415
 Mac-Mac 

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.265
 Windows-Windows 

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:02.871
 after 

00:03:02.993 --> 00:03:04.993
 If you use the attached conversion cable 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.340
 We can connect with Android terminal 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.696
 I want to see 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.240
 Because I do not have an Android device, it is unconfirmed 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.684
 Windows and Mac 

00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:13.896
 So I confirmed 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.260
 Video release force of the day 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:24.440
