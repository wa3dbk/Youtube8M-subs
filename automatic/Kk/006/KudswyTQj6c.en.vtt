basically<00:02:49.599> but<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.560> feel<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:50.799> that<00:02:51.040> could<00:02:51.069> get

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
basically but I feel like that could get

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.449 
basically but I feel like that could get
really<00:02:51.370> messy<00:02:51.639> um<00:02:52.439> if<00:02:53.439> I<00:02:53.560> had<00:02:53.829> an<00:02:54.040> interview

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
really messy um if I had an interview

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.740 
really messy um if I had an interview
with<00:02:54.549> somebody<00:02:55.000> or<00:02:55.150> something<00:02:55.449> I<00:02:55.510> had<00:02:55.719> to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
with somebody or something I had to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.149 
with somebody or something I had to
sneeze<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.349> then<00:02:56.469> just<00:02:56.620> glitter<00:02:56.919> when

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
sneeze and then just glitter when

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.280 
sneeze and then just glitter when
everywhere<00:02:57.609> then<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.269> think<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:58.900> would<00:02:59.109> be

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
everywhere then I think that would be

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.930 
everywhere then I think that would be
really<00:03:00.239> off-putting<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:02.169> mess

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
really off-putting and mess

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.830 
really off-putting and mess
that<00:03:03.510> would<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.680> be<00:03:04.740> good<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.360> think<00:03:06.480> out

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that would not be good so I think out

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
that would not be good so I think out
completo<00:03:07.320> because<00:03:07.770> then<00:03:08.040> like<00:03:08.370> my<00:03:09.120> poop<00:03:09.330> would

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
completo because then like my poop would

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.400 
completo because then like my poop would
just<00:03:09.690> be<00:03:09.810> colorful<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:12.230> mean<00:03:13.230> I'm<00:03:13.320> not

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
just be colorful and I mean I'm not

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.350 
just be colorful and I mean I'm not
going<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.650> stick<00:03:13.950> my<00:03:14.100> hand<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.490> toilet<00:03:14.880> play

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
going to stick my hand the toilet play

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.700 
going to stick my hand the toilet play
with<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.570> try<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.960> build<00:03:16.140> something<00:03:16.590> out<00:03:16.650> of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
with it try to build something out of

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.250 
with it try to build something out of
play-doh<00:03:17.010> but<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:18.150> think<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.750> would<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:18.930> about

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
play-doh but I think it would be about

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.080 
play-doh but I think it would be about
the<00:03:19.440> same<00:03:19.680> thing<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.370> pooping<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.000> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
the same thing is just pooping but it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.620 
the same thing is just pooping but it
would<00:03:21.210> be<00:03:21.240> colorful<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:23.330> think<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.450> would

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
would be colorful and I think I would

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.380 
would be colorful and I think I would
play<00:03:25.100> because<00:03:26.100> glitter<00:03:26.430> could<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.940> annoyed

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
play because glitter could get annoyed

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.700
