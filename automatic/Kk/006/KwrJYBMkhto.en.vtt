00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
transmitter it has a 360 degree flip you

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.160 
transmitter it has a 360 degree flip you
press<00:00:47.089> the<00:00:47.239> button<00:00:47.480> then<00:00:47.629> you<00:00:47.749> choose<00:00:47.960> where

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
press the button then you choose where

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.200 
press the button then you choose where
to<00:00:48.230> flip<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.829> has<00:00:48.980> LED<00:00:49.460> night<00:00:49.789> lights

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
to flip it has LED night lights

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.969 
to flip it has LED night lights
it<00:00:50.329> is<00:00:50.749> a<00:00:51.129> CF<00:00:52.129> mode<00:00:52.550> which<00:00:53.179> I<00:00:53.210> believe<00:00:53.510> means

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
it is a CF mode which I believe means

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.619 
it is a CF mode which I believe means
it's<00:00:54.979> headless<00:00:55.399> so<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.030> doesn't<00:00:56.239> matter<00:00:56.390> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
it's headless so it doesn't matter the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.239 
it's headless so it doesn't matter the
orientation<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.499> automatically<00:00:58.039> goes

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
orientation and it automatically goes

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.040 
orientation and it automatically goes
based<00:00:58.699> off<00:00:58.819> of<00:00:58.850> what<00:00:59.179> the<00:00:59.359> orientation<00:00:59.870> with

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
based off of what the orientation with

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.229 
based off of what the orientation with
where<00:01:00.319> it<00:01:00.409> started<00:01:00.769> it<00:01:01.370> also<00:01:01.519> has<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.699> one<00:01:01.969> press

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
where it started it also has a one press

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.350 
where it started it also has a one press
automatic<00:01:02.780> return<00:01:03.190> so<00:01:04.190> essentially<00:01:04.879> what<00:01:05.330> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
automatic return so essentially what I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.940 
automatic return so essentially what I
found<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.930> one<00:01:06.080> personal<00:01:06.380> demonic<00:01:06.680> return

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
found is the one personal demonic return

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.999 
found is the one personal demonic return
is<00:01:07.579> basically<00:01:08.329> you<00:01:08.869> put<00:01:09.229> in<00:01:09.350> headless<00:01:09.829> mode

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
is basically you put in headless mode

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.609 
is basically you put in headless mode
and<00:01:10.369> then<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.880> press<00:01:11.390> back<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.990> automatically

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
and then you press back in automatically

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.280 
and then you press back in automatically
comes<00:01:12.890> back<00:01:13.100> to<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.399> because<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.869> way<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
comes back to you because of the way the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.620 
comes back to you because of the way the
orientation<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:16.399> basically<00:01:16.790> if<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.240> fly

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
orientation is so basically if you fly

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.060 
orientation is so basically if you fly
it<00:01:17.689> away<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.020> can't<00:01:18.530> see<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.799> orientation

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
it away you can't see the orientation

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.340 
it away you can't see the orientation
all<00:01:19.909> you<00:01:20.149> have<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.390> do<00:01:20.539> to<00:01:20.689> get<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.899> back<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:21.229> you

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
all you have to do to get it back to you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.690 
all you have to do to get it back to you
is<00:01:21.729> press<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:24.289> headless<00:01:24.649> mode<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.189> then

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
is press the the headless mode and then

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.609 
is press the the headless mode and then
just<00:01:25.909> press<00:01:26.060> back<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:26.539> it<00:01:26.750> will<00:01:26.840> fly<00:01:27.020> back<00:01:27.439> to

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
just press back and it will fly back to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.190 
it's also to disassemble the quad and
for<00:02:49.430> what<00:02:49.519> I'm<00:02:49.640> using<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:49.970> for<00:02:50.000> right<00:02:50.209> now<00:02:50.239> it's

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
for what I'm using it for right now it's

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:16.110 
for what I'm using it for right now it's
to<00:02:51.410> put<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> batteries<00:02:52.160> in

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.320 

and<00:03:16.690> then<00:03:16.840> I'll<00:03:16.959> change<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.730> sensitivity<00:03:18.730> up

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
and then I'll change the sensitivity up

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:54.660 
and then I'll change the sensitivity up
a<00:03:19.360> notch

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.339 

doesn't<00:03:55.670> matter<00:03:55.819> the<00:03:56.000> orientation<00:03:56.599> but<00:03:56.840> they

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
doesn't matter the orientation but they

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:04.569 
doesn't matter the orientation but they
still<00:03:57.620> say<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.920> same<00:04:02.950> you<00:04:03.950> know<00:04:03.980> it's<00:04:04.280> still

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
still say the same you know it's still

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.000 
still say the same you know it's still
still<00:04:05.390> forward<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.989> backwards<00:04:06.439> and<00:04:06.739> even<00:04:06.799> if

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
still forward and backwards and even if

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.089 
still forward and backwards and even if
I<00:04:07.099> spin<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:07.760> know<00:04:08.329> I<00:04:08.390> scream<00:04:08.689> the<00:04:08.780> bunch

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
I spin it you know I scream the bunch

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.050 
I spin it you know I scream the bunch
forward<00:04:10.099> backwards<00:04:12.459> it<00:04:13.459> doesn't<00:04:13.819> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
forward backwards it doesn't the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.940 
forward backwards it doesn't the
orientation<00:04:14.599> to<00:04:14.720> all<00:04:14.870> it<00:04:15.500> just<00:04:15.530> doesn't

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
orientation to all it just doesn't

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.659 
orientation to all it just doesn't
matters<00:04:16.160> it's<00:04:16.699> crazy<00:04:17.000> it's<00:04:17.209> headless<00:04:17.510> mode

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
matters it's crazy it's headless mode

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.340 
matters it's crazy it's headless mode
once<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.850> return<00:04:20.120> future<00:04:20.539> is<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.810> part<00:04:21.139> of<00:04:21.229> this

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
once you return future is a part of this

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.159 
once you return future is a part of this
but<00:04:22.280> essentially<00:04:22.669> it's<00:04:23.330> fine<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.780> you<00:04:23.930> say

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
but essentially it's fine and you say

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.300 
but essentially it's fine and you say
you<00:04:24.229> don't<00:04:24.440> have<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.650> orientation<00:04:24.889> like

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
you don't have the orientation like

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.650 
you don't have the orientation like
right<00:04:25.580> now<00:04:25.699> I<00:04:25.729> can<00:04:26.000> barely<00:04:26.090> tell<00:04:26.360> all<00:04:26.570> I'm

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
right now I can barely tell all I'm

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.790 
right now I can barely tell all I'm
gonna<00:04:26.780> do<00:04:26.870> is<00:04:26.930> push<00:04:27.169> back<00:04:27.380> in<00:04:27.590> my<00:04:27.710> backpack

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
gonna do is push back in my backpack

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.790 
gonna do is push back in my backpack
there<00:04:30.800> we<00:04:30.889> go<00:04:31.660> it's<00:04:32.660> back<00:04:32.870> thanks<00:04:33.680> for

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800
