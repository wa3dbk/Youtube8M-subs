00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Mr. Lauda and again is one 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
 week passed without a video came 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.960
 I know I'm really fucking foulte 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.670
 but still moor no bock was the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.469
 play too nice to bum in here 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.210
 any youtube stories too 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.320
 celebrate 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.260
 That's why I thought today I do it 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.480
 what because I have a little bit right 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.820
 service in the blood of yesterday therefore must 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.230
 I'll cure it and I have it now 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 before and from boredom times new 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 made people looked at and there they have 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 knows about this arma 2 extension 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.859
 maybe a lot of it comes to many 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.140
 hardly two but only because of the motto 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.880
 I also made totally cool are 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.610
 in the contribution what to grasp even in the block 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.800
 have played an hour wolf and budi 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.350
 I believe and again a couple of the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.730
 o'neals though not funny and i have 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.550
 the total air is everything too much 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.890
 Play without joke 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 motto that is a member of but two 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.180
 by the developers as making a 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.710
 alone so fucking shit and prompt 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.300
 really something of famous everyone will 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.989
 play the game and it is so innovative 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.520
 just does not know that 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.189
 apocalypse forest must survive 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.119
 Sport is burning on an island of huge 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.530
 big has hardly anything to eat 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.909
 i think i am my weapon i am 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 certainly another pistol off 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.479
 incredible and he just has to stop 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 not by start has other players 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.470
 So, maybe you player 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.080
 can kill one that is all 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.940
 The celebration is one can do the others all 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 kill that is pretty fierce and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.250
 Of course, you have to be sunny everywhere 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.740
 just break through 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 and it looks so crazy 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.830
 definitely a few videos on 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.210
 make youtube on gamestar and 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.150
 tutorials and couple tips how to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.530
 I can survive in the wilderness 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.460
 It's just awesome and that's how it is 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.660
 what is not the torch if 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.640
 any developers that they see 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.410
 here's a game that looks like in there 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.470
 The project could be successful 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.790
 really help the people 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.160
 Employees I say new programs 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.520
 does not even have to plug in with something 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.960
 So the cost halt such small mod 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.280
 really the whole game nice yes 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.040
 loosen it up somehow already 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.750
 sad if all the fat 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.090
 corporations spend their 100 million dollars 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.800
 raushauen production and it is always 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.690
 the same again i know this 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.070
 typical call of duty the situation that's it 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.110
 yes always the same comes out 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.610
 but is really so i have now 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.920
 Recently it was new games 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.020
 landsberg ops the line and ghost 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.730
 recon future soldier and that's both 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.459
 though completely genetic shooters have though 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.900
 a few cool features but on the whole 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.130
 and all of a sudden just scold me 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.870
 not there I really think so now 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.180
 much more appealing that has too 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.709
 a lot with people and has one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.660
 simply play multiplayer with people 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.459
 , the expenditure not going to be Rendant 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.160
 it's just much more open than what 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.269
 completely new and that will not be so 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.350
 That's why I say openly 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.550
 somehow nothing at all except 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.519
 from 3 because it's just a bit 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.980
 everything else is already addictive 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.550
 views played occurs five times 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.739
 for hours 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.170
 it's just too boring always 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.340
 the same I hope that changes 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.140
 So just any kind of game industry 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.450
 real guy has fallen siemens video yes 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.070
 it's all too much the same 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.850
 everything repeats itself too much 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.350
 and I did that earlier real gamer 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.920
 So gamers are out of passion though 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.140
 Meanwhile, I think again 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.810
 out because it is nothing there 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.970
 would really appeal to like that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.100
 blockbuster grad to wait like gta 5 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.430
 or something really back on it 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.530
 have 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.450
 that takes a long time they are so hardly 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.980
 once out or once every two years 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.430
 Of course, boring too 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.049
 but I would be more 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.060
 a novel player just want 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.099
 again so be a full price game 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.019
 maybe she could do it 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.540
 a failed and how minecraft that 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.219
 you can buy the beta for 15 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.420
 euro for example i mean, it happens 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.189
 more often on aa2 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.810
 because problem is I have two 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.269
 not and I like about the beets 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.459
 play the cold now, unfortunately, not one 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.879
 little bit 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.980
 maybe they'll bring it now 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.019
 backwind separately from novi hardly smaller 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.790
 online that timo that's really cool 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.340
 and if everything is more user friendly 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.510
 it will be pretty packed play 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.090
 is not in the alpha version yet 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.099
 Times beta is really the turn 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.489
 but the furniture is missing so you can 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.919
 say that everything is still very missing there 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.669
 still some immobilienproblem elektro 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:14.049
 clown zombies funny and well 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.639
 Nevertheless , riva had a lot of fun 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.359
 I suppose that's what they are all about 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.400
 has been right and moderately yes 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.190
 Incidentally, I bought despite being dlc 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.680
 it came out on tuesday however 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.880
 tuesday came out exactly for 15 euros 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.130
 it must have been 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.810
 for all for not gram and 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.909
 I now own this branding 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.349
 I bought it, I'm on it 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:40.270
 told and sometimes that possible as 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.800
 god I must somehow I, game 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.510
 I also felt so below 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.190
 here no longer baulk or by again 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.210
 but is much more relaxed because the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.830
 round have been too much coast and in 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.080
 the normal way 30 times on the whole 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.599
 normal maps underneath as forever mine 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.150
 fast, for example, no help and no 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.669
 the hour is courageous ticket number and 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.289
 problem is just on the pc when 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.479
 I want to record but the much 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.740
 money must be so high at the congress 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.419
 that round has about an hour 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.940
 go partly with 1000 is it stop 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.139
 abnormal and that they can receive the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.060
 must then put together so 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.560
 Half missing and therefore also 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.270
 like kaka, that's where I want that 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.800
 I have to say the whole thing completely 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.210
 also in barcas inside the permanent 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.520
 believe twelve minutes but I'm just 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:27.639
 a lot of running around have looked for opponents and 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:29.409
 This year dares me just run around 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.610
 nothing happens there i have the i 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.340
 highlights in quotation marks 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:37.060
 cut out so the shown and the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.889
 rest had so better but it 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.440
 is just real to operate in normal 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:43.060
 quick and easy really good way 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.240
 Seems like eight minutes really has 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.590
 what's going on 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.840
 I do not know much about my cap 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.990
 Well that's why donated so 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.820
 simply call of duty in the advantage because 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.590
 To round it off, go about 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.389
 seven to eight minutes a t en masse 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.460
 on team deathmatch the backrest 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.669
 the same length that he profi after how 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.090
 bad good team is already 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.650
 Therefore, rather the comments 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.300
 most commentators I think 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.770
 You really have to play with it 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.969
 for the left side round out because 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.539
 I often find them difficult personally 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.680
 the school stores are already here 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.240
 acceptable to look at is this 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.039
 template for example optimal though 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.870
 has taken something and tried 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:25.779
 playing the bed was reasonably okay 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.690
 but no trip but good I hope you 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:30.039
 be satisfied with that 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.990
 it 's so true I just turn it 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.719
 you really have 40 degrees 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.560
 in the room that's just not clear 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:40.029
 Well, no matter if well then I hope you have 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.610
 Danger that again did 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:45.849
 next video will come no plan 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.020
 news videos actually every Monday 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.820
 but honestly it just happens 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.770
 secret just completely airways and 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.240
 typical summer hole in autumn again 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.370
 continue when the whole game comes out 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.550
 until then we have to be patient for money 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.139
 gamble post war marco good 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.690
 then I want to say until next time 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.690
 I was happy and goodbye
