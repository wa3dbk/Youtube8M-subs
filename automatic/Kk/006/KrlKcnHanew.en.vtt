00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.920
 and well we're going to introduce you to a young 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.680
 that as we said to the thesis of the program that launched 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.519
 that break the ball and excellently 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.249
 stress franco alejandro apparently on stage 2p costa and the intermediate 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.119
 he took 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.650
 the carload of applause in each performance also in the stadium 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.849
 jalisco trajano coasts welcome good memories gat 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.849
 concessions 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.060
 and how old are you dominating the ball 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 about four years from the age of 11 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.070
 conflict 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.080
 m 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.200
 cm I liked it 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 when I started to practice 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.520
 Because I like football 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 and so I started him 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.050
 another subject 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 It's 100 plus 5 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.660
 like two and a half hours 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 there were plays in which he finished fourth with panama 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 this 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.559
 Well, both at the same time anyway, the ball thanks 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.080
 future who surely the post should be for their part of the 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:08.930
 pecos 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 improsa 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.020
 applaud 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.720
 especially the public granted what remains of the program begins in the 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.100
 coast 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.870
 dominating the ball and here we know each other perfectly 0-3 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.409
 the man perished for three costumes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.580
 in the afternoon now that it becomes true 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 to see but a lot of that money 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.010
 at that time 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.870
 I look back with only three points 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.930
 harper 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.650
 and the dominant one was even put back to the program today from 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.070
 in passports and but following 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.490
 Alejandro in the state showed he operated is being done here 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.710
 In a very small space, I decide, do not think it's easy, because 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 have 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.760
 so scarce 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.560
 two meters when a lot to 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.440
 dominate the ball 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.570
 there we will be 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.569
 following us we will continue 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.799
 with the program i if you like we are going with the second part of this interview 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.130
 pedro that you made 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.440
 with Jorge Vergara and now he talks about a complicated subject the subject of the bulls 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.510
 exactly
