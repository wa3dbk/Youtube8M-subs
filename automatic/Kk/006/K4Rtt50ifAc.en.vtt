applications on the computer is there
any<00:00:11.969> point<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.420> putting<00:00:12.599> filters<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
any point in putting filters on the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.369 
any point in putting filters on the
camera<00:00:13.620> well<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.940> answer<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.179> yes<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.839> there

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
camera well the answer is yes and there

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.590 
camera well the answer is yes and there
are<00:00:16.500> several<00:00:16.650> reasons<00:00:16.770> why<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:18.180> first<00:00:18.390> reason

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
are several reasons why the first reason

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.859 
are several reasons why the first reason
is<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.050> not<00:00:20.039> all<00:00:20.160> effects<00:00:20.520> from<00:00:21.359> filters<00:00:21.779> on

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
is that not all effects from filters on

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.570 
is that not all effects from filters on
the<00:00:21.960> camera<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.710> replicated<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the camera can be replicated on the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.189 
the camera can be replicated on the
computer<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> most<00:00:24.330> important<00:00:24.750> ones<00:00:24.900> really

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
computer the most important ones really

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
computer the most important ones really
can't<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.680> replicated<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.580> well<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
can't be replicated that well and the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.210 
can't be replicated that well and the
second<00:00:28.019> point<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.410> even<00:00:28.439> those<00:00:28.769> filters<00:00:29.160> that

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
second point is even those filters that

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
second point is even those filters that
can<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.609> replicated<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.470> question

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
can be replicated it's really a question

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.810 
can be replicated it's really a question
of<00:00:31.859> whether<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> spend<00:00:32.640> more<00:00:32.759> time

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
of whether you want to spend more time

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.639 
of whether you want to spend more time
doing<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> camera<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.380> having

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
doing it right on the camera or having

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.380 
doing it right on the camera or having
to<00:00:34.680> spend<00:00:34.950> time<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.550> computer<00:00:35.640> afterwards

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to spend time on the computer afterwards

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
to spend time on the computer afterwards
trying<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> simulate<00:00:37.350> effects<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.010> could

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
trying to simulate effects you could

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.110 
trying to simulate effects you could
have<00:00:38.219> done<00:00:38.370> at<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> shot<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
have done at the time you shot the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
have done at the time you shot the
picture<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> world<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> filters<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
picture now the world of filters is

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.770 
picture now the world of filters is
quite<00:00:41.280> confusing<00:00:41.760> basically<00:00:42.540> there<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.660> two

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
quite confusing basically there are two

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.330 
quite confusing basically there are two
different<00:00:43.050> types<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.410> filter<00:00:43.800> there<00:00:44.160> are<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
different types of filter there are the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
different types of filter there are the
round<00:00:44.550> filters<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.149> screw<00:00:45.420> into<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.690> front

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
round filters which screw into the front

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
round filters which screw into the front
of<00:00:46.050> your<00:00:46.170> lens<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.620> lenses<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
of your lens on the lenses of this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.889 
of your lens on the lenses of this
thread<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> filter<00:00:48.120> two<00:00:48.210> screws<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
thread and the filter two screws in and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.529 
thread and the filter two screws in and
then<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:49.920> are<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> sheet<00:00:50.610> filters<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
then there are the sheet filters the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.869 
then there are the sheet filters the
square<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.379> rectangular<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.129> they<00:00:53.489> fit<00:00:53.760> into

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
square or rectangular and they fit into

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.819 
square or rectangular and they fit into
a<00:00:53.969> holder<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.690> holder<00:00:55.050> screws<00:00:55.500> on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> lens

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a holder the holder screws on the lens

filters<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.800> some<00:00:58.980> advantages<00:00:59.190> over<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
filters have some advantages over the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
square type the main one being that you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.810 
square type the main one being that you
don't<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.190> all<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> holder<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
don't need all the holder and

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.130 
don't need all the holder and
paraphernalia<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.539> attach<00:01:03.780> them<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> your

paraphernalia to attach them to your

paraphernalia to attach them to your
lens<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.010> make<00:01:05.159> sure<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> you've<00:01:05.610> got

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
lens you just make sure that you've got

lens you just make sure that you've got
the<00:01:05.880> right<00:01:06.000> thread<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:07.020> screw<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> onto

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the right thread and you screw it onto

the right thread and you screw it onto
the<00:01:07.619> front<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> lens<00:01:08.280> using<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> thread

the front of the lens using the thread
here<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> drawback<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.180> you've<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.420> more

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
here the drawback is you've got more

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
here the drawback is you've got more
than<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.840> lens<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.650> threads<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
than one lens of different threads is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
than one lens of different threads is
that<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> filter<00:01:15.150> will<00:01:15.270> only<00:01:15.390> fit<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.350> lens

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
that the filter will only fit the lens

we<00:01:33.689> made<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.960> resin<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> buy<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> good

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
we made of resin but if you buy the good

residence<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.200> shouldn't<00:01:37.439> see

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
lees system which is looks in a similar

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
lees system which is looks in a similar
principle<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> ring<00:01:44.430> with<00:01:44.759> your

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
principle you get the ring with your

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
principle you get the ring with your
fits<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.180> lens<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> holder

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
fits your lens and you get the holder

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.679 
fits your lens and you get the holder
and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> ring<00:01:47.490> goes<00:01:48.000> into<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> holder

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and then the ring goes into the holder

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.319 
and then the ring goes into the holder
like<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> filters<00:01:50.880> slide<00:01:51.149> in

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
like so and then the filters slide in

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.899 
like so and then the filters slide in
same<00:01:51.780> principle<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:53.250> which<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.670> should<00:01:53.850> you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
same principle now which one should you

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.370 
same principle now which one should you
buy<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> question<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.990> asking

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
buy that's the question you're asking

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.929 
buy that's the question you're asking
well<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.070> answer<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.610> depends<00:01:56.820> what

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
well the answer is it depends what

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.580 
well the answer is it depends what
filter<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.420> using<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:58.020> some<00:01:58.200> filters

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
filter you're using because some filters

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
filter you're using because some filters
actually<00:01:58.920> work<00:01:59.070> better<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.759> circular

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
actually work better in the circular

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
actually work better in the circular
format<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> filters<00:02:01.439> work<00:02:01.740> better

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
format and all the filters work better

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.490 
format and all the filters work better
in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:03.210> rectangular<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:04.049> square<00:02:04.290> format

and a talk about each one in turn if you

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.020 
and a talk about each one in turn if you
only<00:02:08.110> ever<00:02:08.289> buy<00:02:08.500> one<00:02:08.740> filter<00:02:09.070> make<00:02:09.850> it<00:02:09.970> a

can be really dramatic what it does is

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.020

the not all the same though it'll do the

and<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:47.580> one<00:04:47.729> that<00:04:47.849> you<00:04:47.970> use<00:04:48.030> really<00:04:48.389> depends

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
and the one that you use really depends

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.749 
and the one that you use really depends
on<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.900> brightness<00:04:49.259> range<00:04:49.500> in<00:04:50.340> your<00:04:50.520> scene

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
on the brightness range in your scene

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.640 
on the brightness range in your scene
the<00:04:51.360> way<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.509> do<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.810> has<00:04:51.930> taken<00:04:52.110> light<00:04:52.380> meter

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
the way to do that has taken light meter

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.230 
the way to do that has taken light meter
reading<00:04:52.919> from<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.190> ground<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:53.729> from<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:54.000> sky

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
reading from the ground and from the sky

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.150 
reading from the ground and from the sky
to<00:04:54.780> work<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:55.139> how<00:04:55.289> many<00:04:55.349> stops<00:04:55.710> difference

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
to work out how many stops difference

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.620 
to work out how many stops difference
there<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.460> between<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.880> ground<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.389> sky

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
there is between the ground in the sky

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.689 
there is between the ground in the sky
and<00:04:57.870> if<00:04:58.199> there<00:04:58.410> is<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.710> three<00:04:59.009> stops<00:04:59.280> difference

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
and if there is a three stops difference

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.999 
and if there is a three stops difference
then<00:05:00.210> well<00:05:00.930> it's<00:05:01.110> not<00:05:01.229> recommended<00:05:01.560> that<00:05:01.860> you

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
then well it's not recommended that you

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:03.290 
then well it's not recommended that you
balance<00:05:02.490> them<00:05:02.580> up<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:02.820> they're<00:05:02.940> exactly<00:05:03.150> the

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
balance them up so they're exactly the

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.089 
balance them up so they're exactly the
same<00:05:03.570> there's<00:05:04.110> certainly<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.410> one<00:05:04.590> or<00:05:04.710> two<00:05:04.860> stop

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
same there's certainly a one or two stop

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:06.140 
same there's certainly a one or two stop
difference<00:05:05.460> between<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.820> ground<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.060> the

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
difference between the ground and the

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.330 
difference between the ground and the
sky<00:05:06.419> is<00:05:06.449> ideal<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.380> say<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.680> want<00:05:07.860> a<00:05:07.919> one-stop

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
sky is ideal so say you want a one-stop

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.830 
sky is ideal so say you want a one-stop
difference<00:05:08.699> between<00:05:09.000> the<00:05:09.240> sky<00:05:09.419> on<00:05:09.509> the<00:05:09.570> ground

difference between the sky on the ground

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.839 
difference between the sky on the ground
and<00:05:10.080> there<00:05:10.470> is<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> three-stop<00:05:11.039> difference<00:05:11.430> and

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
and there is a three-stop difference and

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.879 
and there is a three-stop difference and
you<00:05:11.880> take<00:05:12.449> a<00:05:12.479> meter<00:05:12.720> reading<00:05:12.900> then<00:05:13.440> if<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.680> use

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
you take a meter reading then if you use

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.300 
you take a meter reading then if you use
a<00:05:14.130> grad<00:05:15.030> filter<00:05:15.449> which<00:05:16.320> has<00:05:16.500> two<00:05:16.710> stops<00:05:17.010> of

brand of filter you buy that will

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.270

that depends on the kind of scene that

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.029 
that depends on the kind of scene that
you're<00:05:42.659> photographing<00:05:42.870> as<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.830> more<00:05:43.949> you

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
you're photographing as the more you

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.499 
you're photographing as the more you
stop<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.340> lens<00:05:44.490> down<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:45.030> sharp<00:05:45.300> of<00:05:45.419> that

you<00:05:50.230> can<00:05:50.440> get<00:05:50.650> Brad<00:05:51.070> filters<00:05:51.520> in<00:05:51.790> the<00:05:52.180> round

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
you can get Brad filters in the round

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.570 
you can get Brad filters in the round
format<00:05:52.810> but<00:05:52.990> frankly<00:05:53.440> there<00:05:54.160> are<00:05:54.190> waste<00:05:54.400> of

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
format but frankly there are waste of

time<00:05:54.760> because<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.420> one<00:05:55.510> of<00:05:55.570> the<00:05:55.630> most

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
time because the one of the most

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
important things that you need to do

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.400 
important things that you need to do

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
with a grad filter is to be able to move

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.620 
with a grad filter is to be able to move
it<00:05:59.590> up<00:05:59.770> and<00:05:59.980> down<00:06:00.070> in<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.430> holder<00:06:00.820> so<00:06:01.480> that

when you're composing the picture you

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.700 
when you're composing the picture you

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
filter you can't move it so you're kind
