head and then you have to buy another

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.190 
head and then you have to buy another
one<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.810> could<00:01:14.960> become<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.229> pain<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.710> ass

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200

this bolt that I have over here on this

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.120 
this bolt that I have over here on this
particular<00:01:21.530> bike<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.820> bottom<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:23.829> comes<00:01:24.829> out

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
particular bike the bottom one comes out

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
particular bike the bottom one comes out
a<00:01:25.579> little<00:01:25.939> bit<00:01:26.180> harder<00:01:26.840> than<00:01:27.430> usual<00:01:28.430> I'm<00:01:28.970> not

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
a little bit harder than usual I'm not

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.450 
a little bit harder than usual I'm not
sure<00:01:29.360> exactly<00:01:29.630> why<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.979> doesn't<00:01:31.189> look

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
sure exactly why it doesn't look

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.160 
sure exactly why it doesn't look
stripped<00:01:31.909> but<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:32.299> feels<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.020> has<00:01:33.140> a

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
stripped but it feels like it has a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.289 
stripped but it feels like it has a
little<00:01:33.439> bit<00:01:33.649> of<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:35.560> resistance<00:01:36.560> on<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:36.920> back

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
little bit of a resistance on the back

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:43.120 
little bit of a resistance on the back
so<00:01:38.299> I'm<00:01:38.390> gonna<00:01:38.509> loosen<00:01:38.750> them<00:01:39.020> all<00:01:39.170> out<00:01:42.130> there

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so I'm gonna loosen them all out there

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.590 
so I'm gonna loosen them all out there
it<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:43.430> that<00:01:43.670> one's<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:43.909> little<00:01:43.970> bit<00:01:44.180> too<00:01:44.299> tight

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
it is that one's a little bit too tight

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.870 
it is that one's a little bit too tight
to<00:01:45.110> be<00:01:45.140> very<00:01:45.409> honest<00:01:45.619> with<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:48.670> okay<00:01:49.670> that

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880

came off make sure you don't hurt
yourself<00:01:53.659> on<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.070> brake<00:01:55.180> lever<00:01:56.619> when<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.710> do

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
yourself on the brake lever when you do

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.520 
yourself on the brake lever when you do
so<00:01:59.979> this<00:02:00.979> will<00:02:01.159> come<00:02:01.399> out<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:03.380> know<00:02:03.500> I

there's<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:07.009> little<00:02:07.310> bit<00:02:07.399> shorter<00:02:07.759> you<00:02:07.939> can

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
there's a little bit shorter you can

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.640 
there's a little bit shorter you can
really<00:02:08.960> mix<00:02:09.140> them<00:02:09.410> by<00:02:10.250> mistake

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
works and if I do a quick visual

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.430 
works and if I do a quick visual
inspection<00:03:47.739> on<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.549> as<00:03:48.699> you<00:03:49.000> can<00:03:49.030> see<00:03:49.419> I'm<00:03:50.169> sure

all that oil out as you can see it's

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.070 
all that oil out as you can see it's
already<00:05:22.410> losing<00:05:22.740> out<00:05:23.039> so<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.780> just<00:05:24.780> give<00:05:24.960> my

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
already losing out so I just give my

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.750 
already losing out so I just give my
bike<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.289> little<00:05:25.470> nice<00:05:28.190> twist<00:05:30.440> okay<00:05:31.520> so<00:05:32.520> we're

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
bike a little nice twist okay so we're

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.490 
bike a little nice twist okay so we're
ready<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:33.090> put<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.330> G<00:05:33.510> way<00:05:33.630> or<00:05:33.780> filter<00:05:34.140> back<00:05:34.320> in

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
ready to put the G way or filter back in

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.820 
ready to put the G way or filter back in
oil<00:05:34.800> filter<00:05:35.160> back<00:05:35.340> in<00:05:36.050> oil<00:05:37.050> filter<00:05:37.380> as<00:05:37.500> I<00:05:37.620> said

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
oil filter back in oil filter as I said

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:45.200 
oil filter back in oil filter as I said
it<00:05:37.979> goes<00:05:40.250> facing<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.430> way<00:05:43.220> anyway<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.370> you

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
it goes facing this way anyway so you

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.150 
it goes facing this way anyway so you
could<00:05:45.360> go<00:05:45.539> either<00:05:45.720> or<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.289> usually<00:05:46.890> put<00:05:47.070> the

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
could go either or I usually put the

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.130 
could go either or I usually put the
filter<00:05:47.460> back<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.850> first<00:05:48.060> you're<00:05:48.990> going<00:05:49.080> to

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
filter back in first you're going to

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.510 
filter back in first you're going to
feel<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.590> oil<00:05:49.770> filter<00:05:50.070> gives<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.490> a

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
feel that the oil filter gives you a

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.730 
feel that the oil filter gives you a
little<00:05:50.700> bit<00:05:50.820> of<00:05:50.850> a<00:05:51.000> resistance<00:05:51.810> on<00:05:52.289> this<00:05:52.500> thing

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
little bit of a resistance on this thing

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.050 
little bit of a resistance on this thing
so<00:05:52.860> it's<00:05:52.979> not<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.280> completely<00:05:53.430> flat<00:05:53.850> why

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
so it's not going completely flat why

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.300 
so it's not going completely flat why
because<00:05:54.360> that's<00:05:54.539> the<00:05:54.750> job<00:05:54.960> of<00:05:54.990> these<00:05:55.229> bolts<00:05:56.160> to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
because that's the job of these bolts to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.670 
because that's the job of these bolts to
hold<00:05:56.460> it<00:05:56.580> together<00:05:56.700> so<00:05:57.120> the<00:05:57.840> big<00:05:58.020> bolt<00:05:58.289> goes<00:05:58.530> on

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
hold it together so the big bolt goes on

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.710 
hold it together so the big bolt goes on
top<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.229> right<00:06:01.260> as<00:06:01.770> you're<00:06:01.950> looking<00:06:02.100> at<00:06:02.400> it

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
top to the right as you're looking at it

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.600 
top to the right as you're looking at it
screw<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:03.750> in<00:06:03.990> hand<00:06:04.350> tight<00:06:04.680> but<00:06:05.010> don't<00:06:05.220> hand

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
screw it in hand tight but don't hand

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
screw it in hand tight but don't hand
tight<00:06:05.820> it<00:06:05.970> yet<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:07.350> second<00:06:08.280> bolt<00:06:08.460> goes<00:06:09.330> the

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
tight it yet the second bolt goes the

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.360 
tight it yet the second bolt goes the
shorter<00:06:09.900> one<00:06:10.080> goes<00:06:10.320> here

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.439 

and<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:15.290> third<00:06:15.560> bulb<00:06:15.919> goes<00:06:16.790> here<00:06:17.150> on<00:06:17.300> the

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
and the third bulb goes here on the

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:23.340 
and the third bulb goes here on the

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830 
part of the installation so you you put

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.730 
part of the installation so you you put
them<00:06:29.950> in<00:06:30.130> and<00:06:30.480> you<00:06:31.480> tied<00:06:31.780> them<00:06:32.370> in<00:06:33.370> here<00:06:34.740> but

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
them in until they actually push the

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.060

almost to the max almost to the max and
this<00:07:19.570> one<00:07:19.810> still<00:07:20.380> goes<00:07:20.590> a<00:07:20.620> little<00:07:20.830> bit<00:07:23.820> this<00:07:24.820> is

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
this one still goes a little bit this is

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.090 
this one still goes a little bit this is
where<00:07:25.180> the<00:07:25.330> gasket<00:07:26.140> gets<00:07:26.560> pushed<00:07:30.420> and<00:07:32.100> it

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
where the gasket gets pushed and it

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.460 
where the gasket gets pushed and it
keeps<00:07:33.370> the<00:07:33.640> engine<00:07:34.570> nice<00:07:35.380> and<00:07:35.710> tight<00:07:36.010> and

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:37.470 
keeps the engine nice and tight and

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:39.920 
keeps the engine nice and tight and
that's<00:07:38.470> it

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:39.930 
that's it

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.890 
that's it
so<00:07:40.440> that's<00:07:40.620> how<00:07:40.710> you<00:07:40.770> replace<00:07:41.070> the<00:07:41.160> oil<00:07:41.610> filter

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:41.900 
so that's how you replace the oil filter

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.150 
so that's how you replace the oil filter
now<00:07:42.900> all<00:07:43.230> I<00:07:43.350> have<00:07:43.470> to<00:07:43.500> do<00:07:43.650> just<00:07:43.830> fill<00:07:43.980> it<00:07:44.070> up

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 
now all I have to do just fill it up

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.250 
now all I have to do just fill it up
with<00:07:44.310> oil<00:07:44.460> it's<00:07:45.120> just<00:07:45.420> a<00:07:45.510> normal<00:07:45.810> oil<00:07:45.900> change

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260 
with oil it's just a normal oil change

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.970 
with oil it's just a normal oil change
at<00:07:46.350> that<00:07:46.380> point<00:07:48.020> watch<00:07:49.020> my<00:07:49.200> video<00:07:49.380> how<00:07:49.920> to

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:49.980 
at that point watch my video how to

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.480 
at that point watch my video how to
change<00:07:50.280> the<00:07:50.370> oil<00:07:50.400> on<00:07:50.730> a<00:07:50.790> WR<00:07:51.330> 450<00:07:51.900> and<00:07:52.370> you<00:07:53.370> will

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:53.490 
change the oil on a WR 450 and you will

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.260 
change the oil on a WR 450 and you will
know<00:07:53.640> all<00:07:53.820> the<00:07:53.850> steps<00:07:54.120> thanks<00:07:54.840> for<00:07:54.990> watching
