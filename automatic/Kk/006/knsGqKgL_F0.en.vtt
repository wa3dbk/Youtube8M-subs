what's<00:01:37.250> with<00:01:37.369> that<00:01:37.430> metal<00:01:37.729> employed

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
what's with that metal employed

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.020 
what's with that metal employed
I<00:01:39.259> guess<00:01:39.649> that's<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.070> someone's<00:01:40.729> won't<00:01:40.880> use

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
I guess that's so someone's won't use

I guess that's so someone's won't use
the<00:01:41.149> elevator<00:01:41.450> put<00:01:41.689> them<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:47.570> metal

the elevator put them in that metal

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.230 
the elevator put them in that metal
plate<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.259> probably<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:48.920> stop<00:01:49.159> damage<00:01:50.090> from

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
plate is probably to stop damage from

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960 
plate is probably to stop damage from
