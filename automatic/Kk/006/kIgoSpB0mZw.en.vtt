heavier than any of my mobile devices

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
heavier than any of my mobile devices
it's<00:00:54.570> even<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> weight<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.489> the

it's even up there with a weight at the
I'm<00:00:56.730> head<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:59.820> has<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.600> huge<00:01:01.379> internal<00:01:02.010> battery

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I'm head it has a huge internal battery

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.160 
I'm head it has a huge internal battery
in<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.820> that's<00:01:03.000> basically<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in it that's basically what this is it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.649 
in it that's basically what this is it's
a<00:01:04.260> 6000<00:01:05.189> milliamp<00:01:05.519> hour<00:01:05.909> battery<00:01:08.540> it's<00:01:09.540> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
a 6000 milliamp hour battery it's a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830 
a 6000 milliamp hour battery it's a
lithium<00:01:10.170> polymer<00:01:10.380> battery<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.659> bit

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
lithium polymer battery so a little bit

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
lithium polymer battery so a little bit
of<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> dangerous<00:01:13.380> battery<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.250> still

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of a dangerous battery but it still

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
of a dangerous battery but it still
works<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:15.030> fine<00:01:15.299> as<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.920> right

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
works just fine as you can see right

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.230 
works just fine as you can see right
here<00:01:17.790> we<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:18.869> USB<00:01:19.259> ports<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.000> for

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
here we have two USB ports and the for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
here we have two USB ports and the for
status<00:01:21.990> LEDs<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.860> light<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> tell

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
status LEDs that will light up and tell

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
status LEDs that will light up and tell
us<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> charge<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.570> right<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:25.470> we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
us to the charge on it and right now we

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.770 
us to the charge on it and right now we
have<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> 50-percent<00:01:26.820> charge<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
have a 50-percent charge on it because I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
have a 50-percent charge on it because I
just<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:28.200> took<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.890> bag<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.430> forgot

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just now took it out of my bag I forgot

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.160 
just now took it out of my bag I forgot
to<00:01:29.970> plug<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.920> you'll<00:01:32.100> turn<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> around

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
to plug it up if you'll turn it around

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.920 
to plug it up if you'll turn it around
you'll<00:01:34.170> notice<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.369> has<00:01:35.659> labels<00:01:36.659> on<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
you'll notice that it has labels on the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.260 
you'll notice that it has labels on the
side<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:39.350> optimized<00:01:40.430> charging<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> one

five to six hours of video playback on
the<00:02:19.680> iPad<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.740> alone<00:02:23.070> is<00:02:23.310> pretty

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
the iPad so that alone is pretty

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.780 
the iPad so that alone is pretty
impressive<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:25.160> focus<00:02:26.160> back<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:28.790> there

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
impressive so focus back up here there

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.869 

so<00:04:19.729> we'll<00:04:20.299> plug<00:04:20.599> the<00:04:20.810> USB<00:04:21.019> port<00:04:21.729> into<00:04:22.729> the

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:22.879 
so we'll plug the USB port into the

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.219 
so we'll plug the USB port into the
optimized<00:04:23.419> port<00:04:23.750> which<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.199> top<00:04:24.620> one<00:04:25.810> if<00:04:26.810> I

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
optimized port which is the top one if I

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.420 
optimized port which is the top one if I
can<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:27.979> this<00:04:29.560> all<00:04:30.560> right<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:30.979> we<00:04:31.129> have<00:04:31.159> it

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
can do this all right so we have it

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.520 
can do this all right so we have it
plugged<00:04:31.580> up<00:04:31.759> like<00:04:32.300> so<00:04:32.539> we're<00:04:33.169> going<00:04:33.319> to<00:04:33.379> take

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.649 
plugged up like so we're going to take
the<00:04:33.680> other<00:04:33.889> end<00:04:34.189> and<00:04:35.530> it's<00:04:37.030> not<00:04:38.030> awkward<00:04:38.300> as
