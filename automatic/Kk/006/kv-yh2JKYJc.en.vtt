 weaknesses already in the year of

 2009 but since then his family 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.809
 began to deal with the matter in a 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.210
 very reserved without giving further details 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.120
 they also avoid direct contact 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.780

 immortalized in their interpretation 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.180
 see the testimony of artists now 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.150
 Brazilians and personalities about the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.700
 Bolan career good message that the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.890
 What happened was that humble boy. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 that stopped inside a barrel but he 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 I played with friends from social classes 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.030
 different the kiko that always appeared 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.939
 with those toys with those bose 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.950
 critic the lollipops and sometimes he does not 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.920
 I wanted to share things like tea 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.450
 I should be with love and love and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040
 little and small 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.850
 they played together in a way 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.290
 normal to talk about calls is how it is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 last year at the beginning of my 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.399
 career when I had the opportunity 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.770
 to do the first program on sbt 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.600
 It was then that I introduced the Chávez 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.570
 Chávez is very important in my 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.340
 because I held the keys through the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.579
 tv program paulo that i started 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.450
 so I have as it closes the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.619
 eyes and I remember my beginning is 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.420
 starting together with xavi that I do not 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 I knew it was Hugo Chávez already chávez 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.549
 was doing 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.530
 success in my program and then I come 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.879
 doing were several generations of mine 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.900
 kids loved the keys ooo me 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.970
 I loved the xavi 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.569
 My generation liked the keys anyway. 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.940
 and talking about him is how you talk about a 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.790
 person who does not exist so much pain right 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.680
 this is this is you say it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.140
 you see the keys unintentionally 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.269
 wanting you see the keys and there what already 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.579
 I laughed and I had fun. 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.680
 so I'm really proud 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.379
 to have had the opportunity to start 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.569
 my career presenting key was the 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.530
 the first time Chávez appeared in the 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.450
 sbt 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.250
 was through television stage where I 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.099
 where the mara marvel 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.310
 presented then I am very happy and 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.799
 relegate to teach me how to earn money 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.730
 I had with him 12 mother 1988 and again in 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.510
 1991 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.290
 For me, I was a newbie on television and when 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.060
 nor face to face with a myth that 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.519
 always been roberto bails 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.030
 I was even a bit shy you 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.160
 can see in the images of that time that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.470
 the noise when we find a glass 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.780
 even if we work on television 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
 we find one liter we stay 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.760
 fascinated by the fact that it is that idol that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 people accompany so many years of 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.260
 And you think you'll never be close. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.250
 so when I met him and 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.400
 I was very touched by one of the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.349
 Incredible charisma, right? 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.160
 just the fact of the way he looked at 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.900
 I was a bit embarrassed but there 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.849
 have to do interview 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.459
 these two times and has not been 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.590
 different the second time of the first 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.730
 roberto bolano is one of those examples of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.650
 complete communication to professional 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.139
 enormous ability to write direct 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.840
 interpret with for composing songs 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:18.989
 finally a man with the ability to 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.489
 act and master the whole of communication and 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.480
 more than that with a huge 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:28.650
 ability to have a language 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.630
 extremely human ability to achieve 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.140
 More particularly layers lowly 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.540
 of the population and not of a particular 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.200
 population but of all populations 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.930
 What I feel is that the story itself 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.310
 of sbt has a lot to do with this 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.580
 all character roberto angolanos o 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.640
 keys is not the Chávez is one he created 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.470
 an identity with us very much 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.419
 is very effective and inclusive 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.700
 making the very history of the 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.700
 sbt has a wee bit of chavez 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:16.970
 the anime tower is because it has barely read 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.150
 favorably 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:27.510
 when even in tweets in the capital and does 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:31.910
 and not putting it there with programs 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:35.750
 and some breakthroughs are falling 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.520
 in 2000 already won with all my face 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.520
 with a show 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.930
 she 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.060
 Chávez is now delighted. 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.129
 pink guimaraes 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.289
 the beloved ones do not die 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:00.810
 enchanted and is now with small children 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.240
 right after the special 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.569
 Thank you soon after the rebel novel. 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.050
 Good night Brazil, bye there are young people from 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:14.530
 30 and as many years old as 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.370
 females 2016 because beauty and not 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:22.710
 means nothing and the youth come back time 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.710
 and again that you play
