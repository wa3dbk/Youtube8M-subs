 what is it about 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.010

 we said but since we have opened 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.800
 our image the first steps that 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 we must do is create a new layer 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 let's go with this layer is that all 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
 these wrinkles are going to be removed so 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 well let's choose this tool 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.750
 which is the correct brush tool 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.640
 timely and we will select it now 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.970
 What we have to do is make sure 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.890

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.140
 percent 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.089
 5 percent and in space we're going to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.399
 select 1 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.770
 and the size of another we will add it 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.100

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.510

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.060
 well we will remove the visibility 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.819
 of this layer and as you can see is the 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.340
 before and after good now what 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.190

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.090
