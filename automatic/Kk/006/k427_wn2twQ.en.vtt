00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.900 
so now our battery duration you're going
to<00:04:10.049> change<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> nine<00:04:11.400> nine<00:04:11.640> nine<00:04:11.670> nine

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
to change that to nine nine nine nine

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.440 
to change that to nine nine nine nine
nine<00:04:12.859> for<00:04:13.859> every<00:04:14.040> single<00:04:14.220> one<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:15.060> i<00:04:15.180> I

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
nine for every single one because i I

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.020 
nine for every single one because i I
think<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.840> thousand<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.500> top<00:04:17.070> so<00:04:17.640> we're

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
think a thousand is the top so we're

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.650 
think a thousand is the top so we're
just<00:04:18.150> gonna<00:04:18.239> be<00:04:18.329> safe<00:04:18.539> and<00:04:18.720> put<00:04:19.489> 999<00:04:20.489> now<00:04:21.419> when

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
just gonna be safe and put 999 now when

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.589 
just gonna be safe and put 999 now when
you<00:04:21.720> go<00:04:21.810> down<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.109> about<00:04:22.320> right<00:04:23.330> here<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.479> get

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
you go down to about right here you get

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.050 
you go down to about right here you get
default<00:04:25.140> batteries

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
default batteries

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.510 
default batteries
you<00:04:26.720> won't<00:04:26.930> change<00:04:26.990> those<00:04:27.350> somewhere<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
you won't change those somewhere the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.310 
you won't change those somewhere the
default<00:04:28.940> number<00:04:29.120> battery<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.630> basically<00:04:30.050> how

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
default number battery is basically how

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.620 
default number battery is basically how
many<00:04:30.500> batteries<00:04:30.860> do<00:04:31.070> contain<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:31.910> the<00:04:32.270> number

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
many batteries do contain and the number

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.240 
many batteries do contain and the number
of<00:04:32.690> max<00:04:32.900> batteries<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.650> basically<00:04:34.010> the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
of max batteries is basically the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.700 
of max batteries is basically the
batteries<00:04:34.639> you<00:04:34.850> can<00:04:34.880> have<00:04:35.419> but<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.500> don't

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
batteries you can have but you don't

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.640 
batteries you can have but you don't
have<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.630> we're<00:04:38.840> just<00:04:38.870> going<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.230> change<00:04:39.410> that
