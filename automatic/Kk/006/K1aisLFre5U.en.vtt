00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.439

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 very beautiful as you can see is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.930
 in a good state I bought it in a bad way 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.230
 I was sad but I restored 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.340

 for you to take a look at a suspension 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 came from Taiwan 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.670
 the suspension occurs over in several 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.550
 types of regulation looks just that legal 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.280
 every new light that is lost enough 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 comfort but for the agility and lightness of the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.270
 vehicle direction really improved a lot 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.119
 There's a lot of driveability and 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.170
 quite a lot the car is much more agile as well 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.760
 even more 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.689
 the interior of that car as you can. 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 to see 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.540
 a little tight for those who go behind 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.610
 but it's a ball show cart for anyone 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.040

 Look at the comfort you travel in. 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.400
 of that personal car so conditioned 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.900
 very light power steering 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.150
 progressive or in accordance with 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.830
 speed it hardens you do not 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.890

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.440
 from the driver 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.870
 're going to show a little now for you 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.560

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.670
 adjustments as I told you, there's a 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.860
 bit dirty here really this engine 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.450
 because unfortunately a land language 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.550

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.480
 I need the maintenance up to date. 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.940
 It's a reliable car. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.400

 keeping everything as it should be 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.330
 The sound of the year is very carefully. 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.890
 quite zealous 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.910
 possible way 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.560
 It's a rare car It's a hard car to get 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.330
 find in good condition 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 I can tell you that I 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.410
 I spent underneath to keep this car 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.050

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.600
 at least to keep it the way it 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.160
 It's okay that it's not perfect yet. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.530

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.239

 world has to work in that car knows 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.540
 the staff has a bit of prejudice 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.739
 yet all imported species 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.150
