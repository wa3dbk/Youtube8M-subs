00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.830
 10 of batista70phone today I present a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.349
 other clock of tokyo flash jap n come 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.980
 see you can immediately notice that yes 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.980
 is activating a sort of equalizer 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 hear my voice answers practically 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.310
 my solicitations at this stage 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.710
 the clock is practically let's say in 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.530
 stand by to go see the time not 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.629
 they have to do nothing but crush and 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.480
 reading the time will try to do it 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.590
 see you read with the two of us the first two 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.410
 numbers are then they are 10 below and 15 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 and next are the seconds that run 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.460
 it will take a little hard to see why 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.309
 we have the light that bothers us 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 we can always activate the light e 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.899
 go and see let's try switching off a 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.420
 moment the spotlight may be seen better 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.190
 here it is, as you can see, it's 10am 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.990
 16 minutes and 29 30 31 seconds via 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.450
 this button we can go and see 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:19.100
 the date 04 was about to open 05 is the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.640
 day and 14 and precisely the year after a while 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.299
 back to the simple mode 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.400
 watch then we go here as you see 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.290
 while I speak there is a kind of 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.790
 equalization we can leave it in 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.320
 this phase 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.500
 or always turn it off with 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.360
 active updating or return 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.689
 in this phase without equalization 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.659
 this we say that the most expensive method in 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.159
 which you save more battery 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.159
 or if we like we can put 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.290
 equalization have some sort of 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.880
 when the wife sees you move 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.979
 say to mo supercar is a clock 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.270
 very nice well assembled in metal 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.659
 possibility of obviously removing the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 jerseys and go to tighten we have 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.380
 also the possibility 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.209
 the battery is rechargeable as you see 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.819
 here we have a small hole we can 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.920
 quietly close with 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.200
 its screws neither and use a cable 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.400
 that we are going to connect to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.549
 computer example 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.109
 the charge is very fast 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.389
 if we don't use the equalization mode 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.010
 the battery lasts us quietly 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.109
 month with equalization mode 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.810
 always active in short, it depends on how many 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.859
 sometimes the equalizer starts but let's say 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.579
 which does not last very long then if we want 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:45.099
 increase let's say sensitivity there 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.379
 just open this button and the 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.180
 sensitivity increases we say a lot if there is 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.859
 for example of the noise there is a battery 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.419
 at home he called me to see now 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.909
 I break the table anyway as you see 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.459
 increased equalization by holding it 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.319
 closed it is waterproof so you don't have 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.480
 problems that enter the water obviously 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.930
 remember to close the neighbor here 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.959
 side 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.480
 what to say I really like very much 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.400
 nice like 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.360
 as an idea then you see you have the small light here 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.870
 next to night vision a lot 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.709
 beautiful is a bit tamarro we say so to the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.920
 supercar 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.879
 I must say that as an idea I like 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.830
 then I will give you the link with relative prices 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.750
 and all goes well you know that every now and then 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.349
 We also review these things that don't 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.450
 we are particularly connected to 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.909
 world of technology telephony 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.769
 but they are nice and they can 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.750
 also be nice gifts or otherwise 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.730
 also to put to me not sincerely 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.560
 slightly tamarro but not me 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.569
 sorry at all if i have to be honest 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.970
 with this concluded a greeting from the aris 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.970
 aka batista70 for batista70phone
