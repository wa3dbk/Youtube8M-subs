00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
get the hell off there mother
so<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.260> see<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> kinda<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.250> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
so as you can see this is kinda what I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.830 
so as you can see this is kinda what I
wanted<00:01:41.550> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.909> first<00:01:42.060> place<00:01:42.510> but<00:01:42.720> like

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
wanted to be in the first place but like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
wanted to be in the first place but like
I<00:01:42.930> said<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.260> beginning<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.800> video

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
I said in the beginning of this video

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.520 
I said in the beginning of this video
I'm<00:01:44.580> all<00:01:44.970> about<00:01:45.240> efficiency<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.110> keeping<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I'm all about efficiency so keeping the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
I'm all about efficiency so keeping the
speaker<00:01:46.860> wires<00:01:47.009> nice<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> short

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
speaker wires nice and short

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.400 
speaker wires nice and short
keeping<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> amplifiers<00:01:48.810> nice<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.229> close

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
keeping the amplifiers nice and close

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.810 
keeping the amplifiers nice and close
together<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.040> power<00:01:50.220> wires<00:01:50.490> are<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
together so the power wires are the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.670 
together so the power wires are the
exactly<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.300> same<00:01:51.570> ground<00:01:52.200> wires<00:01:52.440> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
exactly the same ground wires the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710 
exactly the same ground wires the
exactly<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> same<00:01:53.369> speaker<00:01:53.940> wire<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.360> exactly

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
exactly the same speaker wire is exactly

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.540 
exactly the same speaker wire is exactly
the<00:01:54.869> same<00:01:55.080> now<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.040> those<00:01:56.159> people<00:01:56.310> who

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
the same now for all those people who

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.280 
the same now for all those people who
are<00:01:56.640> saying<00:01:56.909> well<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.720> could<00:01:57.900> actually<00:01:58.080> have

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
are saying well you could actually have

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.540 
are saying well you could actually have
the<00:01:58.440> speaker<00:01:58.770> while<00:01:58.890> you're<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> same<00:01:59.280> link

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
the speaker while you're the same link

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.310 
the speaker while you're the same link
if<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.450> make<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.930> longer

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
if you just you know make them longer

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.760 
if you just you know make them longer
inside<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.800> box<00:02:02.009> pops-up<00:02:03.020> stupid<00:02:04.020> door<00:02:04.440> why

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
inside the box pops-up stupid door why

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.529 
inside the box pops-up stupid door why
would<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.009> want<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.369> any<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:06.030> wire<00:02:06.300> than

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
would I want to have any more wire than

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:07.940 
would I want to have any more wire than
I<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> when<00:02:07.080> these<00:02:07.170> guys<00:02:07.410> got<00:02:07.619> direct

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I have to when these guys got direct

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.410 
I have to when these guys got direct
leads<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.519> Ricoh<00:02:08.820> ins<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.030> getting<00:02:09.239> gonna

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
leads and the Ricoh ins of getting gonna

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.880 
leads and the Ricoh ins of getting gonna
have<00:02:09.570> direct<00:02:09.869> leads<00:02:10.050> -<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.649> about

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
have direct leads - I'm all about

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
have direct leads - I'm all about
efficiency<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.670> keep<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> wires<00:02:12.269> nice<00:02:12.600> and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
efficiency so I keep the wires nice and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.060 
efficiency so I keep the wires nice and
short<00:02:13.019> letting<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.410> guys<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.800> have

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
short letting you guys know that have

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.190 
short letting you guys know that have
over<00:02:14.280> four<00:02:14.580> amplifiers<00:02:15.239> in<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.780> might<00:02:15.959> throw<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
over four amplifiers in I might throw a

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.540 
over four amplifiers in I might throw a
couple<00:02:16.440> silent<00:02:16.830> Clips<00:02:17.010> after<00:02:17.190> I'm<00:02:17.400> done

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
couple silent Clips after I'm done

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.920 
couple silent Clips after I'm done
talking<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.360> show<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> got
