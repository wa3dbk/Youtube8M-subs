00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello pink I do not know if I'll tell you how to set up some exclusive applications 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.679
 of service rendered 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.819
 where are we going to be able to 

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:15.049
 7 - neatly chronologically all the entities that go with us 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.970
 the system gives its messages 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.970
 emails social networks 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.939
 - Rum very simple as you can see and one of the three waiting screens 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.249
 with flo directly you have to go 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.460
 smith and we wanted to directly disappear this format 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.150
 yes for each letter type where we can see 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.630
 from facebook to emails calls 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.340
 messages all everything 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.710
 in this format 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 pain like that oo 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690
 all take advantage of the horizontal format 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.910
 therefore passing from one to another the note without any problem 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.230
 and where we want 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.390
 what we wanted and this day more directly for example 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.850
 to 6 ko 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 long time directly application 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.320
 and happens to carry all the information related to this contact 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.660
 we would have on facebook 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.980
 to recharge 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.980
 and now we knew we already had 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
 on the other hand we will be able to with figures 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.140
 with the commented by configure 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.430
 here we have marked that we have with figures and all events facebook 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 messages and more losses we could even add our fight against 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 cotto simply say on each one of them the stage 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.630

 on twitter we would do the same 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.910
 and for mail we will do even the same thing 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.830

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.630

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.619
 here 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.949
 kresic let's change the state we can change the status of both facebook 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.299
 as twitter created social networks that are loaded because it is processed in 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.509
 this 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.929

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.489
 p the social networks in the messages the emails 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.679
 this buttons to see if we want to increase our personal agenda with 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:33.399

 direct access to the application 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:41.229
 and like this 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.369
