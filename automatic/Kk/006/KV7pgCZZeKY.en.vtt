maybe<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> dozen<00:00:33.840> teams<00:00:34.230> as<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> team

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
maybe a dozen teams as we got a team

maybe a dozen teams as we got a team
from<00:00:35.489> RIT

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
from RIT

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
from RIT
several<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.870> our<00:00:36.960> team<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:44.000> we<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.120> one

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
several of our team and we have one

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810 
several of our team and we have one
group<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.870> year<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.890> participating<00:00:47.640> in

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
group this year it's participating in

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.340 
group this year it's participating in
and<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.329> our<00:00:48.480> engineering<00:00:49.050> design

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and with our engineering design

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.520 
and with our engineering design
development<00:00:49.739> course<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> group

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
development course we also have a group

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
development course we also have a group
that's<00:00:52.770> participating<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.360> had<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that's participating we actually had a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
that's participating we actually had a
second<00:00:54.960> group<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.039> lost

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
second group but they kind of lost

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
second group but they kind of lost
theirs<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> back<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> truck<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
theirs out of the back of the truck on

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.680 
theirs out of the back of the truck on
the<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.550> thesis<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the way here so it was in thesis so we

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.139 
the way here so it was in thesis so we
actually<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.670> most<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> them<00:01:02.969> are

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
actually only have one most of them are

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.410 
actually only have one most of them are
built<00:01:04.140> two<00:01:04.379> by<00:01:04.559> fours<00:01:04.909> bolted<00:01:05.909> together<00:01:06.000> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
built two by fours bolted together so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.190 
built two by fours bolted together so
you<00:01:06.510> saw<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.200> get<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.950> bunch<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> balls<00:01:09.200> it's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you saw you get a bunch of balls it's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.800 
you saw you get a bunch of balls it's
not<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.680> big<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> deal<00:01:11.330> if<00:01:12.330> you're<00:01:12.540> really

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
not that big a deal if you're really

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
not that big a deal if you're really
cute<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.680> buy<00:01:13.920> some<00:01:14.159> decent

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
cute then you go out buy some decent

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.039 
cute then you go out buy some decent
bearings<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:15.060> that's<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.509> key<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
bearings because that's that's key to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.090 
bearings because that's that's key to
getting<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> thing<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> swing

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
getting the thing to swing

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.940 
getting the thing to swing
there<00:01:19.100> are<00:01:19.280> two<00:01:19.460> categories<00:01:19.760> really

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
there are two categories really

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.560 
there are two categories really
launchers<00:01:21.950> there<00:01:22.220> are<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.850> trebuchet

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
launchers there are the trebuchet

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.330 
launchers there are the trebuchet
there's<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:23.960> catapult<00:01:24.740> kind<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.160> thing<00:01:25.310> that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
there's a catapult kind of thing that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.830 
there's a catapult kind of thing that
you<00:01:25.580> all<00:01:25.700> know<00:01:25.880> about<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.360> then<00:01:26.630> there<00:01:26.780> are

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
you all know about and then there are

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.270 
you all know about and then there are
people<00:01:26.960> bring<00:01:27.260> air<00:01:27.440> cannons<00:01:27.950> will<00:01:28.100> air

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
people bring air cannons will air

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580 
people bring air cannons will air
cannons<00:01:28.810> apparently<00:01:29.810> are<00:01:29.930> unlimited<00:01:30.500> so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
cannons apparently are unlimited so

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.930 
cannons apparently are unlimited so
we've<00:01:30.740> had<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.010> say<00:01:31.160> that<00:01:31.340> you're<00:01:31.490> not<00:01:31.580> allowed

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
we've had to say that you're not allowed

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.600 
we've had to say that you're not allowed
to<00:01:32.240> go<00:01:32.390> over<00:01:32.630> 70<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:33.710> we<00:01:33.830> have<00:01:33.979> had<00:01:34.160> air

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
to go over 70 but we have had air

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.880 
to go over 70 but we have had air
cannons<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.300> past<00:01:35.510> come<00:01:35.870> fairly<00:01:36.350> close<00:01:36.710> to

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
cannons in the past come fairly close to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.150 
cannons in the past come fairly close to
hitting<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.190> fraternity<00:01:37.640> quad<00:01:38.830> so<00:01:39.830> we<00:01:39.950> want

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
hitting the fraternity quad so we want

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.130 
hitting the fraternity quad so we want
to<00:01:40.220> put<00:01:40.310> these<00:01:40.400> in<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.700> popular<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.930> where

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
to put these in the popular and where

00:01:42.140 --> 00:02:15.440 
to put these in the popular and where
these<00:01:42.290> lands

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:03:01.819 

oh<00:02:57.680> my<00:02:58.680> god<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.010> been<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> blast<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.870> been<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
oh my god it's been a blast it's been a

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.000 
oh my god it's been a blast it's been a
lot<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.340> learning<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.940> difficulties<00:03:03.360> but

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
lot of learning and difficulties but

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.580 
lot of learning and difficulties but
problem-solving<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.190> it's<00:03:06.090> been<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> blast

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
problem-solving and it's been a blast
