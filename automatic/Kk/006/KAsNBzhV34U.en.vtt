00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.020 
from and then I did it did it right and
you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.200> glide<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> long<00:01:38.369> time<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you can glide for a long time this is a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.060 
you can glide for a long time this is a
high<00:01:39.509> mountain<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.049> got<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.770> across

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
high mountain I got all the way across

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.749 
high mountain I got all the way across
from<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:42.360> mountain<00:01:42.689> across<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.250> sea<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
from the mountain across the the sea I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.300 
from the mountain across the the sea I
think<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.450> called<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.659> sea<00:01:45.869> at<00:01:46.110> two<00:01:46.649> sandy

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
think it's called a sea at two sandy

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
think it's called a sea at two sandy
shores<00:01:47.579> where<00:01:47.850> Trevor<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.840> originally<00:01:49.320> from

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
shores where Trevor is originally from

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
shores where Trevor is originally from
so<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.880> how<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
so this is just how you get the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.719 
so this is just how you get the
parachute<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.619> don't<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.310> jump<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.610> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
parachute you don't have to jump up in

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.420 
parachute you don't have to jump up in
the<00:01:53.850> mountain<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.780> down<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
the mountain you can go back down on the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.749 
the mountain you can go back down on the
on<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.259> cable<00:01:58.619> car<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.369> have<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
on the cable car so you can have the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.120 
on the cable car so you can have the
parachute<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.420> hand<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.829> several

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
parachute on hand for you know several

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.679 
parachute on hand for you know several
different<00:02:02.579> missions<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.090> case<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.450> need<00:02:03.659> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
different missions in case you need it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.249 
different missions in case you need it
also<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.909> eventually<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.689> land<00:02:06.990> you'll

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
also when you eventually do land you'll

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
also when you eventually do land you'll
see<00:02:07.469> me<00:02:07.590> land<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.039> kinda<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:09.000> land

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
see me land and I kinda actually do land

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.820 
see me land and I kinda actually do land
without<00:02:09.479> dying<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.989> anything<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.319> do<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.560> roll

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
without dying or anything I do a roll

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
without dying or anything I do a roll
your<00:02:11.430> parachute<00:02:11.910> falls<00:02:12.239> off<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.810> then

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
your parachute falls off you and then

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.490 
your parachute falls off you and then
it's<00:02:13.050> discard<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> one

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
it's discard so it is a one

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.600
