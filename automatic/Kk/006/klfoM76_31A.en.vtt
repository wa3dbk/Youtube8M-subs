00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410 

it<00:00:43.809> was<00:00:43.930> fun<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.950> second<00:00:45.280> one<00:00:45.430> being<00:00:45.640> maybe<00:00:46.239> we

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
it was fun the second one being maybe we

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.729 
it was fun the second one being maybe we
lose<00:00:46.630> it<00:00:46.809> or<00:00:47.080> something<00:00:47.440> goes<00:00:47.559> wrong

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
lose it or something goes wrong

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.680 
lose it or something goes wrong
hopefully<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.489> won't<00:00:48.610> happen<00:00:48.700> because<00:00:49.510> I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
hopefully that won't happen because I

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.780 
hopefully that won't happen because I
got<00:00:49.840> my<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:49.989> put<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.559> receiver<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.580> here

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
got my to put you receiver in here

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.210 
got my to put you receiver in here
and<00:00:52.350> 2,000<00:00:53.350> times<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:53.680> didn't<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:54.100> her

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
and 2,000 times you didn't like her

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.410 
and 2,000 times you didn't like her
battery<00:00:54.580> so<00:00:54.760> we<00:00:54.850> don't<00:00:55.000> really<00:00:55.120> want<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.330> to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
battery so we don't really want that to

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:27.760 
battery so we don't really want that to
happen

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.190 

it's<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:29.090> running<00:01:30.090> pretty<00:01:30.420> sweet<00:01:30.720> actually

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it's just running pretty sweet actually

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's just running pretty sweet actually
I<00:01:31.410> just<00:01:32.130> got<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.520> bit<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.790> water<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.420> I

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
I just got a bit of water in there I

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
I just got a bit of water in there I
think<00:01:33.780> maybe<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.170> need<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.440> move<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.950> battery

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
think maybe we need to move the battery

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.420 
think maybe we need to move the battery
forward<00:01:36.300> slightly<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.530> let<00:01:37.830> me<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.070> that

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.150 

because<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:42.000> running<00:01:42.330> a<00:01:42.540> little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:43.160> back

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
because it's running a little bit back

00:01:44.160 --> 00:02:15.210 
because it's running a little bit back
heavy

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.490 

is<00:02:16.220> perhaps<00:02:17.120> wait<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.930> drift<00:02:18.140> over

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
is perhaps wait for it to drift over

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.259 
is perhaps wait for it to drift over
there<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.400> go<00:02:19.550> affect<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:19.970> from<00:02:20.150> that

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
there and then go affect you from that

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.660 
there and then go affect you from that
way<00:02:20.510> because<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.709> can<00:02:21.739> only<00:02:22.010> get<00:02:22.190> one<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:23.090> motor

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
way because I can only get one one motor

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
way because I can only get one one motor
and<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:25.819> just<00:02:25.970> gonna<00:02:26.120> go<00:02:26.269> round<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.630> round

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
and it's just gonna go round and round

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.009 
and it's just gonna go round and round
in<00:02:26.930> circles

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.309 

the<00:02:29.890> radio<00:02:30.190> signal<00:02:30.459> is<00:02:30.700> completely<00:02:31.209> gone<00:02:31.390> so

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
the radio signal is completely gone so

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.649 
the radio signal is completely gone so
now<00:02:32.349> it's<00:02:32.769> just<00:02:33.390> basically<00:02:34.390> waiting<00:02:34.720> for<00:02:35.230> the

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
now it's just basically waiting for the

00:02:36.659 --> 00:03:03.809 
now it's just basically waiting for the
current<00:02:37.659> to<00:02:38.129> take<00:02:39.129> it<00:02:39.250> somewhere<00:03:01.709> but<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:03.430> think

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
current to take it somewhere but I think

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:13.970 
current to take it somewhere but I think
if<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.060> go<00:03:04.269> around<00:03:04.359> far<00:03:04.780> enough

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.369 

came<00:03:14.340> round<00:03:14.580> to<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.720> she<00:03:16.020> completely

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
came round to get it and she completely

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:33.699 
came round to get it and she completely
vanished

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.280 

because<00:03:34.340> for<00:03:34.909> a<00:03:34.939> moment<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.450> actually<00:03:35.719> thought

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
because for a moment I actually thought

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.440 
because for a moment I actually thought
that<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.620> itself<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:37.519> my<00:03:37.670> life<00:03:37.879> of<00:03:38.060> battery

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
that it itself with my life of battery

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.690 
that it itself with my life of battery
and<00:03:38.629> I<00:03:38.719> was<00:03:38.840> like<00:03:38.989> surely<00:03:39.469> in<00:03:39.560> Connell<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.549> is

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
and I was like surely in Connell that is

00:03:40.700 --> 00:04:13.059 
and I was like surely in Connell that is
sort<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.090> impossible<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:11.439> don't<00:04:12.439> know<00:04:12.620> maybe

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
sort of impossible I don't know maybe

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.770 
sort of impossible I don't know maybe
you<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.549> decide<00:04:13.849> probably<00:04:14.389> not

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
you can decide probably not

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.539 
you can decide probably not
considering<00:04:15.470> we<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.620> walked<00:04:15.950> half<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.370> mile

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
considering we just walked half a mile

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.449 
considering we just walked half a mile
round<00:04:16.910> but<00:04:17.599> enjoy<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.229> bit<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.560> fun<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.250> movie

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
round but enjoy a bit of fun and movie

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.419 
round but enjoy a bit of fun and movie
