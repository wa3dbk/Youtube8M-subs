happen now back on track we see the kid
in<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.579> minigames<00:02:08.060> followed<00:02:08.479> by<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.630> number

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
in the minigames followed by the number

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.600 
in the minigames followed by the number
of<00:02:08.989> days<00:02:09.229> to<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> party<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.250> even<00:02:10.429> get

of days to the party we even get
mentioned<00:02:10.820> that<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.209> bite<00:02:11.390> hasn't<00:02:11.690> happened

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.660 
mentioned that the bite hasn't happened
yet<00:02:12.079> because<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.680> one<00:02:12.829> of<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.010> children<00:02:13.430> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
yet because of one of the children the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.460 
yet because of one of the children the
minigames<00:02:14.150> asking<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.750> we're<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.170> our

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
minigames asking if we're going to our

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.380 
minigames asking if we're going to our
party<00:02:15.920> which<00:02:16.489> is<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> strong<00:02:17.000> piece<00:02:17.209> of

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
party which is a strong piece of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.280 
party which is a strong piece of
evidence<00:02:17.720> if<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.019> do<00:02:18.079> say<00:02:18.350> so<00:02:18.380> myself<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:21.140> now

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
evidence if I do say so myself so now

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.420 
evidence if I do say so myself so now
that<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:21.530> know<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.950> game<00:02:22.070> takes<00:02:22.370> place

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
that we know that the game takes place

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.580 
that we know that the game takes place
before<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.970> bite<00:02:23.299> why<00:02:23.810> does<00:02:24.019> the<00:02:24.140> kids<00:02:24.380> see

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
before the bite why does the kids see

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.900 
before the bite why does the kids see
these<00:02:24.769> things<00:02:24.980> well<00:02:25.489> like<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.730> mentioned

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
these things well like I mentioned

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.400 
these things well like I mentioned
before<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.450> Dom<00:02:26.600> bathe<00:02:26.810> here<00:02:27.049> can<00:02:27.230> play

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
before with Dom bathe here can play

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.140 
before with Dom bathe here can play
tricks<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:27.920> mind<00:02:27.950> especially<00:02:28.850> when<00:02:29.000> your

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
tricks on the mind especially when your

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.670 
tricks on the mind especially when your
child<00:02:29.480> in<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.810> middle<00:02:30.079> of<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.320> night<00:02:30.470> with<00:02:30.650> a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
child in the middle of the night with a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.800 
child in the middle of the night with a
grandfather<00:02:31.280> clock<00:02:31.519> going<00:02:31.790> up<00:02:32.060> these

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
grandfather clock going up these

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.080 
grandfather clock going up these
animatronics<00:02:33.260> are<00:02:33.829> appearing<00:02:34.610> because<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
animatronics are appearing because the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.210 
animatronics are appearing because the
kid<00:02:35.269> is<00:02:35.390> afraid<00:02:35.600> of<00:02:35.720> them<00:02:36.019> another<00:02:36.860> point<00:02:37.070> to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
kid is afraid of them another point to

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.710 
kid is afraid of them another point to
bring<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.489> is<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> coma<00:02:38.090> theory<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.570> I've

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
bring up is this coma theory that I've

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.110 
bring up is this coma theory that I've
been<00:02:38.840> hearing<00:02:39.140> about<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.799> I'm<00:02:40.400> with<00:02:40.730> mat<00:02:40.940> pad

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
been hearing about and I'm with mat pad

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.569 
been hearing about and I'm with mat pad
on<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:42.290> can't<00:02:42.650> be<00:02:42.769> that<00:02:42.799> if<00:02:43.130> he's<00:02:43.250> missing

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
on this it can't be that if he's missing

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.800 
on this it can't be that if he's missing
his<00:02:43.609> frontal<00:02:43.940> lobe<00:02:44.000> because<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:44.600> would<00:02:44.780> have

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
his frontal lobe because he would have

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.110 
his frontal lobe because he would have
fear<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.650> these<00:02:45.859> animatronics<00:02:46.280> wouldn't<00:02:47.030> be

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
fear so these animatronics wouldn't be

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.870 
fear so these animatronics wouldn't be
there<00:02:47.299> I<00:02:47.890> should<00:02:48.890> also<00:02:48.950> point<00:02:49.130> out<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.549> for

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
there I should also point out that for

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.729 
there I should also point out that for
tonight<00:02:50.329> six<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.810> seven<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.260> game<00:02:51.500> I'm

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
tonight six and seven of this game I'm

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.770 
tonight six and seven of this game I'm
simply<00:02:52.549> knocking<00:02:52.940> these<00:02:53.060> as<00:02:53.269> non-canonical

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
simply knocking these as non-canonical

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.270 
simply knocking these as non-canonical
nights<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.410> we've<00:02:54.590> seen<00:02:54.620> him<00:02:54.859> five<00:02:55.040> nights

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
nights like we've seen him five nights

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.030 
nights like we've seen him five nights
at<00:02:55.400> Freddy's<00:02:55.700> 2<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:57.200> nightmare<00:02:57.650> being<00:02:57.890> a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
at Freddy's 2 with nightmare being a

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680 
at Freddy's 2 with nightmare being a
recolor<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.609> golden<00:02:58.940> Freddy<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.329> just<00:02:59.510> more

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
recolor of golden Freddy and just more

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.990 
recolor of golden Freddy and just more
difficult<00:03:00.350> thing<00:03:00.530> for<00:03:00.560> the<00:03:00.859> player<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:01.730> we<00:03:01.880> can

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
difficult thing for the player so we can

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.520 
difficult thing for the player so we can
distinguish<00:03:02.480> him<00:03:02.780> from<00:03:02.810> long<00:03:03.560> golden<00:03:03.949> Freddy

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
distinguish him from long golden Freddy

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.490 
distinguish him from long golden Freddy
so<00:03:06.530> back<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.579> track<00:03:07.880> why<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.630> golden<00:03:09.260> Freddy

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
so back on track why is golden Freddy

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.890 
so back on track why is golden Freddy
being<00:03:09.799> so<00:03:10.040> prevalent<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.699> the<00:03:10.850> fit<00:03:11.060> night<00:03:11.329> well

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
being so prevalent on the fit night well

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.780 
being so prevalent on the fit night well
from<00:03:12.049> what<00:03:12.109> we<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.470> tell<00:03:12.530> Fred<00:03:13.190> bears<00:03:13.400> leader

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
from what we can tell Fred bears leader

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.180 
from what we can tell Fred bears leader
of<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> animatronics<00:03:14.720> like<00:03:15.440> chucky<00:03:15.949> cheeses

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
of the animatronics like chucky cheeses

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.849 
of the animatronics like chucky cheeses
with<00:03:16.639> his<00:03:16.820> game<00:03:17.290> reasoning<00:03:18.290> why<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.500> child

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
with his game reasoning why the child

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.680 
with his game reasoning why the child
would<00:03:19.070> be<00:03:19.100> more<00:03:19.400> afraid<00:03:19.609> of<00:03:19.760> him<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.299> why<00:03:20.480> he's

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
would be more afraid of him and why he's

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.539 
would be more afraid of him and why he's
so<00:03:21.079> much<00:03:21.290> more<00:03:21.320> aggressive<00:03:22.010> than<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.190> others

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
so much more aggressive than the others

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.970 
so much more aggressive than the others
when<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.419> birthday<00:03:23.780> party<00:03:24.109> does<00:03:24.350> happen<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
when the birthday party does happen the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.830 
when the birthday party does happen the
brother<00:03:25.220> brings<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.639> child<00:03:25.880> specifically<00:03:26.720> to

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
brother brings the child specifically to

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.449 
brother brings the child specifically to
Fred<00:03:27.079> they're<00:03:27.290> probably<00:03:27.709> knowing<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.370> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
Fred they're probably knowing that the

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.460 
Fred they're probably knowing that the
child<00:03:28.699> is<00:03:28.850> multiplied<00:03:29.449> of<00:03:29.600> him<00:03:29.750> and<00:03:29.959> goes<00:03:30.229> as

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
child is multiplied of him and goes as

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.469 
child is multiplied of him and goes as
far<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.859> sticking<00:03:31.340> him<00:03:31.489> in<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.850> face<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.120> his

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:32.479 
far as sticking him in the face of his

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.229 
far as sticking him in the face of his
fear<00:03:32.799> now<00:03:33.799> this<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.250> where<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.669> bite<00:03:34.820> happens

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
fear now this is where the bite happens

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.780 
fear now this is where the bite happens
and<00:03:35.600> what<00:03:36.109> do<00:03:36.260> we<00:03:36.290> get<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.769> child<00:03:37.250> missing<00:03:37.519> his

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
and what do we get a child missing his

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.849 
and what do we get a child missing his
frontal<00:03:38.090> lobe<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.600> final<00:03:39.470> minigame

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
frontal lobe and the final minigame

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.409 
frontal lobe and the final minigame
