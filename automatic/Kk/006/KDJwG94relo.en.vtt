00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
you know what if the water is cold this

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.079 
you know what if the water is cold this
time<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.739> year<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.019> high<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.489> cold<00:00:41.909> and

time of year and high and it is cold and
high<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:43.070> fish<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:45.379> sinks<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> little<00:00:46.500> faster

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
high I fish it to sinks a little faster

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.329 
high I fish it to sinks a little faster
a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:47.909> bigger<00:00:48.300> profile<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:50.129> water

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
a little bit bigger profile the water

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.179 
a little bit bigger profile the water
starts<00:00:50.699> coming<00:00:50.759> down<00:00:51.089> I<00:00:51.269> fish<00:00:51.720> pours<00:00:52.189> comes

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:53.189 
starts coming down I fish pours comes

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:58.579 
starts coming down I fish pours comes
down<00:00:53.430> farther<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:54.059> fish<00:00:54.570> sixes<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> that's

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
down farther I fish sixes so that's

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.450 
down farther I fish sixes so that's
that's<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.509> a<00:01:00.750> generality

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
that's just a that's just a generality

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
that's just a that's just a generality
if<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.699> had<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.269> choose<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> size<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:05.070> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
if you had to choose a size and you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.350 
if you had to choose a size and you
could<00:01:05.339> just<00:01:05.700> fish<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.329> size<00:01:08.119> winter<00:01:09.119> summer

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
could just fish one size winter summer

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.920 
could just fish one size winter summer
Chris<00:01:09.720> what<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> choose<00:01:11.570> be<00:01:12.570> probably

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
Chris what would you choose be probably

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
Chris what would you choose be probably
a<00:01:12.960> four<00:01:13.590> yeah<00:01:14.460> I'd<00:01:14.759> take<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> fork<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:18.000> just

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
a four yeah I'd take a fork it's just

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
a four yeah I'd take a fork it's just
it's<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> nice<00:01:19.380> hook<00:01:20.040> size

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it's just a nice hook size

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.230 
it's just a nice hook size
I'd<00:01:21.210> rather<00:01:21.920> heaven<00:01:22.920> forbid<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.670> any<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.150> us

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I'd rather heaven forbid that any of us

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
I'd rather heaven forbid that any of us
should<00:01:24.300> just<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.080> choose<00:01:25.320> whether<00:01:26.000> it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
should just have to choose whether it's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600 
should just have to choose whether it's
ridiculous<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.620> it's<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.280> having

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
ridiculous it's just it's like having

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.560 
ridiculous it's just it's like having
one<00:01:29.640> fire<00:01:30.510> rod<00:01:30.750> give<00:01:31.110> me<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.409> break

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
one fire rod give me a break

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.950 
one fire rod give me a break
so<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.049> black<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.280> red<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:36.510> red

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so this is black and red and this red

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.450 
so this is black and red and this red
hackle<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.290> very<00:01:40.680> dusky

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
hackle actually this was a very dusky

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
hackle actually this was a very dusky
kind<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> done<00:01:42.360> color<00:01:42.780> when<00:01:43.080> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.290> dyed

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
kind of a done color when it was dyed

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.450 
kind of a done color when it was dyed
red<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.270> clear<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.220> not

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
red so if it's not clear at but it's not

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.920 
red so if it's not clear at but it's not
a<00:01:47.490> vivid<00:01:48.360> red<00:01:49.670> I<00:01:50.720> often<00:01:51.720> tie<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.990 

this<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.440> gonna<00:01:57.650> be<00:01:57.920> just<00:01:58.130> fine<00:02:00.370> and<00:02:01.370> for<00:02:01.790> those

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
this is gonna be just fine and for those

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.750 
this is gonna be just fine and for those
of<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.450> who<00:02:02.690> are<00:02:02.870> those<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.620> you

perfectionist out there and you know who

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.050 
perfectionist out there and you know who
you<00:02:06.740> are<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:08.470> know<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.770> speak<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.460> you<00:02:10.670> once<00:02:10.880> in

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
you are I know I speak with you once in

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.840 
you are I know I speak with you once in
a<00:02:11.120> while<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.600> get<00:02:11.750> busted<00:02:12.410> because<00:02:12.890> my<00:02:13.400> heads

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
a while I get busted because my heads

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.690 
a while I get busted because my heads
are<00:02:14.150> too<00:02:14.420> lumpy<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.350> I<00:02:15.500> didn't<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.490> or

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
are too lumpy and I didn't do this or

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.730 
are too lumpy and I didn't do this or
that<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.540> will<00:02:17.690> notice<00:02:18.020> that<00:02:18.080> this<00:02:18.350> applies<00:02:18.709> a

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
that you will notice that this applies a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.740 
that you will notice that this applies a
little<00:02:19.190> bit<00:02:19.310> big<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.910> back<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.150> little<00:02:20.570> bit

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
little bit big in the back a little bit

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.170 
little bit big in the back a little bit
narrow<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.320> front<00:02:21.350> I<00:02:21.740> admit<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.030> is

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
narrow in the front I admit it it is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.600 
narrow in the front I admit it it is
it's<00:02:23.390> not<00:02:23.510> supposed<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.900> be<00:02:24.190> if<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.430> had<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
it's not supposed to be if I had a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's not supposed to be if I had a
choice<00:02:25.880> I'd<00:02:26.209> have<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.510> be<00:02:26.660> a<00:02:26.690> little<00:02:26.870> bit

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
choice I'd have it be a little bit

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.600 
choice I'd have it be a little bit
smaller<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.950> back<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.370> little<00:02:28.430> bit

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
smaller in the back and a little bit

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.130 
smaller in the back and a little bit
bigger<00:02:28.820> in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.000> front<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.630> know<00:02:29.750> what<00:02:29.959> it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
bigger in the front but you know what it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.490 
bigger in the front but you know what it
doesn't<00:02:30.290> always<00:02:30.470> work<00:02:30.680> out<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:30.920> way<00:02:32.500> but

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
doesn't always work out that way but

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.890 
doesn't always work out that way but
when<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.550> Chris<00:02:34.730> takes<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.120> picture<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:35.690> I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
when it Chris takes a picture of this I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.010 
when it Chris takes a picture of this I
have<00:02:36.110> one<00:02:36.320> neatly<00:02:36.680> stacked<00:02:37.250> away<00:02:38.020> this

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
have one neatly stacked away this

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:51.760
