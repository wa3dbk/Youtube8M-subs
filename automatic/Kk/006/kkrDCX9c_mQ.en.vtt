am aware I want to get rid of the the
actual<00:01:29.369> outline<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.360> just

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
actual outline of this and then just

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
actual outline of this and then just
make<00:01:30.719> sure<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.770> actual<00:01:32.130> width<00:01:32.369> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.319 
make sure that the actual width and
height<00:01:32.969> is<00:01:33.770> all<00:01:34.770> appropriate<00:01:35.219> here<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.969> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
height is all appropriate here so that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.510 
height is all appropriate here so that
does<00:01:36.570> look<00:01:36.780> good<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.619> let's<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.399> go<00:01:38.490> ahead

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
does look good and let's just go ahead

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
does look good and let's just go ahead
and<00:01:38.640> make<00:01:38.759> sure<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.090> adjust<00:01:39.420> us<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:40.110> over<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and make sure we adjust us just over the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
and make sure we adjust us just over the
artboard<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:41.969> this<00:01:42.329> object

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
artboard so now that we have this object

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.170 
artboard so now that we have this object
you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.920> option<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.969> on<00:01:45.090> your

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you have an option up here on your

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.459 
you have an option up here on your
object<00:01:45.719> under<00:01:46.409> path<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.820> ahead<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.180> say

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
object under path to go ahead and say

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.080 
object under path to go ahead and say
split<00:01:49.469> into<00:01:49.649> grid<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.520> over<00:01:50.789> here<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.060> can

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
split into grid and over here you can

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.209 
split into grid and over here you can
identify<00:01:51.329> how<00:01:51.810> many<00:01:51.960> rows<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> how

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
identify how many rows you have and how

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.310 
identify how many rows you have and how
many<00:01:53.399> columns<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.990> stated<00:01:55.170> before

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
many columns and as I stated before

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.080 
many columns and as I stated before
there's<00:01:55.770> gonna<00:01:55.859> be<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.250> row<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.909> my

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
there's gonna be one row because my

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.920 
there's gonna be one row because my
images<00:01:57.450> are<00:01:57.509> really<00:01:57.960> tall<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.149> and<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.810> just

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
images are really tall and and it's just

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.370 
images are really tall and and it's just
going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.289> be<00:02:01.409> four<00:02:01.740> columns<00:02:02.659> so<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.200> see

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
going to be four columns so you can see

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
aligned guide markers and we can now go

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.920 
aligned guide markers and we can now go
to<00:02:19.530> file<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.220> place<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.940> I'm<00:02:21.240> assuming<00:02:21.690> that
