00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.980
 lots of things change up 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.020
 Joost playing games are the 'most important 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.610
 is of course the new microphone and the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.380
 also come in a new room tomorrow 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.460
 this video that you see now is nothing 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.200
 not recorded on my new camera 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.579
 tire was a bit wrong with the delivery 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.750
 and then only come in tomorrow 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.000
 especially in the morning you will just 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.340
 the videos will see you is 60 fps 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.219
 in 1080 p with even the face cam in it 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.990
 1080 ps 60 fps everything is very cord and the 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.819
 vlog will also be from 60 fps team that the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.630
 tendons are a very nice quality because 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.100
 my new camera 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.959
 and that is really a very nice upgrade 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.149
 of the videos completely different also just 

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:14.749
 the webcam in 60 fps is allowing me 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.819

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.999

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:21.529
 and of course the microphone for the 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.119
 blue snowball has been doing it for almost two years now 

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.619
 maybe longer and two longer 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.479
 even years and it was allowed as time 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.920
 to be that beginning is microphone 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.779
 as I call marshall to replace 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.249
 this old one is more professional 

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:32.990
 technology you that I have now bought for 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:37.130
 their knowledge among us it is the audio 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.359
 technica t 2020 usb plus variant and that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.950
 is really a very nice thing i like the 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.450
 old quality really super nice and what 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.069
 You now also hear the quality of 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.119
 my new microphone and I'm used to 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.459
 super happy with it 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.439
 the d2 is that i put my entire schedule on this 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.029
 turn the moment around because it is now 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.380
 another mess I change every week 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.299
 is something different again it's never real 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.529
 constant and I want a bit of a schedule 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.939
 keep what I am proud of 

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:58.189

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.689
 am proud just go for it one 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.520
 many series fall away 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.200
 lots of things go on other days and 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.639
 before that time we are already one again 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.749
 a few weeks later so I will keep it 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.489
 equally secret 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:09.110
 I still wanted to work out I want some names 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.460
 I want to change with other 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.750
 youtubers discuss what they think about it 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.010
 things so keep it behind if that goes 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.390
 change there was about him maybe 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.050

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.670

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.050
 but you will change small ones 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.880
 changes that will now 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.980
 taking place is as follows 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.480

 just try 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.270
 but that is for Saturday because 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.310
 your podcast is not every week but 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.560
 without two weeks and every Sunday comes 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.510
 a minecraft skywars episode online 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.310
 I'm going to build that up a bit 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.720
 I see that in the community of the Netherlands 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.340
 being free is very much fun 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.690

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.400
 played the link page with 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.780
 brian does and those guys want but 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.459
 also just help so there goes anyway 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.300

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.830
 on my channel 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.360
 and that is the current one 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.100
 changes that I want to implement 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.870
 pokémon and you choose to continue 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.910
 for demand, of course, continues 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.680

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.870
 agree a video online the second video 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.300
 those will just remain random videos 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.340

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.630
 neighbor and neighbor games like that kind of 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.790
