00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 and all three notes and I'm reviewing today 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:11.370
 The new mod is a mod on a werewolf too 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.790
 cool mod here and it allows 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.190
 turn into animals well, not easy 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.619
 website example team chatting third out 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:27.080
 tracery here are some things for this and so 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:37.230
 Now I will tell you about them 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:40.230
 time i write 1 you need to start gif gif 470 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 here and there you will have such here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.800
 a menu that does not look like a sword to her 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:58.340
 I 'll see for animals and everything 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:08.010
 Vilk this fall's here right now, and I 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:10.590
 an ordinary person now I will be mine 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 I immediately liked this mod because I 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.320
 such a cow's but that's generally not mod 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.890
 like it because you can turn 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 In all of course except these words mobs 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.750
 zombies I'm not talking about them now 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.479
 I will try to find it now because 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.479
 back at live unless I know 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.150
 but as long as the load victories also recently 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.490
 I use 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.759
 I donâ€™t need a sheep 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.189
 cool crumbs have cons 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.770
 example when multiplayer was played to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.710
 most nickname here I did not show it 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.860
 as an ordinary person saw cows 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 and I'm in the shower being a cow 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:17.459
 now we will find some kind of mob 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:22.260
 mobs but could be where else look so 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:29.069
 same hour from another one on night vision about 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:41.150

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:41.150
 Gus fashion watch so I do not remember so 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:03:00.569
 I do not remember because I mode 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:06.930
 then there are no bones hardcot hardcot here I am 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.070
 thing to have a genome as well, probably not a pike 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
