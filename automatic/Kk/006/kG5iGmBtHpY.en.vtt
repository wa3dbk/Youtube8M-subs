00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome to face book cooking then 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.560
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.990
 new recipe muscles and that of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 benquet cros was holding so look good 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 you will need 50 20 oatmeal 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.690
 75 ml of water one measure two proteins 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.939
 for my part it will be baule and at the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 vanilla and you can add more 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 a little bit of sugar and I'm 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.510
 vanilla flavored sugar for the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.699
 recipe it's really very very simple 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 so you will come and have a shaker 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:38.120
 or a salad bowl we will come to put the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.840
 sugar oatmeal protein 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.550
 and have completed 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.610
 we add to the wolf we come then closed 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.070
 the shaker and there simply we come 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.500
 check the preparation for about 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
 about thirty seconds and for the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.250
 cooking is very simple you go 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 take a pan you put a small 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.550
 little fat otherwise it risks 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.920
 to give birth 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 I took the choice to put the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.580
 package in a circle for a beautiful 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.740
 form but you can do it without 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.760
 circle you just have to pour your 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.280
 preparation and after three minutes of 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.350
 cooking we just return the pancake and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 look at me the color he has and I 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.580
 can you tell that there he is already well 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.490
 thick and it smells strongly vanilla that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.619
 is going to be just delicious here are the friends 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.579
 let's go for the result 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.799
 so we have pretty punk and the ex with 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.329
 a beautiful texture if you show well 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.970
 beyond they are high 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.009
 I put a little bit even a lot of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.350
 maple syrup i love holy wants you 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.880
 to put peanut butter is very 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.450
 good also for bodybuilding 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 so here's a little bit of texture and 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.610
 now we will go directly to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.610
 tasting 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.920
 hello it's a pure shocking slaughter 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.840
 this is the best way to eat 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.900
 the prote because it's just delicious 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.300
 we have a debate is that a good texture 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.730
 a good taste of myself I love the so 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.640
 it's just terrible and it's to be tested 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.290
 as I already wanted said the taste is 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.450
 really very very good I think 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.640
 it's one of my favorite ways to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.709
 eat the protein we feel it's 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.230
 something very good it's heavy 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.110
 anyway but it's particularly 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.000
 well we all enjoy eating 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.760
 pancakes except that there is more 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.590
 something protein and and at the same 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.600
 pretty light time I want to say 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.580
 because we do not have too much material 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.290
 fat so do not hesitate to test 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.110
 at home you can send me of course 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.880

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.239
 to cover up the eyes 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.670
