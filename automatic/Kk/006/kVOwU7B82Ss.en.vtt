00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
here is my cloning tool right so I can

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.410 
here is my cloning tool right so I can
make<00:00:43.800> my<00:00:44.010> brush<00:00:44.250> bigger<00:00:44.700> I'm<00:00:45.030> clicking<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
bracket to make it bit smaller in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.670 
bracket to make it bit smaller in the
open<00:00:52.980> bracket<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.030> bigger<00:00:54.530> left<00:00:55.530> and

open bracket to make it bigger left and
right<00:00:55.800> brackets<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.850> now<00:00:57.059> instead<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> just

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
right brackets so now instead of just

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.479 
right brackets so now instead of just
clicking<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.559> dragging<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.250> could<00:00:59.399> do

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
clicking and dragging like I could do

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.380 
clicking and dragging like I could do
before<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.149> actually<00:01:00.350> paint<00:01:01.609> over<00:01:02.609> an<00:01:02.850> area

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
before I can actually paint over an area

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.710 
before I can actually paint over an area
in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.080> image<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> remove<00:01:06.240> just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
in the image that I want to remove just

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.530 
in the image that I want to remove just
like<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.729> goes<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.330> gone

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
like this and there it goes it's gone

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
like this and there it goes it's gone
and<00:01:09.900> you'll<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.350> what's<00:01:10.560> happening<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.100> so

and you'll see what's happening here so
it's<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.810> doing<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.140> clone<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
it's not it's not doing a clone like a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's not it's not doing a clone like a
does<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.400> Photoshop<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.150> he'll<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.869> does

in<00:01:16.200> Photoshop<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.799> actually<00:01:17.869> replicating

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
in Photoshop it's actually replicating

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.039 
in Photoshop it's actually replicating
what<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.619> old<00:01:19.920> feature<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.880> Lightroom<00:01:21.360> 4<00:01:21.720> did

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049

what the old feature in Lightroom 4 did
a<00:01:22.290> EIG<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.460> easy<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.090> sort<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.479> create<00:01:24.780> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
a EIG or easy just sort of create a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
a EIG or easy just sort of create a
circle<00:01:26.250> where<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> sample<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.869> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
circle where it's got a sample from and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
circle where it's got a sample from and
copy<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.740> target<00:01:29.040> area<00:01:29.340> cool<00:01:30.329> thing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
copy over the target area cool thing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.530 
copy over the target area cool thing
about<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.530> grab<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.540> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
about that is I can now grab that that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
about that is I can now grab that that
target<00:01:34.079> area

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
target area

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160 
target area
the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.220> sample<00:01:35.549> from<00:01:36.090> area<00:01:36.600> we'll<00:01:36.780> call<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the first sample from area we'll call it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.830 
the first sample from area we'll call it
and<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.070> drag<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.400> around<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.600> can

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
and I can drag it around so that I can

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
and I can drag it around so that I can
have<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> sample<00:01:40.619> different<00:01:40.950> parts<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
have it sample different parts of the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.789 
have it sample different parts of the
image<00:01:41.549> whatever<00:01:42.450> makes<00:01:42.689> sense<00:01:42.780> if<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.649> don't

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
image whatever makes sense if I don't

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
image whatever makes sense if I don't
like<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.579> just<00:01:44.759> click<00:01:44.909> delete

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
like any of it I can just click delete

like any of it I can just click delete
and<00:01:45.479> start<00:01:45.840> again<00:01:46.040> for<00:01:47.040> example<00:01:47.159> we'll<00:01:47.520> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and start again for example we'll just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.819 
and start again for example we'll just
paint<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.420> brush<00:01:48.689> here

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
do little pieces like that you could you

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.370 
do little pieces like that you could you
know<00:02:06.060> you'd<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.479> generally<00:02:07.110> take<00:02:07.259> it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
know you'd have to generally take it

a<00:02:13.470> lot<00:02:13.800> more<00:02:14.040> work<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.910> staying<00:02:15.150> right<00:02:15.480> in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
a lot more work just staying right in

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.600 
a lot more work just staying right in
Lightroom<00:02:16.320> now<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.160> what<00:02:17.310> are<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.460> main

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
differences between that feature the new

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
differences between that feature the new
revised<00:02:20.730> version<00:02:21.270> of<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.450> feature<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
revised version of that feature and the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.110 
revised version of that feature and the
old<00:02:22.320> feature<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.830> was<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.100> Lightroom<00:02:23.400> 4<00:02:23.730> is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
old feature that was in Lightroom 4 is

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.870 
old feature that was in Lightroom 4 is
that<00:02:25.080> Lightroom<00:02:25.500> 4<00:02:25.740> let<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.490> think<00:02:26.760> that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that Lightroom 4 let you I think that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.460 
that Lightroom 4 let you I think that
the<00:02:27.030> feature<00:02:27.240> was<00:02:27.510> specifically<00:02:27.990> designed

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
the feature was specifically designed

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.100 
the feature was specifically designed
for<00:02:28.590> sensor<00:02:29.130> dust<00:02:29.370> or<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.570> specks<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
for sensor dust or just little specks of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.200 
for sensor dust or just little specks of
things<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.680> were<00:02:31.920> sort<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.820> floating<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
things that were sort of floating in the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.620 
things that were sort of floating in the
air

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
air

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.200 
air
on<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.960> image<00:02:34.230> or<00:02:34.770> in<00:02:35.070> blank<00:02:35.460> area<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
on the image or in blank area so you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.120 
on the image or in blank area so you
could<00:02:36.330> do<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.570> sort<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.870> cloning<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.470> use<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.070> a

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
could do that sort of cloning I use it a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.220 
could do that sort of cloning I use it a
lot<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.460> retouching<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.330> use<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.020> you
