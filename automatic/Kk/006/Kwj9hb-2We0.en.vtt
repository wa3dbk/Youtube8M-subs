00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.700
IAN: There's a boulder right there.
SIMON: There is. We're gonna hit that.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:41.590
IAN: Dodge 'em car. Rod, rod, rod.
SIMON: Lean into the log. Not away from it.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:57.060
JASE: Just lean into the log. We're good.
We're good. Watch your head. A bit close.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.850
CAMERAMAN: What about me?
JASE: Nearly wiped out the cameraman. You

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.950
good, mate?
CAMERAMAN: Yeah.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:53.070
JASE: Is it deep? Alright, we're going in.
We're going in. Oh ****.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.870
SIMON: I reckon we want to go right over to
the left there, aye?

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:21.810
JASE: Because this tide's dropped now, this
fresh water is starting to crank. See if I've

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:31.600
got a bit of control with this motor. Just
hold us in position. I don't want to go---.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.959
****. We're going backwards. ****.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.700
It will give me a bit of control. Come on,
baby.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.480
No, we're gonna hit.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:44.080
Well that was a bit intense.
Especially by myself.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.510
The biggest fear there,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.590
is when you hit a rock, the water just wants
to tip you, and tip the boat over and once

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.590
we tip that boat. Watch your head. We're not
out of it yet.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.920
The problem is with a rapid like that, once your
boat gets caught on a rock, the water can

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.660
push your boat. Tip it over. You get that
thing wet and you can't get it goin', we're

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:37.230
40 mile from our cars, our cars are in the
middle of nowhere. I was just talkin' to Ian,

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:45.860
he'd never even been up there before. So that
puts it all into perspective when something

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:55.260
like that becomes a challenge. You've just
gotta pull it all together and make it happen.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.930
Let's go fishing.
