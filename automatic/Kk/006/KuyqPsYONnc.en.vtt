00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
all right so here's the version two of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.970 
all right so here's the version two of
this<00:00:06.480> battery<00:00:06.930> box<00:00:08.210> I<00:00:09.349> want<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.469> show<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.679> some

this battery box I want to show you some
of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.099> refinements<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.820> did<00:00:12.059> things

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
of the refinements that I did things

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.110 
of the refinements that I did things
that<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.509> added<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.700> as<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.940> tell

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
that I added to it and as you can tell

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300 
that I added to it and as you can tell
this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.719> cheap<00:00:15.990> 22<00:00:16.590> inch<00:00:16.770> toolbox

pretty heavy it's about 50 pounds having

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.749 
pretty heavy it's about 50 pounds having
waited<00:00:30.060> exactly<00:00:30.779> yet<00:00:31.189> but<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.369> roughly

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
waited exactly yet but it's roughly

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.639 
waited exactly yet but it's roughly
around<00:00:32.880> there<00:00:34.160> opening<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:36.350> you<00:00:37.350> can<00:00:37.469> see

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
around there opening it up you can see

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.850 
around there opening it up you can see
there's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> bunch<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> stuff<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:39.860> seven

won't<00:00:47.340> charge<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.760> real<00:00:48.030> fast<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.829> will

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
won't charge it real fast but this will

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.630 
won't charge it real fast but this will
keep<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.250> topped<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:52.460> just<00:00:53.460> put<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
keep it topped off and just put that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.299 
keep it topped off and just put that
aside<00:00:53.879> first<00:00:55.579> charge<00:00:56.579> controller<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:59.219> I've

aside first charge controller and I've

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.760 
aside first charge controller and I've
switched<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.879> these<00:01:00.180> connectors<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
switched all these connectors out to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.210 
switched all these connectors out to
these<00:01:01.890> SAE<00:01:02.489> style<00:01:03.030> connectors<00:01:03.920> just<00:01:04.920> because

so<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> I<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.390> lucky<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.810> hang<00:04:21.959> off<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.290> the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
so that I can lucky just hang off to the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.630 
so that I can lucky just hang off to the
side<00:04:22.820> this<00:04:23.820> way<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.060> can<00:04:24.210> close<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.780> lid<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.640> in

side this way I can close the lid and in

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:36.020 
side this way I can close the lid and in
the<00:04:26.730> front<00:04:28.370> show<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.430> here<00:04:34.820> I've<00:04:35.820> got<00:04:36.000> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
the front show you here I've got a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.460 
the front show you here I've got a
switch<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.590> voltmeter<00:04:38.930> will<00:04:39.930> tell<00:04:40.170> me<00:04:40.290> my

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
switch and a voltmeter will tell me my

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.420 
switch and a voltmeter will tell me my
state<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.800> charge<00:04:42.440> it's<00:04:43.440> very<00:04:43.650> low<00:04:43.920> amp<00:04:44.190> draw

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
state of charge it's very low amp draw

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.880 
state of charge it's very low amp draw
so<00:04:44.820> I<00:04:45.120> can<00:04:45.690> leave<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:46.140> all<00:04:46.320> day<00:04:46.500> long<00:04:46.530> if<00:04:46.800> I

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
so I can leave that on all day long if I

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.430 
so I can leave that on all day long if I
want<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.330> but<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.360> can<00:04:48.480> just<00:04:48.630> turn<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.900> off

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.490 

alright<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.910> let's<00:04:54.180> put<00:04:54.330> this<00:04:54.420> back<00:04:54.480> in<00:04:54.930> show

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
alright so let's put this back in show

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.200 
alright so let's put this back in show
you<00:04:55.560> how<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.960> is<00:04:58.020> generally<00:04:58.710> used<00:04:59.120> so<00:05:00.120> all

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
you how this is generally used so all

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.780 
you how this is generally used so all
this<00:05:00.360> stuff<00:05:00.630> goes<00:05:00.840> back<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.320> here<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:04.790> will

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
this stuff goes back in here I will

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.700 
this stuff goes back in here I will
probably<00:05:06.120> end<00:05:06.390> up<00:05:06.600> simplifying<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:07.410> lot<00:05:07.590> of

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
probably end up simplifying a lot of

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.410 
probably end up simplifying a lot of
this<00:05:07.830> I'm<00:05:08.430> going<00:05:08.640> to<00:05:08.700> leave<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.150> charge
