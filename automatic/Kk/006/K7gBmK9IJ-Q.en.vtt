00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
like this is a silicone tape it's very

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.310 
like this is a silicone tape it's very
very<00:01:10.170> thin<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.860> actual<00:01:11.370> tape<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.390> what

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
very thin it's not actual tape but what

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950 
very thin it's not actual tape but what
plumbers<00:01:14.190> use<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.970> force<00:01:15.330> they're

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
plumbers use this force they're

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
plumbers use this force they're
connecting<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.440> pipes<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.550> just<00:01:18.060> thin

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
connecting to pipes it's just thin

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.080 
connecting to pipes it's just thin
enough<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.020> seal<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.370> if<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.610> taking<00:01:20.970> two

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
enough to seal so if you're taking two

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.760 
enough to seal so if you're taking two
pieces<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> metal<00:01:21.690> and<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> you're

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
pieces of metal and you're and you're

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
pieces of metal and you're and you're
threading<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:24.000> together<00:01:24.180> what<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> do<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
threading them together what you do is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.310 
threading them together what you do is
you<00:01:25.290> wrap<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.799> around<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.420> actual<00:01:29.720> bar<00:01:30.720> okay

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
you wrap this around the actual bar okay

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.410 
you wrap this around the actual bar okay
so<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.830> case<00:01:31.890> here<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:34.549> even<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:36.240> in

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so in this case here and even going in

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
so in this case here and even going in
here<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.260> is<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.440> this<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.770> an<00:01:38.010> old<00:01:38.159> strat

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
here and this is a this is an old strat

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.480 
here and this is a this is an old strat
so<00:01:39.080> you<00:01:40.080> could<00:01:40.260> obviously<00:01:40.619> use<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.310> with

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
so you could obviously use this with

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
so you could obviously use this with
newer<00:01:41.670> strats<00:01:42.030> or<00:01:42.180> older<00:01:42.390> stress<00:01:42.630> you're<00:01:42.810> not

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
newer strats or older stress you're not

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.260

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
covering the threads okay

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.050 
covering the threads okay
