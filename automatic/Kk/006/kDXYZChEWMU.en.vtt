then rolling out the sugar paste and
then<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.740> went<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> cut<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.460> circles<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.330> go

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
then I'm went to cut out circles that go

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.749 
then I'm went to cut out circles that go
on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.690> side<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:14.700> using

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
on the side so for this I'm using

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.930 
on the side so for this I'm using
cutters<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.830> also<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.220> piping<00:01:17.610> tube

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
cutters and also I'm using a piping tube

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.540 
cutters and also I'm using a piping tube
because<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.660> like<00:01:18.959> some<00:01:19.319> circles<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.069> be<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
because I like some circles to be a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.089 
because I like some circles to be a
little<00:01:21.149> bit<00:01:21.270> smaller<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.349> the<00:01:22.380> sizes<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:23.099 
little bit smaller for the sizes of the

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:26.660 
little bit smaller for the sizes of the
cutters<00:01:23.459> I<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> piping<00:01:26.160> tube<00:01:26.369> makes

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
cutters I have so the piping tube makes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.400 
cutters I have so the piping tube makes
a<00:01:26.819> good<00:01:27.000> cutter

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.050 

all<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:32.680> time<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> red<00:01:33.460> sugar<00:01:33.730> paste

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
all the time that the red sugar paste

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.540 
all the time that the red sugar paste
isn't<00:01:34.390> being<00:01:34.750> used<00:01:35.080> I<00:01:35.500> keep<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.370> wrapped

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
isn't being used I keep it wrapped

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.580 
isn't being used I keep it wrapped
through<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.880> plastic<00:01:37.090> bag<00:01:37.510> so<00:01:37.900> that<00:01:38.320> it

and<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:52.390> find<00:02:52.629> it<00:02:52.780> easier<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.500> cake

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and I find it easier to have the cake

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.830 
and I find it easier to have the cake
raised<00:02:54.010> slightly<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.120> I've<00:02:55.239> put<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.629> one

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
raised slightly so I've put this one

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.319 
raised slightly so I've put this one
onto<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.200> turntable<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.549> could<00:02:57.760> use<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.209> a

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
onto a turntable but you could use it a

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.750 
onto a turntable but you could use it a
mixing<00:02:58.810> bowl<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.290> raise<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.650> up<00:02:59.829> as<00:03:00.010> well<00:03:02.760> then

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
mixing bowl to raise it up as well then

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.420 
mixing bowl to raise it up as well then
to<00:03:03.970> pipe<00:03:04.239> I'm<00:03:04.629> doing<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.349> snail's<00:03:05.650> trail<00:03:06.099> which

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
to pipe I'm doing a snail's trail which

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.500 
to pipe I'm doing a snail's trail which
is<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.700> series<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.209> dots<00:03:07.569> which<00:03:08.530> are<00:03:08.739> joined<00:03:09.010> up

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
is a series of dots which are joined up

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.440 
is a series of dots which are joined up
and<00:03:10.859> I'm<00:03:11.859> piping<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:12.760> little<00:03:13.030> bit<00:03:13.180> away

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and I'm piping just a little bit away

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.780 
and I'm piping just a little bit away
from<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:14.379> red<00:03:14.680> dots

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.210 

I've<00:03:18.330> got<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.569> damp<00:03:18.870> cloth<00:03:19.110> here<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:20.069> when<00:03:20.189> I

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
I've got a damp cloth here but when I

I've got a damp cloth here but when I
keep<00:03:20.489> breaking<00:03:20.840> their<00:03:21.840> line<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.950> clean<00:03:23.189> em

keep breaking their line I can clean em

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.869 
keep breaking their line I can clean em
to<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.730> piping<00:03:24.150> tube<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.349> damp<00:03:25.560> cloth

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.369 

then<00:03:29.879> when<00:03:30.030> they<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.540> end<00:03:30.629> of<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.870> line

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.399 
then when they get to the end of a line
I<00:03:31.409> can<00:03:31.799> pipe<00:03:32.010> some<00:03:32.280> dots<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.750> four<00:03:34.019> or<00:03:34.049> five

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
I can pipe some dots so four or five

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.970 
I can pipe some dots so four or five
dots<00:03:34.879> starting<00:03:35.879> off<00:03:36.000> with<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.209> big<00:03:36.420> one<00:03:36.629> and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
dots starting off with a big one and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.229 
dots starting off with a big one and
then<00:03:37.980> decreasing<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.790> size<00:03:40.340> then<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.459> can<00:03:41.670> use<00:03:41.879> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
then decreasing in size then I can use a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:59.880 
then decreasing in size then I can use a
damp<00:03:42.780> paintbrush<00:03:43.409> just<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.750> press<00:03:45.989> some<00:03:46.230> down

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
I'm now going to make the point setter

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.710 
I'm now going to make the point setter
to<00:04:02.650> go<00:04:02.890> on<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.130> top<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.700> only<00:04:04.120> actually<00:04:04.360> need

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
to go on the top I only actually need

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840 
to go on the top I only actually need
one<00:04:05.020> but<00:04:05.590> I'm<00:04:05.740> going<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:05.950> make<00:04:06.100> several<00:04:06.430> just

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
one but I'm going to make several just

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.460 
one but I'm going to make several just
in<00:04:07.000> case<00:04:07.209> any<00:04:07.450> break<00:04:07.720> while<00:04:07.959> I'm<00:04:08.080> handling

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
in case any break while I'm handling

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.520 
in case any break while I'm handling
them<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.910> to<00:04:09.970> dry<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.480> point<00:04:10.840> setter<00:04:11.140> in<00:04:11.500> the

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530

one for the top and I'm going to use the

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.120 
one for the top and I'm going to use the
red<00:04:33.880> sugar<00:04:34.419> paste<00:04:34.750> as<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.050> did<00:04:35.350> for<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.590> dots<00:04:35.860> on

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130

roll the flowers out more thinly and

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.140 
roll the flowers out more thinly and
they'll<00:05:19.990> set<00:05:20.229> and<00:05:20.410> they'll<00:05:20.560> hold<00:05:20.770> their<00:05:20.979> shape

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.150 

and<00:05:25.150> I'm<00:05:25.360> going<00:05:25.569> to<00:05:25.630> roll<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:26.050> out<00:05:26.289> on<00:05:26.979> the

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
and I'm going to roll it out on the

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.210 
and I'm going to roll it out on the
surface<00:05:27.669> that's<00:05:27.910> been<00:05:28.120> lightly<00:05:28.360> dusted<00:05:29.220> with

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
surface that's been lightly dusted with

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.400 
surface that's been lightly dusted with
icing<00:05:30.400> sugar<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:33.400> each<00:05:33.580> flower<00:05:34.000> is<00:05:34.479> made<00:05:35.139> up<00:05:35.289> of

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
icing sugar so each flower is made up of

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.820 
icing sugar so each flower is made up of
two<00:05:35.620> layers<00:05:36.569> so<00:05:37.569> I<00:05:37.630> cut<00:05:37.840> one<00:05:38.020> layer<00:05:38.259> with<00:05:38.560> the

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
two layers so I cut one layer with the

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.260 
two layers so I cut one layer with the
larger<00:05:39.220> size<00:05:39.430> calyx<00:05:40.030> cutter<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:42.280> then<00:05:42.970> I'm

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
larger size calyx cutter and then I'm

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.930 
larger size calyx cutter and then I'm
going<00:05:43.449> to<00:05:43.509> brush<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.750> little<00:05:44.080> bit<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.349> water<00:05:44.940> in

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
going to brush a little bit of water in

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.850 
going to brush a little bit of water in
the<00:05:46.150> center<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:47.819> and<00:05:49.229> I'm<00:05:50.229> going<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.530> rest

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
the center of that and I'm going to rest

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.240 
the center of that and I'm going to rest
it<00:05:51.130> in<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.120> cup<00:05:52.330> shape<00:05:52.810> of<00:05:52.990> foil<00:05:53.259> then<00:05:54.130> I'm

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
it in the cup shape of foil then I'm

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.610 
it in the cup shape of foil then I'm
going<00:05:54.430> to<00:05:54.520> cut<00:05:54.759> out<00:05:54.789> a<00:05:55.419> layer<00:05:56.110> with<00:05:56.530> the

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
going to cut out a layer with the

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.879 
going to cut out a layer with the
smaller<00:05:56.860> size<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:58.110> I'm<00:05:59.110> going<00:05:59.139> to<00:05:59.380> rest<00:05:59.620> that

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
smaller size and I'm going to rest that

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.700 
smaller size and I'm going to rest that
on<00:06:00.069> top<00:06:00.370> so<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:01.479> alternates<00:06:02.050> with<00:06:02.620> the

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
on top so that it alternates with the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.059 
on top so that it alternates with the
first<00:06:02.979> layer<00:06:03.990> then<00:06:04.990> once<00:06:05.349> I've<00:06:05.530> made<00:06:05.680> all<00:06:05.919> the

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
first layer then once I've made all the

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.520 
first layer then once I've made all the
flowers<00:06:06.520> I<00:06:06.759> pipe<00:06:07.120> the<00:06:07.300> center's<00:06:07.750> in<00:06:07.990> them<00:06:08.199> in

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
flowers I pipe the center's in them in

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.120 
flowers I pipe the center's in them in
yellow<00:06:08.889> royal<00:06:09.280> icing<00:06:09.659> and<00:06:10.659> this<00:06:10.900> is<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.620> series

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
yellow royal icing and this is a series

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:19.969 
yellow royal icing and this is a series
of<00:06:12.159> dots<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:17.110> cover<00:06:17.349> the<00:06:17.680> whole<00:06:17.889> of<00:06:17.919> the<00:06:18.130> inside

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
of dots to cover the whole of the inside

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.200 
of dots to cover the whole of the inside
then<00:06:20.979> once<00:06:21.159> you've<00:06:21.340> gone<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.669> covered<00:06:22.000> the

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
then once you've gone and covered the

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.809 
then once you've gone and covered the
inside<00:06:22.599> you<00:06:22.900> can<00:06:23.020> then<00:06:23.229> do<00:06:23.409> a<00:06:23.440> few<00:06:23.830> and<00:06:24.520> pull

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
inside you can then do a few and pull

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:27.540 
inside you can then do a few and pull
the<00:06:24.940> icing<00:06:25.360> up<00:06:25.539> just<00:06:26.500> so<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.889> gets<00:06:27.069> longer

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
the icing up just so that it gets longer

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.749 
the icing up just so that it gets longer
peaks<00:06:28.110> to<00:06:29.110> give<00:06:29.259> more<00:06:29.440> texture<00:06:29.919> to<00:06:30.039> the<00:06:30.280> center

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
peaks to give more texture to the center

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.060 
peaks to give more texture to the center
and<00:06:31.060> they<00:06:31.509> should<00:06:31.690> be<00:06:31.810> left<00:06:31.990> overnight<00:06:32.530> to<00:06:32.740> dry

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
and they should be left overnight to dry

00:06:34.070 --> 00:07:16.800 
and they should be left overnight to dry
