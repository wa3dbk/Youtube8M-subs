00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
plants in a self-watering container

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.820 
plants in a self-watering container
right<00:00:13.110> here<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.620> front<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.040> me<00:00:14.870> to<00:00:15.870> harvest<00:00:16.560> the

right here in front of me to harvest the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.400 
right here in front of me to harvest the
plants<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.789> general<00:00:18.240> rule<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> thumb<00:00:18.630> with

plants the general rule of thumb with

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.529 
plants the general rule of thumb with
most<00:00:19.770> herbs<00:00:20.130> than<00:00:20.430> most<00:00:20.580> greens<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.390> don't

most herbs than most greens is you don't

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.029 
most herbs than most greens is you don't
want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.720> take<00:00:21.900> more<00:00:22.080> than<00:00:22.289> one-third<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.890> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
want to take more than one-third of the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.700 
want to take more than one-third of the
plants<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.550> any<00:00:24.060> given<00:00:24.300> time<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.470> will

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
plants at any given time as that will

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.700 
plants at any given time as that will
stress<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> plants<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.710> potentially

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stress out the plants and potentially

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
stress out the plants and potentially
cause<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.400> put<00:00:29.789> its<00:00:29.910> energy<00:00:30.269> into

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
cause it to put its energy into

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.690 
cause it to put its energy into
producing<00:00:30.750> flowers<00:00:31.160> rather<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.430> into

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
producing flowers rather than into

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090 
producing flowers rather than into
tender<00:00:33.030> leaves<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.230> eat<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
tender leaves that we like to eat and to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
tender leaves that we like to eat and to
enjoy<00:00:36.110> we're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.469> learn<00:00:37.710> about

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
enjoy we're going to first learn about

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
enjoy we're going to first learn about
how<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.100> harvest<00:00:38.430> basil<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.320> generally<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
how to harvest basil and generally I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.430 
how to harvest basil and generally I
recommend<00:00:41.040> people<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.760> cut<00:00:42.450> individual<00:00:43.170> stems

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
recommend people to cut individual stems

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
recommend people to cut individual stems
of<00:00:43.649> basil<00:00:44.010> rather<00:00:44.670> than<00:00:44.910> pinch<00:00:45.149> off

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
of basil rather than pinch off

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.020 
of basil rather than pinch off
individual<00:00:45.930> leaves<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.890> reason<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
individual leaves the reason for this is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.389 
individual leaves the reason for this is
that<00:00:48.120> cutting<00:00:48.960> off<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.320> stems<00:00:49.399> encourages

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that cutting off the stems encourages

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.610 
that cutting off the stems encourages
new<00:00:50.670> branching<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.390> new<00:00:51.570> growth<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.590> occur

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
new branching and new growth to occur

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.709 
new branching and new growth to occur
which<00:00:53.430> generally<00:00:53.789> means<00:00:53.940> higher<00:00:54.239> yields

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
which generally means higher yields

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.250 
which generally means higher yields
throughout<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> entire<00:00:55.649> season<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.780> harvest

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
throughout the entire season to harvest

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.250 
throughout the entire season to harvest
the<00:00:58.469> basil<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> look<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.390> one<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the basil we're going to look for one of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.139 
the basil we're going to look for one of
the<00:01:01.350> basil<00:01:01.739> stems<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.399> we're<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> look

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the basil stems and we're going to look

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.670 
the basil stems and we're going to look
for<00:01:03.390> an<00:01:03.449> area<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:04.019> there's<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.470> bit

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
for an area where there's a little bit

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.070 
for an area where there's a little bit
of<00:01:04.710> new<00:01:04.979> growth<00:01:05.250> happening<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.689> example

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
of new growth happening so for example

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.380 
of new growth happening so for example
in<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.380> stem<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:07.920> here<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:09.000> some<00:01:09.240> new

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
in this stem right here there's some new

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.899 
in this stem right here there's some new
growth<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:09.810> happening<00:01:10.290> here<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.920> some

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
growth that's happening here and some

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.370 
growth that's happening here and some
new<00:01:12.030> growth<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.420> happening<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.900> in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
new growth that's happening right in

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.039 
new growth that's happening right in
here<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.820> long<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.240> cut<00:01:15.450> above<00:01:15.689> where

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
here so as long as we cut above where

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.289 
here so as long as we cut above where
some<00:01:16.290> new<00:01:16.470> growth<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> happening<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:18.030> plant

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
some new growth is happening the plant

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.800 
some new growth is happening the plant
will<00:01:18.479> branch<00:01:18.780> out<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.250> produce<00:01:20.250> some

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
will branch out and produce some

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
will branch out and produce some
neutrals<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.900> us<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.040> use<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
neutrals for us and we can use all of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.090 
neutrals for us and we can use all of
the<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.540> leaves<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> even<00:01:25.409> use<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.710> stem

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the the leaves we can even use the stem

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819 
the the leaves we can even use the stem
in<00:01:26.600> flavoring<00:01:27.600> our<00:01:27.780> different<00:01:28.320> soups<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
in flavoring our different soups and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.630 
in flavoring our different soups and
stews<00:01:29.280> as<00:01:29.549> well<00:01:31.009> when<00:01:32.009> we're<00:01:32.159> harvesting

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
stews as well when we're harvesting

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.030 
stews as well when we're harvesting
oregano<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.240> oregano<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.990> just<00:01:34.350> about<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
oregano this oregano is just about to

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
oregano this oregano is just about to
flower<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.549> now<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.270> cut<00:01:36.420> all

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
flower right now so we want to cut all

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.560 
flower right now so we want to cut all
of<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.579> manageable<00:01:38.640> level

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of that down to a more manageable level

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.710 
of that down to a more manageable level
and<00:01:40.130> again<00:01:41.130> we're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.700> looking<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and again we're going to be looking to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.050 
and again we're going to be looking to
cut<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.290> plants<00:01:43.680> above<00:01:44.189> where<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.850> some

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
cut the plants above where we see some

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
cut the plants above where we see some
new<00:01:45.210> growth<00:01:45.420> happening<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.649> cut<00:01:46.860> too<00:01:47.100> far

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
new growth happening if we cut too far

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.550 
new growth happening if we cut too far
down<00:01:47.729> where<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:48.570> no<00:01:48.780> new<00:01:48.990> growth<00:01:49.259> below

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
down where there's no new growth below

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.190 
down where there's no new growth below
it<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.610> might<00:01:50.790> kill<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.329> individual<00:01:51.899> branch

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
it we might kill that individual branch

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560 
it we might kill that individual branch
and<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.860> might<00:01:53.070> reduce<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> future<00:01:54.090> yields<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and we might reduce the future yields of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
and we might reduce the future yields of
that<00:01:54.810> plant<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.740> anywhere<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:56.850> new

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that plant so anywhere you see some new

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
that plant so anywhere you see some new
growth<00:01:57.180> happening<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.930> example<00:01:57.960> there's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
growth happening for example there's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.709 
growth happening for example there's
some<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.130> there's<00:01:59.340> some<00:01:59.460> right<00:01:59.640> here

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
some right here there's some right here

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
some right here there's some right here
we<00:02:00.719> can<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.049> cutting<00:02:01.409> above<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we can be cutting above there and that

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.760 
we can be cutting above there and that
will<00:02:03.119> help<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.570> control<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> shape<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
will help to control the shape of the

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.980 
will help to control the shape of the
plants<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.180> help<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> encourage

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
plants and that will help to encourage

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.850 
plants and that will help to encourage
new<00:02:07.740> growth<00:02:07.770> new<00:02:08.520> leaves<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:10.319> deliciousness

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
new growth new leaves more deliciousness

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.309 
new growth new leaves more deliciousness
for<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.700> our<00:02:11.849> plants<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
for all of our plants and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.009 
for all of our plants and
our<00:02:13.409> cooking<00:02:13.999> so<00:02:14.999> we<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.269> continue<00:02:15.689> to<00:02:15.840> cut<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
our cooking so we can continue to cut a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.949 
our cooking so we can continue to cut a
little<00:02:16.170> bit<00:02:16.349> more<00:02:16.469> and<00:02:17.180> again<00:02:18.180> we<00:02:18.629> don't<00:02:18.810> want

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
little bit more and again we don't want

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.479 
little bit more and again we don't want
to<00:02:19.049> cut<00:02:19.170> more<00:02:19.379> than<00:02:19.409> one<00:02:19.769> third<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.249> plant

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
to cut more than one third of the plant

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.660 
to cut more than one third of the plant
at<00:02:20.670> any<00:02:20.879> time<00:02:21.499> when<00:02:22.499> it<00:02:22.620> comes<00:02:22.859> to<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.639> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
at any time when it comes to the the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.599 
at any time when it comes to the the
time<00:02:24.269> similar<00:02:25.139> kind<00:02:25.499> of<00:02:25.560> idea<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.219> our<00:02:26.340> time<00:02:26.579> is

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
time similar kind of idea so our time is

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.970 
time similar kind of idea so our time is
all<00:02:26.909> right<00:02:27.090> here<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.689> starting<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.739> spill

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
all right here it's starting to spill

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.849 
all right here it's starting to spill
over<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.310> side<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.969> plants<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.560> as<00:02:31.560> long

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
over the side of the plants and as long

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.649 
over the side of the plants and as long
as<00:02:32.069> we<00:02:32.219> don't<00:02:32.430> take<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.909> than<00:02:33.000> 1/3<00:02:33.299> as<00:02:33.510> long

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
as we don't take more than 1/3 as long

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.300 
as we don't take more than 1/3 as long
as<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.900> cut<00:02:34.079> above<00:02:34.379> where<00:02:34.620> we<00:02:34.650> see<00:02:34.920> some<00:02:35.159> new

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
as we cut above where we see some new

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.619 
as we cut above where we see some new
growth<00:02:35.609> and<00:02:35.849> some<00:02:36.000> new<00:02:36.120> development

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
growth and some new development

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.720 
growth and some new development
happening<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.620> plant<00:02:37.889> will<00:02:38.069> continue<00:02:38.489> to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
happening the plant will continue to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.709 
happening the plant will continue to
grow<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:40.680> produce<00:02:40.859> new<00:02:41.189> leaves<00:02:41.219> for<00:02:41.730> us<00:02:41.909> so

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
grow and to produce new leaves for us so

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.440 
grow and to produce new leaves for us so
you<00:02:43.109> can<00:02:43.230> see<00:02:43.409> I've<00:02:43.560> cut<00:02:43.769> this<00:02:44.269> part<00:02:45.269> of<00:02:45.359> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
you can see I've cut this part of the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.809 
you can see I've cut this part of the
time<00:02:45.689> right<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.439> can<00:02:47.310> cut<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> little<00:02:47.579> bit

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
time right here I can cut a little bit

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.490 
time right here I can cut a little bit
more<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.239> basil<00:02:48.599> train<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.079> to<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.290> more

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
more of the basil train this to a more

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.629 
more of the basil train this to a more
manageable<00:02:49.680> shape<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> as<00:02:52.109> we<00:02:53.099> continue<00:02:53.609> to

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
manageable shape and as we continue to

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.240 
manageable shape and as we continue to
harvest<00:02:53.939> these<00:02:54.329> plants<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.650> continue<00:02:56.099> to

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
harvest these plants it will continue to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.729 
harvest these plants it will continue to
grow<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.060> produce<00:02:57.599> lots<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.079> great

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
grow back and produce lots of great

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.409 
grow back and produce lots of great
herbs<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.250> us<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.519> be<00:02:59.639> cooking<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.209> using

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
herbs for us to be cooking and using

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.110 
herbs for us to be cooking and using
throughout<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.439> entire<00:03:01.739> season<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:03.030> that's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
throughout the entire season so that's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.360 
throughout the entire season so that's
how<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.359> harvest<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> basil<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.469> oregano<00:03:04.859> at

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
how you harvest the basil the oregano at

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.949 
how you harvest the basil the oregano at
the<00:03:05.430> time<00:03:05.639> you<00:03:05.819> want<00:03:05.969> to<00:03:06.030> generally<00:03:06.540> cut<00:03:06.719> them

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
the time you want to generally cut them

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
the time you want to generally cut them
rather<00:03:07.530> than<00:03:07.799> pinching<00:03:08.189> off<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.519> individual

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
rather than pinching off the individual

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.740 
rather than pinching off the individual
leaves<00:03:09.419> to<00:03:10.139> maximize<00:03:10.799> your<00:03:10.949> harvest<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.750> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
leaves to maximize your harvest and to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.479 
leaves to maximize your harvest and to
ensure<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.439> plant<00:03:13.650> continues<00:03:14.099> to

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
ensure that the plant continues to

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.189 
ensure that the plant continues to
produce<00:03:15.060> good<00:03:15.419> leaves<00:03:15.629> for<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.109> the

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:16.199 
produce good leaves for you in the

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.409 
produce good leaves for you in the
future
