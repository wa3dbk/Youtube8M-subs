00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
can make it they can change that can

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.920 
can make it they can change that can
actually<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.030> difference<00:00:39.149> on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.629> whole

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
actually make a difference on the whole

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.979 
actually make a difference on the whole
face<00:00:40.199> is<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:41.790> line<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.269> huge

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
face is that little line there huge

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
face is that little line there huge
difference<00:00:43.589> because<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.550> pay

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
difference because we don't pay

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
difference because we don't pay
attention<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:45.960> reduce<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
attention to it but reduce that the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.460 
attention to it but reduce that the
depth<00:00:47.729> of<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.089> and<00:00:48.479> it<00:00:48.659> just<00:00:48.690> changes<00:00:49.409> the

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
depth of it and it just changes the

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.749 
depth of it and it just changes the
overall<00:00:50.120> how<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.300> say<00:00:51.979> countenance<00:00:52.979> because

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:53.759 
overall how do I say countenance because

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:55.490 
overall how do I say countenance because
when<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.180> goes<00:00:54.479> that<00:00:54.809> makes<00:00:55.049> you<00:00:55.170> look<00:00:55.350> like

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
when this goes that makes you look like

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.179 
when this goes that makes you look like
your<00:00:55.710> son<00:00:55.979> it<00:00:56.759> kind<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.089> goes<00:00:57.780> down<00:00:58.080> so<00:00:58.890> based

00:00:59.179 --> 00:00:59.189 
your son it kind of goes down so based

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:01.340 
your son it kind of goes down so based
on<00:00:59.400> that<00:00:59.460> district<00:01:00.000> exactly<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> whole<00:01:01.110> face

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on that district exactly the whole face

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.679 
on that district exactly the whole face
kind<00:01:01.619> of<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.799> eye<00:01:01.920> looks<00:01:02.339> at<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.820> way<00:01:03.059> but

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:03.689 
kind of the eye looks at it that way but

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:05.420 
kind of the eye looks at it that way but
once<00:01:03.900> you<00:01:04.049> feel<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> has<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> straight

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
once you feel it and it has a straight

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.480 
once you feel it and it has a straight
look<00:01:05.670> now<00:01:06.049> and<00:01:07.049> that's<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> know<00:01:07.619> makes

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
look now and that's what you know makes

look now and that's what you know makes
all<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:08.880> difference<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> eye<00:01:10.049> looks<00:01:10.320> at

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
all the difference when the eye looks at

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.410 
all the difference when the eye looks at
the<00:01:10.560> face<00:01:10.829> the<00:01:11.340> moment<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> unlined

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the face the moment you see the unlined

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.499 
the face the moment you see the unlined
Isis<00:01:13.110> okay<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.650> person<00:01:14.009> is<00:01:14.070> agent<00:01:14.579> because

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
Isis okay this person is agent because

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.569 
Isis okay this person is agent because
that<00:01:15.869> line<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> goes<00:01:16.650> deep<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> get<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> job

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
that line as it goes deep you get a job

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.940 
that line as it goes deep you get a job
if<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> draw<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.450> straight<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.829> it

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
if you draw it straight this is what it

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.710 
if you draw it straight this is what it
is<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.579> just<00:01:20.850> perceived<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is so that I just perceived that as a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.350 
is so that I just perceived that as a
sign<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.049> agent<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.430> also<00:01:23.610> work<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
sign of agent so we also work on that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.490 
sign of agent so we also work on that
and<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.409> all<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.770> used<00:01:26.120> just<00:01:27.120> one<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.110> syringe

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and in all we used just one like syringe

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
and in all we used just one like syringe
in<00:01:28.710> his<00:01:28.830> small<00:01:29.130> strengths<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.820> two<00:01:29.970> point

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
in his small strengths as two point

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
in his small strengths as two point
three<00:01:30.330> cc's<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.050> radius<00:01:31.620> was<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> result<00:01:34.460> I'm

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
three cc's of radius was this result I'm
