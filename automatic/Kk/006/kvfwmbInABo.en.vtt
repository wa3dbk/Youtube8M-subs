00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.560
 All products look here at noon today on 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.480
 water directed that existed so far 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 never been a cruise ship in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.710

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.400
 we are often in eckernförde and 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.980
 today for the first time holiday beginning 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 beginning of the year with the grandchildren and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 we are quite surprised that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.920
 Shipping is the local tourism 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.570

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.119
 from the cruise cake abzubekommen 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.900

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.610
 as planned 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.090
 Actually they should be in sacred harbor 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
 but unfortunately he is the port too 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.059
 shallow that means the ship would have been too far 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.379
 have to lie outside 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.090
 and there we are nautically better 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.690

 third unauthorized not to the pier system 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.180
 but that's all 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.809
 temporarily the plant will be tomorrow again 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.470
 with a reception in eckernförde 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.869
