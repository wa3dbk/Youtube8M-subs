00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.570
 Well, I'm really happy about you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.020
 find today for fans a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.730
 new video 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.040
 so today I'm coming back for you 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.690
 talk about the magic 'place I do not know the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 everything if you know actually it's 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 a on glass for mobile phone that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.880
 looks like a plastic film but it's 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.640
 much thicker and so it's going 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 to protect your phone 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.310
 scratches things like that because 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.270
 that's when you have to change the screen 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.460
 it costs a lot more 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.980
 so I present this product to you 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.900
 why because it's pretty similar 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 finally a plastic film that we can 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.880
 find everywhere except that one 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.430
 knows all the big air bubbles at 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.230
 middle of the phone because the movie 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.190
 plastic arises badly on a lot of 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.469
 trouble doing there are some beautiful 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 everywhere I have never set film 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.050
 plastic on my cell phones 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.860
 but see what was bubbling 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.210
 and I find it ugly 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.100
 so I always used 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.200
 hulls actually like these at flap at 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 level of the screen to protect it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 has always been well protected I had already 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.239
 seen a video on precisely this product there 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.940
 for phones I found that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.280
 super good and when they offered me 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.809
 here is to send me a product for 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.710
 able to test I said yes everything from 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.719
 next because precisely that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 I was very interested because 5 of 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.479
 blow I do not dare put shells 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.220
 right behind the phone because 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.240
 this is my screen I'm really scared of 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.650
 damage it because when I put it in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.270
 the bag is often a lot of mess and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.640
 i am and key all that so here I am 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 prefers but that kind of cocks and so 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.130
 and here I am not taking codes for 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.530
 the behind but at least that's my 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 screen and protect and +7 survive and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 anti-scratch so already it will fit 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.350
 your phone and it survives you 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 do not go herself and in addition 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.110
 of that the break is super simple to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.520
 do it finally here it's really hyper 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.189
 convenient we have all the products for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 really well clean the front screen and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.890
 then put it on glass and you go 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.509
 see there is no bubble is there survival 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 to pose alone is enough 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 impressive end 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 really i find this product really 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.360
 well so the jelly already applied 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.500
 since I did the demo before 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.390
 to just be able to talk to you a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.070
 little bit of the break there is no 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.149
 bubble i do not know if you can see 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.119
 anyway I show you more 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.110
 close in in the video yes you can 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.340
 see that I hang my curls 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.810
 video Love ears because I have 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.579
 no storage loop ear so 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 I make your means from the edge the carpet of 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.369
 still working as well I did the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.770
 test before I show it to you also in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.420
 words is not because we are a 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.469
 on quickly thicker than the carpet of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.149
 works less well he always walks 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.160
 as well there you have no worries 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 so I'm really pleased 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.000
 so at the bottom i will leave you with the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 demo and then I come back after then 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.700
 first of all I'm going to show you what he 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 ya in the voice so you will see 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.629
 that there is no need for much 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.580
 so you have survival like you 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.040
 can see it's a pretty fast on 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.540
 rigid and not very fine you have 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.190
 then a little alcohol wipe and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 a small wipe to wipe your 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.769
 screen then you have like a little 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.480
 scotch tip that will allow you 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.580
 to catch the little dust that gets 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.780
 still find on the screen so we're going 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 start we'll take the little 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.860
 wipes soaked in alcohol and we're going 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.060
 clean the screen with this 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.220
 wipes that will allow to remove 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.599
 all the traces on the screen what he 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.670
 must know is that it's hyper 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.470
 important to really well clean up 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.940
 the screen since when you go to ask 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.829
 sweat fast is still better 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.540
 there is no trace underneath 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.040
 otherwise it'll show up and then we'll 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.870
 take the little wipe we will come 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.390
 wipe the screen it just goes 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.709
 allow to remove all the product that 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.860
 is on the screen and that was in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.359
 the language is so then I take the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.160
 little piece of tape and I'm coming 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.630
 tap on my screen that's all 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.739
 simply allow to remove all 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.750
 small dust in it 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.829
 again I think it's really not 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.910
 bad even though I find that it leaves 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.410
 some small traces still on 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.480
 the screen I did not show to the camera 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.250
 but not manage a little bit of laundry is 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.230
 gray that I used before to 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.330
 able to really remove the traces and 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.400
 after that it was nickel 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.020
 so then we take survival too 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.210
 take off the plastic and pay attention 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.830
 not to put your fingers on the side 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.690
 tights otherwise you at the time of the traces 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.620
 of fingers and if you try to 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.180
 remove you will make traces 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.090
 even bigger so mostly do 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.860
 attention to that then you take your 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.750
 survival tea you put it well above 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.730
 from your phone take your time there 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.140
 must be really well posed and 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.150
 then I'm just going with my 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.900
 point gently leaning on the glass 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.270
 what will make her stick all alone 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.440
 it's impressive then I support 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.590
 on the sides for it to be well 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.750
 stuck two everywhere and it's over it's 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.250
 hyper fast as could see without 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.780
 no difficulty everyone can there 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.180
 to arrive I assure you that if I get there 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.530
 everyone can do it if you 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.670
 see small breeds on the side 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.080
 it's just interest my 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.410
 phone that's broken I'm doing them 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.520
 fall 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.709
 it's a hindrance in any way use 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.160
 but it's normal this is absolutely 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.390
 no air bubbles I will you 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.010
 show that survival you do not play in 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.840
 nothing on the touch and a walk all 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.310
 as well as when I did not have 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.140
 survive at the top it's not because 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.490
 that she is very thick that her chain 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.720
 something on the contrary I did 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.250
 really not feel like having a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.830
 on quickly that's what bluffes me 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.090
 ac is that it protects extremely well 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.110
 my side of it the phone works 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.110
 always as well 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.500
 so as you could see on the demo 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.360
 it's super simple to ask you've seen 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.310
 I laid down life so you really have to 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.140
 well there in relation to the phone 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.820
 you drop it you press a 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.410
 place and you see it arises 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.220
 all alone so I think at this moment 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.110
 there the camera has not made the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.610
 focus properly 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.650
 pity but it really arises 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.700
 well there is no air bubble but 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.260
 really no 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.520
 and that's really what 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.600
 I like because I do not like when 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.160
 there are big air bubbles everywhere 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.080
 even if it's full of little ones 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.960
 hate that I prefer not limit actually 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.880
 and there really is nickel so I 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.140
 would like to thank the website already 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.600
 of one for his kindness that are 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.580
 extremely nice about them but there are 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.720
 little smile and that's it shows 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.400
 really that people are really 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.110
 nice and here they thanked me 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.550
 many times and that I find that 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.650
 really great to have a partnership 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.480
 which is happening as well with 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.340
 so nice people and besides they 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.950
 offered me to benefit from my 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.240
 close so the jean coup the bonuses 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.620
 for world because I had him 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.610
 talked to him he likes a lot protected his 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.120
 screen I often have movies 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.260
 plastics 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.930
 but there are a lot of bubbles and 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.460
 I can not get 0 goal ago 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.690
 always full of bubbles it's boring and 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.130
 So I took him one like that 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.680

 promo for you from -20% so I find 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.370
 that it's really not negligible 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.600
 put all the info here 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.820
 so it sure costs more 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.840
 a simple little plastic film 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.790
 we can find a little bit everywhere 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.110
 for not much but I assure you 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.400
 that it has nothing to do I usually 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.170
 I put that name because 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.120
 the oyster angle too much and so that's it 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.710
 me who but every time and it's 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.280
 every time the galley I rest it I 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.690
 rest I'm not getting there 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.370
 already it's not easy to use because 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.050
 that it's really flexible whereas 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.980
 there it is a survival of cowardly and weighs 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.420
 so what makes it stay good 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.919
 right and she's not going away in all 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.570
 the senses but that you just have to 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.980
 position she dropped and 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.139
 after just walking she sticks everything 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.389
 alone while there it is super flexible 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.410
 it's frankly not practical and finally 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.350
 that's if you're used to using 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.400
 this kind of two movies here you have 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.690
 the habit and you know it's 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.580
 really galley there I assure you that 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.870
 it's totally different it shows 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.490
 right now that's going to hold a lot 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.440
 better it really sticks well 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.130
 as I tell you there is no bubble and 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.300
 really I think it's some 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.530
 something that will lasted me a very long time 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.419
 especially as plastic films 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.500
 classic can be so it's 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.510
 % overall for foreign exchange because they 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.080
 are paid too much when that's done 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:17.470
 specifically just scratch resistant so even 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.720
 was beating so even the sweat panes did not 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.770
 will not be scratched so that will you duration 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.360
 really long time if you take it 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.130
 care of course it's going to last 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.419
 for a long time I think it's tough 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.830
 I really think it's top that we see 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:28.900
 girls for this video I hope that 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.190
