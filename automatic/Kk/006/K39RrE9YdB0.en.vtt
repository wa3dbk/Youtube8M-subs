a<00:00:46.170> video<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.860> difference<00:00:47.280> between

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
a video about the difference between

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.340 
a video about the difference between
mechanics<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.110> technicians<00:00:50.660> yes<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
mechanics and technicians yes there is a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.619 
mechanics and technicians yes there is a
difference<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:53.430> some<00:00:53.670> degree<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.329> i<00:00:54.449> would

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
difference to some degree and i would

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.119 
difference to some degree and i would
say<00:00:54.899> i<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:56.070> easily<00:00:56.489> sum<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:56.910> visually<00:00:57.420> by

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
say i can easily sum it up visually by

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.330 
say i can easily sum it up visually by
mechanics<00:00:59.840> technicians<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.649> mechanics<00:01:02.219> was

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
mechanics technicians so mechanics was

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
mechanics technicians so mechanics was
mostly<00:01:02.640> use<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.199> technicians<00:01:04.199> would

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
mostly use these technicians would

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.120 
mostly use these technicians would
mainly<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:05.010> these<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:06.470> yes<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.650> course<00:01:07.890> they

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
mainly use these and yes of course they

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
mainly use these and yes of course they
would<00:01:08.310> use<00:01:08.490> both<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.299> there<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> some

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
would use both because there is some

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
would use both because there is some
crossover<00:01:10.830> between<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> two<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.880> similar<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
crossover between the two but similar to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.580 
crossover between the two but similar to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the medical profession auto repair has

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.690 
the medical profession auto repair has
specialists<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> some<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> those

systems of that vehicle yes the

systems of that vehicle yes the
electronics<00:01:54.840> are<00:01:54.990> most<00:01:55.950> likely<00:01:56.250> tied<00:01:56.640> into

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
electronics are most likely tied into

those<00:01:57.119> mechanical<00:01:57.689> systems<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.520> person

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
those mechanical systems but the person

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.170 
those mechanical systems but the person
that<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.409> work<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.250> those<00:02:02.490> systems<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that is going to work on those systems I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.550 
that is going to work on those systems I
think<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> differentiation<00:02:04.530> between

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
think there's a differentiation between

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.280 
think there's a differentiation between
those<00:02:05.189> two<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.939> mechanics<00:02:06.450> are<00:02:06.719> mostly

those two your mechanics are mostly

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.680 
those two your mechanics are mostly
doing<00:02:07.469> tire<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.459> lube<00:02:08.489> work<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.300> type<00:02:09.479> thing

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
doing tire and lube work that type thing

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.350 
doing tire and lube work that type thing
or<00:02:09.869> or<00:02:10.020> basic<00:02:10.920> mechanical<00:02:11.610> work<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.970 
in ours transmission aren't ours but
then<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:14.970> get<00:02:15.120> into<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.810> fine<00:02:16.110> minutia

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
then when you get into the fine minutia

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.590 
then when you get into the fine minutia
of<00:02:17.190> things<00:02:17.640> when<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:17.970> start<00:02:18.030> breaking<00:02:18.540> it

down take for instance somebody that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.740 
down take for instance somebody that
might<00:02:20.310> rebuild<00:02:20.550> an<00:02:21.060> automatic<00:02:21.510> transmission

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
might rebuild an automatic transmission

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.440 
might rebuild an automatic transmission
I<00:02:22.350> would<00:02:22.920> put<00:02:23.130> them<00:02:23.280> more<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> technician

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
I would put them more on the technician

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
I would put them more on the technician
side<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.620> mechanic<00:02:26.070> side

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
forte might be taking things apart and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.620 
forte might be taking things apart and
putting<00:03:17.070> them<00:03:17.160> back<00:03:17.280> together<00:03:17.580> let's<00:03:18.299> face<00:03:18.600> it

putting them back together let's face it

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780 
putting them back together let's face it
doing<00:03:19.320> an<00:03:19.440> engine<00:03:19.709> job<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:20.340> taking

hundreds of things back together and at
times<00:03:25.110> it's<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> miracle<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> gets<00:03:26.190> back

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
times it's a miracle that it gets back

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.330

together and it runs at all that takes a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.180 
together and it runs at all that takes a
great<00:03:29.370> deal<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.730> mechanical<00:03:30.390> skill<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.190> like

great deal of mechanical skill and like
I<00:03:32.310> said<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> take<00:03:33.209> anything<00:03:33.480> away<00:03:33.660> from

I said not to take anything away from

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
I said not to take anything away from
the<00:03:34.080> mechanic<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.739> talking<00:03:35.340> about<00:03:35.430> their

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
terms as far as the people who would be

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.140 
terms as far as the people who would be
considered<00:03:40.500> technicians<00:03:41.430> over<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.880> people

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
considered technicians over the people

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.750 
considered technicians over the people
who<00:03:42.180> be<00:03:42.420> considered<00:03:42.930> mechanics<00:03:43.410> these<00:03:44.190> days<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
who be considered mechanics these days I

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.009 
who be considered mechanics these days I
would<00:03:44.970> argue<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.510> I'm<00:03:45.600> going<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:45.780> put<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.959> to

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
would argue and I'm going to put it to

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.560 
would argue and I'm going to put it to
the<00:03:46.049> group<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.519> all<00:03:47.850> people<00:03:48.420> working

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
the group here that all people working

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.090 
the group here that all people working
in<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> mechanical<00:03:49.320> fields<00:03:49.650> should<00:03:49.980> be

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
in the mechanical fields should be

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.340 
in the mechanical fields should be
referred<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.580> as<00:03:50.850> technicians<00:03:51.720> and<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> say

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
referred to as technicians and I say

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.380 
referred to as technicians and I say
that's<00:03:52.530> because<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.280> those<00:03:53.430> electronics<00:03:54.269> that

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
that's because of those electronics that

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.660 
that's because of those electronics that
I<00:03:54.510> spoke<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.900> earlier<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:56.370> proliferation

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
I spoke of earlier and the proliferation

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.820 
I spoke of earlier and the proliferation
of<00:03:57.180> those<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.630> just<00:03:57.660> about<00:03:57.959> everything<00:03:58.260> and

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
of those and just about everything and

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.699 
of those and just about everything and
it<00:03:59.430> seems<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.239> even<00:04:00.480> even<00:04:00.989> using<00:04:01.230> your<00:04:01.350> radio

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
it seems like even even using your radio

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.440 
it seems like even even using your radio
your<00:04:01.980> instrument<00:04:02.459> cluster<00:04:02.519> all<00:04:03.060> seems<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
your instrument cluster all seems to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.850 
your instrument cluster all seems to
have<00:04:03.600> some<00:04:03.840> kind<00:04:04.019> of<00:04:04.049> control<00:04:04.230> unit<00:04:04.680> that's

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
have some kind of control unit that's

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.620 
have some kind of control unit that's
tied<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.580> even<00:04:06.120> doing<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.390> brake<00:04:06.600> job

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
tied in to even doing a brake job

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.960 
tied in to even doing a brake job
sometimes<00:04:07.320> these<00:04:07.560> days<00:04:07.730> bleeding<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.790> brake

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
sometimes these days bleeding a brake

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.060 
sometimes these days bleeding a brake
system<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.780> need<00:04:09.959> one<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.140> these<00:04:10.320> on<00:04:10.560> some

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
system you need one of these on some

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.949 
system you need one of these on some
vehicles<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.790> order<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.180> bleed<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.750> brakes

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
vehicles in order to bleed the brakes

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.569 
vehicles in order to bleed the brakes
out<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.320> that's<00:04:13.769> something<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.430> would

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
out of that's something that you would

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.729 
out of that's something that you would
normally<00:04:14.760> consider<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.600> mechanical<00:04:16.410> repair

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
normally consider a mechanical repair

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.370 
normally consider a mechanical repair
well<00:04:17.070> guess<00:04:17.250> what<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.940> becomes<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.479> technical

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
well guess what it becomes a technical

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.680 
well guess what it becomes a technical
repair<00:04:19.859> if<00:04:20.070> you're<00:04:20.789> adding<00:04:21.239> things<00:04:21.570> like

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
repair if you're adding things like

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.570 
repair if you're adding things like
high-end<00:04:22.109> scan<00:04:22.530> tools<00:04:22.740> into<00:04:23.039> them<00:04:23.160> it's<00:04:23.340> not

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
high-end scan tools into them it's not

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.980 
high-end scan tools into them it's not
necessarily<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.060> highest<00:04:24.330> end<00:04:24.510> scan<00:04:24.780> tool

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
necessarily the highest end scan tool

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.460 
necessarily the highest end scan tool
but

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
but

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.140 
but
it<00:04:25.680> illustrates<00:04:25.830> my<00:04:26.310> point<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.820> it's<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it illustrates my point and it's the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.060 
it illustrates my point and it's the
scam<00:04:27.390> tool<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:27.900> have<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:28.410> stop<00:04:28.650> being<00:04:28.860> all

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
scam tool that I have so stop being all

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.920 
scam tool that I have so stop being all
picky<00:04:29.580> about<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.910> kind<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.270> thing<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.750> point

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
picky about that kind of thing the point

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.410 
picky about that kind of thing the point
I'm<00:04:31.080> trying<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.380> make<00:04:31.500> here<00:04:31.770> is<00:04:31.830> that<00:04:32.490> modern

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
I'm trying to make here is that modern

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.080 
I'm trying to make here is that modern
vehicles<00:04:33.990> require<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.860> technicians<00:04:35.760> point<00:04:36.030> of

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
vehicles require a technicians point of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.030 
vehicles require a technicians point of
view<00:04:36.210> or<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.390> technicians<00:04:37.050> touch<00:04:37.350> even<00:04:37.860> though

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
view or a technicians touch even though

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.430 
view or a technicians touch even though
it's<00:04:38.280> mechanical<00:04:38.790> work<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.570> said<00:04:39.840> just<00:04:40.170> in

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
it's mechanical work as I said just in

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.950 
it's mechanical work as I said just in
the<00:04:40.980> case<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.520> many<00:04:41.820> brake<00:04:42.060> systems<00:04:42.510> bleeding

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
the case of many brake systems bleeding

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.630 
the case of many brake systems bleeding
the<00:04:43.050> brakes<00:04:43.170> that<00:04:43.530> type<00:04:43.710> of<00:04:43.740> thing<00:04:44.040> you<00:04:44.460> may

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
the brakes that type of thing you may

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.250 
the brakes that type of thing you may
run<00:04:44.820> into<00:04:44.880> situations<00:04:45.270> where<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.990> need<00:04:46.140> to

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
run into situations where you need to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.960 
run into situations where you need to
break<00:04:46.440> out<00:04:46.590> scan<00:04:46.890> tools<00:04:47.130> or<00:04:47.310> other<00:04:47.340> technical

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
break out scan tools or other technical

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.020 
break out scan tools or other technical
equipment<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.720> do<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.900> mechanical<00:04:49.730> repair<00:04:50.730> or<00:04:50.970> a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
equipment to do a mechanical repair or a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.590 
equipment to do a mechanical repair or a
mechanical<00:04:51.630> service<00:04:52.050> so<00:04:52.830> yeah<00:04:53.850> it's<00:04:54.300> hard<00:04:54.540> to

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
mechanical service so yeah it's hard to

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.850 
mechanical service so yeah it's hard to
say<00:04:54.810> who's<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.050> mechanic<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.680> who's<00:04:55.830> a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
say who's a mechanic and who's a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.530 
say who's a mechanic and who's a
technician<00:04:56.340> these<00:04:56.610> days<00:04:56.880> but<00:04:57.420> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
technician these days but the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.090 
technician these days but the
distinction<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.050> I'm<00:04:58.290> making<00:04:58.620> is<00:04:58.800> there

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
distinction that I'm making is there

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.590 
distinction that I'm making is there
there<00:04:59.460> are<00:04:59.580> still<00:04:59.790> people<00:04:59.940> even<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.480> that

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
there are still people even in that

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.210 
there are still people even in that
electronic<00:05:01.230> universe<00:05:01.590> there<00:05:01.800> are<00:05:01.830> still

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
electronic universe there are still

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.680 
electronic universe there are still
people<00:05:02.430> out<00:05:02.640> there<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:03.060> specialize<00:05:03.660> in

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
people out there that specialize in

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.870 
people out there that specialize in
certain<00:05:04.590> things<00:05:04.770> specialize<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.460> perhaps<00:05:05.730> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
certain things specialize in perhaps the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.360 
certain things specialize in perhaps the
mechanical<00:05:06.390> or<00:05:06.480> repair<00:05:06.780> over<00:05:07.410> say<00:05:07.800> the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
mechanical or repair over say the

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.490 
mechanical or repair over say the
electronics<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.510> computer<00:05:09.900> controls<00:05:10.230> that

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
electronics the computer controls that

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.830 
electronics the computer controls that
type<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.740> thing<00:05:11.010> so<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:12.240> make<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:12.420> long<00:05:12.510> story

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
type of thing so to make a long story

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.690 
type of thing so to make a long story
long<00:05:13.110> that's<00:05:13.500> my<00:05:13.740> point<00:05:13.920> that's<00:05:14.190> that's<00:05:14.520> what

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
long that's my point that's that's what

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.490 
long that's my point that's that's what

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
I'm putting out to you the group as the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.920 
I'm putting out to you the group as the

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.300 
discussion here that's that's my take on
the<00:05:19.140> difference<00:05:19.440> between<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.740> mechanic<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.280> a

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
the difference between a mechanic and a

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.100 
the difference between a mechanic and a
technician<00:05:20.640> and<00:05:20.910> once<00:05:21.090> again<00:05:21.210> I'd<00:05:21.810> like<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
technician and once again I'd like to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.860 
technician and once again I'd like to
say<00:05:22.410> I<00:05:22.650> vote<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.460> all<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.300> us<00:05:24.390> working<00:05:24.660> in<00:05:24.810> the

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
say I vote that all of us working in the

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.870 
say I vote that all of us working in the
mechanical<00:05:25.380> field<00:05:25.590> these<00:05:25.770> days

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
mechanical field these days

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.490 
mechanical field these days
professionally<00:05:26.960> should<00:05:27.960> be<00:05:28.050> considered

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
professionally should be considered

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.530 
professionally should be considered
technicians<00:05:29.160> because<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.270> kind<00:05:30.480> of

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
technicians because of the kind of

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.670 
technicians because of the kind of
things<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.870> we<00:05:30.960> deal<00:05:31.110> with<00:05:31.140> even<00:05:31.500> oil

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680

different<00:05:45.510> and<00:05:45.990> we're<00:05:46.620> having<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.980> adapt<00:05:47.280> to

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
different and we're having to adapt to

different and we're having to adapt to
these<00:05:47.910> things<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.680> because<00:05:49.680> I'm<00:05:50.160> throwing
