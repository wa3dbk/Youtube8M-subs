00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
line at the roots on feel like going

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.630 
line at the roots on feel like going
through<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.520> um<00:00:21.140> it's<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.560> orange<00:00:23.160> red

I'm gonna take these things out and I

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.920 
I'm gonna take these things out and I
took<00:03:06.480> them<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.049> still<00:03:07.260> had<00:03:07.440> dimples<00:03:07.650> so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
guess that's a good sign but who knows

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.240 
guess that's a good sign but who knows
how<00:03:12.569> long<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:13.079> will<00:03:13.230> stay<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.950> if<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.190> took

how long they will stay like if I took

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.090 
how long they will stay like if I took
them<00:03:14.519> out<00:03:14.670> today<00:03:15.410> who<00:03:16.410> knows<00:03:16.590> how<00:03:16.769> I'm<00:03:16.950> them

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100

stay<00:03:18.590> what<00:03:19.590> I've<00:03:19.829> been<00:03:20.069> using<00:03:20.720> is<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.109> pen

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
stay what I've been using is this pen

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.140 
stay what I've been using is this pen
they<00:03:22.709> intercept<00:03:23.250> equation<00:03:23.489> that's<00:03:23.940> what<00:03:24.060> I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

use on my Moreau so I figured it would
