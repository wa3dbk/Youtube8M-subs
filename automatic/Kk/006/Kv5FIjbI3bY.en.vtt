00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
in they effectively bought Silicon

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.310 
in they effectively bought Silicon
Knights<00:00:45.519> so<00:00:46.000> they're<00:00:46.180> taking<00:00:46.360> them<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:46.839> and

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
people and some people are saying that's

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.700 
people and some people are saying that's
a<00:00:52.330> little<00:00:52.629> weird<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.080> you're<00:00:53.379> making<00:00:53.500> a

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
a little weird that you're making a

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.289 
a little weird that you're making a
spiritual<00:00:54.070> successor<00:00:54.129> their<00:00:54.699> game<00:00:54.909> and<00:00:55.180> then

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
spiritual successor their game and then

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.030 
spiritual successor their game and then
you<00:00:55.330> buy<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.750> original<00:00:56.049> company<00:00:56.559> now<00:00:56.979> the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
you buy the original company now the

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.500 
you buy the original company now the
reason<00:00:57.250> that<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.519> don't<00:00:57.850> think<00:00:58.059> this<00:00:58.150> is<00:00:58.210> weird

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
reason that I don't think this is weird

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.170 
reason that I don't think this is weird
is<00:00:58.930> because<00:00:59.320> apparently<00:01:00.150> Silicon<00:01:01.150> Knights

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
is because apparently Silicon Knights

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.850 
is because apparently Silicon Knights
was<00:01:01.420> having<00:01:01.600> a<00:01:01.659> lot<00:01:01.720> of<00:01:01.780> problems<00:01:02.199> anyway<00:01:02.650> they

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
was having a lot of problems anyway they

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.410 
was having a lot of problems anyway they
were<00:01:02.920> starting<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.309> sell<00:01:03.610> off<00:01:03.850> as<00:01:04.059> many<00:01:04.239> things

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
were starting to sell off as many things

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.820 
were starting to sell off as many things
as<00:01:04.600> they<00:01:04.750> could<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:05.080> that<00:01:05.470> they<00:01:05.530> could<00:01:05.680> keep

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
as they could so that they could keep

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.070 
as they could so that they could keep
more<00:01:06.040> people<00:01:06.490> and<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:07.210> think<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.600> precursor

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
more people and I think that precursor

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.690 
more people and I think that precursor
games<00:01:08.200> saw<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.010> decided<00:01:09.310> to<00:01:09.430> try<00:01:09.640> to

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
games saw that and decided to try to

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.450 
games saw that and decided to try to
make<00:01:10.090> a<00:01:10.330> good<00:01:10.840> situation<00:01:11.079> out<00:01:11.649> of<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.859> and<00:01:12.039> say

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
make a good situation out of it and say

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.880 
make a good situation out of it and say
look<00:01:12.700> we're<00:01:12.909> making<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.770> spiritual<00:01:14.770> successor

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
look we're making a spiritual successor

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.859 
look we're making a spiritual successor
to<00:01:15.250> your<00:01:15.549> game<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.210> we<00:01:16.570> see<00:01:16.689> that<00:01:16.719> you're

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
to your game and we see that you're

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.810 
to your game and we see that you're
having<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.289> tough<00:01:17.500> time<00:01:17.560> why<00:01:18.369> don't<00:01:18.549> we<00:01:18.640> just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
having a tough time why don't we just

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.599 
having a tough time why don't we just
fuse<00:01:19.590> ourselves<00:01:20.590> sidenote<00:01:21.009> wouldn't<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.520> be

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
fuse ourselves sidenote wouldn't it be

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:24.599 
fuse ourselves sidenote wouldn't it be
fantastic<00:01:22.329> if<00:01:22.479> when<00:01:23.320> two<00:01:23.560> companies<00:01:24.009> came

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
fantastic if when two companies came

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.270 
fantastic if when two companies came
together<00:01:24.909> they<00:01:25.869> had<00:01:26.079> to<00:01:26.229> do<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.740> fusion<00:01:27.100> dance

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
together they had to do the fusion dance

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.069 
together they had to do the fusion dance
from<00:01:27.549> dragon<00:01:27.820> ball<00:01:27.850> z<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.450> wouldn't<00:01:28.810> amount<00:01:28.960> to

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
from dragon ball z it wouldn't amount to

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.599 
from dragon ball z it wouldn't amount to
anything<00:01:29.200> because<00:01:30.070> they<00:01:30.219> couldn't<00:01:30.399> actually

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
anything because they couldn't actually

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.490 
anything because they couldn't actually
fuse<00:01:31.090> their<00:01:31.240> bodies<00:01:31.539> oh<00:01:31.780> my<00:01:31.990> gosh<00:01:32.170> which<00:01:32.380> they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500
