00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
depending on what size the brushes you

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.400 
depending on what size the brushes you
can<00:00:17.880> get<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.180> completely<00:00:18.600> different<00:00:19.020> feel<00:00:19.199> and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
can get a completely different feel and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.620 
can get a completely different feel and
depending<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.520> like<00:00:20.789> how<00:00:21.029> much<00:00:21.180> pressure<00:00:21.359> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
put on you can get a different feel so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.070 
put on you can get a different feel so
it's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.699> versatile<00:00:24.210> brush<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:25.050> can

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
it's a really versatile brush you can

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's a really versatile brush you can
lay<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.410> big<00:00:25.710> areas<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> doesn't

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
lay in big areas with it and it doesn't

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.330 
lay in big areas with it and it doesn't
slow<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.240> your<00:00:27.510> computer<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:29.099> can<00:00:29.130> get

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
slow down your computer and you can get

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
slow down your computer and you can get
really<00:00:29.519> fine<00:00:29.929> hardlines<00:00:30.929> hard<00:00:31.380> edges<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
really fine hardlines hard edges if you

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.250 
really fine hardlines hard edges if you
need<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> you'll<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.840> really

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
need to you'll see I just a bit really

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
need to you'll see I just a bit really
make<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> size<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.579> small<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.239> really

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
make the size really small then really

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.920 
make the size really small then really
big<00:00:36.920> that's<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:38.010> handy<00:00:38.309> little<00:00:38.340> trick<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.120> like

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
big that's a handy little trick I like

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770 
big that's a handy little trick I like
to<00:00:40.050> put<00:00:40.260> ground<00:00:40.680> reflections<00:00:41.480> like<00:00:42.480> little

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
to put ground reflections like little

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.580 
to put ground reflections like little
pools<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.230> water<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> good<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> faking

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
pools of water it's a good way of faking

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.029 
pools of water it's a good way of faking
ground<00:00:46.910> use<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> lasso<00:00:48.450> tool<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.800> some

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
ground use the lasso tool and make some

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.209 
ground use the lasso tool and make some
random<00:00:50.340> shapes<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.570> then<00:00:51.980> paint<00:00:52.980> whatever

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
random shapes and then paint whatever

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
random shapes and then paint whatever
the<00:00:53.550> sky<00:00:53.850> color<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.530> mess<00:00:55.829> with

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the sky color is and then just mess with

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.270 
the sky color is and then just mess with
it<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> doesn't<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:59.010> like

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
it a little bit so it doesn't look like

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.520 
it a little bit so it doesn't look like
the<00:00:59.430> lasso<00:00:59.850> tool

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.160 

I've<00:01:03.399> made<00:01:03.579> a<00:01:03.640> basic<00:01:04.150> block<00:01:04.449> model<00:01:04.930> and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
I've made a basic block model and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.190 
I've made a basic block model and
sketchup<00:01:05.950> a<00:01:06.220> really<00:01:06.729> cool<00:01:06.940> program<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:08.020> get

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
sketchup a really cool program you get

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.170 
sketchup a really cool program you get
really<00:01:08.440> simple<00:01:09.010> really<00:01:09.280> crappy<00:01:09.640> models

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
really simple really crappy models

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.340 
really simple really crappy models
really<00:01:10.479> fast<00:01:10.810> and<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:12.310> model<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.850> very<00:01:13.350> very

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
really fast and this model is very very

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.249 
really fast and this model is very very
simple<00:01:14.670> basically<00:01:15.670> all<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.850> does<00:01:16.119> is<00:01:16.390> works

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
simple basically all it does is works

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.020 
simple basically all it does is works
out<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> lot<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.710> the<00:01:17.799> prospective<00:01:18.340> issues<00:01:18.640> for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
out a lot of the prospective issues for

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.280 
out a lot of the prospective issues for
me<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.750> gives<00:01:20.619> me<00:01:20.680> like<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.580> half<00:01:22.180> decent<00:01:22.509> start

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
me and gives me like a half decent start

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:38.720 
me and gives me like a half decent start
up<00:01:23.440> on<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.490> value

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.790
