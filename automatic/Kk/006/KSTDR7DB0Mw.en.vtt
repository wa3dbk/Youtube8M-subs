00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and a free titanfall game now I've been

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.959 
and a free titanfall game now I've been
pretty<00:00:42.329> critical<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.829> xbox<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.610> since

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
pretty critical of the xbox one since

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.670 
pretty critical of the xbox one since
its<00:00:45.180> release<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.829> understandably<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
its release I think understandably so it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
its release I think understandably so it
seems<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.129> losing<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.940> war<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
seems that it is losing the war of the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.760 
seems that it is losing the war of the
p's<00:00:52.260> since<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.660> 720<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.770> 900p

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
p's since it is always 720 or 900p

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.060 
p's since it is always 720 or 900p
whatever<00:00:56.340> vs<00:00:56.969> ps4<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> major

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
whatever vs ps4 but this is a major

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.790 
whatever vs ps4 but this is a major
