 Now the fender is out of the eiga mode and the putter is cute. 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.550
 The ability to be engraved as a very tremendous fear to the players

 4 It is a character that supplements the typical stamina of healing now 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.030
 Looking at the absolute Now English skills are those computers because doing so is very little 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.360
 I have to be right. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.199
 Pressing the q Skills 4 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 Not only this , but also ours

 So I'm such a technique that when the hill right now 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 Well, we have a lot of fun with this technology. 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.730
 I could do it myself. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:10.070
 One of the requirements is that a child will be attacked at a distance. 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:13.010
 You can see it. 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 This can be done to our fans . 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.870
 If you give the name to the near-by things, there's a street standing at Lime 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.370
 I think it's okay. 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.920

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.310
 So this is the baby thing. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:34.310
 Yes, this is four characters. 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:37.520
 It is a technique that directly attacks an opponent . 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.329
 For example, five different causes ridden 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.329
 He's attacking me. 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.990
 In fact, I do not feel so powerful until I have a very strong opponent 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.399
 overflow 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.479
 It's not like this, but it 's a technology that can be used anyway. 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.270
 The same 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.729

 Men only get to see you 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:47.439
 It's awesome. I can not do anything with this wheel infinity, but whatever. 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.510
 I need to know that it makes it so fast It's faster than my strength 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:54.700
 Stamina is faster then the speed to fill 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.420
 I can see it is similar now, but different. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:03.569
 Every schedule character. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.569
 One more thing. It's offensive to the left. 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.660

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:20.310
 1 Take, shoot, take one. 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.250
 Water dragon 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.250
 It's literally a water dragon. 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:35.610
 Writing, where the axle is yireongeo yisukhui containment haejugo yaw floating spread something 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:41.850
 Give it to our side and give it some sort of buff. 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:45.080
 And if you want to get away from your physical strength now, 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.790
 One, two, three. 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.790
 Fly to one, water dragon. 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.120

 Give me other people . 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:08.700
 Now no one went up around this Water Dragon 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:15.950
 Without a hero, we can not fire. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.950
 If you see a hero of your opponent, this is the technique that attacks the opponent. 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:25.889
 4 will be like this 4 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:29.789
 Usually I know yisuryong negative than that yisuryong 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:35.279
 The technique that fills up the physical is preferred to North Korea , 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:39.620
 I can do aggressive Lee Lee's work in front of a fantastic fantasy
