00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.450> there's<00:00:00.599> no<00:00:00.780> doubt<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.170> way<00:00:01.290> things

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
I think there's no doubt the way things

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.670 
I think there's no doubt the way things
are<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.709> that<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.250> will<00:00:03.080> come<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.259> time<00:00:04.500> we

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
are going that we will come to a time we

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.900 
are going that we will come to a time we
have<00:00:04.799> computers<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.370> are<00:00:05.430> equally

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
have computers that are equally

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.400 
have computers that are equally
intelligent<00:00:06.120> human<00:00:06.569> beings<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.049> then<00:00:07.140> even

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
intelligent human beings and then even

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.400 
intelligent human beings and then even
more<00:00:07.440> intelligent<00:00:08.309> by<00:00:08.760> which<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> mean<00:00:09.410> being

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
more intelligent by which I mean being

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.640 
more intelligent by which I mean being
able<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> do<00:00:11.519> all<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.990> functions<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.440> do

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
able to do all the functions that we do

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.880 
able to do all the functions that we do
in<00:00:13.889> terms<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.599> reasoning<00:00:15.890> understanding

those<00:00:17.070> sorts<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.430> things<00:00:17.510> which<00:00:18.510> are<00:00:18.630> moment

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
those sorts of things which are moment

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.480 
those sorts of things which are moment
very<00:00:19.140> hard<00:00:19.410> for<00:00:19.619> computer<00:00:20.010> there's<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.340> very

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
very hard for computer there's a very

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.640 
very hard for computer there's a very
good<00:00:20.550> number<00:00:20.820> crunchers<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.630> awful<00:00:22.260> pattern

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
good number crunchers but awful pattern

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.920 
good number crunchers but awful pattern
recognition<00:00:23.390> things<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> reasoning

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930

recognition things and reasoning
machines<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.920> we<00:00:25.980> will<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.130> good

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
machines I think we will have good

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.160 
machines I think we will have good
reasoning<00:00:27.180> machines<00:00:27.510> good<00:00:27.779> pattern

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
reasoning machines good pattern

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.740 
reasoning machines good pattern
recognition<00:00:28.500> machines<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:29.539> don't<00:00:30.539> think<00:00:30.720> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
recognition machines I don't think that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.799 
recognition machines I don't think that
implies<00:00:31.140> consciousness<00:00:31.800> though<00:00:32.630> that<00:00:33.630> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
implies consciousness though that this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
implies consciousness though that this
is<00:00:33.989> my<00:00:34.140> own<00:00:34.260> personal<00:00:34.469> belief<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is my own personal belief because I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.080 
is my own personal belief because I
think<00:00:36.260> well<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.440> will<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.649> conscious<00:00:38.219> I

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
think well they will be conscious I

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.389 
think well they will be conscious I
believe<00:00:39.360> everything<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> conscious<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.530> I

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
believe everything is conscious and I

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
believe everything is conscious and I
believe<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.329> human<00:00:42.570> beings<00:00:42.600> i

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
believe it's not just human beings i

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
believe it's not just human beings i
think<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.379> animals<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.160> conscious<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
think all animals are conscious and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
think all animals are conscious and
there's<00:00:45.090> no<00:00:45.210> way<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.420> draw<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> line<00:00:45.870> it's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
there's no way you draw the line it's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.950 
there's no way you draw the line it's
just<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.710> level<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.579> light<00:00:47.850> gets<00:00:48.450> dimmer<00:00:48.719> as

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
just the level of light gets dimmer as

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
just the level of light gets dimmer as
you<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.260> down<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.219> consciousness<00:00:50.700> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you go down so that the consciousness in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
you go down so that the consciousness in
a<00:00:50.910> bacterium<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.949> not

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a bacterium is there but it's a lot not

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.740 
a bacterium is there but it's a lot not
dimmer<00:00:53.460> than<00:00:53.550> human<00:00:53.969> consciousness<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
dimmer than human consciousness then it

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
dimmer than human consciousness then it
goes<00:00:54.870> down<00:00:55.110> right<00:00:56.010> down<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> subatomic

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
goes down right down to the subatomic

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.049 
goes down right down to the subatomic
level<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.140> computers<00:00:59.059> silicon

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
level and I think computers silicon

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.560 
level and I think computers silicon
based<00:01:00.840> systems<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.920> level<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> organization

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
based systems the level of organization

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.980 
based systems the level of organization
is<00:01:03.769> basically<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.400> crystalline<00:01:05.909> level<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
is basically at the crystalline level so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.899 
is basically at the crystalline level so
i<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.560> consciousness<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> computer<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
i think the consciousness of computer is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.760 
i think the consciousness of computer is
there<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:10.020> below<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> an

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there but it's way below that of an

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880 
there but it's way below that of an
amoeba<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:12.180> think<00:01:12.450> my<00:01:12.960> feeling<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> always

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
amoeba and I think my feeling is always

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.730 
amoeba and I think my feeling is always
stay<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:15.330> won't<00:01:15.450> actually<00:01:15.780> wake

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stay there that they won't actually wake

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.730 
stay there that they won't actually wake
up<00:01:16.979> internally<00:01:17.810> because<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.229> have<00:01:19.439> they're

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
up internally because they have they're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.590 
up internally because they have they're
not<00:01:19.860> evolving<00:01:20.340> beyond<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.820> basic<00:01:21.210> structure

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
not evolving beyond that basic structure

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.270 
not evolving beyond that basic structure
which<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> putting<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> those

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
which is putting a lot of those

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.160 
which is putting a lot of those
crystalline<00:01:23.790> structures<00:01:24.240> together<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
crystalline structures together so I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.719 
crystalline structures together so I
think<00:01:25.409> they're<00:01:25.500> actually<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
think they're actually going to have the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.760 
think they're actually going to have the
inner<00:01:27.060> awakening<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.530> they<00:01:28.619> may

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
inner awakening that we do so they may

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149 
inner awakening that we do so they may
better<00:01:28.979> simulate<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.930> responses<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.890> human

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
better simulate the responses of a human

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.429 
better simulate the responses of a human
being<00:01:32.450> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.540> don't<00:01:33.960> believe<00:01:34.229> they'll

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
being but I don't believe they'll

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.830 
being but I don't believe they'll
actually<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.310> inner<00:01:35.490> experience<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.659> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
actually have the inner experience as we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.120 
actually have the inner experience as we
do<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.200> there's<00:01:37.500> no<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
do and there's no need for them to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.819 
do and there's no need for them to
happen<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.990> factors<00:01:39.990> vary<00:01:40.020> only<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.590> human

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
happen and factors vary only for human

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
happen and factors vary only for human
beings<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.340> means<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> great<00:01:41.990> question<00:01:42.990> about

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
beings have means a great question about

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.679 
beings have means a great question about
human<00:01:43.619> beings<00:01:43.770> or<00:01:44.040> any<00:01:44.310> living<00:01:44.970> systems<00:01:45.390> why

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
human beings or any living systems why

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.499 
human beings or any living systems why
are<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.200> conscious<00:01:46.729> because<00:01:47.729> there's<00:01:48.090> nothing

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
are we conscious because there's nothing

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.270 
are we conscious because there's nothing
in<00:01:48.659> science<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.170> predicts<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:50.009> living
