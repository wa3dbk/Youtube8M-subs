 hello everyone today I bring you a news 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 something sad for megaman fans the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.030
 online megaman games could have been 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 canceled well this info I took it from 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.590
 some good pages are now the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.600
 I show 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.910
 Megaman bypasses its best 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.190
 precisely in the year that its 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.880
 twenty-fifth anniversary after 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.400
 cancel megaman universe playstation 3 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.630
 xbox360 and mega man legends 3 for 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.820
 Nintendo 3DS 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.490
 now it is believed that the future of half man 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.290
 online is uncertain announced two years ago 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.840
 years for pf as part of a 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.970
 collaboration between capcom and lewis from 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.000
 then few or no news of their 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.620
 advances have been made public neowin that 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.930
 was the developer in this way 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.430
 starring the old mascot of 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.649
 capcom faced a 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.170
 restructuring at the beginning of the year that 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.390
 would have affected the project when wow 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.790
 the main artist of rock man on line 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.469
 as it is known in japan has published in 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.420
 your personal blog a series of 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.550
 illustrations of a game canceled 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 It would be illegal to show this material with 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.990
 the game in progress although it is not 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.760
 mention the name everything indicates that it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.590
 try half-hand 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.870
 but has not yet confirmed or denied 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.460
 these rumors 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.310
 capcom through what was being 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.840
 preparing a mega hand was because 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.940
 apparently the project has not 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.670
 survived the restructuring of the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.350
 company who has given the news although 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.390
 without mentioning anything specifically 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.220
 megaman online has been one of the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.290
 designers who cross themselves that has 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.900
 announced on his blog that the game in the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.580
 who worked has been canceled then has 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.350
 uploaded a few images of 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.240
 project what reconfirms its 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.850
 cancellation since it would have been illegal 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.680
 show them to continue be in progress 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.750
 megaman online took a year without giving 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.790
 news of life and barely knew anything 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.650
 of him as platforms for which 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.640
 was being developed or kind of 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.640
 game that I was going to do 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.210
 but there it is 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 well this would be all until the next
