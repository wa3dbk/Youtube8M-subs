was 1,000,000,000 HP in 33 seconds I
missed<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.750> molten<00:02:39.530> impact<00:02:39.859> meter<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:42.519> that's

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
missed a molten impact meter so that's

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.940 
missed a molten impact meter so that's
over<00:02:43.820> 1<00:02:44.030> million<00:02:44.329> deepest<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:45.140> missed<00:02:45.410> uh

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.380 

that's<00:02:48.950> pretty<00:02:49.250> good<00:02:49.459> I'm<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.299> gonna

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
that's pretty good I'm just gonna

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.540 
that's pretty good I'm just gonna
calculate<00:02:50.720> that<00:02:51.200> asked

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:03.170 

what<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:56.880> exactly<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.680> take<00:02:59.690> one

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.640 

million

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.630 

three

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.790 

so<00:03:10.640> that's

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.170 

what<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.430> hell<00:03:16.640> did<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.940> just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290 

okay<00:03:23.180> crawl<00:03:23.450> well<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.500> more<00:03:24.710> than<00:03:25.300> it's

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
okay crawl well it's more than it's

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:42.820 
okay crawl well it's more than it's
about<00:03:26.600> oh<00:03:31.390> uh<00:03:37.720> isn't<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.780> like<00:03:39.430> 30<00:03:41.830> 30

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
about oh uh isn't that like 30 30

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
about oh uh isn't that like 30 30
something<00:03:43.400> at<00:03:43.520> least<00:03:44.770> that's<00:03:45.770> not<00:03:46.010> as<00:03:46.130> good<00:03:46.370> as

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.640 

that's<00:03:49.850> not<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:50.180> good<00:03:50.360> as<00:03:50.510> I<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:51.110> did<00:03:51.320> on<00:03:51.470> my

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
that's not as good as I just did on my

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:00.520 
that's not as good as I just did on my
own<00:03:52.240> on<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.840> boss<00:03:53.990> before<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:59.290> I'm<00:04:00.290> just

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
own on the boss before this I'm just

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.990 
own on the boss before this I'm just
gonna<00:04:00.680> cut<00:04:00.950> it<00:04:01.100> straight<00:04:01.280> at<00:04:01.459> 30<00:04:01.700> million

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
gonna cut it straight at 30 million

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.949 
gonna cut it straight at 30 million
that's<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.750> nice<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.170> eat<00:04:03.290> number<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:08.840> not

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
that's a nice and eat number it's not

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:17.680 
that's a nice and eat number it's not
about<00:04:09.380> 30<00:04:09.709> million<00:04:09.950> I<00:04:10.280> guess<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:16.299> if<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.480> hit

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
about 30 million I guess and if I hit

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.880 
about 30 million I guess and if I hit
that<00:04:17.720> molten<00:04:18.290> impact<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.950> would<00:04:19.100> have<00:04:19.160> been

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
that molten impact it would have been

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.500 
that molten impact it would have been
like<00:04:21.890> 30<00:04:22.130> one<00:04:22.400> minute<00:04:22.700> I<00:04:22.730> guess<00:04:22.910> just<00:04:23.060> add<00:04:23.270> 1

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
like 30 one minute I guess just add 1

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.040 
like 30 one minute I guess just add 1
million<00:04:23.840> deepest<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:25.690> because<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.900> took

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
million deepest to that because it took

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.440 
million deepest to that because it took
less<00:04:27.320> than<00:04:27.380> 35<00:04:28.040> seconds<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.000> usually

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
less than 35 seconds and I usually

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
less than 35 seconds and I usually
creates<00:04:29.720> for<00:04:30.020> more<00:04:30.230> than<00:04:30.440> 35<00:04:30.950> million<00:04:35.590> and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
creates for more than 35 million and

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.930 
creates for more than 35 million and
that's<00:04:37.970> single<00:04:38.600> target<00:04:38.930> dps<00:04:39.110> as<00:04:39.500> well<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:39.940> guess

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
that's single target dps as well I guess

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.230 
that's single target dps as well I guess
that's<00:04:41.150> pretty<00:04:41.300> good<00:04:41.510> well<00:04:42.470> um<00:04:42.910> my<00:04:43.910> gear<00:04:44.120> is

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
that's pretty good well um my gear is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240 
that's pretty good well um my gear is
really<00:04:44.690> not<00:04:44.810> optimized<00:04:45.290> for<00:04:45.410> this<00:04:45.680> spec<00:04:45.980> yet

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
really not optimized for this spec yet

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.680 
really not optimized for this spec yet
bike<00:04:47.150> I<00:04:48.100> don't<00:04:49.100> have<00:04:49.430> extra<00:04:49.880> magic<00:04:50.150> missile

extra<00:05:04.580> fire<00:05:04.970> damage<00:05:05.390> except<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.080> my<00:05:06.290> amulet

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.610 

and<00:05:18.060> i'm<00:05:18.150> not<00:05:18.450> sure<00:05:18.510> if<00:05:18.840> thunderfury<00:05:19.290> is<00:05:19.440> the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
and i'm not sure if thunderfury is the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.700 
and i'm not sure if thunderfury is the
best<00:05:19.860> item<00:05:20.490> for<00:05:20.700> this<00:05:20.820> Bank<00:05:21.120> it's<00:05:21.450> like<00:05:22.140> insane

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
best item for this Bank it's like insane

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.390 
best item for this Bank it's like insane
but<00:05:23.750> might<00:05:24.750> be<00:05:24.930> better<00:05:25.110> with<00:05:25.380> fire<00:05:25.860> damage

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
but might be better with fire damage

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.780 
but might be better with fire damage
that<00:05:26.670> the<00:05:26.970> axe<00:05:27.240> or<00:05:27.600> something<00:05:27.900> oh<00:05:28.490> I'll<00:05:29.490> try<00:05:29.700> to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
that the axe or something oh I'll try to

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.960 
that the axe or something oh I'll try to
improve<00:05:30.210> as<00:05:30.840> possible<00:05:31.290> but<00:05:32.250> this<00:05:32.490> back<00:05:32.700> should

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
improve as possible but this back should

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.530 
improve as possible but this back should
be<00:05:33.000> like<00:05:34.400> the<00:05:35.400> best<00:05:35.610> endgame<00:05:35.970> spec<00:05:36.360> for

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
be like the best endgame spec for

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.410 
be like the best endgame spec for
wizards<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.080> dps<00:05:37.440> is<00:05:37.650> just<00:05:37.950> it's<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:39.000> insane

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
wizards the dps is just it's just insane

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.540 
wizards the dps is just it's just insane
it's<00:05:40.320> a<00:05:40.350> lot<00:05:40.500> better<00:05:40.650> than<00:05:40.890> the<00:05:41.010> glacial<00:05:41.310> spike

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
it's a lot better than the glacial spike

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.390 
it's a lot better than the glacial spike
ones<00:05:41.790> yeah<00:05:42.590> there<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.650> have<00:05:43.770> it<00:05:43.800> I'll<00:05:44.100> try<00:05:44.310> to
