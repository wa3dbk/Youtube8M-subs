actual<00:02:28.249> process<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.060> they<00:02:29.510> are<00:02:29.540> very<00:02:30.099> very

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
actual process and they are very very

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.069 
actual process and they are very very
meticulous<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.969> can<00:02:32.269> see<00:02:32.420> we've<00:02:32.599> got<00:02:32.629> people

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
meticulous you can see we've got people

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.039 
meticulous you can see we've got people
that<00:02:33.499> are<00:02:33.950> inspecting<00:02:34.719> making<00:02:35.719> sure<00:02:35.870> that

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
that are inspecting making sure that

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.179 
that are inspecting making sure that
there's<00:02:36.200> nothing<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:36.650> came<00:02:36.829> through<00:02:37.069> the

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:37.189 
there's nothing that came through the

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.309 
there's nothing that came through the
processing<00:02:37.849> plant<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.749> we<00:02:38.900> don't<00:02:39.079> want<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
processing plant that we don't want to

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.170 
processing plant that we don't want to
put<00:02:39.469> in<00:02:39.590> our<00:02:39.680> hamburgers<00:02:40.159> we<00:02:40.700> have<00:02:40.790> our<00:02:40.969> metal

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
put in our hamburgers we have our metal

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.030 
put in our hamburgers we have our metal
detection<00:02:41.599> that's<00:02:41.959> documented<00:02:42.500> recorded

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
detection that's documented recorded

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.660 
detection that's documented recorded
every<00:02:43.280> hour<00:02:43.400> we<00:02:44.090> test<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.810> as<00:02:45.019> small<00:02:45.349> as<00:02:45.670> 1.5

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
every hour we test to as small as 1.5

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
every hour we test to as small as 1.5
millimeters<00:02:47.420> bears<00:02:47.689> and<00:02:48.500> I'll<00:02:48.620> pass<00:02:48.769> this

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
millimeters bears and I'll pass this

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.830 
millimeters bears and I'll pass this
around<00:02:49.129> that's<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:49.670> size<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.209> our<00:02:50.599> metal

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
around that's the size of our metal

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.659 
around that's the size of our metal
detectors<00:02:51.290> we'll<00:02:51.469> pull<00:02:51.680> out<00:02:51.859> if<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:52.519> any

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:52.669 
detectors we'll pull out if there's any

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:54.970 
detectors we'll pull out if there's any
metal<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.180> goes<00:02:53.540> through<00:02:53.870> what's<00:02:54.769> gonna

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
metal that goes through what's gonna

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.819 
metal that goes through what's gonna
happen<00:02:55.519> is<00:02:55.700> he's<00:02:56.150> gonna<00:02:56.269> put<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.599> plastic<00:02:57.319> yes

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
happen is he's gonna put a plastic yes

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.119 
happen is he's gonna put a plastic yes
that's<00:02:58.159> got<00:02:58.340> metal<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.969> it<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.260> belt<00:03:00.590> what

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
that's got metal in it on that belt what

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's got metal in it on that belt what
you'll<00:03:01.250> see<00:03:01.459> is<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.639> gate<00:03:01.969> flip<00:03:02.389> up<00:03:02.569> and<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
you'll see is a gate flip up and the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.220 
you'll see is a gate flip up and the
burgers<00:03:03.290> will<00:03:03.439> come<00:03:03.650> down

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.860 

to<00:03:07.129> make<00:03:07.280> sure<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.670> machine<00:03:08.060> works<00:03:08.390> every

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
to make sure the machine works every

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.440 
to make sure the machine works every
hour<00:03:13.989> no<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.290> not<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:15.769> common<00:03:16.190> occurrence

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
hour no it's not a common occurrence

hour no it's not a common occurrence
metal<00:03:17.450> detection<00:03:17.720> is<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:17.930> standard<00:03:18.530> food

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
metal detection is a standard food

metal detection is a standard food
industry<00:03:19.730> practice<00:03:20.239> we're<00:03:20.780> detecting<00:03:21.290> at<00:03:21.379> a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
industry practice we're detecting at a

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.240 
industry practice we're detecting at a
finer<00:03:22.569> sensitivity<00:03:23.569> than<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.890> other<00:03:25.010> beef

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
finer sensitivity than the other beef

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.490 
finer sensitivity than the other beef
plants<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:25.700> we<00:03:25.880> know<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.209> all<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> things

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
plants that we know of all of the things

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.550 
plants that we know of all of the things
that<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.800> are<00:03:27.830> doing<00:03:28.010> here<00:03:28.300> are<00:03:29.300> a<00:03:29.690> secondary

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
that we are doing here are a secondary

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.430 
that we are doing here are a secondary
step<00:03:31.519> it's<00:03:32.360> like<00:03:32.510> what<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.720> would<00:03:32.930> do<00:03:33.080> really

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
step it's like what you would do really

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.410 
step it's like what you would do really
in<00:03:33.530> your<00:03:33.680> own<00:03:33.799> kitchen<00:03:34.130> as<00:03:34.910> part<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.269> our

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
in your own kitchen as part of our

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.020 
in your own kitchen as part of our
process<00:03:35.690> we<00:03:36.110> full<00:03:36.349> eat<00:03:37.040> we<00:03:37.519> make<00:03:37.700> a<00:03:37.730> very

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
process we full eat we make a very

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.000 
process we full eat we make a very
consistent<00:03:38.480> product<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> shade

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
consistent product on the shade

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.059 
consistent product on the shade
thickness<00:03:40.700> all<00:03:41.150> those<00:03:41.390> things<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.049> it's<00:03:42.799> got

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
thickness all those things so it's got

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.520 
thickness all those things so it's got
to<00:03:43.160> be<00:03:43.250> very<00:03:43.370> consistent<00:03:43.849> fat<00:03:44.269> content<00:03:44.840> pack

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
to be very consistent fat content pack

to be very consistent fat content pack
what<00:03:46.430> we're<00:03:46.549> gonna<00:03:46.640> do<00:03:46.849> now<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:50.239> then<00:03:50.480> what

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
what we're gonna do now and then what

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:29.409 
what we're gonna do now and then what
we'll<00:03:50.930> do<00:03:51.079> is<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:55.549> show<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.790> exactly<00:04:28.419> like

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
we'll do is to show you exactly like

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.129 
we'll do is to show you exactly like
it's<00:04:30.110> like<00:04:30.470> burgers<00:04:30.919> that<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.100> would<00:04:31.370> buy<00:04:32.139> at

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
it's like burgers that you would buy at

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.900 
it's like burgers that you would buy at
the<00:04:33.289> grocery<00:04:33.410> store<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:34.160> lot<00:04:34.520> of<00:04:34.610> what<00:04:34.700> we<00:04:34.789> do

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
the grocery store a lot of what we do

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.540 
the grocery store a lot of what we do
honestly<00:04:35.539> is<00:04:35.600> around<00:04:36.050> consistency<00:04:37.010> because

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
honestly is around consistency because

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.190 
honestly is around consistency because
you<00:04:37.669> have<00:04:37.820> to<00:04:37.940> have<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.150> mark<00:04:38.330> every<00:04:38.479> time<00:04:38.660> now

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
you have to have the mark every time now

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.560 
you have to have the mark every time now
you're<00:04:39.289> cooking<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.620> hamburger<00:04:39.889> at<00:04:40.039> home<00:04:40.570> you

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
you're cooking a hamburger at home you

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.370 
you're cooking a hamburger at home you
know<00:04:41.660> they're<00:04:41.840> gonna<00:04:41.960> be<00:04:42.050> different

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
know they're gonna be different

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.010 
know they're gonna be different
different<00:04:43.130> size<00:04:43.310> shape<00:04:43.729> you're<00:04:44.720> gonna<00:04:44.840> cook

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
different size shape you're gonna cook

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.140 
different size shape you're gonna cook
them<00:04:45.139> different<00:04:45.470> lengths<00:04:45.919> of<00:04:45.979> time<00:04:46.039> here<00:04:47.000> it's

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
them different lengths of time here it's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.589 
them different lengths of time here it's
the<00:04:48.020> same<00:04:48.229> and<00:04:49.130> we<00:04:49.280> need<00:04:49.430> that<00:04:49.550> because<00:04:49.729> when

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
the same and we need that because when

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.020 
the same and we need that because when
they're<00:04:50.750> out<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.139> store

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
they're out in the store

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.200 
they're out in the store
are<00:04:53.360> set<00:04:53.600> to<00:04:54.490> cooking<00:04:55.490> times<00:04:55.730> on<00:04:55.940> each<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
are set to cooking times on each of the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.080 
are set to cooking times on each of the
products<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:57.020> if<00:04:57.260> there's<00:04:57.440> any<00:04:57.740> deviation<00:04:58.090> in

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
products and if there's any deviation in

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.240 
products and if there's any deviation in
our<00:04:59.270> product<00:04:59.720> it<00:05:00.140> won't<00:05:00.350> cook<00:05:00.590> correctly<00:05:01.100> so

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
our product it won't cook correctly so

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.130 
our product it won't cook correctly so
it's<00:05:01.400> very<00:05:01.850> important<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.510> we<00:05:02.690> get<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:02.960> done

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
it's very important that we get it done

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.080 
it's very important that we get it done
correctly<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:03.890> has<00:05:04.070> been<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:04.550> fun<00:05:04.820> for

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
correctly this has been really fun for
