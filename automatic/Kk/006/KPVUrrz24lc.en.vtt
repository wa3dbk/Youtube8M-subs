read with at first but I love it now is
an<00:04:29.710> excellent<00:04:29.889> system<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.730> what<00:04:31.240> it<00:04:31.360> does<00:04:31.510> is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
an excellent system and what it does is

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.140 
an excellent system and what it does is
it<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.380> just<00:04:33.100> three<00:04:33.280> pieces<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.639> wood<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.060> the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
it is just three pieces of wood and the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
end ones pinched in and then once it

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.280 
end ones pinched in and then once it
slides<00:04:36.760> into<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:37.240> little<00:04:37.570> tighter<00:04:37.900> canal

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
slides into this little tighter canal

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.100 
slides into this little tighter canal
and<00:04:38.500> then<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.770> locks<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:40.660> does<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:40.930> really

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
and then it locks and it does a really

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.620 
and then it locks and it does a really
excellent<00:04:41.889> job<00:04:42.190> at<00:04:42.370> locking<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:42.940> man<00:04:43.270> does<00:04:43.450> it

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
excellent job at locking and man does it

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.790 
excellent job at locking and man does it
stay<00:04:43.840> together<00:04:43.990> well<00:04:44.350> so<00:04:44.470> we're<00:04:44.590> just<00:04:44.620> going

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
device quite a bit not a ton though it's

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.320 
device quite a bit not a ton though it's
pretty<00:05:12.070> much<00:05:12.280> comparable<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.150> switch

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
pretty much comparable to the switch

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.420 
pretty much comparable to the switch
easy<00:05:13.540> neo<00:05:13.810> it's<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.710> little<00:05:14.950> bit<00:05:15.070> bigger<00:05:15.250> than

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
easy neo it's a little bit bigger than

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.800 
easy neo it's a little bit bigger than
the<00:05:15.490> switch<00:05:15.730> easier<00:05:16.030> apple<00:05:16.300> but<00:05:16.450> not<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.690> whole

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
the switch easier apple but not a whole

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.409 
the switch easier apple but not a whole
lot<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.410> fact<00:05:17.919> it's<00:05:18.190> closer<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:19.000> incase

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
lot in fact it's closer to the incase

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.990 
lot in fact it's closer to the incase
slider<00:05:19.660> than<00:05:20.620> even<00:05:20.979> this<00:05:21.130> it's<00:05:21.400> this<00:05:21.640> is<00:05:21.760> way

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
slider than even this it's this is way

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000 
slider than even this it's this is way
thin<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:23.169> is<00:05:23.290> just<00:05:23.470> a<00:05:23.560> little<00:05:23.710> bit<00:05:23.860> better

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
thin this is just a little bit better

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.420 
thin this is just a little bit better
than<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.370> incase<00:05:24.639> slider<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:25.440> it's<00:05:26.440> big<00:05:26.830> but

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
than the incase slider so it's big but

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.610 
than the incase slider so it's big but
not<00:05:27.490> you<00:05:28.360> know<00:05:28.510> really<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:29.110> large<00:05:29.350> at<00:05:29.500> all

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
little so it's good on the fact that

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.670 
little so it's good on the fact that
you're<00:06:18.789> protected<00:06:19.330> this<00:06:19.690> whole<00:06:20.080> side<00:06:20.289> is<00:06:20.350> very

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
you're protected this whole side is very

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.230 
you're protected this whole side is very
nice<00:06:20.979> you<00:06:21.220> flip<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.550> switch<00:06:21.760> down<00:06:21.789> you<00:06:22.120> still

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
nice you flip the switch down you still

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.930 
nice you flip the switch down you still
have<00:06:22.390> full<00:06:22.570> switch<00:06:22.840> accessibility<00:06:23.590> but<00:06:24.160> you

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
have full switch accessibility but you

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.860 
have full switch accessibility but you
know<00:06:25.090> it's<00:06:25.690> pretty<00:06:26.970> it's<00:06:27.970> in<00:06:28.120> close<00:06:28.390> quarters

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
know it's pretty it's in close quarters

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.390 
know it's pretty it's in close quarters
so<00:06:29.020> there's<00:06:29.169> not<00:06:29.350> a<00:06:29.380> lot<00:06:29.650> of<00:06:29.680> room<00:06:29.979> for<00:06:30.010> it<00:06:30.280> to

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
so there's not a lot of room for it to

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.460 
so there's not a lot of room for it to
get<00:06:30.490> damaged<00:06:31.000> and<00:06:31.570> I'll<00:06:31.720> same<00:06:32.020> with<00:06:32.140> the<00:06:32.229> tops
