00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.100 
weekends race where in the Sahara Falls
in<00:00:50.610> year<00:00:50.789> 4<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.120> their<00:00:51.390> home<00:00:51.600> corn<00:00:51.899> Prix

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
in year 4 what is their home corn Prix

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.069 
in year 4 what is their home corn Prix
and<00:00:52.610> will<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.699> running<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> setup<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
and will be running through the setup of

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
and will be running through the setup of
course<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> forcing<00:00:56.520> gear<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> top<00:00:57.120> team

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
course the forcing gear not a top team

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.580 
course the forcing gear not a top team
so<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> car<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> little<00:00:58.199> sluggish

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
so the car is a little sluggish

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.930 
so the car is a little sluggish
especially<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.219> corner<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.670> that's<00:00:59.820> why

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
especially in the corner so that's why

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
especially in the corner so that's why
we're<00:01:00.120> running<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.570> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> front<00:01:01.410> wing

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
we're running a little bit of front wing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.990 
we're running a little bit of front wing
but<00:01:01.829> keeping<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.190> nice<00:01:02.340> balance<00:01:02.699> between<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
but keeping a nice balance between the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
but keeping a nice balance between the
front<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.359> rear<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> help<00:01:03.840> keep<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> car<00:01:04.500> from

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
front and rear to help keep the car from

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 
front and rear to help keep the car from
understeering<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.339> oversteer<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:06.060> much<00:01:06.290> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
understeering or oversteer too much the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
understeering or oversteer too much the
balance<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> suspension<00:01:08.490> are<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.790> geared<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
balance and suspension are all geared to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.810 
balance and suspension are all geared to
favor<00:01:09.780> mid<00:01:10.080> corner<00:01:10.350> grip<00:01:10.650> over<00:01:11.159> initial

favor mid corner grip over initial

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
favor mid corner grip over initial
response<00:01:12.210> as<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> middle<00:01:12.930> sector<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> here

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
response as the middle sector and here

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.080 
response as the middle sector and here
full<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.770> medium<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.280> high<00:01:14.400> speed<00:01:14.460> sweeping

full of medium to high speed sweeping

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.330 
full of medium to high speed sweeping
corners<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.080> maintaining<00:01:16.530> grip<00:01:16.830> mid<00:01:17.040> corner

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
corners so maintaining grip mid corner

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
corners so maintaining grip mid corner
is<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.549> important<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:19.140> as

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
straight-line acceleration which is why

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
straight-line acceleration which is why
arrow<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.509> very<00:01:21.930> low<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.250> car<00:01:23.430> feels<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.790> bit

too loose you can of course raise the
error<00:01:25.770> levels<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.369> make<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> car<00:01:26.820> more

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
a driver to push to the limits so that's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
a driver to push to the limits so that's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the setup that we'll be using for this
