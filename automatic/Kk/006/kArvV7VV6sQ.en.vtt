00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
equals the back half I think before the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.180 
equals the back half I think before the
front<00:00:41.329> half<00:00:41.510> wheel<00:00:42.260> gap<00:00:42.500> was<00:00:42.710> a<00:00:42.739> lot<00:00:42.980> higher

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
front half wheel gap was a lot higher

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:54.910

take<00:02:20.420> out<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> lag<00:02:20.900> bolt<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.350> bottom<00:02:21.650> when

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
take out the lag bolt at the bottom when

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.520 
take out the lag bolt at the bottom when
you<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> 17<00:02:22.580> inch<00:02:22.850> we're<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.600> 17<00:02:24.170> millimeter

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
you get a 17 inch we're a 17 millimeter

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.770 
you get a 17 inch we're a 17 millimeter
