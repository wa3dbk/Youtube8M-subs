better<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.689> than<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.200> am<00:01:12.260> that's<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.590> way

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
better at this than I am that's one way

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.469 
better at this than I am that's one way
to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.460> guess

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
to do it I guess

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.080 
to do it I guess
my<00:01:16.229> arms<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.619> sore<00:01:16.770> now<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.820> had<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
do that 50 times that might be a little

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.230 
do that 50 times that might be a little
bit<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> hassle<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.970> these

yeah that's a little bit thinner
cardboard<00:01:59.800> it<00:01:59.890> works<00:02:00.100> pretty<00:02:00.400> good<00:02:00.520> on<00:02:00.850> but

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
cardboard it works pretty good on but

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.190 
cardboard it works pretty good on but
thicker<00:02:03.400> cardboard<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.420> kind<00:02:04.870> of<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.050> little

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
thicker cardboard so kind of a little

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.420 
thicker cardboard so kind of a little
bit<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.590> pain<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.790> then<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.180> got<00:02:07.360> these

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.570 

that's<00:02:31.740> pretty<00:02:32.740> straight<00:02:33.070> cut<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.700> it's
