00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.779
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.520
 you are welcome to this new video 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.170
 today a video maybe a little 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.390
 different a mini tutorial we are going to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.220
 say it and how are you seeing there in 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.739
 screen let's make this work 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.630
 piece command this beautiful command of the 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.820
 play 4 on the pc 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.469
 the truth is quite simple but there 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.649
 a small problem but that 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.600
 solve as I say it's easy, let's go 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.210
 to start with the basics, you do not get 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.300
 the control and with the charging cable that you 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.290
 comes with the command of play 4 of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.960
 I send this to load then this 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.239
 goes with a usb micro usb and with usb 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.940
 the computer simply because you 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.450
 you connect to the computer and automatically 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 the 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.530
 the computer will already recognize you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.350
 I'm even going to be able to do it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.730
 operate in steam the command in the mode 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.050
 this now I do not remember what it's called 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.360
 the way this good there is a way that is 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.990
 for consoles so good in that 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.500
 and so you will not run the command 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.880
 you are going to go for example to here we are going to 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.359
 watch 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.310
 to the control panel look for games 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:28.000
 configure to configure devices 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.219
 of usb game and we see that we have it here 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.280
 and we see then that he does not answer us 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:37.420
 Absolutely all controls are worth 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 what happens what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.180
 the games will not recognize you 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.540
 because normally games do not 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.400
 they recognize all the controls 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.340
 this will not recognize you recognizes 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.960
 normally the controls of xbox is worth but 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.750
 well do not worry because this in 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.820
 reality is not a problem that 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.990
 we need ok we need good 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.800
 we are waiting and for now 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.570
 we need to download a program because 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.240
 of course I'm going to put you in the 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.870
 description the link to download or that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.330
 this one not the ds4 four x input rapper voucher 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.760
 well this is what you have to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.040
 download and I say good to you 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.290
 decompress you will come a winrar and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 decompressing because we are going out 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.490
 these five files and the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.930
 folder is worth the first thing that 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.520
 we have to do is come here to 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.810
 virtual bus driver and you will give here 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.880
 spectra jvr 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.370
 double click I'm not going to do it 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.290
 and you give him here to install vale what 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.450
 you install nothing happens 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.850
 and once installed it is installed in 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.990
 zero eat 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.890
 come to this other that is that cp server 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:52.130
 it's worth here we stick 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.810
 and here here it will not take fijaros saba 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.819
 in the little screen below that will open a 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 incognito like this that is you 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.130
 installing the server this nothing is 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.340
 another second of nothing and good select 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.500
 is this and you already have the emulator this is 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.590
 as an emulator an emulator to command 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.990
 of xbox 360 working perfectly what 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.600
 you will have so what we have to 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.820
 do now once we have this open 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.730
 we do not use it anymore we come another 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.700
 time here to the games where you have 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.489
 you play and as you see here already as 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.959
 you see here and we get the xbox controller 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.160
 360 for windows is worth so far the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.010
 step d 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.739
 we are going to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.709
 and do the test that we see that follows 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.230
 perfectly working all 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.879
 correct buttons good so far 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.090
 configure the command we already have it 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:53.319
 recognized as an xbox command and now 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.239
 Well, the next step would be to check 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:59.069
 that everything works and that the games 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.069
 they go well so let's go to it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.490
 with flavors as I said sometimes 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.140
 we can start with the manu 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.600
 also estimate in the mode this 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.120
 picture that we control with the command that 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.420
 it's very good so nothing perfect anymore 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.630
 we have the command running here now 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.430
 well what we would have left a little is 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.579
 then nothing to choose a game that we want 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.820
 in this case I'm going to choose the 2 by 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.580
 example so you can see that you can 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.530
 work perfectly and so that you 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.350
 you can laugh perfectly about me 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.690
 because I with a command is as if I 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.580
 it says it's a command to a baby or surely 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.030
 the baby would do better than me we are going to 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.030
 check it 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.700
 Well, kids, we're here in 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.610
 the game we see right away that the 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.220
 command works perfectly well there 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.590
 puts us there because that's because 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.720
 it recognizes as an xbox command but 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.720
 we go 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.449
 that you can work perfectly 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.150
 so then let's see a little 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.159
 to try a little we see that the menus 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.479
 goes perfectly we are going to make a 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.479
 deprived of a moment 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:17.479
 sucked because as I said we are 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:21.099
 allies in a couple of them and shit and 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.099
 because it does 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.550
 the map of good right here 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.500
 OK 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.740
 because we have come here assignment 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.169
 automatic 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.740
 which brings me loose young by 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.740
 be flowers 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.180
 and well let's check that the command 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.979
 work perfectly let's try 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.770
 kill a couple of them 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.479
 and I say try because when I tell you 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.379
 that I am bad you have to believe me that it is 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:58.330
 it 's worth it once it works 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.810
 perfectly all that is that the taken 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.810
 I'm going to start 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.110
 there we have one 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.250
 there we have another bad habits 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.250
 I keep killing 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.080
 Perfect everyone 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.669
 perfect the command kids laces is 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.460
 blame my computer for nothing 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.090
 contrary 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.090
 fuck 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.840
 because the European arms 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.290
 I 'm not going to extend the more 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.700
 little the roll of this because what 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.700
 we wanted to see is that the command works 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.390
 The next thing we wanted to see is that 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.200
 We have to kill 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.070
 as an ally 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.070
 and the other one does not 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:04.060
 it has brought us 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.060
 there was another one around here 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.370
 and we're going to leave it because the ties that 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.840
 they give me is not even average normal so 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.010
 look what we left here that for now neither 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.620
 I had been killed or anything like that 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.480
 perfect kids I hope you liked it 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.550
 the video I hope you share it for 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.040
 let everyone know which one they are going to 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.050
 kill haha the two to take for ass and 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.760
 that works perfectly by sending well 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.250
 that nothing kids like I tell you I hope you 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.190
 liked the video like favorites and 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.680
 see you in a next chao up 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:37.680
 then friends are there if you look for them
