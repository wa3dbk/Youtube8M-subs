people on how I think you can set about
establishing<00:00:52.949> an<00:00:53.820> orchard<00:00:54.140> particularly<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
establishing an orchard particularly it

may be a small one in your backyard now
I'm<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> backyard<00:00:58.199> orchard<00:00:58.739> right<00:00:58.890> now<00:00:59.100> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

people have got in subsequent films so

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.569 
people have got in subsequent films so
this<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> first<00:03:05.829> time<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.159> basically

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
this is the first time just basically

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.000 
this is the first time just basically
announcing<00:03:07.060> I'm<00:03:07.180> going<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.419> do<00:03:07.510> some<00:03:08.010> how-to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
announcing I'm going to do some how-to

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.849 
announcing I'm going to do some how-to
how<00:03:09.159> to<00:03:09.780> establish<00:03:10.780> an<00:03:11.139> orchard<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.620> put<00:03:11.829> a

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
how to establish an orchard I put a

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.689 
how to establish an orchard I put a
common<00:03:12.870> title<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.709> them<00:03:14.859> all<00:03:14.979> so<00:03:15.280> they<00:03:15.430> can<00:03:15.639> be

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:15.699 
common title to them all so they can be

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.830 
common title to them all so they can be
searched<00:03:15.970> easily<00:03:16.629> and<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:19.209> next<00:03:19.419> one<00:03:19.569> I'll<00:03:19.690> do

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
searched easily and the next one I'll do

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.569 
searched easily and the next one I'll do
is<00:03:20.019> probably<00:03:20.229> about<00:03:20.440> early<00:03:21.010> apples<00:03:21.370> and

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
is probably about early apples and

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.109 
is probably about early apples and
