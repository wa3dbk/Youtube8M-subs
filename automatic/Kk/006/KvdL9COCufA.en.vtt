00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
being away from home for so long had

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.690 
being away from home for so long had
actually<00:02:38.450> gotten<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.989> me<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:40.129> felt<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.670> bit

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
actually gotten to me and I felt a bit

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.440 
actually gotten to me and I felt a bit
depressed<00:02:41.629> for<00:02:41.930> some<00:02:42.140> days<00:02:42.409> and<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:44.060> decided

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
depressed for some days and I decided

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.110 
depressed for some days and I decided
with<00:02:45.409> my<00:02:45.620> family<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.189> go<00:02:46.340> back<00:02:46.519> home<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:46.939> half

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
with my family to go back home for half

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
a year it wasn't an easy decision

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.229 
a year it wasn't an easy decision
because<00:02:51.620> all<00:02:52.189> of<00:02:52.250> my<00:02:52.400> friends<00:02:52.760> would<00:02:53.000> have

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
because all of my friends would have

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.259 
because all of my friends would have
moved<00:02:53.480> on<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.040> if<00:02:55.040> I<00:02:55.189> come<00:02:55.489> back<00:02:55.730> everything

moved on and if I come back everything

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.319 
moved on and if I come back everything
would<00:02:56.599> be<00:02:56.750> very<00:02:57.019> different<00:02:57.970> during<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.090> six

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329

spending time with him so I took the

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.710 
spending time with him so I took the
time<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.400> reflect<00:03:16.549> on<00:03:16.879> my<00:03:16.939> life<00:03:17.269> especially

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
that spending time with family was

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.740 
that spending time with family was
