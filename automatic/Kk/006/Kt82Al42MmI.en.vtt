00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.840
 yes 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.840
 or 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.099
 and diamonds 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.529
 and it has like dice youtube mexico the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 world how are your camera here the red 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.849
 this commented new gameplay a new 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.250
 tutorial of this series of operation 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.770
 of the stones network and we are in the third 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.430
 chapter already and well this time we're going to 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.680
 know what the repeaters are good for 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.450
 this can work as a repeater and 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.190
 as a retarder as we saw in the 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.040
 first chapter what you are going to do is 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 repeat our signal when we 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.170
 finish electricity from a network are 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.410
 but it also works as a retarder 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.600
 ok for example we want you to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.440
 example 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.539
 although this piston is activated 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.750
 but we're going to want you to have a little 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.019
 good delay how are we going to do 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 let's put I do not know 3 for example and I 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.430
 let's open the legs ok as you see 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.710
 giving him lt we open his legs is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.590
 very easy ok let's open for example 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.719
 this two to each repeater 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 and what we're going to do is we're going to 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.880
 be from this side that is the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.759
 ok energy we're going to take it out of the room 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.969
 network torch are for example and good 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.520
 see how it takes ok see me activate 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.079
 and as you can see it takes a bit now for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.319
 that they do it well because the truth is that 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.670
 with an example that was quite simple 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.319
 what is going to be this is that I'm going to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.179
 talk about how to do what he is going to do is 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.369
 that will activate one and it will go 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.740
 activated in all this all this but at 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.569
 get here to be open it will take 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 approximately another two seconds 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:49.649
 more or less it 's very little but it takes a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.929
 little bit more now they will see the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.469
 ok difference let's activate them all 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:59.039
 until the third space ok 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:00.179
 well now you can see the difference between 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.649
 let it be seen see how it goes 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.619
 learning one by one and activates our 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.429
 piston ok and now see the difference if 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.379
 we do not have what are the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.780
 repeaters ok if we do not have repeaters 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.670
 see them fast even if it's longer 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.280
 circuit how fast it will activate 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.980
 young does not take anything or the network is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.129
 It happens very fast then 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.780
 what we are going to have to do to 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.580
 activating this is pretty easy 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.060
 we're just going to have to put this 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 so and let's go and we're going to have to open 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.560
 the legs so that it takes a 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.390
 little bit more ok 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.860
 As you can see, it is going to happen for each of the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.200
 repeaters and until the end 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.000
 last one opens and well this has 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.620
 quite its also so I hope they 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.299
 I liked it, it was to your liking if it was 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.299
 so you know how to leave your favorite light
