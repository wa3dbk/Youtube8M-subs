buffer to an h2 buffer the wife shot the
rifle<00:02:08.450> only<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:09.050> functioned<00:02:09.590> fine<00:02:09.770> with<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
rifle only it functioned fine with the

rifle only it functioned fine with the
h2<00:02:10.399> or<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.150> H<00:02:11.270> buffer<00:02:11.660> what's<00:02:12.140> h2<00:02:12.650> simply

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
h2 or with the H buffer what's h2 simply

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.360 
h2 or with the H buffer what's h2 simply
because<00:02:13.489> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
because it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.720 
because it
it<00:02:14.700> seemed<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.590> slow<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.770> bolt<00:02:16.980> down<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
it seemed to slow the bolt down just a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.309 
it seemed to slow the bolt down just a
little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.150> cyclical<00:02:18.630> rate<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.930> lower

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
little bit that cyclical rate was lower

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.220 
little bit that cyclical rate was lower
and<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:20.310> able<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.540> get<00:02:21.540> back<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:21.750> target

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
and I was able to get back on target

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.870 
and I was able to get back on target
just<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.410> bit<00:02:22.560> faster<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:23.040> well<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.459> don't<00:02:23.819> know

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
just a bit faster as well I don't know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.650 
just a bit faster as well I don't know
if<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.150> was<00:02:24.330> related<00:02:24.600> if<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.470> change<00:02:25.770> in<00:02:26.660> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
if that was related if the change in the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.510 
if that was related if the change in the
change<00:02:28.319> in<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> muzzle<00:02:28.920> break<00:02:29.069> was<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.430> of

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
change in the muzzle break was one of

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.580 
change in the muzzle break was one of
the<00:02:29.580> first<00:02:29.790> things<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.120> did<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.510> went<00:02:31.200> from<00:02:31.350> an<00:02:31.470> a2

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the first things I did I went from an a2

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.580 
the first things I did I went from an a2
to<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.270> don't<00:02:33.420> know<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.290> what

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to this so I don't know that is what

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.500 
to this so I don't know that is what
necessarily<00:02:35.069> change<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.819> dynamics<00:02:36.330> but<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
necessarily change the dynamics but it

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.650 
necessarily change the dynamics but it
just<00:02:36.660> seems<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> little<00:02:37.020> torquey<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:38.600> don't<00:02:39.600> know

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
just seems a little torquey I don't know

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.090 
just seems a little torquey I don't know
if<00:02:39.870> that's<00:02:40.200> probably<00:02:40.500> gonna<00:02:40.620> sound<00:02:40.770> retarded

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
if that's probably gonna sound retarded

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.240 
if that's probably gonna sound retarded
something<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:43.050> just<00:02:43.980> seemed<00:02:44.190> to

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
something you know but it just seemed to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.010 
something you know but it just seemed to
torque<00:02:44.550> quite<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> bit<00:02:44.970> my<00:02:45.090> hand<00:02:45.360> for<00:02:45.780> being<00:02:45.959> a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.979 
five five six rifle as I want the h2
that<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:50.700> twisting<00:02:51.209> motion<00:02:51.570> has<00:02:51.950> subsided

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
that that twisting motion has subsided

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.710 
that that twisting motion has subsided
also<00:02:54.989> changed<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> an<00:02:55.590> MOA<00:02:55.800> grip<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.720> despise

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
