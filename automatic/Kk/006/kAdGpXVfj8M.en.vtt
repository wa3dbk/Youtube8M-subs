00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.730
 loneliness blacksmith to happen 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.829
 the new console 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:11.279
 three babies 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.739
 in the latest version 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.369
 businessman 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.789
 at present 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.070
 there is none in the market 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.960
 but not now 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.489
 in Finland console actually 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.039
 as we can see in his speech 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.220
 pretty similar 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.589
 rarely previous 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.319
 in this case, what stands out the most 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.280
 the 3d option that has its screen 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.280
 good part of nn in melon color 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.479
 the chosen colors 

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.430
 those are the colors 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.630
 housing was an option of sd memory and skill once the client 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.460
 chosen 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 which was used to make fire to erase footloose min 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.470
 music the image and video 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.130
 pepe cervera 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.500
 i 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.940
 the only thing we could say that which will be your camera is not a 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.650
 little limited apparently once 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.489
 1 prisoner points 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.910
 an AIDS 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.869
 but in the next game to tennis 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.110
 later nice 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 it's quite interactive 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
 so how constantly is this a movement 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.100
 very few times you're fine 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.160
 static p 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.960
 and that makes good so do not have more fun 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.420
 they dropped him 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.719
 red the camera can can be visualized well the 3d graphics 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.910
 that we are playing with a card 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.980
 one that is also included in 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.450
 around four or five cards included 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.130
 for different games 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.840
 which were little by little the game 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.940
 cd investigating 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 cepeda going bad 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.580
 notwithstanding the interesting 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
 he has the option of environment another game like 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.640
 like for example to put someone's face of you take a picture 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.569
 and place a real bolt 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.769
 I'm going to play in your jazz sauce 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.469
 for trying to do it 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.959
 6 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.549
 by against has taken a photo 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 a companion 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:57.729
 your forces as you have realized 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:59.360
 after juÃ¡rez 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.669
 your interaction with 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:07.529
 according to medez with the environment where we are like this is established on your page 

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:11.179
 the important thing is to take into account the walls all 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.929
 54 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.929
 it was a mission of the fmi 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.439
 eyebrows 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.889
 good how the accounts will be 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:30.909
 after the disaster of 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.599
 from employment counseling 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.819
 think you're dragging 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 in the peloton 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.939
 then the game would come 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.809
 from those 13 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.589
 suffers from a shortage of food 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:47.189
 well that was opted for 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.899
 for now but also information about the interior of this ii 

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:54.229
 much more serious than it seems 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.499
 after coming to power 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:58.109
 the tie 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:58.799
