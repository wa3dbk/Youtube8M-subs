other hand don't have introns I just

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.560 
other hand don't have introns I just
have<00:00:57.110> exons<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.100> they<00:00:58.280> are<00:00:58.430> only<00:00:58.790> capable<00:00:59.000> of

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
have exons so they are only capable of

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.270 
have exons so they are only capable of
reading<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.080> gene<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:00.379> just<00:01:00.619> have<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:00.890> exons

reading a gene that just have the exons

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.160 
reading a gene that just have the exons
and<00:01:01.489> then<00:01:02.030> producing<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.540> protein<00:01:02.839> from<00:01:02.960> that

and then producing the protein from that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.800 
and then producing the protein from that
in<00:01:03.790> order<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> take<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.059> version<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.600> gene

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
to be expressed in the ProCare we first

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.929 
to be expressed in the ProCare we first
have<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.030> make<00:01:11.210> something<00:01:11.390> called<00:01:11.680> cDNA<00:01:12.939> so

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
have to make something called cDNA so

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.840 
have to make something called cDNA so
let's<00:01:14.420> begin<00:01:14.540> we're<00:01:14.990> going<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.290> take<00:01:15.470> our

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
let's begin we're going to take our

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.720 
let's begin we're going to take our
self-interest<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:19.040> first<00:01:19.340> step<00:01:19.550> in

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
self-interest and the first step in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.030 
self-interest and the first step in
creating<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.210> cDNA<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.930> we're<00:01:21.800> going<00:01:21.950> to

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
creating the cDNA is we're going to

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.430 
creating the cDNA is we're going to
isolate<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.970> mRNA<00:01:23.540> of<00:01:23.660> interest<00:01:24.020> this<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.320> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
isolate the mRNA of interest this is the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.920 
isolate the mRNA of interest this is the
mRNA<00:01:24.890> for<00:01:24.950> insulin<00:01:25.400> for<00:01:25.580> example<00:01:25.750> from<00:01:26.750> the

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
mRNA for insulin for example from the

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.430 
mRNA for insulin for example from the
cell<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.490> once<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:28.790> have<00:01:29.000> our<00:01:29.150> mRNA<00:01:29.480> we're

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
cell and once we have our mRNA we're

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.899 
cell and once we have our mRNA we're
going<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.800> add<00:01:30.980> something<00:01:31.220> called<00:01:31.340> reverse

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
going to add something called reverse

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.050 
going to add something called reverse
transcriptase<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.770> protein<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.340> a

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
transcriptase this is a protein that's a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.910 
transcriptase this is a protein that's a
DNA<00:01:35.450> polymerase<00:01:35.900> that's<00:01:36.200> going<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.560> use<00:01:36.710> the

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
DNA polymerase that's going to use the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.360 
DNA polymerase that's going to use the
single-stranded<00:01:37.370> RNA<00:01:37.730> as<00:01:38.420> its<00:01:38.960> template<00:01:39.370> so

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
single-stranded RNA as its template so

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.550 
single-stranded RNA as its template so
it's<00:01:40.490> going<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.790> take<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.720> RNA<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.409> it's

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's going to take the RNA and it's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's going to take the RNA and it's
going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.860> put<00:01:43.010> together<00:01:43.100> this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
going to put together this

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.360 
going to put together this
double-stranded<00:01:45.080> DNA<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.860> would<00:01:45.920> refer<00:01:46.220> to

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
double-stranded DNA that would refer to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.350 
double-stranded DNA that would refer to
a<00:01:46.400> cDNA<00:01:47.210> so<00:01:48.050> this<00:01:48.260> is<00:01:48.409> DNA<00:01:48.979> for<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.280> gene<00:01:49.640> but

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
a cDNA so this is DNA for the gene but

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.020 
a cDNA so this is DNA for the gene but
unlike<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.990> original<00:01:51.080> gene<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.130> only<00:01:52.610> has<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
unlike the original gene it only has the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.700 
unlike the original gene it only has the
exons<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.840> doesn't<00:01:54.260> have<00:01:54.440> any<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.370> introns

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
exons it doesn't have any of the introns

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.320 
exons it doesn't have any of the introns
the<00:01:57.710> next<00:01:58.010> step<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.370> course<00:01:58.400> is<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.030> get<00:01:59.150> the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
the next step of course is to get the

and then it proceeded down the DNA on
the<00:04:41.680> plasmid<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.310> read<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.640> actual<00:04:42.790> gene<00:04:43.150> and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
the plasmid to read the actual gene and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.540 
the plasmid to read the actual gene and
transcribe<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.170> so<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.560> mRNA<00:04:45.100> which<00:04:45.340> then

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
transcribe it and so the mRNA which then

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.870 
transcribe it and so the mRNA which then
ultimately<00:04:45.760> can<00:04:46.300> be<00:04:46.390> made<00:04:46.510> into<00:04:46.660> protein

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
ultimately can be made into protein

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.970 
ultimately can be made into protein
finally<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.060> need<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.240> selection<00:04:49.540> marker<00:04:49.980> now

the vector needs and then we'll go over
it<00:06:06.729> together

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.150 

okay<00:06:16.000> does<00:06:17.000> it<00:06:17.150> need<00:06:17.270> a<00:06:17.300> bacterial<00:06:17.840> Ori<00:06:18.140> yes<00:06:18.980> if

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
okay does it need a bacterial Ori yes if

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.110 
okay does it need a bacterial Ori yes if
we<00:06:19.220> want<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:19.430> grow<00:06:19.520> up<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.640> large<00:06:19.850> amount<00:06:20.090> of

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
we want to grow up a large amount of

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.180 
we want to grow up a large amount of
insulin<00:06:20.510> we're<00:06:21.230> going<00:06:21.470> to<00:06:21.590> put<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.860> plasmid

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
insulin we're going to put the plasmid

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.040 
insulin we're going to put the plasmid
in<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.400> bacteria<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.240> bacteria<00:06:23.270> needs<00:06:23.930> to

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
in the bacteria the bacteria needs to

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.130 
in the bacteria the bacteria needs to
create<00:06:24.320> more<00:06:24.620> of<00:06:24.770> this<00:06:24.920> plasmid<00:06:26.080> there's<00:06:27.080> a

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
create more of this plasmid there's a

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.230 
create more of this plasmid there's a
human<00:06:27.770> Ori<00:06:28.130> no<00:06:28.730> we're<00:06:28.940> not<00:06:29.030> actually

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
human Ori no we're not actually

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.830 
human Ori no we're not actually
assorting<00:06:30.080> the<00:06:30.740> plasmid<00:06:31.190> into<00:06:31.400> human<00:06:32.300> cell<00:06:32.540> so

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
assorting the plasmid into human cell so

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.270 
assorting the plasmid into human cell so
the<00:06:32.990> human<00:06:33.290> cell<00:06:33.470> is<00:06:33.590> never<00:06:33.770> going<00:06:33.920> to<00:06:34.040> need<00:06:34.220> to

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
the human cell is never going to need to

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.100 
the human cell is never going to need to
create<00:06:34.460> more<00:06:34.640> of<00:06:34.790> them<00:06:34.970> just<00:06:35.180> the<00:06:35.630> bacterial

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
create more of them just the bacterial

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.210 
create more of them just the bacterial
cell<00:06:37.270> what<00:06:38.270> about<00:06:38.480> bacterial<00:06:38.930> promoter<00:06:39.220> yes

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
cell what about bacterial promoter yes

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.920 
cell what about bacterial promoter yes
even<00:06:40.670> though<00:06:40.760> it's<00:06:40.880> a<00:06:40.910> human<00:06:41.180> gene<00:06:41.450> the

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
even though it's a human gene the

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.110 
even though it's a human gene the

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 
promoter has before the bacteria because

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.330 
promoter has before the bacteria because
it's<00:06:44.240> going<00:06:44.450> to<00:06:44.570> be<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:45.380> bacterial<00:06:46.130> RNA

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
it's going to be the bacterial RNA

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.010 
it's going to be the bacterial RNA
polymerase<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.450> will<00:06:47.540> bind<00:06:47.810> to<00:06:47.930> the

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
polymerase that will bind to the

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.080 
polymerase that will bind to the
promoter<00:06:48.230> and<00:06:48.740> ultimately<00:06:49.190> ultimately<00:06:49.550> make

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
promoter and ultimately ultimately make

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.950

the<00:06:50.540> mRNA<00:06:50.870> from<00:06:51.380> the<00:06:51.470> cDNA<00:06:52.780> what<00:06:53.780> about<00:06:53.930> a

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
the mRNA from the cDNA what about a

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.020 
the mRNA from the cDNA what about a
human<00:06:54.350> promoter<00:06:54.770> no<00:06:55.280> we<00:06:55.460> don't<00:06:55.640> need<00:06:55.730> a<00:06:55.790> human

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
human promoter no we don't need a human

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.390 
human promoter no we don't need a human
promoter<00:06:56.360> because<00:06:56.630> the<00:06:57.200> human<00:06:57.530> RNA

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
promoter because the human RNA

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.920 
promoter because the human RNA
polymerase<00:06:58.730> won't<00:06:59.000> be<00:06:59.090> involved<00:06:59.330> again<00:06:59.780> this

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
polymerase won't be involved again this

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.270 
polymerase won't be involved again this
is<00:07:00.050> only<00:07:00.290> going<00:07:00.500> to<00:07:00.560> be<00:07:00.650> in<00:07:00.770> the<00:07:00.860> bacterial

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280

is only going to be in the bacterial
cell<00:07:01.490> it's<00:07:01.669> not<00:07:01.850> going<00:07:02.120> to<00:07:02.240> be<00:07:02.360> in<00:07:02.480> the<00:07:02.570> human

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
cell it's not going to be in the human

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.310 
cell it's not going to be in the human
cell<00:07:03.110> so<00:07:03.740> it<00:07:03.830> doesn't<00:07:04.130> need<00:07:04.220> a<00:07:04.280> human<00:07:04.550> promoter

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
cell so it doesn't need a human promoter

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.600 
cell so it doesn't need a human promoter
and<00:07:06.320> finally<00:07:06.740> for<00:07:06.860> the<00:07:06.919> selection<00:07:07.280> markers

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
and finally for the selection markers

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.460 
and finally for the selection markers
once<00:07:07.880> again<00:07:08.120> we<00:07:08.360> only<00:07:08.600> need<00:07:08.930> the<00:07:08.960> bacterial

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
once again we only need the bacterial

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.500 
once again we only need the bacterial
selection<00:07:09.830> marker<00:07:10.100> not<00:07:10.700> the<00:07:10.910> human<00:07:11.120> selection

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510 
selection marker not the human selection

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.780 
selection marker not the human selection

full human cells at this point we're

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.400 
full human cells at this point we're

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
just dealing with the plasmid so we only

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.200 
just dealing with the plasmid so we only
