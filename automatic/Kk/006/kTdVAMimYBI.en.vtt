fighting against diabetes and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
fighting against diabetes and
cardiovascular<00:02:21.020> disease<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.160> several

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.530 
cardiovascular disease and several
studies<00:02:23.450> done<00:02:23.750> for<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.830> low-carb<00:02:25.250> diet

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
studies done for the low-carb diet

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.240 
studies done for the low-carb diet
people<00:02:26.540> have<00:02:27.320> lost<00:02:27.590> as<00:02:27.890> much<00:02:28.370> as<00:02:29.650> 34<00:02:30.650> pounds

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
people have lost as much as 34 pounds

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.180 
people have lost as much as 34 pounds
and<00:02:32.180> these<00:02:32.360> would<00:02:32.540> leaner<00:02:32.810> people<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.920> this

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
and these would leaner people so this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.670 
and these would leaner people so this
represents<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.000> more<00:02:35.510> significant<00:02:36.260> loss<00:02:36.500> of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
represents a more significant loss of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.760 
represents a more significant loss of
percent<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.220> body<00:02:37.400> fat<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.120> body<00:02:38.870> weight<00:02:39.140> than

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
percent of body fat and body weight than

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.590 
percent of body fat and body weight than
the<00:02:39.950> use<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.310> drug<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:40.880> there's<00:02:41.150> no<00:02:41.270> sense

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
the use of the drug so there's no sense

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.950 
the use of the drug so there's no sense
using<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.110> drug<00:02:42.580> at<00:02:43.580> all<00:02:43.790> people<00:02:44.510> will<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.810> it

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
using the drug at all people will do it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.130 
using the drug at all people will do it
I<00:02:45.200> know<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:46.820> let's<00:02:47.060> some<00:02:47.240> reason<00:02:47.900> rise

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
I know that but let's some reason rise

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.690 
I know that but let's some reason rise
out<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.770> ashes<00:02:48.800> here

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
out of the ashes here

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.680 
out of the ashes here
so<00:02:50.600> people<00:02:50.900> think<00:02:51.110> clearly<00:02:52.300> low-carb<00:02:53.300> diet

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
so people think clearly low-carb diet
