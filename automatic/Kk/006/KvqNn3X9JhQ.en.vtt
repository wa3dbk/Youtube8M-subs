00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.770 
current vehicle it has a six-speed
automatic<00:01:48.970> instead<00:01:49.150> of<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.330> 5-speed<00:01:49.750> manual

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780

yes

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
yes

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.650 
yes
it's<00:01:51.250> conditional<00:01:51.850> torque<00:01:52.180> converted

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
it's conditional torque converted

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's conditional torque converted
automatic<00:01:53.170> is<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:53.380> around<00:01:53.590> a<00:01:53.770> clutch<00:01:54.009> okay

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
automatic is this around a clutch okay

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.520 
automatic is this around a clutch okay
one<00:01:54.580> reward<00:01:54.820> even<00:01:55.210> though<00:01:55.509> Chrysler<00:01:56.380> Group

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
one reward even though Chrysler Group

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.960 
one reward even though Chrysler Group
does<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:56.950> dual<00:01:57.130> clutch<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.580> dark<00:01:57.790> they

does have a dual clutch in the dark they

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.749 
does have a dual clutch in the dark they
didn't<00:01:58.210> carry<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.479> over<00:01:58.540> here<00:01:58.930> yeah<00:01:59.380> makes

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
didn't carry that over here yeah makes

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.969 
didn't carry that over here yeah makes
157<00:02:00.759> horsepower<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.420> 183<00:02:02.229> foot-pounds<00:02:02.920> of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
157 horsepower and 183 foot-pounds of

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.499 
157 horsepower and 183 foot-pounds of
torque<00:02:03.039> okay<00:02:03.700> that's<00:02:03.970> different<00:02:04.149> than<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
torque okay that's different than the

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.359 
torque okay that's different than the
manual<00:02:04.780> though<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.680> doesn't<00:02:05.830> a<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:06.160> torque

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
manual though it doesn't a little torque

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.729 
manual though it doesn't a little torque
it<00:02:06.640> so<00:02:06.789> for<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> sport<00:02:07.270> button<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.780> push<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.590> pull

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
it so for a sport button I push the pull

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.949 
it so for a sport button I push the pull
sport<00:02:09.009> but<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.340> think<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:09.550> does<00:02:09.670> anything<00:02:09.959> it'll

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
sport but I think it does anything it'll

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.540 
sport but I think it does anything it'll
change<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.440> show<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.739> G<00:02:11.950> meter<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.370> stuff

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
change and show you a G meter and stuff

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.940 
change and show you a G meter and stuff
on<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:12.850> on<00:02:13.090> Center<00:02:13.450> cluster<00:02:13.600> oh<00:02:14.050> yeah<00:02:14.739> those

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
on here on Center cluster oh yeah those

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.229 
on here on Center cluster oh yeah those
look<00:02:15.130> at<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.370> doesn't<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.790> change<00:02:15.970> so

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
look at that doesn't it change so

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.090 
look at that doesn't it change so
shifting<00:02:16.600> algorithm<00:02:17.200> do<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.530> change<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.950> sit

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
shifting algorithm do that change of sit

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.350 
shifting algorithm do that change of sit
pattern<00:02:18.489> you'll<00:02:18.670> get<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.910> blips<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.270> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
pattern you'll get the blips on the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.050 
pattern you'll get the blips on the
downshift<00:02:19.540> you'll<00:02:20.110> hear<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:21.060> backfires

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
downshift you'll hear the the backfires
