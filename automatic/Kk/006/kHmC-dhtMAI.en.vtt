00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.869
 hello and welcome tsum too 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:22.810
 let's play world of tanks medley atx per 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:26.169
 today on the way to hemmelsdorf with the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:30.310
 t 69 and actually I would start up 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.900
 only it does not seem too much on the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.470
 Metzgergasse to go what that 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.040
 well-known problem is with the map 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.180
 besides, I actually know 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.570
 I had to work because I was so 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.460
 long to record so here 30 degrees times 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.719
 straight line 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.059
 that's not really like that 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.969
 a nice part 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.969
 the 69 I unfortunately have with him 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.820
 I now have no upgrades except 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.260
 the spark I think would have as well as engine 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.160
 Miss and hold the next one and can 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.020
 without the first one I have none 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.789
 premium so I have ammunition earlier 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.640
 but that's what your target degree loads 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.170
 the one thing I'm running is the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.289
 normal standard ammunition 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.000
 prevention is right next to it the yes 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.369
 I just took with me because of the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.860
 but ultimately have 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.099
 I do not need that for a long time anyway 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 is indeed the t71 of local residents has 

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:32.890
 actually never really such problems 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.800
 and yes, here you can see it becomes one 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.130
 medium is bad with cfk 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.229
 hot 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.520
 Well, in any case, the next one is 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.530
 probably quite rancid and there I am 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.819
 probably in how to get relief 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.209
 with premier ammunition 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:54.239
 that means yes I have promised source 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.929
 save up 

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:57.929
 that was stupid now 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.479
 tvt uncool 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.060
 that is very uncool the tv she can be real 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.700
 play well tower I'm in charge 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.930
 after that should be best here 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.150
 return income under the has 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.050
 namely little sense if we are up there 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.010
 have to spend a lot of travel mini 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.450
 plays and some have on the ass 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.700
 maybe already seen with me here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.420
 the 69 I've been last yesterday 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.420
 driven in performance 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:49.000
 unfortunately here is the yes the cannon 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.070
 Do not go that far, not that way 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.770
 I want to go down no matter if I'm there 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:06.640
 a few required with us at one 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:09.120
 things and now keep a shot 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.120
 can 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.370
 oh come there what should that because I have 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.510
 Degree 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.049
 I do not know, I do not drive 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.390
 should we then system further one 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.799
 advisory council 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.290
 I want to help the team 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.989
 I would if that is again and 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.989
 comes out of it 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 well 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.269
 so now we have to see how washington 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:04:02.060
 so that I can hide a lot 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:03.890
 very handy she had to go back or 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.140
 deep in 40's will be apart 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:14.239
 taken yes that is in any case loose 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.989
 so it looks like takeover kasse was missing 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.630
 I almost knocked it out 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:29.240
 do not say anything anymore 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:33.100
 He also plays with distribute now 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.010
 hope that does not come through a pity 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.620
 Well that's just a magazine just fine 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.650
 In such a situation, you can still 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.240
 a lot of damage raushauen 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.580
 Of course this is something real here 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.169
 shit though it works 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.970
 I would very badly played a 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.450
 I do not see it as practical if 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.660
 the team advances out of him with him 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.660
 was 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.710
 who is now also it has there 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.330
 still the ddr it is here namely the 2 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.660
 he sits behind the atx mainboard 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.130
 Logical me if I want you now I 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.080
 now my praise is short i mean 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.490
 although dkv because then the iso alter.de 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.590
 is not hit 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.190
 that's right now shoot at de 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.650
 damn that's what he would have done earlier 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.120
 the isovic and he should do more 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.210
 would then have had without map 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.289
 maybe almost all of them can cool 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.880
 whoever dies may bring that 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.789
 once the team extremely much because you 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:43.160
 really many do not live here anymore 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:48.289
 also completely thoughtless so the opponent in 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.880
 The situation is just banal and so on 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.389
 the honest left looks it too 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.389
 banal 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.150
 it is asked for 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.789
 well before the car have already I 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.379
 I do not have that much time right now 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.099
 i am sorry i have master marksmen 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:14.930
 get second best 1600 damage 13 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:19.370
 shot 13 hits from 10,000 received yes 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.710
 not really good but well i would 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.219
 I can say 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.710
 that was not up to me yes which one 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:29.840
 That's why I'm doing drinks now 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.159
 equals boring already relatively late 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.620
 and I have to upload that change 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:37.520
 and I do not always want to 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:41.180
 always late soy and the live stream 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.940
 goes from 21 o'clock to 21 30 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.409
 I extended it then you are 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.409
 not even if you see yourself and killed
