 idea of ​​the size of the 20 ships that already

 they have a model without counting the variants 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.930
 of course now it would be a good idea 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.150
 try to compare these measures with 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.660
 boats trucks or planes we can 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.460
 see in our day to day 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.110
 I hope this information has been 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.190
 of utility little by little we will give you 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.530
 the new ships that we have 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.530
 available we see in the stars
