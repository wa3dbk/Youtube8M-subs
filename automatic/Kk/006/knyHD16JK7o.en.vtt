00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 gas and foam gets more and more 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.660
 the spread of the organizers following the new 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 consumer trends galen 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 offered his solution to enhance 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.220
 energy efficiency of buildings from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.079
 porous finely piece material 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.390
 basalt plastic flexible ties for 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.680
 aerated concrete 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.750
 flexible connection for aerated concrete company 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.640
 galen represent but 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.239
 plastic rod with sand 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 coated 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.469
 and also screw part executed for 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 impact resistant frost resistant bullets yes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.809
 what advantages consider themselves given 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.699
 flexible connection is ease of installation 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.219
 availability low thermal conductivity 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.870
 highly corrosion resistant flexible 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.239
 galen connections intended for 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.399
 brick facing compounds 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.069
 to the inner wall and from aerated concrete and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.100
 other porous materials represent 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.350
 a round rod diameter 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.479
 6 millimeters with molded screw 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.710
 anchor at the end 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.960
 the surface of the rod has sandy 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.630
 spraying which contributes to the best 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.729
 adhesion with mortar new 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.710
 A kind of flexible galen bonds is applicable as 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.649
 for double layer it is three layer 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.939
 structures with internal insulation 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.020
 installation and communication for aerated concrete 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.990
 performed in the next 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 sequences on cured gas 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.880
 the concrete wall mark the place of drilling 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.399
 hem hole connection so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 so after installing the flexible connection in 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.710
 aerated concrete block its end with sandy 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.530
 the dust turned into light to us 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.469
 facing layer then drill with 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 drill with a diameter of 10 millimeters 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.799
 drill holes 100 depth 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.920
 millimeter hole obtained 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.909
 blow dust from the pear further into the finished 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 insert hole 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.679
 from the end and flexible connection with the anchor when 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.320
 using the key anchor twist all the way 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.450
 at the same time the anchor sleeve must be 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.149
 completely immersed in aerated concrete block 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.700
 then if erected wall represents 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.009
 a three-layer construction on 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.580
 established flexible connections are fixed 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.500
 insulation if the enclosing structure 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.870
 double layer then sandy end flexible 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 connection immediately mounts in mortar joints 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.330
 facing layer recommended depth 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.810
 flexible termination gal 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.150
 on the bearing wall and in the facing layer 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.610
 90 millimeters amount of connection 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.710
 determined by the project usually one 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.860
 square meter wall requires at least 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.930
 5 products application of flexible connections galen 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.030
 for aerated concrete give a number 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.820
 benefits both under construction 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.980
 so in the course of operation among them 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.910
 reliable fastening of the facing layer to 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 supporting wall 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.380
 improving the energy efficiency of the building and 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.170
 temperature uniformity of elements 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.660
 designs to improve the heat of the humid 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.080
 operating modes with flexible 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.220
 communication galen much more accessible 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.220
