going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.730> run<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> website

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.830 

we'll<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.130> go<00:00:47.310> to<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.940> los<00:00:48.180> angeles<00:00:48.450> time

three<00:00:51.840> two<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:58.790> okay<00:00:59.790> so<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.090> pretty<00:01:00.239> close

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
three two one okay so it's pretty close

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.660 
three two one okay so it's pretty close
but<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> 4s<00:01:01.440> end<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.980> coming<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.460> winning

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and the 4s is still struggling to even

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.000 
and the 4s is still struggling to even
open<00:03:09.319> up<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.680> app<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.650> let<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.830> go<00:03:12.860> and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
power on and power off test we'll see

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.699 
power on and power off test we'll see
how<00:03:28.760> Allen<00:03:29.630> taste<00:03:29.780> turn<00:03:30.080> off<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.380> turn<00:03:30.440> back

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.550 

ok<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:46.569> 4s<00:03:46.930> did<00:03:47.110> actually<00:03:47.260> turn<00:03:47.530> off

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
ok so the 4s did actually turn off

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.940 
ok so the 4s did actually turn off
faster<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.989> we'll<00:03:49.989> just<00:03:50.020> see<00:03:50.349> how<00:03:50.530> this<00:03:50.650> goes

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
faster so we'll just see how this goes

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.530 
faster so we'll just see how this goes
the<00:03:51.340> five<00:03:51.550> might<00:03:51.790> be<00:03:51.910> doing<00:03:52.120> update<00:03:52.270> or

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
the five might be doing update or

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.890 
the five might be doing update or
something<00:03:57.090> ok<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.150> they'll<00:03:58.330> turn<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> map<00:03:58.780> on

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
something ok so they'll turn the map on

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.949 
something ok so they'll turn the map on
now<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> apple<00:04:04.120> logo<00:04:04.150> can<00:04:04.600> run<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> lot

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
now so the apple logo can run a lot

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.559 
now so the apple logo can run a lot
faster<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.800> five<00:04:06.190> but<00:04:07.180> we'll<00:04:07.270> just<00:04:07.420> see
