offseason to put a team together that we

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.930 
offseason to put a team together that we

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.499 
think we can be competitive in the
league<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.490> we<00:00:14.490> spent<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.089> time<00:00:15.210> on

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
league and and we spent a lot of time on

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.880 
league and and we spent a lot of time on
it<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.680> we've<00:00:16.830> picked<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.510> specific

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
it we think we've picked pretty specific

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.929 
it we think we've picked pretty specific
characters<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.039> types<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> players<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
characters and types of players that we

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.210 
characters and types of players that we
want<00:00:21.150> em<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:22.170> terms<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> our<00:00:22.680> style<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.039> play

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
want em in terms of our style of play

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.580 
want em in terms of our style of play
and<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.519> think<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.869> hope<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.380> can

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and I think what we hope that we can

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
and I think what we hope that we can
obviously<00:00:26.279> put<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.550> right<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.849> field<00:00:27.029> and

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
obviously put it right on the field and

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.750 
obviously put it right on the field and
that<00:00:27.599> starts<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.080> Sunday<00:00:28.470> Boston<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.229 
on Sunday am no much have they been part
of<00:00:36.420> presume<00:00:36.950> yes<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.520> difficult<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of presume yes it's difficult with the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
of presume yes it's difficult with the
national<00:00:39.540> team<00:00:39.570> players<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.440> know

there's<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.860> much<00:00:41.070> commitment<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.940> with

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
there's so much commitment for them with

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.209 
there's so much commitment for them with
the<00:00:42.300> algarve<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.140> they're<00:00:43.829> friendlies

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the algarve and then they're friendlies

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.790 
the algarve and then they're friendlies
that<00:00:44.579> they've<00:00:44.730> just<00:00:44.969> had<00:00:45.149> coming<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.800> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that they've just had coming up and but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.680 
that they've just had coming up and but
we<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.489> managed<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.789> get<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.090> 12<00:00:48.450> days

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we got we managed to get about 12 days

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
we got we managed to get about 12 days
in<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> practice<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:49.980> them<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.460> great

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
in of practice with them which was great

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.860 
in of practice with them which was great
and<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.899> think<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.820> that's<00:00:54.390> always<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and I think you know that's always a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.410 
and I think you know that's always a
difficult<00:00:55.199> part<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
difficult part is that we get them a

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
difficult part is that we get them a
very<00:00:57.719> limited<00:00:58.020> time<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.710> before<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.160> game

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
very limited time just before the game

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
very limited time just before the game
and<00:00:59.730> my<00:01:00.390> biggest<00:01:00.780> hope<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.260> they<00:01:01.440> will

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and my biggest hope is that they will

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.810 
and my biggest hope is that they will
come<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.859> fit<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.160> healthy<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.460> if<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.760> do

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
come back fit and healthy and if they do

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.410 
come back fit and healthy and if they do
then<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.719> huge<00:01:04.439> bonus<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:05.010> us<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this first season and hopefully we can

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.810 
this first season and hopefully we can
build<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> moving<00:01:56.969> forward

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.639 

leagues<00:02:01.820> is<00:02:01.969> it<00:02:02.149> I<00:02:02.450> mean<00:02:02.719> it's<00:02:03.049> nice<00:02:03.319> that<00:02:03.380> they

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
leagues is it I mean it's nice that they

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.469 
leagues is it I mean it's nice that they
her<00:02:03.740> back<00:02:03.950> for<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.249> second<00:02:04.579> season<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.999> even

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
her back for a second season and even

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.660 
her back for a second season and even
apparently<00:02:05.990> growing<00:02:06.499> yeah<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.219> sure<00:02:07.280> you

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
apparently growing yeah for sure you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.969 
apparently growing yeah for sure you
know<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.360> expand<00:02:08.869> in<00:02:09.049> the<00:02:09.080> first<00:02:09.410> season<00:02:09.619> is

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
know it to expand in the first season is

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.039 
know it to expand in the first season is
huge<00:02:10.310> i<00:02:10.610> think<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.120> structure<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.900> league

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
huge i think the structure of the league

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.190 
huge i think the structure of the league
is<00:02:12.290> something<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> sustainable<00:02:13.730> model

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
is something that is a sustainable model

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.479 
is something that is a sustainable model
and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.950> from<00:02:16.190> being<00:02:16.370> in

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
and I think you know from being in

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.180 
and I think you know from being in
meetings<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:16.940> offices<00:02:17.299> and<00:02:17.510> everyone's

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
meetings in the offices and everyone's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.309 
meetings in the offices and everyone's
invested<00:02:19.190> in<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.459> from<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.510> financial<00:02:20.690> point<00:02:21.170> of

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
invested in it from a financial point of

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.720 
invested in it from a financial point of
view<00:02:21.379> as<00:02:21.620> well<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:21.920> on<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.190> field<00:02:22.370> point<00:02:22.610> of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
view as well as on the field point of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.369 
view as well as on the field point of
view<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.150> think<00:02:23.180> that's<00:02:23.629> going<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:24.019> huge

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
view and I think that's going to be huge

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.250 
view and I think that's going to be huge
for<00:02:24.650> this<00:02:25.160> league<00:02:25.370> moving<00:02:25.730> forward<00:02:26.090> it's<00:02:26.599> in

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
for this league moving forward it's in

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.949 
for this league moving forward it's in
my<00:02:27.530> opinion<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.489> US<00:02:28.819> is<00:02:29.060> there<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.629> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
my opinion the US is there is the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.080 
my opinion the US is there is the
biggest<00:02:30.170> country<00:02:31.010> for<00:02:31.190> succor<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.849> fact

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
biggest country for succor and the fact

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.490 
biggest country for succor and the fact
that<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.299> has<00:02:32.450> another<00:02:32.660> sustainable<00:02:33.349> league

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that it has another sustainable league

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.589 
that it has another sustainable league
is<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.829> shame<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.790> think<00:02:34.879> it's<00:02:35.150> everybody's

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
is a shame and I think it's everybody's

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.910 
is a shame and I think it's everybody's
responsibility<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:36.379> make<00:02:36.530> sure<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.799> happens

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
responsibility to make sure that happens

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.710 
responsibility to make sure that happens
so<00:02:37.549> why<00:02:37.849> do<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.000> think<00:02:38.090> there's<00:02:38.510> such<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so why do you think there's such a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.479 
so why do you think there's such a
salary<00:02:39.200> disparity<00:02:39.739> between<00:02:39.829> that<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.220> ladies

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
salary disparity between that the ladies

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.910 
salary disparity between that the ladies
can<00:02:40.670> get<00:02:40.760> paid<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.120> Europe<00:02:41.390> versus<00:02:41.720> here<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.590> I

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
can get paid in Europe versus here and I

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.520 
can get paid in Europe versus here and I
said<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.280> before<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.670> think<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.989> reality

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
said this before I think the the reality

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.160 
said this before I think the the reality
of<00:02:45.560> European<00:02:46.280> football<00:02:47.000> was<00:02:47.269> when<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> WPS

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
of European football was when the WPS

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.699 
of European football was when the WPS
came<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.739> which<00:02:49.250> had<00:02:49.459> huge<00:02:49.790> salaries<00:02:50.709> Europe

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
came in which had huge salaries Europe

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.680 
came in which had huge salaries Europe
had<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.040> try<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.459> create<00:02:52.700> an<00:02:53.030> environment<00:02:53.299> and

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
had to try and create an environment and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.780 
had to try and create an environment and
a<00:02:53.810> market<00:02:54.260> where<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.560> could<00:02:54.829> attract<00:02:55.609> the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
a market where they could attract the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.569 
a market where they could attract the
WPS<00:02:56.329> players<00:02:56.629> back<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.980> then<00:02:58.220> that's

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
WPS players back and then that's

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.509 
WPS players back and then that's
counteracted<00:02:59.239> now<00:02:59.420> whereas<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.530> NWSL<00:03:01.190> is<00:03:01.340> put

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
counteracted now whereas the NWSL is put

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.710 
counteracted now whereas the NWSL is put
in<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.730> salary<00:03:02.090> structure<00:03:02.420> which<00:03:02.690> is

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
in a salary structure which is

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.410 
in a salary structure which is
sustainable<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.459> find<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.030> Europe

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
sustainable and as you find it in Europe

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.059 
sustainable and as you find it in Europe
clubs<00:03:05.840> can't<00:03:06.079> sustain<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.709> amount<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.010> money

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
clubs can't sustain the amount of money

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.860 
clubs can't sustain the amount of money
that<00:03:07.280> they're<00:03:07.519> having<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.819> pay<00:03:08.000> out<00:03:08.120> and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
that they're having to pay out and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.220 
that they're having to pay out and
there's<00:03:09.650> only<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.950> few<00:03:10.400> clubs<00:03:11.049> globally<00:03:12.049> who

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
there's only a few clubs globally who

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.949 
there's only a few clubs globally who
can<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.859> and<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:14.090> think<00:03:14.120> you'll<00:03:14.450> see<00:03:14.660> in

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
can do that and I think you'll see in

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.180 
can do that and I think you'll see in
the<00:03:15.079> next<00:03:15.200> couple<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.560> years<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.980> that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the next couple of years that that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.460 
the next couple of years that that
market<00:03:16.639> will<00:03:16.730> even<00:03:17.000> itself<00:03:17.239> out<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.750> I<00:03:18.200> think

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
market will even itself out and I think

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.770
