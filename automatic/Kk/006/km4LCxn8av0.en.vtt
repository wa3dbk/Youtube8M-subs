also nice is that now when people call
you<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.750> incorporate<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you it actually will incorporate that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
you it actually will incorporate that
number<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.100> let's<00:01:23.280> say<00:01:23.430> Pizza<00:01:23.790> Hut<00:01:23.970> calls<00:01:24.330> you
