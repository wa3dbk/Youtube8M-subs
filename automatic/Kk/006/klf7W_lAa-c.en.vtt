right<00:00:17.270> but<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:17.900> 2012<00:00:18.800> is<00:00:19.099> just<00:00:19.520> one<00:00:19.820> step

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
right but the 2012 is just one step

important for us to carry over was the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.140 
important for us to carry over was the
engine<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.439> drivetrain<00:00:24.680> because<00:00:25.310> they<00:00:25.970> are
