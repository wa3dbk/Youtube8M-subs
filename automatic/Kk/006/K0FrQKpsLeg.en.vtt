00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 mushrooms for cooking this dish 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.510
 I certainly need a slow cooker and 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.330
 down product seasoning for 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.160
 potatoes for chicken onion which i 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.210

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.810
 plates and salted and added a little 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.970
 spice potatoes which I cut 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.060
 big enough pieces like you 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.150

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.300
 us at the very end of cooking and mushrooms 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.850
 this is my frozen refugee and so on 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 sleep still need of course bouts 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.040
 first thing ready sauce for this with 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.870
 I mix the plates with sour cream here 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:06.899
 100 grams a teaspoon of mustard bit 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.520
 seasoning for potatoes and our chopped 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.990
 dill and also added some salt 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.399
 mix until smooth and consistency 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.289
 in order for our little sauce to be 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.079
 a little more liquid i will add somewhere 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.210
 milliliters 50 water like this 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.130
 no longer needed because in the process 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.770
 cooking in the process of extinguishing in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.899
 the multicooker will stand out extra 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.299
 liquid which then will have to all 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.100
 equal to evaporate to the bottom of the pan from 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 multicookers I spread our pieces 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.969
 hens and basically nothing with her 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 did because she had a belly 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.020
 speak on pickled if you 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.420
 just cut fillets salt and his 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.189
 and add spices by the way the saucepan is not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.499
 must be oiled on top 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.369
 Chicken I spread mushrooms and here them already 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.369
 need to salt 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.329
 on top of the mushrooms lay our onion for now 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:04.189
 everything is done in layers and does not mix 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.280
 over the onion already laying out our potatoes 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:13.880
 and here you need to add a little more 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 salt to potatoes did not work 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.209
 fresh and spices for potatoes i 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.610
 I use here such at the right end of 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.930
 my 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.299
 Kamensky miss I do not know how to but 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.470
 there is no glutamate sodium that's great and 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:35.480
 on top of the potatoes I water 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.340
 cooked sauce and here is our 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 prepare not process complete 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.980
 close the cover multicooker choose 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:48.349
 quenching mode and I will put at 1:30 passed 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 one and a half hours the slow cooker switched 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:57.530
 the heating mode is turned off and on 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.769
 re- select the baking menu and start 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.560
 the fact is that inside is big enough 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.989
 the amount of liquid you need to evaporate it and 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.989
 a little our braised potatoes stew 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.410
 it is for more flavor and flavor 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.330
 such a beautiful crust I add here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.220
 grated cheese 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.320
 after the time our dish is ready 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.960
 look how rosy it turned out 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.970
 chicken this potato with chicken with mushrooms 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.890
 very fond of our family and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.370
 is a skin dish on 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.590
