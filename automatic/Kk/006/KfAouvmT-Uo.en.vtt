going to try to upgrade it it's going to
be<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.269> think<00:00:38.840> it's<00:00:38.930> gonna<00:00:39.019> be<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.199> little<00:00:39.500> bit<00:00:39.710> of

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
be I think it's gonna be a little bit of

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.680 
be I think it's gonna be a little bit of
money<00:00:39.830> I<00:00:40.250> think<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:40.790> have<00:00:40.879> to<00:00:41.000> get<00:00:41.150> a<00:00:41.180> new<00:00:41.269> case

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
money I think I have to get a new case

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.380 
money I think I have to get a new case
so<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.589> am<00:00:42.890> kind<00:00:43.129> of<00:00:43.159> preparing<00:00:43.549> for<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:43.879> I<00:00:43.909> know

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
so I am kind of preparing for it I know

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.880 
so I am kind of preparing for it I know
that<00:00:44.690> I'm<00:00:44.780> not<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.049> greatest<00:00:45.170> mouse<00:00:45.620> and

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:48.769 
keyboard users so I ended up using my

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.490 
keyboard users so I ended up using my
xbox<00:00:49.400> 360<00:00:50.000> controller<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.629> was<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.809> USB<00:00:51.350> one

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.880 
like using semi-auto but anyway so yeah
so<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.930> whole<00:01:42.050> point<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.500> series<00:01:42.770> would

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
so the whole point of the series would

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.830 
so the whole point of the series would
be<00:01:42.950> like<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.190> beta<00:01:43.460> testing<00:01:43.970> type<00:01:44.180> thing<00:01:44.420> the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
be like a beta testing type thing the
