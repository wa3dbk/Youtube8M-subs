bonk the wall which I see in the air as

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.729 
bonk the wall which I see in the air as
long<00:04:02.470> as<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.739> can<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.989> is<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> nice<00:04:05.440> looking

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
long as I can that is a nice looking

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.089 
long as I can that is a nice looking
glider<00:04:06.250> there<00:04:06.640> I<00:04:06.910> like<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.780> even<00:04:08.650> though<00:04:08.739> even

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
glider there I like it even though even

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:10.979 
glider there I like it even though even
if<00:04:09.220> its<00:04:09.340> stats<00:04:09.610> are<00:04:09.849> bad<00:04:10.150> it's<00:04:10.450> transparent

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
if its stats are bad it's transparent

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.979 
if its stats are bad it's transparent
but<00:04:11.829> even<00:04:12.040> if<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.250> stats<00:04:12.549> aren't<00:04:13.420> as<00:04:13.750> good<00:04:13.930> as

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
but even if it stats aren't as good as

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.870 
but even if it stats aren't as good as
some<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.739> other<00:04:14.890> gliders<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:15.579> think<00:04:15.819> I

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
some of the other gliders I think I

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.250 
some of the other gliders I think I
might<00:04:16.060> just<00:04:16.180> use<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.660> because<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:20.200> really

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
might just use it because it's really

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.409 
might just use it because it's really
nice<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.590> have<00:04:22.080> sorry<00:04:23.080> my<00:04:23.229> camera<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:24.419> don't

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
nice to have sorry my camera I don't

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.879 
nice to have sorry my camera I don't
really<00:04:25.570> care<00:04:25.780> if<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.020> win<00:04:26.200> or<00:04:26.260> lose<00:04:26.380> even<00:04:26.770> though

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
really care if I win or lose even though

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.210 
really care if I win or lose even though
I<00:04:26.919> am<00:04:27.130> in<00:04:27.250> way<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:27.580> first<00:04:27.970> I'm<00:04:28.960> uh<00:04:29.050> apparently<00:04:29.950> I

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
I am in way in first I'm uh apparently I

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.410 
I am in way in first I'm uh apparently I
picked<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.810> 50cc<00:04:31.810> yeah<00:04:32.260> that's<00:04:32.650> probably<00:04:32.740> why

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.660 

yeah<00:04:37.050> I'm<00:04:37.620> having<00:04:37.860> a<00:04:37.980> hard<00:04:38.130> time<00:04:38.160> recording

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
yeah I'm having a hard time recording

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.660 
yeah I'm having a hard time recording
gold<00:04:38.850> ever<00:04:39.680> yeah<00:04:40.680> I<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:40.950> really<00:04:41.070> care<00:04:41.430> if<00:04:41.460> I

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
gold ever yeah I don't really care if I

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.650 
gold ever yeah I don't really care if I
even<00:04:42.320> get<00:04:43.320> coins<00:04:43.620> now<00:04:43.950> I<00:04:44.340> mean<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.850> only<00:04:45.480> need

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
even get coins now I mean I only need

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.890 
even get coins now I mean I only need
him<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.840> speed<00:04:46.110> up<00:04:46.260> now<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.400> don't<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.480> don't<00:04:48.540> have

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
him to speed up now I don't I don't have

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.580 
him to speed up now I don't I don't have
any<00:04:49.260> reason<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.620> collect<00:04:49.950> him<00:04:50.070> now

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.910 

I<00:04:53.600> think<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> pretty<00:04:55.350> good<00:04:55.590> challenge

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
I think it is a pretty good challenge

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.240 
I think it is a pretty good challenge
getting<00:04:56.490> 10,000<00:04:57.120> coins<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.540> 10,000<00:04:58.320> VR<00:04:58.620> well

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
getting 10,000 coins and 10,000 VR well

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.670 
getting 10,000 coins and 10,000 VR well
of<00:04:59.730> course<00:04:59.760> there<00:05:00.150> is<00:05:00.240> optional<00:05:00.780> ways<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.230> get

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
of course there is optional ways to get

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.410 
of course there is optional ways to get
these<00:05:01.860> parts<00:05:02.430> but<00:05:04.940> again<00:05:05.940> I'm<00:05:06.030> just<00:05:06.180> taking

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
these parts but again I'm just taking

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.550 
these parts but again I'm just taking
this<00:05:06.540> path<00:05:06.720> because<00:05:06.900> I<00:05:07.080> want<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.320> use<00:05:07.440> the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
this path because I want to use the

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.990 
this path because I want to use the
glider<00:05:07.770> oops<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:12.270> then<00:05:12.480> go<00:05:12.750> on<00:05:12.900> that<00:05:13.080> air

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
glider oops and then go on that air
