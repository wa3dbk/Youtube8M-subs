00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
let's say type here's the button it's I

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.840 
let's say type here's the button it's I
have<00:01:46.000> polypropylene<00:01:46.600> around<00:01:47.170> all<00:01:47.500> around<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
have polypropylene around all around the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.920 
have polypropylene around all around the
edge<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.420> inside<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:50.050> hidden<00:01:50.230> and

kind of makes a wedge in there and the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.310 
kind of makes a wedge in there and the
iPad<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.300> shock<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.900> dropped<00:02:54.140> on

iPad the the shock if it's dropped on
this<00:02:54.410> end<00:02:54.709> isn't<00:02:55.400> gonna<00:02:55.760> hit<00:02:56.690> isn't<00:02:57.230> gonna<00:02:57.530> be

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
this end isn't gonna hit isn't gonna be

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.170 
this end isn't gonna hit isn't gonna be
transferred<00:02:57.980> directly<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.520> iPad<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.030> has

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
transferred directly to the iPad it has

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.670 
transferred directly to the iPad it has
to<00:02:59.330> go<00:02:59.450> through<00:02:59.600> here<00:02:59.810> this<00:03:00.020> has<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.260> slide

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
to go through here this has to slide

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.580 
to go through here this has to slide
down<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.250> then<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.959> a<00:03:03.020> wedge<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.410> there

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.830 
down and then it and a wedge in there
and<00:03:03.800> then<00:03:04.070> it<00:03:04.220> would<00:03:04.489> transfer<00:03:04.970> but<00:03:05.180> if<00:03:05.390> it's

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
and then it would transfer but if it's

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.140 
and then it would transfer but if it's
just<00:03:05.930> if<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.800> have<00:03:06.890> a<00:03:06.950> case<00:03:07.160> that<00:03:07.459> goes<00:03:07.790> and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
just if you have a case that goes and

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.300 
just if you have a case that goes and
it's<00:03:08.600> right<00:03:08.840> along<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.200> edge<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.890> shock<00:03:10.130> will

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
it's right along the edge the shock will

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.710 
it's right along the edge the shock will
transfer<00:03:10.730> it'll<00:03:11.239> keep<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.510> from<00:03:11.540> eating

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
transfer it'll keep it from eating

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.870 
transfer it'll keep it from eating
scratch<00:03:12.050> but<00:03:12.380> in<00:03:12.470> your<00:03:12.950> case<00:03:13.220> may<00:03:13.430> not<00:03:13.580> keep<00:03:13.730> it

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.020 
scratch but in your case may not keep it
from<00:03:14.000> getting<00:03:14.350> destroyed<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.920> I've<00:03:16.820> got<00:03:16.970> this

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
from getting destroyed so I've got this

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.150 
from getting destroyed so I've got this
little<00:03:17.209> buffer<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:17.750> here<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.770> then<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.130> have

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
little buffer in here and then you have

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.220 
little buffer in here and then you have
an<00:03:19.549> eighth<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.850> an<00:03:19.970> inch<00:03:20.030> between<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:20.840> edge<00:03:21.019> of

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
an eighth of an inch between the edge of

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.420 
an eighth of an inch between the edge of
the<00:03:21.320> leather<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.799> stitching<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:22.280> that's

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
the leather and the stitching and that's

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.479 
the leather and the stitching and that's
also<00:03:22.760> another<00:03:22.910> buffer<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:24.010> if<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.160> happen<00:03:25.459> to

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
oh this also check this out my niece she

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.870 
oh this also check this out my niece she
likes<00:03:30.920> typing<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:33.010> let's<00:03:34.010> say<00:03:34.190> she

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
likes typing like this so let's say she

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.770 
likes typing like this so let's say she
likes<00:03:35.090> typing<00:03:35.450> like<00:03:35.570> this<00:03:37.000> she'll<00:03:38.000> do<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.660> do
