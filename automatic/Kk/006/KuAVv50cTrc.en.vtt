okay<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.610> me<00:02:43.880> clearly<00:02:44.300> HTC<00:02:45.170> one<00:02:45.350> was<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
okay to me clearly HTC one was the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.160 
okay to me clearly HTC one was the
loudest<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.280> then<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.330> substance<00:02:47.750> is<00:02:47.870> for

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
loudest and then the substance is for

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.800 
loudest and then the substance is for
second<00:02:48.620> experience<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.820> not<00:02:50.270> really<00:02:50.630> good

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
second experience that not really good

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.390 
second experience that not really good
sound<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.170> think<00:02:51.380> not<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.710> good<00:02:51.920> speaker<00:02:52.070> quality

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
sound I think not a good speaker quality

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.360 
sound I think not a good speaker quality
so<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.390> HTC<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:53.870> takes<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> first<00:02:54.740> part<00:02:55.220> of

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
so the HTC one takes the first part of

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.670
