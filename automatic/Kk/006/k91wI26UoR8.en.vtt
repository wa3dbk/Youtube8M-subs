wonderfully unique car and that's why I

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
love it and it's made by coil in the
game<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> coil<00:00:49.050> brawler<00:00:49.440> which<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
game the coil brawler which is

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
game the coil brawler which is
interesting<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.390> electric

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
interesting because it's not an electric

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.799 
interesting because it's not an electric
car<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.460> think<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:53.969> Tesla<00:00:54.660> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
car but I I think that Tesla are

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.360 
car but I I think that Tesla are
actually<00:00:55.140> making<00:00:55.410> something<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> looks

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
actually making something that looks

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
actually making something that looks
similar<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.809> probably<00:00:58.109> without<00:00:58.289> all

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
similar to this but probably without all

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
similar to this but probably without all
the<00:00:58.770> sort<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> fancy<00:01:00.199> 4x4<00:01:01.199> wheels<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.949> stuff

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the sort of fancy 4x4 wheels and stuff

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
the sort of fancy 4x4 wheels and stuff
like<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.300> car<00:01:03.629> shape<00:01:03.930> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like that but I think this car shape is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
like that but I think this car shape is
something<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> Tesla<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.760> bringing<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.240> but

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
something that Tesla is bringing out but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
something that Tesla is bringing out but
I<00:01:06.450> could<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> completely<00:01:07.260> wrong<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
I could be completely wrong if this is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.740 
I could be completely wrong if this is
actually<00:01:08.220> based<00:01:08.460> on<00:01:08.670> something<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.240> I'm

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
actually based on something and I'm

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.140 
actually based on something and I'm
wrong<00:01:10.320> again<00:01:10.500> let<00:01:11.280> me<00:01:11.400> know<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.790> comment

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
is as basic as you would expect it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.200 
is as basic as you would expect it's
another<00:01:33.570> generic<00:01:34.200> interior<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> shame

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
another generic interior bit of a shame

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
another generic interior bit of a shame
but<00:01:36.689> again<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.200> don't<00:01:37.259> think<00:01:37.439> I'm<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:38.340> always<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
but again I don't think I'm I'm always a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
but again I don't think I'm I'm always a
bit<00:01:39.000> unsure<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> interiors<00:01:40.049> but<00:01:40.200> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
bit unsure about the interiors but I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.469 
bit unsure about the interiors but I
think<00:01:40.500> mods<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:41.130> probably<00:01:41.400> fix<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.180> stuff

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
think mods can probably fix that stuff

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
think mods can probably fix that stuff
in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> future<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.860> much<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.189> the

could<00:03:43.739> do<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:43.980> in<00:03:44.069> the<00:03:44.130> future<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.700> quite<00:03:45.569> like

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
could do that in the future I quite like

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.610

the<00:03:46.290> standard<00:03:46.739> wheels<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.609> be<00:03:47.730> fair<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:49.260> I

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
the standard wheels to be fair so I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.370 
the standard wheels to be fair so I
think<00:03:50.599> that<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.630> might<00:03:51.810> keep<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.139> with<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
think that I might keep it with the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.809 
think that I might keep it with the
standard<00:03:52.709> wheels<00:03:52.889> I<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.669> that's

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
standard wheels I think that that's

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.129 
standard wheels I think that that's
actually<00:03:54.030> gonna<00:03:54.359> look<00:03:54.540> better<00:03:54.780> because<00:03:54.989> I

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
actually gonna look better because I

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.339 
actually gonna look better because I
want<00:03:55.440> all<00:03:55.590> these<00:03:55.799> wheels<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.370> match

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
with the wheels but I think it's just

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.020 
with the wheels but I think it's just
gonna<00:04:01.500> be<00:04:01.620> letter-writing<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.609> stuff<00:04:02.849> which

why

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.219 
why
I'm<00:04:24.099> thinking<00:04:24.639> army<00:04:25.240> colors<00:04:25.599> although<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.930> knew

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
I'm thinking army colors although I knew

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.650 
I'm thinking army colors although I knew
I<00:04:26.500> loved<00:04:27.039> that<00:04:27.069> color<00:04:27.639> I<00:04:27.940> love<00:04:28.360> all<00:04:28.509> these

green<00:04:31.569> foliage<00:04:31.930> green<00:04:32.349> olive<00:04:32.949> drab<00:04:33.490> dark

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
green foliage green olive drab dark

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.890 
green foliage green olive drab dark
earth<00:04:34.419> desert<00:04:35.080> tan<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:36.000> think<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.120> desert<00:04:37.599> tan

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
earth desert tan I think it desert tan

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.170 
earth desert tan I think it desert tan
maybe<00:04:38.289> it's<00:04:39.069> good<00:04:39.220> for<00:04:39.310> desert<00:04:39.639> tan<00:04:39.879> and

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
maybe it's good for desert tan and

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.550 
maybe it's good for desert tan and
that's<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.629> we<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:40.840> get<00:04:40.900> on<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.169> secondary

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
that's it we can get on the secondary

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.939 
that's it we can get on the secondary
color

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
color

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.809 
color
I'm<00:04:42.430> thinking<00:04:43.150> maybe<00:04:43.389> dark<00:04:43.810> earth<00:04:44.639> that's<00:04:45.639> not

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
I'm thinking maybe dark earth that's not

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.610 
I'm thinking maybe dark earth that's not
bad<00:04:46.000> or<00:04:46.270> we<00:04:46.360> can<00:04:46.479> go<00:04:46.599> for<00:04:46.629> like<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.930> olive<00:04:47.199> drab

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
bad or we can go for like a olive drab

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.760 
bad or we can go for like a olive drab
