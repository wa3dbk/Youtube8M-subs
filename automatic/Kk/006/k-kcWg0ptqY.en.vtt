worms but the tomatoes they'll get hit
pretty<00:01:33.360> hard<00:01:33.659> by<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> tomato<00:01:34.950> hornworm<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
pretty hard by the tomato hornworm and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249 
pretty hard by the tomato hornworm and
that<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.299> eggplants<00:01:36.810> really<00:01:37.079> don't

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that and the eggplants really don't

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
that and the eggplants really don't
stand<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.650> chance<00:01:37.680> unless<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:39.270> them<00:01:39.390> when

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
stand a chance unless you get them when

stand a chance unless you get them when
they're<00:01:39.570> bigger<00:01:40.100> because<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.820> put<00:01:42.030> them

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
they're bigger because if you put them

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
they're bigger because if you put them
out<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> elements<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.680> they're<00:01:43.799> too

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that might be true right now but get

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.330 
that might be true right now but get
into<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.019> habit<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.319> using<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.950> get<00:02:35.160> into

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
into the habit of using that get into

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.240 
into the habit of using that get into
the<00:02:35.430> habit<00:02:35.519> of<00:02:35.760> using<00:02:36.000> aloe<00:02:36.360> vera<00:02:36.920> that's<00:02:37.920> a

but<00:03:43.970> these<00:03:44.970> are<00:03:45.180> all<00:03:45.209> really<00:03:45.569> big<00:03:45.840> around<00:03:46.079> me

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
but these are all really big around me

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.409 
but these are all really big around me
they<00:03:46.680> made<00:03:46.889> it<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.760> know<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> grapes<00:03:48.239> are

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
they made it you know the grapes are

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.240 
they made it you know the grapes are
doing<00:03:48.690> okay<00:03:48.989> peppers<00:03:49.560> are<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.859> pain<00:03:50.099> in<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
doing okay peppers are a pain in the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.220 
doing okay peppers are a pain in the
butt<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.489> got<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.819> watch<00:03:50.940> those<00:03:51.239> eggplants

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
butt you got to watch those eggplants

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.569 
butt you got to watch those eggplants
every<00:03:52.410> couple<00:03:52.590> days<00:03:52.799> you<00:03:53.010> got<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.220> go<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
every couple days you got to go out and

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.610 
every couple days you got to go out and
check<00:03:53.730> underneath<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> leaves<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.959> find

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
check underneath the leaves and and find

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.460 
check underneath the leaves and and find
the<00:03:55.739> worms<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.340> they're<00:03:56.879> just<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.470> prevalent

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
the worms and they're just so prevalent

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.059 
the worms and they're just so prevalent
they're<00:03:59.250> really<00:03:59.340> prevalent<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.980> know

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
they're really prevalent and you know

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.099 
they're really prevalent and you know
it's<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.669> is<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.180> desert<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.720> guess<00:04:03.900> there's

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
it's it is the desert I guess there's

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.110 
it's it is the desert I guess there's
not<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.319> lot<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.650> succulent<00:04:05.519> things<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.940> munch

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
not a lot of succulent things to munch

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.089 
not a lot of succulent things to munch
on<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.540> maybe<00:04:06.690> we're<00:04:07.260> more<00:04:07.440> vulnerable

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
on so maybe we're more vulnerable

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.789 
on so maybe we're more vulnerable
compared<00:04:08.849> to<00:04:08.879> Minnesota<00:04:09.389> I've<00:04:09.959> had<00:04:10.199> damage<00:04:10.650> in

hard core and they'll take raspberries

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.520 
hard core and they'll take raspberries

alive<00:05:00.950> in<00:05:00.980> his<00:05:01.250> greenhouse<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:02.000> believe<00:05:02.360> if<00:05:02.630> not

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
alive in his greenhouse I believe if not

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.110 
alive in his greenhouse I believe if not
he'll<00:05:03.110> bring<00:05:03.290> them<00:05:03.440> in<00:05:03.590> inside<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:05.030> winter

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120

he'll bring them in inside in the winter
time<00:05:05.419> but<00:05:06.260> he<00:05:06.800> sent<00:05:07.040> us<00:05:07.130> those<00:05:07.370> goji<00:05:07.730> berries

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
time but he sent us those goji berries

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.909 
time but he sent us those goji berries
and<00:05:08.390> we're<00:05:08.840> up<00:05:08.930> to<00:05:09.080> start<00:05:09.320> planning<00:05:09.470> more<00:05:09.800> of

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
and we're up to start planning more of

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.680 
and we're up to start planning more of
those<00:05:10.040> I'm<00:05:10.400> really<00:05:10.669> feeling<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.180> aloe<00:05:11.360> vera

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
those I'm really feeling the aloe vera

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.050 
those I'm really feeling the aloe vera
I'm<00:05:12.230> feeling<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:13.520> prickly<00:05:13.850> pear<00:05:14.030> cactus

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
I'm feeling the the prickly pear cactus

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.710 
I'm feeling the the prickly pear cactus
a<00:05:15.190> Basil's<00:05:16.190> doing<00:05:16.550> really<00:05:16.820> well<00:05:17.060> if<00:05:17.390> we<00:05:17.600> can

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
a Basil's doing really well if we can

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.870 
a Basil's doing really well if we can
get<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.050> grapes<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.950> established<00:05:19.610> and

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
get the grapes really established and

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.909 
get the grapes really established and
keep<00:05:20.090> them<00:05:20.270> going<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.810> think<00:05:21.410> they'll<00:05:21.590> really

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
keep them going I think they'll really

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.650 
keep them going I think they'll really
get<00:05:22.190> down<00:05:22.340> in<00:05:22.580> there<00:05:22.729> and<00:05:22.790> they<00:05:23.180> won't<00:05:23.360> need<00:05:23.479> so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
get down in there and they won't need so

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.690 
get down in there and they won't need so
much<00:05:23.780> watering<00:05:24.260> there's<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.190> lot<00:05:25.250> of<00:05:25.430> herbs

take that advantage now while we have it

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.900 
take that advantage now while we have it
because<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.010> going<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:16.160> be<00:06:16.280> really<00:06:16.580> hard

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
because it's going to be really hard

reasonable price this is a really good
time<00:06:34.789> to<00:06:35.060> start<00:06:35.300> implementing<00:06:35.810> some<00:06:36.169> of<00:06:36.200> these

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
time to start implementing some of these

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.160 
time to start implementing some of these
practices<00:06:36.980> it's<00:06:37.640> not<00:06:37.940> like<00:06:38.210> we<00:06:38.810> should<00:06:38.990> wait

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.170 
practices it's not like we should wait

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.630 
practices it's not like we should wait
around<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.800> even<00:06:40.070> though<00:06:40.160> it<00:06:40.280> doesn't<00:06:40.370> feel

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
around and even though it doesn't feel

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.070 
around and even though it doesn't feel
sustainable<00:06:41.300> because<00:06:41.480> we're<00:06:41.750> burning

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
sustainable because we're burning

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.470 
sustainable because we're burning
gasoline<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.860> drive<00:06:43.100> somewhere<00:06:43.430> and<00:06:43.790> and<00:06:43.940> to

gasoline to drive somewhere and and to
pick<00:06:44.690> up<00:06:44.810> mulch<00:06:45.140> and<00:06:45.820> you<00:06:46.820> know<00:06:46.910> using

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
pick up mulch and you know using

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.480 
pick up mulch and you know using
gasoline<00:06:48.710> to<00:06:49.310> mulch<00:06:50.030> all<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:50.390> chips<00:06:50.720> and<00:06:51.140> and

gasoline to mulch all the chips and and
you<00:06:52.490> know<00:06:52.610> maybe<00:06:52.970> you<00:06:53.680> know<00:06:54.680> drive<00:06:55.040> around

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
you know maybe you know drive around

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.100 
you know maybe you know drive around
whatever<00:06:55.550> it<00:06:55.940> doesn't<00:06:56.270> you<00:06:56.720> get<00:06:56.870> the<00:06:56.960> point

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
whatever it doesn't you get the point

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.560 
whatever it doesn't you get the point
it's<00:06:57.410> not<00:06:57.530> as<00:06:57.830> long-term<00:06:58.580> sustainable<00:06:59.360> as<00:06:59.450> it

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
it's not as long-term sustainable as it

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.820 
it's not as long-term sustainable as it
would<00:06:59.660> seem<00:06:59.870> but<00:06:59.900> you<00:07:00.080> just<00:07:00.260> have<00:07:00.380> to<00:07:00.500> set<00:07:00.710> up

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
would seem but you just have to set up

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.620 
would seem but you just have to set up
those<00:07:00.950> systems<00:07:01.400> and<00:07:01.820> start<00:07:02.150> working<00:07:02.270> with<00:07:02.510> the

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
those systems and start working with the

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.730 
those systems and start working with the
animals<00:07:03.020> you<00:07:03.740> know<00:07:03.830> chickens<00:07:04.310> bees<00:07:04.730> goats

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
animals you know chickens bees goats

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.020 
animals you know chickens bees goats
then<00:07:06.740> you<00:07:07.130> can<00:07:07.280> start<00:07:07.430> producing<00:07:07.700> your<00:07:07.970> own

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
then you can start producing your own

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.659 
then you can start producing your own
but<00:07:08.600> it's<00:07:08.870> it<00:07:09.290> takes<00:07:09.620> it<00:07:10.010> takes<00:07:10.070> some<00:07:10.460> time

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:10.669 
but it's it takes it takes some time

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:12.760 
but it's it takes it takes some time
especially<00:07:11.360> if<00:07:11.630> you<00:07:11.690> don't<00:07:11.870> have<00:07:12.050> a<00:07:12.080> lot<00:07:12.260> of<00:07:12.290> a

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.770 
especially if you don't have a lot of a

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.220 
especially if you don't have a lot of a
lot<00:07:13.730> of<00:07:13.880> manpower<00:07:14.150> and<00:07:14.660> you<00:07:14.750> can't<00:07:14.990> drive

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
lot of manpower and you can't drive
