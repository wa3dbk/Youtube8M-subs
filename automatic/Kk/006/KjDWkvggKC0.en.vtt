00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.020
 hi all friends with you one of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.120
 Today I will show you 10 of the rarest 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.250
 frames in the game five nights at freddy's 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 first and second part but when will 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 the third part is possible to do exactly 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.070
 the same videos on it and let's not 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.590
 unnecessary words begin tenth place 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.510
 pirate bay chamber 17 here you can 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.820
 will see the sign on it's plate 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.949
 my can only be seen once per 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 night when the fox goes to you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 the ninth place is camera 1 a from the first part 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.210
 games are very rare cases we can 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.320
 see how all three animatronics 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 looking straight at you 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.149
 8 place camera 11 in the second part of the game 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 here we can see like a puppet 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 climbs out of the box there is one more 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.989
 the frame on which the puppet is almost 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 got out of the box right after that 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.850
 frame puppet will attack you on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.539
 the seventh place is camera 4 a from the first part 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.399
 games 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.340
 here we can see on the sloping 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.960
 an abandoned crying boy but after 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.239
 the second part of the game everyone understood that this 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.309
 most likely a puppet and by the way that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.140
 the most interesting thing is that in part 1 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.479
 puppets did not exist at all she appeared 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 only in the second part also many people 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.830
 I think what a boy polish mini-game 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.540
 this is a puppet at all if you want 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.119
 learn about this story in more detail then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.979
 look on my channel video top 10 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.530
 legends of secrets in the game five nights at 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 freddy's link I will leave in the description well 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.799
 and move on to the sixth place is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.720
 animatronic 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.580
 whom is called the endoskeleton he 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.590
 is the endoskeleton head 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 without a suit by the way what Mr. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 discrete is almost the rarest 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
 character in the game the chance of his appearance 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.490
 examples but also one tenth percent workshop 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
 fifth place is Freddy's shadow in the workshop in 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
 The second part of the game is a very rare shot. 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.189
 and by the way if you look closely you can 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 will see what Freddie is painted 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.079
 purple color many it is connected 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.630
 somehow with a purple person but I even 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.820
 I don't know, maybe this is true as well 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.399
 maybe these are fall processes but in 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.140
 Anyway , if that's true, I think. 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 in part three of us some of this 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.299
 will also reveal that itâ€™s just 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.790
 the nation of the protagonist will return but in any 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.610
 If you see this frame then the game 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.979
 immediately take the fourth place camera 2 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.330
 both in the first part of the game are usually here 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.640
 depicted on the freddy's poster 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.950
 grafon but in very rare cases can 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.170
 will see how Freddie is pictured there 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.520
 which turn my head around 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.740
 my very creepy frame 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.440
 third place again from the first part of the game 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.360
 camera 4 she who we saw posters with 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.880
 crying baby is also possible here 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 will be in rare cases even in very 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.950
 rare cases see the writing on the wall 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.770
 and the media say that this is the rarest 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 frame in the first part of the game so the third 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.790
 second place is a paper man 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.140
 which appears in your office 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.930
 it is not clear where 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.570
 although no say where it came from I 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.340
 I can exactly the same figure we could 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.430
 see on the fourth chamber in the second 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.520
 parts of the game but there are frames where we see 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.380
 the fact that this figure has no meaning it 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.870
 somewhere disappeared in principle we know where 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.830
 most likely it appears just the same 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.650
 in our office 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.810
 but who removes it from there maybe 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.520
 she moves by the way many 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.630
 players say that it's these here 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.110
 paper figures 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.870
 these are animatronic figures one more 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.090
 interesting fact you can see the check 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.280
 which stands in place of this figure with 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.350
 hands apart therefore 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.750
 many players think that's what it is 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.080
 the check moved the paper figure to the office 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.090
 and finally first place 8 night and when i 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.890
 told you the release of the top 10 legend 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.709
 secret of five nights at freddy's there 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.380
 want to look but yes yes maybe 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.269
 met endoskeleton or say the same 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.760
 the inscription light media on the wall is much 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.660
 harder but how is this hidden 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 secret level 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.030
 very very cool so first place 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.610
