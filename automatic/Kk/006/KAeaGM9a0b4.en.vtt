however<00:01:12.590> are<00:01:12.860> responsible<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:13.729> muscle

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
however are responsible for muscle

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:23.859 
however are responsible for muscle
growth<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.899> recovery<00:01:21.159> if<00:01:22.159> you<00:01:22.399> eat<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:23.000> chicken

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
growth and recovery if you eat a chicken

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.690 
growth and recovery if you eat a chicken
or<00:01:24.049> fish<00:01:24.289> or<00:01:25.070> eggs<00:01:25.700> or<00:01:26.000> dairy<00:01:27.549> basically<00:01:28.549> what

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
or fish or eggs or dairy basically what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.800 
or fish or eggs or dairy basically what
happens<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.899> get<00:01:30.109> all<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.740> amino<00:01:31.070> acids

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
happens is you get all the amino acids

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.510 
happens is you get all the amino acids
required<00:01:32.810> in<00:01:33.140> order<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.710> stay<00:01:33.770> healthy<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
required in order to stay healthy and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.139 
required in order to stay healthy and
therefore<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.630> very<00:01:35.840> very<00:01:36.320> important

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
therefore it is very very important

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:40.450 
therefore it is very very important
however<00:01:38.149> straight<00:01:39.109> after<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.740> workout<00:01:40.219> or

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
however straight after you workout or

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.929 
however straight after you workout or
one<00:01:41.149> hunt<00:01:41.450> one<00:01:41.659> hour<00:01:41.899> pre-workout<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.640> need

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
one hunt one hour pre-workout you need

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.929 
one hunt one hour pre-workout you need
to<00:01:44.359> get<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.810> type<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.170> amino<00:01:45.829> acid<00:01:46.369> into<00:01:46.789> your

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.410 
acids responsible for muscle growth so
even<00:02:10.310> though<00:02:10.340> it's<00:02:10.520> important<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.210> eat

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
even though it's important to eat

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.590 
even though it's important to eat
natural<00:02:11.780> healthy<00:02:12.440> organic<00:02:12.860> food

natural healthy organic food

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.140 
natural healthy organic food
and<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:14.050> all<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.470> amino<00:02:14.650> acids<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.550> is<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> very

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and get all the amino acids it is a very

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.800 
and get all the amino acids it is a very
good<00:02:16.570> idea<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.260> have<00:02:17.290> your<00:02:17.710> whey<00:02:17.890> protein<00:02:18.810> ASAP

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
good idea to have your whey protein ASAP

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.140 
good idea to have your whey protein ASAP
after<00:02:19.990> training<00:02:20.550> probably<00:02:21.550> an<00:02:21.640> owl<00:02:21.760> or

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
after training probably an owl or

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.880 
after training probably an owl or
pre-training<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.290> takes<00:02:23.470> about<00:02:23.770> an

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
pre-training because it takes about an

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.130 
pre-training because it takes about an
hour<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.430> those<00:02:24.550> amino<00:02:24.850> acids<00:02:25.330> getting<00:02:25.990> your

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
hour for those amino acids getting your

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.830 
hour for those amino acids getting your
protein<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.890> peek<00:02:27.220> in<00:02:27.400> your<00:02:27.520> bloodstream<00:02:27.840> and

ASAP first thing in the morning when you

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.220 
ASAP first thing in the morning when you
wake<00:02:30.910> up<00:02:31.150> because<00:02:31.420> your<00:02:31.810> body's<00:02:32.080> been

you<00:02:36.370> want<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:37.930> guess<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.320> can't

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
you want to have it so I guess you can't

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.970 
you want to have it so I guess you can't
really<00:02:38.710> compare<00:02:39.340> your<00:02:39.790> whey<00:02:39.970> protein<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.720> food

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
really compare your whey protein to food

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.040 
really compare your whey protein to food
25<00:02:41.980> grams<00:02:42.340> from<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:42.910> whey<00:02:43.060> protein<00:02:43.540> source<00:02:43.810> will

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
25 grams from a whey protein source will

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.200 
25 grams from a whey protein source will
do<00:02:44.170> much<00:02:44.410> more<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:44.800> your<00:02:45.220> recovery<00:02:45.520> than

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
do much more for your recovery than

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.410 
do much more for your recovery than
having<00:02:46.540> 25<00:02:46.990> grams<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.560> food<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.120> when<00:02:49.270> people

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
having 25 grams of food so when people

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.240 
having 25 grams of food so when people
say<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> don't<00:02:50.200> need<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.380> whey<00:02:50.560> protein<00:02:51.010> source

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
say I don't need a whey protein source

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.890 
say I don't need a whey protein source
all<00:02:51.460> i<00:02:51.490> do<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:52.030> health<00:02:52.330> thing<00:02:52.420> get<00:02:52.690> as<00:02:52.780> much

branched-chain amino acids there is one

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.170 
branched-chain amino acids there is one
amino<00:03:10.690> acid<00:03:11.140> that's<00:03:11.320> specifically

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
amino acid that's specifically

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:21.990 
amino acid that's specifically
responsible<00:03:13.180> for<00:03:13.780> muscle<00:03:14.440> growth<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:21.000> that's

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
responsible for muscle growth and that's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.660

loosing<00:03:22.660> loosing<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.740> very<00:03:23.950> very<00:03:24.130> important

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
loosing loosing is very very important

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.940 
loosing loosing is very very important
so<00:03:24.850> if<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.060> can<00:03:25.210> take<00:03:25.420> leucine<00:03:26.080> by<00:03:26.260> itself<00:03:26.620> in

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
so if you can take leucine by itself in

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.890 
so if you can take leucine by itself in
a<00:03:27.070> pure<00:03:27.460> form<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.210> will<00:03:28.300> be<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> really<00:03:28.810> good

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
a pure form it will be a really good

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.320 
a pure form it will be a really good
idea<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.440> add<00:03:29.710> some<00:03:30.070> loose<00:03:30.310> into<00:03:30.730> your<00:03:30.910> protein

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
idea to add some loose into your protein

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.780 
idea to add some loose into your protein
you<00:03:32.020> can<00:03:32.170> buy<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.350> as<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> whole<00:03:32.920> approach<00:03:33.520> as<00:03:33.760> a

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
you can buy it as a whole approach as a

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.120 
you can buy it as a whole approach as a
powerful<00:03:34.390> source<00:03:34.690> directly<00:03:35.320> on<00:03:35.470> its<00:03:35.590> own<00:03:35.710> in
