 hello to you, gene pilot, there are two 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.389
 kind of revolutionary games 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.240
 those that create the genre and those that 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.430
 change it forever 1 categories 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.130
 relates wolfenstein 3d and go mu 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.890
 online in the second you will find such games 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.550
 how half-life is young and of course the world of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.070
 warcraft 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 these games are not just powerful they 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 completely changed the standard for igroproma 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.290
 after the release of the world of warcraft genre 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.940
 Mama 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.580
 changed shape and key set 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.809
 features defined millions of hours 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.750
 continuous play 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.760
 the next decades cannot 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.129
 imagine emma which is not 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.320
 would compare with world of warcraft but not 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.720
 all blizzard ideas were radical or 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.070
 even original yet folded them 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.000
 together they did it 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.649
 brand new model online lpg 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.030
 bob of course inherited the look 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.550
 warcraft strategies 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.300
 and in particular the color of humor and visual 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.910
 abstractions 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.910
 but there is one thing that shared opinion 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.920
 people like everquest most likely 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.140
 adhered to the concept of relatively 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 really portray the outside world like 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.539
 ultima online in turn the world 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.899
 warcraft makes it pretty clear that 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.970
 he created for fun is not a criticism 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.340
 azerot is one of the most unusual 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.440
 gaming spaces ever created and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 Blizzard talent in the story of the plot 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.119
 it remains only to rejoice in such 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.030
 a radical change in visual style 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.039
 games unlike competitors creators 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.500
 Warcraft reported that they are not trying 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.099
 repeat the real world they make their 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.099
 own 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.819
 the concept of gaining experience through quests 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.550
 was one of the most important innovations 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.470
 world of warcraft 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.930
 earlier leveling quests had an indirect 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.880
 relation to each other was effective 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.340
 stand in one place kill hundreds 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.069
 monsters than moving around the world and exploring 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.260
 his god created a mobile population 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.840
 players as a result of competition for 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 The best spa for x ping has become history 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.210
 it's hard to imagine the time before the introduction 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.560
 dungeon similar system equality 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.470
 each group of players 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.110
 changed the role of dungeons forever more 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.060
 there were no queues for treasure and zerg 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.280
 when to go through difficult 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.710
 place come three times more players 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.610
 than necessary 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.010
 dungeons that act like 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.670
 separate locations are the main 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.170
 part of the design of m in our time 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.780
 one location can only be for 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.870
 capture flag another for x ping a 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.480
 third for pvp stating it is a blizzard 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.000
 established a basic principle m for 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.220
 so that the players are free they need 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.300
 give the opportunity to choose what and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.300
 when they want 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.609
 if you 've ever played lpg where u 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.919
 your character was this and skill tree 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.410
 and about thirty one tax 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.240
 choices based on their class then 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.190
 thank world of warcraft 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.340
 of all ideas blizzard talent system 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.680
 widespread 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.380
 up to full copy though 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.240
 and exceptions like guild wars 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.370
 rejected a new trend based on 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.830
 the fact that with her players are obliged to choose 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.540
 too tough specialization and they have not 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.540
 there is room for personal opinion 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.490
 raids existed before the world of 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.890
 warcraft 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.290
 but blizzard created an interesting structure 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.180
 and motivated adventures as well 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.880
 figured out what to do between players 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.130
 Racks original Wings raids were 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.900
 hard as steel intended for 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.150
 fixed number of players and 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.340
 representing the reward only a little 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.780
 of which the leader of the raid was supposed to 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.970
 develop a strategy 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.890
 and the goal of the raid participants was to achieve 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.890
 maximum efficiency on the battlefield 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.270
 in addition you can say a little about 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.639
 the blizzard humor always worked very 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.430
 good writers who have been great 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:05.650
 impact on the global history of the Islands they 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.039
 take seriously but most 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.060
 supporter of quests have a special approach 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.009
 blizzard found out that if you 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.030
 going to spend thousands on the game and 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.400
 thousands of hours 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.710
 then the key feature should be 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.050
 the fact that in the real world we are each 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.240
 day we observe a lot of ridiculous and stupid 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.139
 and their game should not be too 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.139
 serious 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:39.160
 thanks for watching I'll be glad of you 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.160
 ratings and comments to everyone bye
