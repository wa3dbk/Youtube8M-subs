00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.340
 ah 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.050
 while some young people waste 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.330
 their lives in gangs there are others that 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:23.300
 they take advantage of their youth to plant 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:25.850
 hope as these boys in velar 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.110
 to the freedom that has set in motion a 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.020
 papaya cultivation 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.630
 edwin before he walked on crooked roads 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.910
 but today through this activity 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.120
 managed to get away from the vices and gangs 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.610
 for talking to the gangs they will send 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.130
 the attention of the drug user 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.250
 now how do you feel you are doing 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.870
 something productive I feel good and it's 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.270
 greater about which the project much 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.760
 here to give some friendly contours with 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.120
 we all work and there we go teaching 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.120
 ahead 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.590
 Fernan is also an engineer 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.930
 industrial but in the absence of work in 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.420
 this branch decided to join the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.450
 project our idea is to export this 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.520
 papaya to know what we had young 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.890
 we have the intention to take 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.070
 to the country forward and in a few words 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.350
 we are working a group of young people 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.410
 a little bit big I take care of the papaya a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.770
 special care since it is sown there 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.840
 to be on top and one caring 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.729
 fumigating and it's a special neck that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.310
 you have and you have to spend it money too 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.770
 enough to drink after harvesting 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.960
 wine does not harvest anything every day 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 they come to take care of their source of income 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.540
 they have been lucky every week 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.670
 they cut about two thousand papayas that are 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.119
 sold in the main markets of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.530
 the capital plus we contribute 10 quintals and 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.140
 we hope that every week we go 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.050
 cutting more quintales we hope to sell 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.080
 to people or industries 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.390
 factories that distribute papaya or fruit 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.979
 in the country and this is making a 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.020
 we have 12 posts to this story serve 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.840
 of motivation for young people who do not 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.690
 bring anything productive to the country as 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.500
 these guys show us that the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.450
 want is power 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 young example for society that a 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.940
 they started this project and today 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.350
 they are seeing their fruits in the hacienda 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.570
 Melara of freedom
