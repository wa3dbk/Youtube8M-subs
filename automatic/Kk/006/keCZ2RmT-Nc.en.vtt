00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Sweetheart, good morning. I'm here. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.990
 To answer a tag is so lost here. 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.269
 on the channel that even in our cell phone 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.090
 who accompanies me here on the channel knows that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.740
 I changed my cell phone recently. 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 even a blog showing his purchase to 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.730
 leave it at home here and let me make the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.100
 return flight or suv asking to do is 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 a video showing all the details if 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.970
 operating my apps just for 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.660
 That's when I came. It was in this video. 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.490
 you 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.199
 I will show and freedom not to make a 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.300
 even complete review because I do not 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 I'm a specialist in this area but I'm going 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.510
 show right that I like it 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.340
 I do not like how he is like him. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.110
 It works and show you mine. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.370
 applications is so then you want 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.290
 know a little more about my cell phone 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.690
 Come with me, my sofa. It's nokia. 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.629
 925 it's windows phone 8.1 it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.090
 recently updated to 8,168 points 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.160
 0 which had some changes but the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.649
 The main team has swapped to seal in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.809
 relation to the camera is I had this 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.340
 link them great and I wanted to show the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.199
 examples here on the channel 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 But more than that is not so good. 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 as this then I researched I think 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.400
 would be good value for money but if 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 had a great camera weak and blogs 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
 and I kept imagining that it was for you and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.439
 most voted the best I created 277, 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.020
 rain and everything else was ok is that the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.049
 nokia cell phones are great and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.090
 has the rear camera and the front camera 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.979
 both are wonderful for taking the sky 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.439
 with the front camera is great for 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.689
 record also films in HD then for me 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.610
 It's perfect, things are welcome and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 meet all needs 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.520
 so that was the main reason I had 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.439
 switched from samsung to nokia 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.899
 Now I'll show you details. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.170
 starts which applications 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.290
 favorites and how that works he fought 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.079
 good then this is the phone is nokia 925 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 I got mine in the white version with a 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.820
 silver on the side that only actually is 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.810
 the aluminum beyond it and I'm going to talk about 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.369
 mind first because it is one of the things 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.549
 What did you do to buy a cell phone? 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.509

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.700
 eight with 7 megapixels with flash and lens 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 lenses that makes the photo that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.810

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.530
 specifications but it's great 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.150
 here is a little button that connects directly to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.600
 Camera little button to lock and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.130
 unlock and the volume buttons and here it is 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.590
 Until where have my main 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.710
 applications I'll talk about one that has here 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 There's the phone that's basically to see. 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.160
 with the delegation 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.470
 whatsapp that works normally for 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.120
 windows phone is the store that is where 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.440
 want the application equal this alliance 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.540
 that you can play in more than one 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.150
 It's also cool for those who have a lot of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.030
 and the commercial instagram has 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.920

 separated by dates on this phone, and I 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.709
 I think the maximum 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.100
 You can close it right here. 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.380
 FM radio 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.640
 here is the camera application that I 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.680

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.090
 and here in the field has the application that I 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.120
 use to study my photos pro 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.890
 instagram where I make the montages the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.320
 collages and everything else 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.170
 It's very cool, very fast and mobile in 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.300
 Yes it's great It's very fast Very fluid 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.410
 very easy to work with 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.880
 Now I'll show you my 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.640
 application is the application 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.920
 nokia camera than the application 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.959
 photo that leaves your phone with 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.070
 multiple camera settings 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.450
 professional 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.340
 When you enter it looks like a 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.500
 application but you have the option of 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.489
 You pull here and here you can. 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.989
 regular laugh opening and lighting focus 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.919
 because you have a compact camera 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.830
 photography 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.550
 Can you regulate with this with that? 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.170
 cell phone 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.540
 I'll make an example. 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.860
 with button now I'll show you the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.930
 that I can do for example in 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.040
 relation to the focus I can do 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:39.780
 focus the product and 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.910
 focus again on this application and 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.250
 This is the best for people who take photos of 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.900
 The application is great for those who 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.250
 take several photos from your phone 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.960
 who wants to bet strong enough on 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.450
 instagram or even who wants to start 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.560
 to record video is to start having a blog and 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.960
 can not afford to invest in a 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.390
 very good old camera on the phone that 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.640
 you 'll have everything a little there in the 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.920
 Only local place goes pulling side 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.230
 here are my other apps that 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.880
 I do not kiss on the screen the pounds - other 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.130
 who leaves here because he thinks the other 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.710
 more cute on the screen but there are several 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.670
 nice things, people, various things, well 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.410
 cool 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.840
 another goal is to show you that 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.450
 I use a lot is the music download thanks 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.570
 to a month -low music app 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.190
 but that is no download limit and 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.660
 low too fast I think I can 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.380
 download a money song from 15 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.630
 seconds 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.460
 he's really cool and has all the songs 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.650
 what you search for will get you 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.540
 find and will be able to download because he 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.070
 it's free also in the windows shop 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.960
 phone another cell phone I had that was 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.240
 the giant galaxy a little bit more 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.670
 the battery lasted about two days 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.230
 integers and using this one during the 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.610
 whole day then every night has to 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.990
 load but for me too has 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.160
 problem of having to carry it 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.790
 generally I like to give a load 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.130
 cool 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.840
 the other day you can use it all day and 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.130
 Nice as well is he's 4g 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.590
 so you have an idea of when he 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.470
 will be able to use normally he got 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.240
 the fae and it's great people whole system is 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.610
 very fluent he wants very quickly 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.190
 so far he has not recorded it once and looks 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.110
 that I use it all day and to where 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.480
 I'm going to take it so I talk to 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.040

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.840
 I have to talk about any other 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.880
 Doubt something I 've shown is 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.950
 Missing what you want me to say is 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.870
 just let it down in the comments or 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.350

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.720
 with 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.370
 but the cell phone is basically this and this 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.660
