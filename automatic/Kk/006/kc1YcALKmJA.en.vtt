00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:10.100
 If you want to add fade in/out to black or white at the same time, you will end up with 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:18.066
 A video effect instead of two identical video clips. 

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:45.799
 The last video clip, while adding fade in/out to black, first select multiple effects. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.033
 Here, it fades out to black and fades in from black. 

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:27.999
 Now try to do the same fade in / from white. 

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:30.699
 Another way is to add a fade in the first video clip split clip. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.066
 And fade out the last video clip if you find that you have a full storyline video.
