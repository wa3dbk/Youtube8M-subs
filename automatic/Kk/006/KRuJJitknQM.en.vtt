00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 it's a bit like me like that it was 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.919
 as part of the strikes for the arts 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 martial security all body there i 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.230
 had as bait the little pressure on 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.460
 vital points 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.440
 so everyone is talking about points 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 Vital already just made me internships 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.619
 and in the united states and elsewhere prince or 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.789
 early coib me I'm fully 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.199
 agree that vital points are a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.500
 sore point and very effective saint 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.420
 anne 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.400
 good it's good skin problem 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.720
 always named in situations where 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.609
 we can reach the points of the rate of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.410
 easy way and when sowing in the open 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880
 winter here be one of the countries 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 europe 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.160
 I can not dp thing that there is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 sun all year long 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 good it's one thing but when I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.180
 someone wants or who has two glasses on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 him and who has a jacket like you have 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.149
 least liar I explain to you 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.680
 how to do for all points 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.149
 vital by raising the arms of a body 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.969
 their everything they wear them top of the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.430
 bust or the boss of the blow as explains 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 how people can then make 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 products as well to know only 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.530
 know one thing that I fight when 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.879
 you move and who was bound 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
 and although it is much less obvious 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 then by cons I want to have the names 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.359
 are much easier to tahar is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.650
 easier easier to land and where the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.650
 rise is less protected obviously 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.250
 since they will have talked more about the bust 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.030
 sÃ©bastien the remains are more 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.610
 easy to reach 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 in combat in striking is the drift we 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 worried despite knees why 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.680
 because we came inside 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.080
 to unbalance the individual and make 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.070
 skip the setbacks ok that's a lot more 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.890
 easy to get on the ground 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 individuals the thumb is ok and the flag 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.509
 Turkish to seven of which shin suits 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 for above knee okay this is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.340
 always easier to hit 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.240
 genital or femoral spirited 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.180
 agree that look for them a vital point 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.640
 who can never be summoned 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 couple a little bit this side of the brusc and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.509
 we take there we take the head turkey 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.909
 flap is that on the reverse of the point 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.829
 wait what would be the disc seems 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.100
 to the trouble of tig by borrowing 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.869
 ear jaw ok so say 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.869
 that when he does not graduate in 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.430
 power here at 1 7 kb and you 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.380
 commit learn english stability 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.590
 of the individual but if you facts the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.119
 simulated process a compression of air there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.310
 has no meaning kim tong and all 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.379
 alone okay so enjoyed a gabon 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.430
 all that is the blow the cost base 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.750
 will they do ok the cutting edge there is not 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.430
 not necessary either to come 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.290
 hit me or curative accurately 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.400
 when a car that touches them and those 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.319
 in whom a circuit stop smell 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.060
 although they happen the brain is not 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.890
 more food there is nothing serious 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.400
 and aftereffects these dead these ten minutes 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.650
 sleep 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 okay there are other things that I do not 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.129
 see you there on this tape because 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.930
 as a precaution if you never know 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.430
 qualities that I send what to do but 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 they angry that touch the cost base 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.650
 it's an area that is sensitive that goes 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.930
 shake off brain and who will put 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.980
 the individual g sleeping for 5 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.860
 and 10 minutes 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.260
 ok my story here be it in front of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.940
 jean prat is precautionary struck in 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.040
 shearing except at six months of 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.410
 suffering and brutally face 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.060
 if he shoves dead last night there is a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.849
 risk anyway if mu by the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.879
 opportunity of employment m I have 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.840
 rings amplify the grouping 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.459
 keep because the shoot in the eye 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.170
 it's an area that is very sensitive to 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.010
 building where the individual touched at one eye 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.080
 right here 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.300
 ok wine not to take himself in 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.330
 the eye the individual is also 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.930
 handicapped it's super happy effect this 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.630
 cumulate then okay ok that's for 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.300
 this for the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.390
 the cra now when he said I 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.310
 come back to normal patrick context 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.490
 four seasons where the flyer 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.920
 I dressed the amateur group +6 very 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.470
 effective heart fragments here but we 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.650
 do not cross a hit blocked we go 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.540
 clear here at a time to make a 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.870
 good time then the bullock gets 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.350
 split ok anyway ok 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.430
 then tracking is not f here will read them 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.990
 scrapers also pay attention what 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.820
 mulhouse 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.100
 and if the result seems very 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.290
 sensible ok so of an efficiency 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.540
 when he struck early was too violent 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.430
 too much level 2 at the shoulder level you 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.410
 and provides the axa engine provides that the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.010
 mayor does take off it takes the scorer the 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.750
 as soon as possible 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.790
 okay so always be careful 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
 we condition why that for what 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.170
 cash and better received and better 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.360
 also govern but know that it stays 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.030
 dangerous areas okay so the 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.730
 motor to ira hockey since we 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.590
 could fall directly on the beach 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.920
 we in a very violent at the level 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.410
 kidneys and for the posterior of the 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.600
 People is also the printing 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.670
 hitting here become teachers have 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.380
 destroys the joint well to win 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.650
 then against running away 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.630
 okay but that's life committees 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.850
 brake after the date of attractive yak 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.710
 bullish cycle we will not work no 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.120
 more a very broad reason here to learn 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.890
 remote to strike that powerfully 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.300
 is useless to work in the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.040
 very short rotation here to be 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.960
 effective and always kept in touch and 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.750
 individuals agree so we will work 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.610
 here downhill on their application and 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.740
 come on turcot suites for a 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.830
 control at home it turns out to be slashing 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.900
 in others others like in dvd or 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.730
 finally in the intervention technique 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.070
 good rub them here too 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.020
 punches arthaud the club trainer 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.600
 is like a hit that is hyper 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.610
 powerful than you because not this one 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.680
 ok that just back up 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.990
 directly the note of accor and if one 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.210
 opposition here rotation ok but I hope 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.800
 that these tips on hit rousson 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.600
 useful and I wish you good 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.550
 training and especially once again 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.570
 never does something that goes to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.570
 against the physical body
