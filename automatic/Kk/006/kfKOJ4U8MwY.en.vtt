00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
have all the same color scheme we just

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.229 
have all the same color scheme we just
have<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.649> different<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.460> like<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.910> look<00:00:52.090> of

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
have a different I like the look of

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.910

different<00:00:52.660> papers<00:00:53.140> different<00:00:53.590> colors

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
different papers different colors

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.670 
different papers different colors
underneath<00:00:54.309> on<00:00:54.520> our<00:00:54.640> tree<00:00:54.969> so<00:00:55.239> I<00:00:56.199> wanted<00:00:56.559> to

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
underneath on our tree so I wanted to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680 
underneath on our tree so I wanted to
use<00:00:56.890> a<00:00:56.920> color<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.579> would<00:00:57.760> coordinate<00:00:58.449> with

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
use a color that would coordinate with

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.990 
use a color that would coordinate with
most<00:00:59.230> of<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.500> papers<00:00:59.890> that<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.100> have<00:01:00.399> such<00:01:00.699> as

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
most of the papers that I have such as

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.479 
most of the papers that I have such as
Very<00:01:01.239> Vanilla<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.469> I'm<00:01:02.649> going<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.039> use<00:01:03.340> the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
Very Vanilla and I'm going to use the

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.450 
Very Vanilla and I'm going to use the
two<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.789> a<00:01:03.820> half<00:01:04.000> inch<00:01:04.239> circle<00:01:04.449> punch<00:01:04.900> and

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
two and a half inch circle punch and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.940 
two and a half inch circle punch and
it's<00:01:06.460> large<00:01:06.850> enough<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.780> stamp<00:01:08.230> on<00:01:08.470> and<00:01:08.830> then

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
it's large enough to stamp on and then

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.220 
it's large enough to stamp on and then
have<00:01:09.160> room<00:01:09.400> to<00:01:09.610> write<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:10.450> what<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.630> did<00:01:10.900> is<00:01:11.080> I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
sorry about that but I went all the way

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.930 
around okay
punching<00:01:21.130> out<00:01:21.310> circles<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:24.280> try<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.550> get<00:01:24.790> as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
punching out circles to try to get as

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.530 
punching out circles to try to get as
many<00:01:25.210> out<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.660> one<00:01:25.900> sheet<00:01:26.290> as<00:01:26.560> I<00:01:26.860> could<00:01:27.160> and

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
many out of one sheet as I could and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.510 
many out of one sheet as I could and
then<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.960> pinched<00:01:29.590> all<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.770> way<00:01:30.010> down<00:01:30.280> this

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
then I pinched all the way down this

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.360 
then I pinched all the way down this
side<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.270> then<00:01:31.900> what<00:01:32.050> I<00:01:32.080> did<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.710> I<00:01:33.070> just<00:01:33.100> took

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
side and then what I did is I just took

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.020 
side and then what I did is I just took
my<00:01:33.640> paper<00:01:34.180> snips<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.710> chopped<00:01:36.220> off<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:36.700> part

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
my paper snips and chopped off this part

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
my paper snips and chopped off this part
that<00:01:37.210> I<00:01:37.330> cut<00:01:39.060> okay<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.360> then<00:01:40.720> slid<00:01:41.290> this<00:01:41.470> back

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
that I cut okay and then slid this back

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.710 
that I cut okay and then slid this back
in<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.100> middle<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.120> not<00:01:43.240> having<00:01:43.630> to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
in the middle so it's not having to

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.740 
in the middle so it's not having to
waste<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.740> punch<00:01:45.130> some<00:01:45.430> more<00:01:45.640> okay<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.420> you

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
waste and punch some more okay so you

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.460 
waste and punch some more okay so you
get<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.050> idea

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
get the idea

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.190 
get the idea

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
that went really quick so here I have

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.460 
that went really quick so here I have
all<00:01:50.350> these<00:01:50.500> circles<00:01:51.010> ready<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.400> go<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.350> I'm

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
pen in a long time and I thought this is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.640 
pen in a long time and I thought this is
great<00:02:42.610> for<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.350> took<00:02:44.500> the

great for this and I just took the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.310 
great for this and I just took the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
blender pen and you know it's a clear

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.800 
blender pen and you know it's a clear
liquid<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:48.070> scribbled<00:02:48.910> off<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.269> scratch<00:02:49.540> paper

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
liquid I scribbled off on scratch paper

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.960 
liquid I scribbled off on scratch paper
to<00:02:50.050> make<00:02:50.200> sure<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.500> had<00:02:50.800> any<00:02:51.010> previous<00:02:51.430> color

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
to make sure I had any previous color

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.650 
to make sure I had any previous color
off<00:02:52.300> and<00:02:52.720> then<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.800> blended<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.910> ink<00:02:55.330> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
off and then I just blended that ink and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.610 
off and then I just blended that ink and
into<00:02:56.650> each<00:02:56.920> of<00:02:57.160> those<00:02:57.280> berries<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:59.050> fill<00:02:59.319> in

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
into each of those berries to fill in

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.420 
into each of those berries to fill in
and<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.550> went<00:03:01.000> super<00:03:01.720> quick<00:03:02.530> as<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:03.010> can<00:03:03.190> see

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
and it went super quick as you can see

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.009 
and it went super quick as you can see
okay<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.900> then<00:03:05.680> I'd<00:03:06.310> like<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:07.360> finish<00:03:07.750> off<00:03:07.989> my

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
okay and then I'd like to finish off my

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.800 
okay and then I'd like to finish off my
edges<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.700> took<00:03:10.300> an<00:03:10.480> early

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
edges on this one I took an early

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.330 
edges on this one I took an early
espresso<00:03:11.110> sponge

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
espresso sponge

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.509 
it's inked up with early espresso and I
just<00:03:15.400> sponged<00:03:15.970> around<00:03:16.360> the<00:03:16.870> edges<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:18.310> me

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
just sponged around the edges and to me

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.140 
just sponged around the edges and to me
that<00:03:18.549> just<00:03:18.850> gives<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.510> finished<00:03:19.720> look<00:03:20.130> now<00:03:21.150> I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
that just gives it a finished look now I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.150
