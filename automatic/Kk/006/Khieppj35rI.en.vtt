doing this the WD TV live is a network

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.629 
doing this the WD TV live is a network
media<00:00:06.150> player<00:00:06.540> and<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:07.410> WD<00:00:07.799> livewire<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.610> a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
media player and the WD livewire is a

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.339 
media player and the WD livewire is a
way<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:08.940> more<00:00:09.330> easily<00:00:09.510> network<00:00:10.019> your<00:00:10.200> house

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
way to more easily network your house

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.320 
way to more easily network your house
now<00:00:10.650> if<00:00:11.340> you<00:00:11.550> want<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.790> know<00:00:11.880> what<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
now if you want to know what this is

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.200 
now if you want to know what this is
I'll<00:00:12.929> say<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.650> nutshell<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.549> powerline

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
I'll say in a nutshell this is powerline

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.490 
I'll say in a nutshell this is powerline
Ethernet<00:00:15.660> if<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.049> already<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.379> what

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
Ethernet if you already know what

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.890 
Ethernet if you already know what
powerline<00:00:16.890> Ethernet<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:18.029> probably<00:00:18.270> don't

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
powerline Ethernet is you probably don't

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
powerline Ethernet is you probably don't
need<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.170> keep<00:00:19.350> watching<00:00:19.590> unless<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.250> really

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
need to keep watching unless you really

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.759 
need to keep watching unless you really
want<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.760> know<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.090> specifics<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.320> WD

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
want to know the specifics of the WD

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.160 
want to know the specifics of the WD
livewire<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.150> if<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.420> don't<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.810> what<00:00:24.960> power

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
livewire so if you don't know what power

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.560 
livewire so if you don't know what power
line<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.529> Ethernet<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.699> stay<00:00:27.090> tuned<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
line is Ethernet is then stay tuned and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
line is Ethernet is then stay tuned and
I'm<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.930> explain<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> whole<00:00:28.680> thing<00:00:28.710> so

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
I'm going to explain the whole thing so

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.919 
I'm going to explain the whole thing so
first<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> all<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> powerline<00:00:30.900> AV

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
first of all this is a powerline AV

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.510 
first of all this is a powerline AV
network<00:00:31.470> kit<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.980> means<00:00:32.130> you've<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.309> up

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
network kit so that means you've got up

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.139 
network kit so that means you've got up
to<00:00:32.669> 200<00:00:33.270> megabits<00:00:33.630> per<00:00:33.930> second<00:00:34.700> data<00:00:35.700> transfer

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to 200 megabits per second data transfer

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.910 
to 200 megabits per second data transfer
speeds<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.230> stream<00:00:37.410> HD<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.860> can

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
speeds so you can stream HD you can

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.910 
speeds so you can stream HD you can
connect<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> 8<00:00:38.820> devices<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.530> adapters

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
connect up to 8 devices so two adapters

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
connect up to 8 devices so two adapters
by<00:00:41.340> four<00:00:41.610> ports<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.450> cool<00:00:43.280> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> side<00:00:44.700> we

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
by four ports very cool on the side we

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.889 
by four ports very cool on the side we
see<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.329> information

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
see some more information

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.560 
see some more information
aha<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.710> they're<00:00:46.980> comparing<00:00:47.489> powerline<00:00:48.059> vs

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
aha so they're comparing powerline vs

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
aha so they're comparing powerline vs
Wi-Fi<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.500> faster<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.010> more<00:00:50.100> reliable

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Wi-Fi it is faster and more reliable

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.790 
Wi-Fi it is faster and more reliable
yeah<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.690> them<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> immune

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
yeah I'm with them on that one is immune

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.439 
yeah I'm with them on that one is immune
to<00:00:52.980> interference<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.910> easy<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.329> install

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
to interference it is easy to install

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
to interference it is easy to install
and<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.590> are<00:00:55.649> both<00:00:55.770> protected<00:00:56.280> by

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and they are both protected by

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310 
and they are both protected by
encryption<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.390> you've<00:00:57.510> got<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:57.870> adapters

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
encryption so you've got two adapters

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.900 
encryption so you've got two adapters
with<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> total<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.980> four<00:00:59.190> ports<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> means

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with a total of four ports so that means

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.790 
with a total of four ports so that means
you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.210> connect<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.629> seven<00:01:01.079> devices<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you can connect up to seven devices and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
you can connect up to seven devices and
your<00:01:02.370> router<00:01:02.550> all<00:01:02.820> protected<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.420> 128-bit

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
your router all protected with 128-bit

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
your router all protected with 128-bit
encryption<00:01:04.250> create<00:01:05.250> high-speed<00:01:05.610> Internet

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
encryption create high-speed Internet

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.280 
encryption create high-speed Internet
connection<00:01:06.090> anywhere<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.020> home<00:01:07.170> without

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
connection anywhere in your home without

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
connection anywhere in your home without
running<00:01:07.619> wires<00:01:07.890> between<00:01:08.159> rooms<00:01:08.549> yes<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
running wires between rooms yes that is

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
running wires between rooms yes that is
the<00:01:10.110> beauty<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> powerline<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> do

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the beauty of powerline so what you do

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
the beauty of powerline so what you do
with<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> powerline<00:01:12.840> adapter<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.950> I'm

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
with a powerline adapter and I'm

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
with a powerline adapter and I'm
actually<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.369> maybe<00:01:14.610> I'll<00:01:14.790> even<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
actually a maybe I'll even do like a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.100 
actually a maybe I'll even do like a
practical<00:01:16.229> demonstration<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:18.110> okay

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
practical demonstration of this okay

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
practical demonstration of this okay
we've<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.680> an<00:01:19.890> installation<00:01:20.460> CD<00:01:20.909> which<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
we've got an installation CD which I

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.859 
we've got an installation CD which I
can't<00:01:21.689> imagine<00:01:21.869> there'd<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.619> any<00:01:22.740> use<00:01:22.979> for

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
can't imagine there'd be any use for

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.620 
can't imagine there'd be any use for

plug in step two you win aha the CD is

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
plug in step two you win aha the CD is
just<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> user<00:01:43.860> manual<00:01:44.100> yeah<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.880> I

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
just a user manual yeah that's what I

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.280 
just a user manual yeah that's what I
figured

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
figured

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.870 
figured
okay<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.470> we've<00:01:46.740> got<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> couple<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.490> Gigabit

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
okay so we've got a couple of Gigabit

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.800 
okay so we've got a couple of Gigabit
Ethernet<00:01:47.909> cables<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.340> live<00:01:50.549> wire

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.359 

alright<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.740> ports<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.159> there

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
alright then we go for ports on there

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.690 
alright then we go for ports on there
and<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.450> well<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> sync<00:01:58.229> button<00:01:58.579> which<00:01:59.579> I've

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to see any of those issues and I will

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.460 
to see any of those issues and I will
test<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> out<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.880> little<00:02:57.090> bit<00:02:57.299> hopefully<00:02:58.019> over

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
test it out a little bit hopefully over

time<00:03:00.630> for<00:03:00.690> me<00:03:01.049> to<00:03:01.290> suggest<00:03:02.069> testing<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.970> so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
time for me to suggest testing it so

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.539

we<00:03:42.150> will<00:03:42.389> find<00:03:42.630> a<00:03:42.780> TV<00:03:43.049> which<00:03:43.980> is<00:03:44.359> connected<00:03:45.359> to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
we will find a TV which is connected to

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
we will find a TV which is connected to
a<00:03:45.930> media<00:03:46.319> PC<00:03:46.910> which<00:03:47.910> is<00:03:48.180> connected<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.989> WT

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
a media PC which is connected to a WT

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.699 
a media PC which is connected to a WT
live<00:03:49.739> wire<00:03:50.030> okay<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.239> oh<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.900> actually<00:03:52.200> made<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
live wire okay and oh I actually made a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.170 
live wire okay and oh I actually made a
mistake<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.400> plugged<00:03:53.639> it<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:53.910> through<00:03:54.150> a

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
mistake and I plugged it in through a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.250 
mistake and I plugged it in through a
power<00:03:54.540> bar<00:03:54.959> but<00:03:56.299> in<00:03:57.299> my<00:03:57.540> testing<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.079> worked

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
power bar but in my testing it worked

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.110 
power bar but in my testing it worked
anyway<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.650> we're<00:03:58.889> gonna<00:03:58.980> fire<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.310> Big<00:03:59.910> Buck

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
anyway so we're gonna fire up Big Buck

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.080 
anyway so we're gonna fire up Big Buck
Bunny<00:04:00.150> which<00:04:01.139> is<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.319> 1080p<00:04:02.099> video<00:04:02.400> clip<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:05.090> free

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
Bunny which is a 1080p video clip a free

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.840 
Bunny which is a 1080p video clip a free
one

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.610 

and<00:04:10.850> we're<00:04:11.630> going<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.780> demonstrate<00:04:11.960> that<00:04:12.470> it

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
and we're going to demonstrate that it

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:24.090 
and we're going to demonstrate that it
plays<00:04:12.890> 1080p<00:04:13.730> video<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:15.380> nicely

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.200 

you<00:04:25.100> don't<00:04:25.250> really<00:04:25.370> have<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.730> watch<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.090> rest

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
you don't really have to watch the rest

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.910 
you don't really have to watch the rest
of<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:26.480> video<00:04:26.780> because<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.320> just<00:04:27.590> gonna<00:04:27.680> be

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
of this video because it's just gonna be

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.190 
of this video because it's just gonna be
Big<00:04:28.130> Buck<00:04:28.310> Bunny<00:04:31.450> yeah<00:04:32.450> maybe<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:32.810> can<00:04:32.990> skip

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
Big Buck Bunny yeah maybe we can skip

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.540 
Big Buck Bunny yeah maybe we can skip
around<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.680> somewhere<00:04:34.190> where<00:04:34.370> there's

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
around to somewhere where there's

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.640 
around to somewhere where there's
slightly<00:04:35.450> faster<00:04:36.050> action<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.650> bitrate

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
slightly faster action so the bitrate

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:49.420 
slightly faster action so the bitrate
might<00:04:39.980> be<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.130> little<00:04:40.280> bit<00:04:40.460> higher

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.370 

anyway<00:04:50.460> flawless<00:04:50.970> playback<00:04:51.390> on<00:04:51.660> 1080<00:04:52.110> piece

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
anyway flawless playback on 1080 piece

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.710 
anyway flawless playback on 1080 piece
because<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.010> a<00:04:53.280> 200<00:04:53.790> megabit<00:04:54.180> per<00:04:54.210> second

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
because it is a 200 megabit per second

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.090 
because it is a 200 megabit per second
connection

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100

unlike<00:04:56.640> most<00:04:56.910> power<00:04:57.240> line<00:04:57.480> kits<00:04:57.780> these<00:04:57.990> days

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
unlike most power line kits these days

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.650 
unlike most power line kits these days
which<00:04:58.530> are<00:04:58.830> about<00:04:59.820> a<00:04:59.880> hundred<00:05:00.090> megabit<00:05:00.630> per

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
which are about a hundred megabit per

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.420 
which are about a hundred megabit per
second<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.230> 200<00:05:01.560> megabit<00:05:01.890> per<00:05:01.920> second<00:05:02.310> ones

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
second the 200 megabit per second ones

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.700 
second the 200 megabit per second ones
are<00:05:02.610> quite<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.660> bit<00:05:03.690> more<00:05:03.930> extensive<00:05:04.260> in<00:05:04.530> most

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
are quite a bit more extensive in most

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.950 
are quite a bit more extensive in most
cases<00:05:04.950> but<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.850> can<00:05:06.060> see<00:05:06.240> that<00:05:06.420> it<00:05:06.540> does<00:05:06.720> give

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
cases but you can see that it does give

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.780 
cases but you can see that it does give
you<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.080> capability<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:08.010> run<00:05:08.550> full<00:05:09.090> HD<00:05:09.540> video

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
you the capability to run full HD video

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.020 
you the capability to run full HD video
over<00:05:11.790> powerline<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:14.010> I'd<00:05:14.400> imagine<00:05:14.520> we<00:05:14.880> would

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
over powerline and I'd imagine we would

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.570 
over powerline and I'd imagine we would
even<00:05:15.210> get<00:05:15.480> slightly<00:05:16.080> better<00:05:16.260> performance<00:05:16.650> if

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
even get slightly better performance if

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:24.140 
even get slightly better performance if
we<00:05:17.940> were<00:05:18.120> using<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:22.370> livewire<00:05:23.370> directly

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
we were using the livewire directly

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.480 
we were using the livewire directly
plugged<00:05:24.480> into<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:25.110> wall<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:26.310> can<00:05:26.460> see

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
plugged into the wall you can see

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.860 
plugged into the wall you can see
skipping<00:05:26.970> around<00:05:27.060> in<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.390> video<00:05:27.660> isn't

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
skipping around in the video isn't

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.630 
skipping around in the video isn't
giving<00:05:28.290> us<00:05:28.410> too<00:05:28.590> much<00:05:28.620> success<00:05:29.190> here<00:05:29.430> but

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
giving us too much success here but

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.580 
giving us too much success here but
that's<00:05:30.390> okay<00:05:30.660> all<00:05:31.170> right<00:05:31.320> why<00:05:31.410> don't<00:05:31.440> we

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
that's okay all right why don't we

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.260 
that's okay all right why don't we
actually<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.070> do<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> file<00:05:32.490> transfer<00:05:32.700> now<00:05:33.120> so

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
actually go do a file transfer now so

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.140 
actually go do a file transfer now so
why<00:05:33.360> don't<00:05:33.480> we<00:05:33.510> take<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.900> file<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:35.550> just

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
why don't we take that file and just

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:45.100 
why don't we take that file and just
copy<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.510> right<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.900> desktop<00:05:37.200> here

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.899 

yeah<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.919> guess<00:05:46.129> that's<00:05:46.280> about<00:05:46.370> in<00:05:46.610> line<00:05:46.729> with

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:46.909 
yeah I guess that's about in line with

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:49.750 
yeah I guess that's about in line with
my<00:05:47.060> expectations
