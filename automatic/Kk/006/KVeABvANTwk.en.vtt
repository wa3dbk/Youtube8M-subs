00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.029
 what's up guys my name is Hans-otto and Pedro King 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.490
 Oh with me new dishes with fireplace the full good Glock 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.450
 Percent never joke aside so I always get out of bed this floor alone 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.870
 or 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.870
 Respect for ever more road and respect 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.909
 mohawk 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.480
 Kassel ca Kürten 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.610
 seriously now 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.400
 Per cent this is the new multi-channel world when I send you Epi 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.020
 because not again because we probably have to change again 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.020
 with the server because we currently only have one gigabyte of RAM available 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.320
 Prok from the suppose that it is a kind of market place how can you get incredible 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 looking exciting into the water 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.660
 yes or the fries foul 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.260
 or go to the kiosk or you can also put your inventory in the empty if that 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.300
 she is full again, she knows that, and Babette he stopped 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.370
 yourself 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.250
 Huras are still here for the sins here you get when you have kiss and 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.600
 here on the server comeback 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 even there should Bausch the Franzen rich we rise 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.770
 So around her face looks super 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.900
 You get those gaps when you heal yourself well on the server 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.640
 and that is in here, then 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.010
 Wacker by 5 3 percent 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.650
 Allofs No a trend is 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.640
 Jörg Hacker 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.010
 a workbench a box of welcome gift a bed and if it is 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.160
 works an infinite source of water 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.980
 So much for this we go on a light year as you can easily see 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.930
 we have a coffee shop 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.490
 experience with a bomb 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.130
 as such, without you want to pull something through 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.380
 and to have her head then we have an editorial network here that we can 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.980
 Maybe this will be a kind of administration 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.390
 just take a look 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.190
 yes as I said here is a nice smile double 1 that was the first thing 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.990
 I've ever built here in the new world or the old world he unfortunately 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.570
 That's why it's not until this new world is the first 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.030
 first emerged 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.749
 because the tires are 50 pastries from production 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.809
 But I had all houses only way from 2 and therefore I was allowed anyway 

00:01:59.809 --> 00:02:02.519
 Insert again completely new that took the whole night people 

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:04.400
 incredible clubs work 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.810
 yes, among other things, this process may here 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.690
 the atmosphere changes that has about as long as I know 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.759
 not at all who needed it, I can probably go up 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.859
 This cube was once created by Jones Men and it's just that 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.879
 there are no tools used and every block 1 used this is really 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.410
 funny had been violent 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.719
 but somehow two to three lanes round 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.589
 built and I mean it is the result can be seen or 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.199
 I have lifted off one can look over the city from above 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.299
 but also about her that does not matter from up here 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.299
 I can do it 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.809
 so 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:51.419
 crazy, right 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.809
 So I think that looks really good 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:56.259
 Well, theme Wallner Euro hair 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.259
 Hollister does not shock GF 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.389
 only strong at 11 o'clock but do not care and you get 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.950
 and Thyra what else is there in the coffee shop I still could not do that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.929
 then experience yourself 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:14.019
 So I'll show you our settlement 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.029
 I'll do it again shortly 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.309
 Day 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.169
 HM over there over the observation deck of the world over the 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.179
 watch whole match all over the world 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:24.189
 then another lighthouse with background 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.449
 a television tower Police MByte on the so many TVs is well that is still 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.139
 so Martin Feldhaus 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.419
 percent 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.609
 the set 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.269
 incredibly much i thought shit built 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.709
 and this will be your settlement because the houses are behind that are two 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.279
 of the four houses 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.309
 they get 2 and Michelle 

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.689
 Regulars who have been there since the beginning and you would be here 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.049
 live 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.620
 For a sign outside, we visit the house and visit 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.519
 percent 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.999
 you can also go up the house and everything is open and Nicole 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.319
 We drove Dorel Burkhard 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.439
 or it will only be seventh that or not with any here 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.309
 Dining wagons do not bust you 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:10.669
 but the first time we got to the barrel as I said I definitely stop you 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.669
 the current as it looks with ALG i and so on and so forth 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.329
 When can I not say again I guess it will work for another week 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.759
 otherwise percent is nuclear and 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.659
 a few laps
