the occasional drive but it's really

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.349 
the occasional drive but it's really
back<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.100> there<00:00:23.220> again<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.640> sort<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.210> take

back in there again now to sort of take
the<00:00:24.480> engine<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.810> again<00:00:25.250> because<00:00:26.750> really<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the engine out again because really I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.290 
the engine out again because really I
pretty<00:00:27.990> much<00:00:28.170> hit<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.410> limit<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> earth

several<00:00:30.300> different<00:00:30.689> issues<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.170> this

several different issues with this
standard<00:00:31.619> head<00:00:32.420> basically<00:00:33.420> collapsed<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
standard head basically collapsed in the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.139 
standard head basically collapsed in the
hydraulic<00:00:34.559> lifters<00:00:35.510> with<00:00:36.510> too<00:00:36.630> many<00:00:36.719> rpms<00:00:38.149> the

hydraulic lifters with too many rpms the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.090 
hydraulic lifters with too many rpms the
head<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.510> floating<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.469> serious<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
head is floating like serious the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.860 
head is floating like serious the
exhaust<00:00:41.520> ports<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> size<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
exhaust ports on it I like the size of

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
exhaust ports on it I like the size of
your<00:00:43.020> finger<00:00:43.350> standard<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.730> keep<00:00:44.850> gas<00:00:45.059> flow<00:00:45.329> up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
your finger standard to keep gas flow up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
your finger standard to keep gas flow up
sort<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.989> standard<00:00:46.230> turbo<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
sort of a standard turbo so I want to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.330 
sort of a standard turbo so I want to
get<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.059> wet<00:00:48.210> ported<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.160> same

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
get that wet ported out and at the same

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090 
get that wet ported out and at the same
time<00:00:50.930> sort<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> few<00:00:52.260> other<00:00:52.379> issues<00:00:52.559> out<00:00:52.949> as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
time sort of few other issues out as

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.750 
time sort of few other issues out as
well

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
well

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.639 
well
possibly<00:00:54.539> even<00:00:54.690> put<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:54.899> bigger<00:00:55.140> valves<00:00:55.559> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
possibly even put some bigger valves in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
possibly even put some bigger valves in
it<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> cam<00:00:57.120> tree<00:00:57.300> ground<00:00:57.600> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it and I'm get the cam tree ground to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.630 
it and I'm get the cam tree ground to
sorrel<00:00:57.960> soup<00:00:58.170> solid<00:00:58.590> lifters<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> maybe<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
sorrel soup solid lifters and maybe a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.910 
sorrel soup solid lifters and maybe a
bit<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.820> left<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> same<00:01:00.480> time<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> with

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
bit more left at the same time and with

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
bit more left at the same time and with
just<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> general<00:01:02.160> head<00:01:02.640> over<00:01:02.820> already<00:01:03.270> because

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
just a general head over already because

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.450 
just a general head over already because
at<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> minute<00:01:04.500> we're<00:01:04.589> pretty<00:01:04.769> much<00:01:04.920> stuck<00:01:05.159> we

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
at the minute we're pretty much stuck we

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.609 
at the minute we're pretty much stuck we
can't<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:05.909> 30<00:01:06.240> psi<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:07.409> um

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
can't really go over 30 psi because um

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.580 
can't really go over 30 psi because um
the<00:01:08.130> valves<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.780> obviously<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.869> need<00:01:10.020> stiffer

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the valves like obviously I need stiffer

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
the valves like obviously I need stiffer
Springs<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.040> well<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.909> same<00:01:12.060> time<00:01:12.380> so

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
Springs as well at the same time so

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
Springs as well at the same time so
we're<00:01:13.500> kind<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.740> restricted<00:01:14.159> at<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.520> 25<00:01:15.000> psi

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
we're kind of restricted at about 25 psi

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.140 
we're kind of restricted at about 25 psi
which<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.780> why<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.020> been<00:01:16.140> running<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
which is why it's been running which is

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
which is why it's been running which is
going<00:01:18.150> pretty<00:01:18.330> good<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:18.840> obviously<00:01:19.140> it's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
going pretty good but obviously it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.090 
going pretty good but obviously it's
kind<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.670> under<00:01:21.030> achieving<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.100> it's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
kind of under achieving so it's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.649 
kind of under achieving so it's
basically<00:01:23.369> time<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> rip<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> apart<00:01:24.180> again

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
basically time to rip it apart again

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
basically time to rip it apart again
get<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> head<00:01:25.680> sorted<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.189> I've<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.580> some

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
get the head sorted out I've got some

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.770 
get the head sorted out I've got some
other<00:01:26.820> bits<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.119> pieces<00:01:27.210> I've<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
other bits and pieces I've got a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
other bits and pieces I've got a
different<00:01:28.110> V&amp;T<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
different V&amp;T to go on because if you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
different V&amp;T to go on because if you
sit<00:01:32.250> down<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> maths<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
sit down do the maths for the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.710 
sit down do the maths for the
compression<00:01:33.689> maps<00:01:34.049> etc<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.600> on

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
compression maps etc that one that's on

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
compression maps etc that one that's on
that<00:01:36.840> at<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.990> moment<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.470> basically<00:01:37.799> we're

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that at the moment is basically we're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
that at the moment is basically we're
gonna<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.220> come<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> restriction<00:01:39.650> before<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
gonna have come a restriction before I

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.520 
gonna have come a restriction before I
wanted<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.280> basically<00:01:41.729> say<00:01:42.270> I've<00:01:42.990> got<00:01:43.320> another

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
wanted to basically say I've got another

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.219 
wanted to basically say I've got another
one<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.399> slightly<00:01:44.670> larger

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
one to go there which is slightly larger

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.280 
one to go there which is slightly larger
third-gen<00:01:46.229> VNT<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> that's<00:01:48.780> gonna<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
third-gen VNT so that's gonna go at the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.719 
third-gen VNT so that's gonna go at the
same<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:49.860> also<00:01:50.189> I've<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
same time because also I've got just the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
same time because also I've got just the
manifold<00:01:51.240> let's<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.009> really

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
manifold let's do that I'm on a really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
manifold let's do that I'm on a really
the<00:01:53.460> exhaust<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:54.119> pipe<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:54.600> we've

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the exhaust and down pipe because we've

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.980 
the exhaust and down pipe because we've
been<00:01:54.869> running<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.320> temporary<00:01:56.869> where<00:01:57.869> ever

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
been running this temporary where ever

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.510 
been running this temporary where ever
since<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> engine<00:01:58.590> went<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> have<00:01:59.130> had<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> 2

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
since the engine went in is have had a 2

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.030 
since the engine went in is have had a 2
inch<00:01:59.759> sort<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.780> temporary<00:02:01.170> down<00:02:01.590> pipe<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
inch sort of temporary down pipe that

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.420 
inch sort of temporary down pipe that
was<00:02:02.159> put<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.869> get<00:02:04.430> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
was put there really just to just get it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.240 
was put there really just to just get it
just<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.759> front<00:02:05.969> end<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.270> there<00:02:06.450> now

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
just got the front end off there now

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.199 
just got the front end off there now
I'm<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.429> stop<00:02:08.700> dripping<00:02:08.940> all<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
I'm gonna stop dripping all the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.889 
I'm gonna stop dripping all the
radiating<00:02:09.660> stuff<00:02:09.869> out

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
radiating stuff out

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.149 
radiating stuff out
and<00:02:11.080> then<00:02:11.200> there's<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.650> task<00:02:11.950> of

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
and then there's the task of

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.759 
and then there's the task of
disconnecting<00:02:12.730> everything<00:02:13.090> which<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.170> these

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
disconnecting everything which of these

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.470 
disconnecting everything which of these
would<00:02:14.860> be<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.010> fastest<00:02:15.700> or<00:02:15.879> hidden<00:02:16.120> away<00:02:16.209> and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
would be the fastest or hidden away and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.610 
would be the fastest or hidden away and
stuff<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:16.989> into<00:02:17.769> two<00:02:18.310> bad<00:02:22.110> front<00:02:23.110> end<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.470> off

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
stuff but into two bad front end is off

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.229 
stuff but into two bad front end is off
I<00:02:24.040> do<00:02:26.040> okay<00:02:27.040> we're<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.250> gonna<00:02:27.519> start<00:02:28.030> getting

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
I do okay we're just gonna start getting

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.380 
I do okay we're just gonna start getting
the<00:02:28.299> drive<00:02:28.510> shafts<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:29.049> now<00:02:30.000> pull<00:02:31.000> them<00:02:31.150> two

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the drive shafts out now pull them two

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.300 
the drive shafts out now pull them two
out<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:32.319> then<00:02:32.470> just<00:02:32.500> gotta<00:02:32.860> get<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.099> engine

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
out and then just gotta get the engine

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.640 
out and then just gotta get the engine
mounts<00:02:33.549> off<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.909> on<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> engine<00:02:34.569> out<00:02:34.690> um<00:02:34.930> any

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
mounts off and on the engine out um any

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830 
mounts off and on the engine out um any
situation<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.540> can't<00:02:37.750> be

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
situation is is I really can't be

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.430 
situation is is I really can't be
bothered<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.849> remove<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.030> manifold<00:02:40.540> before<00:02:41.349> I

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
bothered to remove the manifold before I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.110 
bothered to remove the manifold before I
take<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.769> engine<00:02:41.890> out<00:02:42.129> so<00:02:42.670> I'm<00:02:42.760> going<00:02:42.849> to<00:02:42.970> try

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
take the engine out so I'm going to try

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.670 
take the engine out so I'm going to try
and<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.329> it<00:02:43.450> with<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.720> still<00:02:43.989> attached<00:02:44.319> which

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
and do it with it still attached which

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.130 
and do it with it still attached which
could<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.310> some<00:02:45.489> issues<00:02:45.849> is<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.720> can't<00:02:46.959> get

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
could have some issues is you can't get

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.500 
could have some issues is you can't get
the<00:02:47.319> air<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:48.489> can't<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.940> transmission

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
the air you can't get the transmission

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.030 
the air you can't get the transmission
mount<00:02:49.629> off<00:02:49.810> without<00:02:50.019> taking<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> manifold

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
mount off without taking the manifold

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.089 
mount off without taking the manifold
off<00:02:51.190> so<00:02:51.670> I'm<00:02:51.879> hoping<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.599> draw<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.590> bolts<00:02:53.950> out

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
off so I'm hoping to draw the bolts out

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.849 
off so I'm hoping to draw the bolts out
through<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.030> chassis<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.659> then<00:02:55.840> from<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:56.650> on

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
through the chassis and then from now on

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.369 
through the chassis and then from now on
bolt<00:02:57.159> it<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:58.060> from<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.569> other<00:02:58.690> side<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.019> world

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
bolt it so from the other side of world

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.080 
bolt it so from the other side of world
two<00:02:59.590> nuts<00:02:59.829> on<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.129> transmission<00:03:00.700> mount<00:03:00.849> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
two nuts on the transmission mount and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.449 
two nuts on the transmission mount and
bolt<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.109> from<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.440> wheel<00:03:02.620> arch<00:03:02.829> side<00:03:03.159> rather

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
bolt it from the wheel arch side rather

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.330 
bolt it from the wheel arch side rather
than<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.879> gearbox<00:03:04.690> mount<00:03:04.930> side<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.159> that<00:03:06.190> I

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
than the gearbox mount side so that I

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.220 
than the gearbox mount side so that I
can<00:03:06.579> hopefully<00:03:06.790> just<00:03:07.239> drop<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.659> whole<00:03:07.810> engine

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
can hopefully just drop the whole engine

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.949 
can hopefully just drop the whole engine
in<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.530> out<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:09.190> one<00:03:09.640> big<00:03:09.879> thing<00:03:10.150> rather<00:03:10.690> than

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
in and out is one big thing rather than

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.750 
in and out is one big thing rather than
having<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.290> take<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.620> off<00:03:11.769> because<00:03:11.890> trying

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
having to take that off because trying

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.890 
having to take that off because trying
to<00:03:12.819> get<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.150> bolts<00:03:13.450> on<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.629> exhaust

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
to get to the bolts on the exhaust

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:25.170 
to get to the bolts on the exhaust

side<00:03:58.280> nice<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:58.790> simple<00:03:59.180> just<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.750> case<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.930> one

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
side nice and simple just a case of one

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.300 
side nice and simple just a case of one
bolt<00:04:00.350> in<00:04:00.500> there

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:24.360 

you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.270 

right<00:04:25.370> she's<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:26.590> bit<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.740> fast<00:04:28.010> but<00:04:28.250> I

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
right she's out a bit of a fast but I

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.820 
right she's out a bit of a fast but I
managed<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.610> do<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:28.880> with<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.030> manifold<00:04:29.830> still

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
managed to do it with a manifold still

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:31.510 
managed to do it with a manifold still
attached

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
attached

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.670 
attached
I<00:04:31.780> do<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.950> key<00:04:34.160> linkages<00:04:34.580> were<00:04:34.760> an<00:04:34.850> absolute

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
I do the key linkages were an absolute

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.970 
I do the key linkages were an absolute
son-of-a-bitch<00:04:36.680> with<00:04:37.580> that<00:04:37.760> in<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.970> way

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
son-of-a-bitch with that in the way

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.700 
son-of-a-bitch with that in the way
yeah<00:04:39.980> not<00:04:40.220> ideal<00:04:40.810> but<00:04:41.810> are<00:04:41.960> still<00:04:42.169> easier<00:04:42.560> than

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
yeah not ideal but are still easier than

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.990 
yeah not ideal but are still easier than
getting<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.040> manifold<00:04:43.430> off<00:04:43.550> in<00:04:43.700> the<00:04:43.790> car

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
getting the manifold off in the car

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.600 
getting the manifold off in the car
that's<00:04:44.240> for<00:04:44.389> sure
