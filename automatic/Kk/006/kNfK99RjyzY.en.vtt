00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
i think they call optic 3d or something

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.699 
i think they call optic 3d or something
like<00:03:32.890> that<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.600> well<00:03:34.600> the<00:03:34.900> only<00:03:35.020> problem<00:03:35.170> is

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709
