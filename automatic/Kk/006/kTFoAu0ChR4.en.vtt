00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.140
 No 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910
 hey 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 and 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.180
 Yes 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.879
 hey i am harry maas and today 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.960
 I demonstrate the electro memory toy 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.670
 harmonix 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.759
 this is the smallest brother of the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.830
 memory men and the memory boy with the 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.899
 typical well-known sound analogy sound 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 and I will read nothing 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.369
 let's go through the check 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.390
 empty goes from 30 to five 150 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.369
 milliseconds 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.789
 feedback determines the amount of repeats 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.280
 the balance determines the delay policy 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.950
 between the direct signal and the dinner 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 signal and the mat switch finally 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.670
 adds modulation to the blank 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.340
 pete's this is going to be a fixed 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.960
 modulation you want more control than is 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.440
 a memory boa from mammy men one 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.090
 alternative choice 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.890
 ok let's start with the clean 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 signal I stuff for yamaha pacifica 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.430
 611 with simon roof and pick-ups 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.430
 here is my bridge element 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 and my neck elements 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 ok i start with the memory adorn with 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:18.560
 all controls in the middle okay bye 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.660
 the minimum setting ended up slightly 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.620
 to increase 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.620
 you get a bit of a double effect 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:48.910
 the lilies also lift him a little more 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.379
 and 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.940
 and 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.409
 but 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.670
 maximum delay 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:59.000
 plant and resource position you already have 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:05:09.710
 in your clinge signal so have a it 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:12.370
 full read yes ok feedback 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.370
 at least some 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.250
 so on a repeat 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.139
 maximum 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.139
 goes the mammy tori also as they learn 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.169
 ok the mat switch 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.179
 that actually adds must later then 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.179
 course effect in the lecture
