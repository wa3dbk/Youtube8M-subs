smeltery<00:00:22.619> hot<00:00:23.039> summer<00:00:23.880> days<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.570> we've<00:00:24.720> been

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
smeltery hot summer days that we've been

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
smeltery hot summer days that we've been
having<00:00:25.050> especially<00:00:25.830> where<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.250> live<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.000> this

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
having especially where I live so this

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.929 
having especially where I live so this
top<00:00:27.480> would<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.750> perfect<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:29.699> first

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
top would be perfect so the very first

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.429 
top would be perfect so the very first
thing<00:00:30.119> you'll<00:00:30.359> need<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.960> make<00:00:31.230> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
thing you'll need to do is make a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
thing you'll need to do is make a
pattern<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.399> pattern<00:00:32.759> paper<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
pattern I have my pattern paper it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.790 
pattern I have my pattern paper it
folded<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.600> half<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.140> working<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
folded in half and I'm working on the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
folded in half and I'm working on the
fold<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.670> tank<00:00:35.910> top<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.270> I'm<00:00:36.360> using<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
fold the tank top that I'm using is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.959 
fold the tank top that I'm using is
stretchy<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.890> fabric<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.610> stretchy

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
stretchy and my fabric is not stretchy

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.869 
stretchy and my fabric is not stretchy
so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> had<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.230> alter<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:41.129> pattern<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
so I had to alter my pattern to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.639 
so I had to alter my pattern to
accommodate<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.870> way<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.140> body<00:00:43.350> fits

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
accommodate the way my body fits

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.650 
accommodate the way my body fits
particularly<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> want<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> make<00:00:45.270> sure<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
particularly I want to make sure that it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
particularly I want to make sure that it
fit<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.020> bust<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> measured<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.309> much<00:00:47.520> more

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
fit my bust so I measured how much more

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.880 
fit my bust so I measured how much more
extra<00:00:48.059> space<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> would<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.320> traced<00:00:49.770> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
extra space I would need and I traced it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.670 
extra space I would need and I traced it
on<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.219> pattern<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.760> also<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.750> add<00:00:51.989> seam

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
on to my pattern I also like to add seam

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.619 
on to my pattern I also like to add seam
allowance<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.460> pattern<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
allowance into my pattern so that I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.000 
allowance into my pattern so that I
don't<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> worry<00:00:55.350> about<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.770> when<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
don't have to worry about that when I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
don't have to worry about that when I
cut<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.370> my<00:00:56.610> fabric<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.510> once<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
cut up my fabric and once you have that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
cut up my fabric and once you have that
all<00:00:58.140> traced<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.739> go<00:00:58.980> ahead<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> cut<00:00:59.789> out<00:01:00.000> your

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
all traced out go ahead and cut out your

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
all traced out go ahead and cut out your
pattern<00:01:00.420> it'll<00:01:01.050> look<00:01:01.199> something<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
pattern it'll look something like this

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.709 
pattern it'll look something like this
like<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.609> front<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> tank<00:01:03.239> top<00:01:03.420> basically

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
like the front of a tank top basically

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.380 
like the front of a tank top basically
and<00:01:04.199> you'll<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> cut<00:01:05.159> two<00:01:05.610> pieces<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and you'll want to cut two pieces of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020 
and you'll want to cut two pieces of
this<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.439> fabric<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> fold<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.000> back

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this out of your fabric and fold it back

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
this out of your fabric and fold it back
up<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> cut<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> fold<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:10.560> it'll

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
up and cut it on the fold because it'll

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
up and cut it on the fold because it'll
be<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> lot<00:01:11.070> easier<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> lot<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:11.939> accurate

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
be a lot easier and a lot more accurate

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.380 
be a lot easier and a lot more accurate
that<00:01:12.570> way<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.060> my

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that way as you can see here I have my

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.300 
that way as you can see here I have my
two<00:01:15.420> pieces<00:01:15.780> cut<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.530> my<00:01:16.619> fabric<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
two pieces cut out of my fabric if you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190 
two pieces cut out of my fabric if you
wanted<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.970> can<00:01:18.060> make<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> reversible<00:01:18.450> by

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
wanted to you can make it reversible by

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.450 
wanted to you can make it reversible by
using<00:01:19.409> two<00:01:19.619> different<00:01:19.740> prints<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.310> two

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
using two different prints or two

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.950 
using two different prints or two
different<00:01:20.700> colors<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> decided<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.780> keep

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
different colors but I decided to keep

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.410 
different colors but I decided to keep
mine<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.460> you'll<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.150> want

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
mine all the same and you'll also want

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780 
mine all the same and you'll also want
to<00:01:24.540> cut<00:01:24.840> straps<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.830> fabric<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.759> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to cut straps as your fabric here I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
to cut straps as your fabric here I
already<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> them<00:01:27.420> folded<00:01:27.810> inside-out<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
already have them folded inside-out and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
already have them folded inside-out and
pinned<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> unfolded<00:01:30.390> measurements<00:01:30.930> of

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
pinned but the unfolded measurements of

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.490 
pinned but the unfolded measurements of
my<00:01:31.290> straps<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.890> 1<00:01:32.460> inch<00:01:32.759> by<00:01:33.180> 60<00:01:33.630> inches<00:01:34.079> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
my straps are 1 inch by 60 inches you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.749 
my straps are 1 inch by 60 inches you
definitely<00:01:34.890> don't<00:01:35.009> need<00:01:35.130> them<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.610> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
definitely don't need them to be this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
definitely don't need them to be this
long<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:36.689> always<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> have<00:01:37.380> more

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
long but it's always better to have more

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.950 
long but it's always better to have more
than<00:01:38.460> less<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> case<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.509> doesn't<00:01:39.780> fit

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
than less just in case it doesn't fit

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.149 
than less just in case it doesn't fit
you<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.439> long<00:01:40.710> enough<00:01:40.979> and
