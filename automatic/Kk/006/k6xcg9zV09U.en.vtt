a good there if you manage to kind of

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.930 
a good there if you manage to kind of
realize<00:00:33.290> that<00:00:33.470> it<00:00:34.430> was<00:00:34.579> going<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.730> be<00:00:34.850> that

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.760 
realize that it was going to be that
quick<00:00:35.149> ball<00:00:35.360> game<00:00:35.600> and<00:00:35.870> then<00:00:36.379> I<00:00:36.410> feel<00:00:36.649> that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
quick ball game and then I feel that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.490 
quick ball game and then I feel that
kind<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.010> sailed<00:00:37.220> into<00:00:38.079> well<00:00:39.079> yeah<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:39.379> was

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
kind of sailed into well yeah it was

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.069 
kind of sailed into well yeah it was
tough<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:40.370> really<00:00:40.610> physical<00:00:40.970> tonight<00:00:41.300> it

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
tough for a really physical tonight it

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.810 
tough for a really physical tonight it
was<00:00:42.199> a<00:00:42.230> tough<00:00:42.440> game

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.780 

obviously<00:00:49.820> not<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.300> lot<00:00:51.080> to<00:00:51.110> plan<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:51.800> I<00:00:52.130> think

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
obviously not a lot to plan but I think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.750 
obviously not a lot to plan but I think
a<00:00:52.940> learning<00:00:53.630> experience<00:00:53.840> for<00:00:54.320> us<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.740> lot<00:00:55.730> of

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
a learning experience for us a lot of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.810 
a learning experience for us a lot of
positives<00:00:56.270> taken<00:00:56.660> from<00:00:56.810> the<00:00:56.930> game

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
positives taken from the game

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.420 
positives taken from the game
and<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.510> think<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.989> all<00:01:00.620> our<00:01:00.770> heads<00:01:00.980> high<00:01:01.190> off

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
and I think we all our heads high off

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.729 
and I think we all our heads high off
the<00:01:01.730> monster<00:01:02.000> another<00:01:02.840> way<00:01:02.989> wanted<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.559> end

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
the monster another way wanted to end

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.860 
the monster another way wanted to end
but<00:01:04.370> definitely<00:01:05.030> something<00:01:05.300> we<00:01:05.420> can<00:01:05.630> take<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
but definitely something we can take a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.460 
but definitely something we can take a
lot<00:01:06.020> from<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.409> game<00:01:06.560> we<00:01:06.710> could<00:01:06.830> take<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:06.979> lot

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
lot from the game we could take a lot

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.140
