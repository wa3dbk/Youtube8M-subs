favorites or something and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.640 
favorites or something and
I<00:04:09.120> really<00:04:09.480> didn't<00:04:09.690> like<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.959> stuff<00:04:10.170> like<00:04:10.470> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
I really didn't like the stuff like I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.040 
I really didn't like the stuff like I
didn't<00:04:11.069> I<00:04:11.400> used<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.540> felt<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:12.870> my

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
didn't I used it and it felt like my

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.490 
didn't I used it and it felt like my
hair<00:04:13.470> was<00:04:13.700> straw<00:04:14.700> afterwards<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:16.470> I

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
hair was straw afterwards and what I

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.340 
hair was straw afterwards and what I
realized<00:04:17.010> later<00:04:17.340> was<00:04:17.549> that<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:18.239> left<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.139> too

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
realized later was that I left it in too

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.009 
realized later was that I left it in too
long<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.949> I<00:04:20.850> did<00:04:21.090> not<00:04:21.269> deep<00:04:21.510> conditioning

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
long and I did not deep conditioning

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.840 
long and I did not deep conditioning
afterwards<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:22.889> somebody<00:04:23.190> commented<00:04:23.669> like

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
afterwards so somebody commented like

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.189 
afterwards so somebody commented like
girl<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.479> know<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:24.780> supposed<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.020> deep

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
girl you know you're supposed to deep

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.840 
girl you know you're supposed to deep
condition<00:04:25.320> after<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.979> right<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:26.460> like<00:04:26.639> I

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
condition after that right I was like I

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.400 
condition after that right I was like I
thought<00:04:27.240> this<00:04:27.449> wasn't<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.810> deep<00:04:27.930> conditioner

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
thought this wasn't the deep conditioner

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.300 
thought this wasn't the deep conditioner
no<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.540> the<00:04:30.630> protein<00:04:30.990> treatment<00:04:31.470> and<00:04:31.620> so

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
no this is the protein treatment and so

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.550 
no this is the protein treatment and so
it's<00:04:33.150> not<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.660> deep<00:04:33.810> conditioner<00:04:34.260> so<00:04:34.500> I've

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
it's not the deep conditioner so I've

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.900 
it's not the deep conditioner so I've
learned<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.699> works<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.510> well<00:04:36.540> now<00:04:37.080> so

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
learned that and it works so well now so

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.690 
learned that and it works so well now so
what<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:38.940> did<00:04:39.380> was<00:04:40.380> go<00:04:40.949> ahead<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.220> wash<00:04:41.340> my<00:04:41.520> hair

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
what I did was go ahead and wash my hair

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.670 
what I did was go ahead and wash my hair
like<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.910> said<00:04:42.120> with<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.330> shampoo<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:42.990> then<00:04:43.440> when

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
like I said with a shampoo and then when

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.570 
like I said with a shampoo and then when
I<00:04:43.710> pair<00:04:43.979> rinse<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.340> out

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
I pair rinse that out

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.240 
I pair rinse that out
I<00:04:44.700> put<00:04:45.030> in<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.630> hair<00:04:45.840> Mayo<00:04:46.110> into<00:04:46.590> each<00:04:46.740> section

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
I put in the hair Mayo into each section

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.040 
I put in the hair Mayo into each section
and<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.700> left<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.120> in<00:04:48.180> while<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.510> took<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.870> rest

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
and I left that in while I took the rest

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.180 
and I left that in while I took the rest
of<00:04:49.169> my<00:04:49.260> shower<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:49.770> it's<00:04:49.889> probably<00:04:50.130> like

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
of my shower so it's probably like

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.750 
of my shower so it's probably like
another<00:04:50.490> like<00:04:50.760> 20<00:04:51.120> minutes<00:04:51.419> or<00:04:51.570> so<00:04:51.780> right<00:04:52.760> then

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
another like 20 minutes or so right then

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.540 
another like 20 minutes or so right then
I<00:04:53.790> rinsed<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.720> out<00:04:54.960> so<00:04:55.530> I'm<00:04:55.950> adding<00:04:56.280> the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
I rinsed that out so I'm adding the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.969 
I rinsed that out so I'm adding the
protein<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.210> my<00:04:57.330> hair<00:04:57.570> because<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.410> relaxer

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
protein to my hair because the relaxer

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.980 
protein to my hair because the relaxer
is<00:04:59.190> going<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.580> strip<00:04:59.820> protein<00:05:00.300> out<00:05:00.510> of<00:05:00.840> your

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
is going to strip protein out of your

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.840 
is going to strip protein out of your
hair<00:05:01.200> so<00:05:01.710> why<00:05:01.889> not<00:05:02.039> make<00:05:02.250> sure<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.669> have

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
hair so why not make sure that you have

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.730 
hair so why not make sure that you have
plenty<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.630> there<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.200> make<00:05:04.289> sure<00:05:04.470> that<00:05:04.590> it's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
plenty in there and make sure that it's

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.640 
plenty in there and make sure that it's
well<00:05:04.860> taken<00:05:05.250> care<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.520> before<00:05:06.470> that's<00:05:07.470> what

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
well taken care of before that's what

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.439 
well taken care of before that's what
I'm<00:05:07.740> thinking<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.550> step<00:05:08.880> three<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.300> the

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
I'm thinking so that step three is the

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.840 
I'm thinking so that step three is the
hair<00:05:09.630> mayo<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.560> I<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:10.800> got<00:05:10.949> that<00:05:11.100> like<00:05:11.430> at

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
hair mayo and I just got that like at

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.420 
hair mayo and I just got that like at
the<00:05:11.970> drugstore<00:05:12.210> so<00:05:13.080> use<00:05:13.350> that<00:05:13.380> left<00:05:14.100> that<00:05:14.280> in

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
the drugstore so use that left that in

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.090

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
hair on cool and then did my twist why

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.480 
hair on cool and then did my twist why
did<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.180> do<00:06:00.330> this<00:06:00.360> was<00:06:00.630> that<00:06:00.840> well<00:06:01.380> if<00:06:02.310> I

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
did I do this was that well if I

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.589 
did I do this was that well if I
Flatiron<00:06:02.880> my<00:06:03.479> hair<00:06:03.870> right<00:06:04.560> before<00:06:04.620> I

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
Flatiron my hair right before I

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.050 
Flatiron my hair right before I
do<00:06:07.409> a<00:06:07.440> relaxer<00:06:08.009> there<00:06:08.639> are<00:06:08.699> two<00:06:08.879> things

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
do a relaxer there are two things

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.640 
do a relaxer there are two things
involved<00:06:09.629> one<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:11.030> kind<00:06:12.030> of<00:06:12.330> it's<00:06:13.110> like<00:06:13.379> adding

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
involved one it kind of it's like adding

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.680 
involved one it kind of it's like adding
damage<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.550> damage<00:06:14.970> that<00:06:15.120> I'm<00:06:15.210> about<00:06:15.389> to<00:06:15.449> do

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
damage to damage that I'm about to do

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.110 
damage to damage that I'm about to do
the<00:06:15.840> next<00:06:16.110> week<00:06:16.319> it's<00:06:16.889> added<00:06:17.310> strain<00:06:17.699> to

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
the next week it's added strain to

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.760 
the next week it's added strain to
strain<00:06:18.479> that<00:06:18.690> I'm<00:06:18.780> gonna<00:06:18.900> put<00:06:19.110> on<00:06:19.169> my<00:06:19.229> hair<00:06:19.590> the

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
strain that I'm gonna put on my hair the

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.850 
strain that I'm gonna put on my hair the
next<00:06:20.009> week<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:20.759> that's<00:06:21.270> one<00:06:21.509> reason<00:06:21.690> also<00:06:22.349> if<00:06:22.680> I

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
next week so that's one reason also if I

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.529 
next week so that's one reason also if I
Flatiron<00:06:23.159> my<00:06:23.430> hair<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.669> I<00:06:23.759> find<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.060> harder<00:06:24.509> to

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
Flatiron my hair and I find it harder to

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.899 
Flatiron my hair and I find it harder to
find<00:06:24.960> that<00:06:25.110> line<00:06:25.379> of<00:06:25.530> demarcation<00:06:25.650> where<00:06:26.460> I've

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
find that line of demarcation where I've

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:28.520 
find that line of demarcation where I've
already<00:06:27.150> processed<00:06:27.840> some<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.110> money<00:06:28.319> where

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
already processed some of money where

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.939 
already processed some of money where
and<00:06:29.520> then<00:06:30.060> also<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.720> part<00:06:30.990> where<00:06:31.229> that<00:06:31.710> the

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
and then also the part where that the

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.719 
and then also the part where that the
new<00:06:32.129> the<00:06:32.340> completely<00:06:32.759> virgin<00:06:33.180> new<00:06:33.360> growth<00:06:33.629> so

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
new the completely virgin new growth so

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.950 
new the completely virgin new growth so
it's<00:06:35.729> easier<00:06:36.060> for<00:06:36.090> me<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.389> park<00:06:36.690> when<00:06:36.930> I

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
it's easier for me to park when I

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.200 
it's easier for me to park when I
Flatiron<00:06:37.319> it<00:06:37.620> but<00:06:38.039> then<00:06:38.190> I<00:06:38.280> can't<00:06:38.520> find<00:06:38.819> where

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
Flatiron it but then I can't find where

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.330 
Flatiron it but then I can't find where
to<00:06:39.900> start<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.349> stop<00:06:40.620> with<00:06:40.889> the<00:06:40.919> actual

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
to start and stop with the actual

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.689 
to start and stop with the actual
relaxer<00:06:42.270> whenever<00:06:42.599> I'm<00:06:42.719> tech<00:06:42.930> slicing<00:06:43.319> in<00:06:43.699> so

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
relaxer whenever I'm tech slicing in so

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.490 
relaxer whenever I'm tech slicing in so
if<00:06:44.879> that<00:06:44.969> makes<00:06:45.150> any<00:06:45.300> sense<00:06:45.449> home<00:06:45.810> so<00:06:46.319> that's

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
if that makes any sense home so that's

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.480 
if that makes any sense home so that's
why<00:06:46.680> I<00:06:46.710> do<00:06:46.860> the<00:06:47.159> the<00:06:48.050> twist<00:06:49.050> down<00:06:49.199> and<00:06:49.860> it's

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
why I do the the twist down and it's

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.309 
why I do the the twist down and it's
also<00:06:50.669> pretty<00:06:51.000> low<00:06:51.120> manipulation<00:06:51.990> so<00:06:52.199> my

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
also pretty low manipulation so my

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:55.279 
also pretty low manipulation so my
scalps<00:06:52.710> not<00:06:52.889> getting<00:06:53.159> irritated<00:06:53.960> also<00:06:54.960> by<00:06:55.229> the

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
scalps not getting irritated also by the

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.930 
scalps not getting irritated also by the
way<00:06:55.469> whenever<00:06:55.710> I'm<00:06:55.979> in<00:06:56.159> the<00:06:56.340> shower<00:06:56.550> and<00:06:56.819> I'm
