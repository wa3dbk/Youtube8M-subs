out of here and we're gonna switch

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.349 
out of here and we're gonna switch
characters<00:00:17.660> that<00:00:18.660> couldn't<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:20.359> think

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
characters that couldn't do this I think

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.090 
characters that couldn't do this I think
those<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.840> switches<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.439> both<00:00:22.619> sides<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
those little switches on both sides and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
those little switches on both sides and
I'm<00:00:23.369> mistaken<00:00:23.990> just<00:00:24.990> wipe<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.650> first

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I'm mistaken just wipe these out first

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.929 
I'm mistaken just wipe these out first
though<00:00:27.920> in<00:00:28.920> case<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.369> didn't<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> by<00:00:29.910> now

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
though in case you didn't know it by now

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.990 
though in case you didn't know it by now
he's<00:00:30.720> incredibly<00:00:31.230> annoying<00:00:34.640> why<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> can't

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
he's incredibly annoying why you can't

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.720 
he's incredibly annoying why you can't
just<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.540> kill<00:00:36.780> them<00:00:36.930> it's<00:00:37.200> because

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
just go up and kill them it's because

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.209 
just go up and kill them it's because
well<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:40.350> can't<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.590> go<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.860> kill<00:00:41.129> him

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
well you can't just go up and kill him

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
well you can't just go up and kill him
because<00:00:41.309> he's<00:00:41.610> happy<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:42.059> below<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.930> not

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
because he's happy from below that's not

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.490 
because he's happy from below that's not
going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> blow<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.899> mom's<00:00:45.899> i<00:00:48.350> remember<00:00:49.350> how

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
going to blow up a mom's i remember how

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.950 
going to blow up a mom's i remember how
i<00:00:49.530> did<00:00:49.710> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:05.090 

I<00:00:56.030> think<00:00:57.030> there's<00:00:57.300> something<00:01:03.830> there's<00:01:04.830> some

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
I think there's something there's some

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:16.669 
I think there's something there's some
sort<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> switch

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.660 

maybe<00:01:17.679> this<00:01:17.829> headed<00:01:18.159> maybe<00:01:18.429> seven<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:21.490> right

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
maybe this headed maybe seven all right

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.110 
maybe this headed maybe seven all right
say<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:21.939> think<00:01:22.149> you<00:01:22.210> might<00:01:22.299> hit<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.509> flyers

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120
