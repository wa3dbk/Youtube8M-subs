00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.280 

see<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.430> wrap<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.149> hair<00:01:17.360> around<00:01:17.390> my<00:01:17.780> finger<00:01:18.259> and

see I wrap the hair around my finger and

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.499 
see I wrap the hair around my finger and
you<00:01:18.740> know<00:01:18.829> I<00:01:18.890> just<00:01:19.570> wrap<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.600> around<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:23.270> to

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
you know I just wrap it around and to

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.550 
you know I just wrap it around and to
fasten<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.740> bantu<00:01:25.369> knot<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:25.729> use<00:01:26.110> threads<00:01:27.110> oh

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
fasten the bantu knot I use threads oh

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.410 
fasten the bantu knot I use threads oh
it's<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.369> bit<00:01:28.549> different

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's a bit different

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.679 
it's a bit different
most<00:01:30.079> people<00:01:30.380> use<00:01:30.759> hair<00:01:31.759> pins<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.420> find

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
most people use hair pins but I find

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.399 
most people use hair pins but I find
that<00:01:32.750> hairpins<00:01:33.229> pull<00:01:33.560> my<00:01:33.710> hair<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.189> also<00:01:35.409> by

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
that hairpins pull my hair and also by

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.679 
that hairpins pull my hair and also by
the<00:01:36.470> end<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.070> day<00:01:37.340> or<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.060> morning<00:01:38.509> you

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
the end of the day or in the morning you

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.749 
the end of the day or in the morning you
know<00:01:38.810> my<00:01:39.020> hair<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.409> bit<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.039> Banton<00:01:40.429> orbit

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
know my hair is a bit the Banton orbit

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.300 
know my hair is a bit the Banton orbit
will<00:01:41.000> be<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.149> bit<00:01:41.450> loose<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.079> I<00:01:42.560> find<00:01:42.979> that<00:01:43.070> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
will be a bit loose so I find that the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.969 
will be a bit loose so I find that the
threading<00:01:43.789> keeps<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.299> really<00:01:44.479> secure<00:01:44.979> again

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
threading keeps it really secure again

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.749 
threading keeps it really secure again
you<00:01:46.340> know<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:46.549> can<00:01:46.759> use<00:01:46.909> banding<00:01:47.600> or<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:49.700> know

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
you know you can use banding or you know

00:01:49.759 --> 00:02:01.929 
you know you can use banding or you know
anything<00:01:50.149> like<00:01:50.179> that<00:01:51.549> so<00:01:52.549> that's<00:01:52.729> what<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:52.909> do

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.490 

again<00:02:02.939> making<00:02:03.210> sure<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:04.170> really

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
again making sure that it's really

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.369 
again making sure that it's really
really<00:02:04.799> tight<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.960> want<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.259> as<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:07.590> curl

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
really tight I want to get as much curl

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.959 
really tight I want to get as much curl
definition<00:02:10.379> as<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.190> can

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:14.969 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:22.259 

secure<00:02:15.969> that<00:02:16.269> with<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.569> threat<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.849> so

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
secure that with the threat and so

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.089 
secure that with the threat and so
that's<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.689> whole<00:02:23.019> look<00:02:23.260> that's<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.859> full

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
that's the whole look that's the full

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.509 
that's the whole look that's the full
look<00:02:25.170> as<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.409> see<00:02:26.560> my<00:02:26.680> bantu<00:02:26.920> knots<00:02:27.219> are

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
look as you can see my bantu knots are

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.849 
look as you can see my bantu knots are
really<00:02:27.849> big<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.749> wanted<00:02:29.019> big<00:02:29.290> big<00:02:29.560> hair
