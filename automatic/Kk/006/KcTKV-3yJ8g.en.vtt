 Success is Santa. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.510
 in that 24 dress we publish 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.400

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.000
 You got sent to respond. 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 the sharp camera 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 the first question the target of medeiros 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.110
 in the month for you and diane adiane camera 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.840
 I was on a 1,500 calorie diet 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.090
 then she moved into a 1,300 only 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.719
 happened that he fattened what he can 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 have happened to her 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.410
 good first place we have to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.469
 investigate the type of age that was 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.170
 making the modality and intensity né 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.210
 second, it is in relation to the diet 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.010
 We people have to be aware of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.770
 that when you start the direct program 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.539
 The first week is the second week that you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 you will see the results 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.119
 it is evident that weight loss by 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 then, of course, when she 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.049
 started to do physical activity 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.689

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.450
 subjectivity definition of this process 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.970
 so what happened to her was this 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 and people the result of a diet is with the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 Time does not matter, you want to do it. 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.430
 short-term diet have resulted in 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.869
 You do not keep what we have to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.599
 the mother and the child then 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.099
 example is the caffeine or paint in 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.870

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.430
 guaraná plus hibiscus I particularly 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.769

 another bond mother daughter has both 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.269
 benefit and for the time being the only source 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.730

 It's important that this is important to us. 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.290
 Look at the next question, Rosemary Lima. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.459
 she asks next camila she loves 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.470

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.510
 good you have to be very careful with 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.150
 dried fruits have a variety and 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.000
 Caloric motherhood also the magic 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.849
 a dried fruit was rescued very good 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.590
 there are many customers in it 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.480
 and she has little calorie then the gait 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.370
 disengaged is a dedicated 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.680

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.580
 associated with silvana's next question 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.620
 camargo 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.080
 the next next question where Jorge 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.680
 I would like to know if the juice 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.060
 sachet and juices light daiti these juices 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.950
 what do we buy in powder 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.930
 it can be taken that is dieting 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.610
 or can not torah 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.560
 good people have two strands is 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.420
 theoretically we have calorie people 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.040
 Do you know who are zero calorie on tv? 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.870
 of nutrient also so I eat 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.239
 nutritionist we have to advocate 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.340
 to a healthy diet then guides and 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.900
 cissokho stand out because the station is 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.550
 objects that are entering the body of the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.110
 people passed us but did not have 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.739
 no kind of functionality of our 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.540
 body 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.880
 so people would prefer a low juice 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.200
 calories juices that you can dance with 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.260
 natural sweeteners 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.579
 the lemon juice acerola juice then I 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.859
 I give preference to this food that 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.440
 has a certain function of our body with 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.960
 acerola juice - calom with the folkloric 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.300
 with the neo sort the cell does not 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.950
 calories but she has lots of vitamin c 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.290
 You may be using natural sweetener. 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.840
 base of fructose sucralose which are 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.750
 natural sweeteners that is not interfere 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.300
 much in the final flavor of this outbreak is the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.520
 next question is maria santana 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.950
 I ask the following will wear a doubt 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.270
 She is duck taking such a flour. 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.180
 dry belly 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.780
 this full golden flaxseed meal 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.580
 black soy beans white apple should have and 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.380
 multimatta 's cuddle should have all this 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.240
 flour these flours 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.340
 they help or do not help the doctor 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.919
 usually flour also has 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.310
 Flavor has sugar you do not 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.650
 attention to this is he has a lot of fiber has 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.350
 many nutrients have a lot of mineral but 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.140
 you have to stick to the amount is 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.360
 nutritious but be careful with the 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.890
 calorie of this flour can then help 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.200
 in the process of losing weight only 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.600
 Sometimes there is a spoon in the groove there in the 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.669
 snack on the doctor a spoon just look in the 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.270
 interesting vitamin is introducing 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.130
 cool 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.530
 the last question daniel costa daniel 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.820
 next question is he loves fruit 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.210
 crystallized 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.340
 Who can lose weight? 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.100
 eat candied fruit pipeline because 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.080
 This state is also has two strands 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.940
 again is the lack of reservation in the panetone 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.610
 is that the hungry people alone 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.979
 the two are slightly dangerous two have 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.900
 a lot of calorie so if you choose to 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.190
 alone crystallized fruit she has a lot of 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.680
 subject was commented on for 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.350
 outsourced one take over sugar then you 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.060
 eats a handful a day is already the 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.729
 enough now if it's a panettone it has 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.889
 to be even more careful because the father 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:02.930
 it is also very greasy, not even more 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.449
 If it's a chocolate, then we have 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.949
 to control and stick to the quantity 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.629
 this is it people 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.129

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.949
