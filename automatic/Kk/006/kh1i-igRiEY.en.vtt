now<00:00:19.570> Sri<00:00:19.750> Lankan<00:00:20.020> fans<00:00:20.230> wouldn't<00:00:20.470> want<00:00:20.590> to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
remember that but I think they've got

remember that but I think they've got
reason<00:00:23.170> to<00:00:23.380> be<00:00:23.529> fairly<00:00:24.160> optimistic<00:00:24.310> about

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
reason to be fairly optimistic about

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.580 
reason to be fairly optimistic about
this<00:00:25.150> because<00:00:25.330> they've<00:00:25.750> got<00:00:25.900> a<00:00:25.930> good<00:00:26.140> side

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590

and<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:44.649> just<00:00:45.250> wonder<00:00:45.640> one<00:00:45.910> day<00:00:46.120> how<00:00:46.270> Sri<00:00:46.540> Lanka

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780

will be without Lasith Malinga because I

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.430 
will be without Lasith Malinga because I
think<00:00:48.730> teams<00:00:49.090> tend<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.420> say<00:00:49.540> okay<00:00:49.750> 16<00:00:50.140> overs

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.139 
think teams tend to say okay 16 overs
and<00:00:50.559> four<00:00:51.250> even<00:00:51.489> though<00:00:51.550> India<00:00:51.820> probably<00:00:51.969> of

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
and four even though India probably of

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.479 
and four even though India probably of
the<00:00:52.239> best<00:00:52.420> record<00:00:52.750> against<00:00:53.500> against<00:00:53.980> malinger

the best record against against malinger

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.860 
the best record against against malinger
but<00:00:54.910> there's<00:00:55.059> something<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.420> look<00:00:55.510> forward<00:00:55.750> to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
but there's something to look forward to

I think this Shawn is starting to look

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.740 
I think this Shawn is starting to look
like<00:01:18.100> a<00:01:18.130> runner<00:01:18.459> ball<00:01:18.759> bats<00:01:19.030> when<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.330> never

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
like a runner ball bats when you never

like a runner ball bats when you never
on<00:01:19.959> a<00:01:19.990> big<00:01:20.229> day<00:01:20.350> it's<00:01:20.500> been<00:01:20.590> such<00:01:21.009> a<00:01:21.039> good

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
on a big day it's been such a good

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.219

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
might just come and explode but he's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.190
