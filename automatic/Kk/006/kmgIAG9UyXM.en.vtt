the<00:00:12.570> playbook<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.559> write<00:00:13.769> native<00:00:14.099> code

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
the playbook you can write native code

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.310 
the playbook you can write native code
you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.820> use<00:00:15.000> Java<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.960> use<00:00:16.049> something

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
you can use Java you can use something

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.689 
you can use Java you can use something
called<00:00:16.440> web<00:00:16.680> works<00:00:16.859> which<00:00:17.220> enables<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
called web works which enables you to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.269 
called web works which enables you to
build<00:00:17.850> sort<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.810> native<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.039> web

applications<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.210> of<00:00:21.300> course<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.720> use

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
applications and of course you can use

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.050 
applications and of course you can use
html5<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.609> fair<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> say<00:00:23.939> that

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
html5 but I think it's fair to say that

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.779 
html5 but I think it's fair to say that
a<00:00:24.300> lot<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> developers<00:00:24.960> will<00:00:25.230> find<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
a lot of developers will find that the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
a lot of developers will find that the
the<00:00:27.300> fastest<00:00:27.720> way<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> develop<00:00:28.680> applications

into applications which are installers
there's<00:01:24.600> an<00:01:24.720> SDK<00:01:25.110> installer<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.740> simulator

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
there's an SDK installer and a simulator

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.130 
there's an SDK installer and a simulator
installer<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> simulator<00:01:29.009> installer

installer this the simulator installer

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
installer this the simulator installer
creates<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.200> iso<00:01:31.530> file<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.009> then<00:01:32.280> load

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
creates an iso file which you then load

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.020 
creates an iso file which you then load
up<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:33.090> vmware<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.170> here

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
playbook and you can see I have this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
playbook and you can see I have this
server<00:02:06.960> sleep<00:02:07.140> late<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.829> file<00:02:08.129> which<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
server sleep late is file which is

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.170 
server sleep late is file which is
basically<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:09.060> wrapper<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.890> reversi

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
basically just a wrapper for for reversi

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.759 
basically just a wrapper for for reversi
and<00:02:12.299> reverses<00:02:12.780> its<00:02:13.079> own<00:02:13.200> ActionScript

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and reverses its own ActionScript

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.679 
and reverses its own ActionScript
project<00:02:14.159> up<00:02:14.280> here<00:02:14.549> which<00:02:15.269> contains

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
project up here which contains

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.869 
project up here which contains
essentially<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.439> entire<00:02:16.500> game<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.189> then

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
essentially the entire game and then

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.500 
essentially the entire game and then
each<00:02:18.599> platform<00:02:18.870> dis<00:02:19.230> has<00:02:19.319> its<00:02:19.560> own<00:02:19.650> wrapper

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
each platform dis has its own wrapper

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.940 
each platform dis has its own wrapper
the<00:02:21.510> reason<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:22.019> platforms<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.769> their<00:02:22.920> own

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the reason that platforms have their own

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.949 
the reason that platforms have their own
rappers<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.549> so<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> can<00:02:23.939> do<00:02:24.629> things<00:02:24.840> like

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
rappers is so I can do things like

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.479 
rappers is so I can do things like
change<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.500> frame<00:02:25.709> rate<00:02:25.920> or<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.099> background

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
change the frame rate or the background

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.099 
change the frame rate or the background
color<00:02:26.670> depending<00:02:27.269> on<00:02:27.359> the<00:02:27.420> platform<00:02:27.900> for

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
color depending on the platform for

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.559 
color depending on the platform for
whatever<00:02:28.319> reason<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:29.579> also<00:02:30.030> have<00:02:30.329> my<00:02:30.359> own

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
whatever reason I also have my own

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.750 
whatever reason I also have my own
application<00:02:31.079> descriptor<00:02:31.379> file<00:02:31.769> as<00:02:32.069> well<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.730> I

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
application descriptor file as well so I

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.869 
application descriptor file as well so I
can<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.409> playbook<00:02:34.799> a<00:02:35.159> project<00:02:35.790> I

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
can for the for the playbook a project I

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.349 
can for the for the playbook a project I
can<00:02:36.030> set<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.379> resolution<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.180> very

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
can set the the resolution to to be very

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:40.849 
can set the the resolution to to be very
close<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.079> the<00:02:40.109> playbook<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> can

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
close to that of the playbook so I can

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.069 
close to that of the playbook so I can
sort<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.159> simulate<00:02:41.609> it<00:02:41.939> as<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.599> developing

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
sort of simulate it as I'm developing

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.869 
sort of simulate it as I'm developing
and<00:02:45.379> if<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.709> open<00:02:46.980> up<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.159> project<00:02:47.579> you'll<00:02:47.700> see

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
and if I open up this project you'll see

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.759 
and if I open up this project you'll see
that<00:02:48.000> I've<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.359> included<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> source<00:02:49.139> for

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
that I've just included the source for

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.960 
that I've just included the source for
the<00:02:49.950> raversi<00:02:50.310> game<00:02:50.489> which<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.329> here<00:02:52.970> if

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the raversi game which is right here if

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.729 
the raversi game which is right here if
I<00:02:54.180> right<00:02:54.450> click<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:55.019> look<00:02:55.169> at<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.349> properties

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
I right click and look at the properties

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.330 
I right click and look at the properties
of<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.950> project<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:57.769> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.919> see<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.129> i'm

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
of the project and you can see that i'm

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.879 
of the project and you can see that i'm
using<00:02:59.669> the<00:02:59.760> blackberry<00:03:00.060> tablet<00:03:00.269> iOS<00:03:00.629> sdk<00:03:01.109> this

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
using the blackberry tablet iOS sdk this

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.470 
using the blackberry tablet iOS sdk this
is<00:03:02.040> again<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> combination<00:03:02.879> of<00:03:03.359> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
is again this is a combination of the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.270 
is again this is a combination of the
blackberry<00:03:03.870> tablet<00:03:03.989> OS<00:03:04.230> sdk<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.739> also<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
blackberry tablet OS sdk and also the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.300 
blackberry tablet OS sdk and also the
air<00:03:05.489> 225<00:03:06.030> sdk<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.689> this<00:03:07.409> was<00:03:07.560> all<00:03:07.680> created<00:03:07.919> for

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
air 225 sdk and this was all created for

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.890 
air 225 sdk and this was all created for
me<00:03:08.459> by<00:03:08.639> the<00:03:08.669> installer<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.480> it's<00:03:09.629> actually

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
me by the installer so it's actually

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.409 
me by the installer so it's actually
very<00:03:09.930> very<00:03:10.230> simple<00:03:10.669> I've<00:03:11.669> then<00:03:11.879> set<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.150> a

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
very very simple I've then set up a

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.129 
very very simple I've then set up a
couple<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.530> debug<00:03:14.430> configurations<00:03:15.180> this

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
couple of debug configurations this

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.990 
couple of debug configurations this
reverse<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.799> playbook<00:03:17.129> configuration<00:03:17.849> which

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
reverse the playbook configuration which

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.699 
reverse the playbook configuration which
I'll<00:03:18.150> run<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.599> this<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.290> runs<00:03:19.500> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
I'll run and this just runs the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.119 
I'll run and this just runs the
application<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> desktop<00:03:21.889> and<00:03:22.889> so

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
application right on the desktop and so

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.439 
application right on the desktop and so
this<00:03:23.280> is<00:03:23.400> going<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.609> be<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> sort<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.239> typical

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
this is going to be a sort of typical

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.789 
this is going to be a sort of typical
workflow<00:03:24.780> when<00:03:25.199> you're<00:03:25.319> developing<00:03:25.500> an

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
workflow when you're developing an

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.140 
workflow when you're developing an
application<00:03:25.919> you'll<00:03:26.400> probably<00:03:26.579> just<00:03:26.790> want<00:03:27.090> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
application you'll probably just want to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.479 
application you'll probably just want to
mostly<00:03:27.510> launch<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.019> on<00:03:28.169> the<00:03:28.919> desktop<00:03:29.220> because

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
mostly launch it on the desktop because

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
mostly launch it on the desktop because
it's<00:03:29.760> nice<00:03:30.389> and<00:03:30.569> quick<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:31.019> you<00:03:31.109> can<00:03:31.260> see<00:03:31.439> that

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
it's nice and quick and you can see that

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.979 
it's nice and quick and you can see that
it's<00:03:31.709> sort<00:03:31.919> of<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.519> know<00:03:32.840> simulating<00:03:33.840> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
it's sort of you know simulating the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.949 
it's sort of you know simulating the
resolution<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:35.579> playbook<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.599> this<00:03:36.750> works

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
resolution of the playbook so this works

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.719 
resolution of the playbook so this works
nicely<00:03:37.229> and<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:38.040> what<00:03:38.189> I<00:03:38.220> actually<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.669> to

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
nicely and then what I actually want to

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.149 
nicely and then what I actually want to
run<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.239> emulator<00:03:40.009> more<00:03:41.009> in<00:03:41.099> the

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
run it on the emulator more in the

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.159 
run it on the emulator more in the
future<00:03:41.310> on<00:03:41.729> the<00:03:42.299> device<00:03:42.540> which<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.870> don't<00:03:42.930> have

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
future on the device which I don't have

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.520 
future on the device which I don't have
yet<00:03:44.120> then<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.269> can<00:03:45.449> just<00:03:45.659> use<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.079> raversi

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
yet then I can just use the raversi

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.800 
yet then I can just use the raversi
playbook<00:03:47.310> emulator<00:03:47.699> debug<00:03:48.689> configuration

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
playbook emulator debug configuration

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.849 
playbook emulator debug configuration
and<00:03:49.590> I'll<00:03:50.370> launch<00:03:50.549> that<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:52.349> then<00:03:52.530> we'll<00:03:52.680> go

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
and I'll launch that and then we'll go

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.289 
and I'll launch that and then we'll go
over<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:54.229> to<00:03:55.229> the<00:03:55.259> emulator<00:03:56.159> and<00:03:56.759> you<00:03:57.180> can

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
over to the to the emulator and you can

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:58.990
