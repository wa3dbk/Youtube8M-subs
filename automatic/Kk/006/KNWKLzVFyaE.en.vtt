00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
a you know and for me I've done a really

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.099 
a you know and for me I've done a really
consistent<00:00:17.730> look<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.240> feel<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.810> doesn't

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
consistent look and feel it doesn't

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.160

doesn't<00:00:19.289> necessarily<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170

doesn't necessarily have to be like this
but<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.320> good<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.650> some<00:00:22.890> control<00:00:23.279> over

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
