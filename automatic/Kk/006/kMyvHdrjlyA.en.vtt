that call of duty five years ago is
great<00:03:38.379> but<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.099> think<00:03:39.370> it<00:03:39.459> would<00:03:39.549> be<00:03:39.639> easier<00:03:39.669> to

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
great but I think it would be easier to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.640 
great but I think it would be easier to
get<00:03:40.239> new<00:03:40.449> people<00:03:40.659> into<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.139> game<00:03:41.349> if<00:03:41.530> they

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
get new people into this game if they

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.800
