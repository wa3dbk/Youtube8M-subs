00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello very good everyone I bring a 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.240
 an analysis of two applications for 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.610
 stop using in the terminals of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.310
 samsung the home button this physical button 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.770
 I do not like anything I do not know 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.530
 are usually played in copy of that 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.869
 paper and putting this button could put it 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.170
 all touch as they all have buttons 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.570
 of backspace and menu but not 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.440
 I understand why because it puts her physically 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.440
 good 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.170
 this application is jonas with path 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.059
 nallely know we see it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 and tell you that with that and another application 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.409
 we will have to stop using this 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.210
 button down here good we had them 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.670
 a bit the terminal is valid for you to go 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.920
 seeing the fluidity that you have do not have 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.440
 no kind of desire 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.269
 ok we see it 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.080
 we have the notifications center here 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.409
 which is to say that to me first the 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.540
 bar because I have here another of these 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.170
 the irregular launcher has been worked 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.909
 from the notification bar and good 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.869
 let's see a bit the configuration of 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.869
 This application 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 well we have a general menu where 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.800
 we can select enable it the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.810
 tactile response if we want the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.780
 glass when we tap that bar to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.760
 know that we are playing and a sound 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.229
 for when we launch an application and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.030
 other is about leaving the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.390
 moment of having hung a series of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.300
 most important additions that here we 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 have asks us to select what you see 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.880
 there we have the lower bar and or 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.800
 I have lower margin but then 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 we have margins right in the middle 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.570
 we selected and here we would appear here 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 we have where we want to put this 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.119
 bar that is going to be this panel 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.960
 in the middle where he rolls 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 well let's remove it by putting it 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.130
 down 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.410
 I advise you one thing is the advice that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.990
 you have in the center of the witnessing 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.959
 that is activated because it goes a lot 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.840
 better and finally we have a series 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.860
 of improvements that are all paid that the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.380
 we can implement or not 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.050
 to this application that already like us 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.080
 we are good we go to the menu 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.080
 principal 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.420
 and here we have this design before and there 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.530
 we have a series of applications this 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.980
 of applications we can change it 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.290
 we if not really pressed it 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.530
 illuminates in another color and already tells me that 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.440
 choose an application a shortcut these are 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.220
 of payment put for a quick entry into 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.519
 twitter all the applications for the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.920
 context to the child is worth the game are not in 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.709
 what they put after but good if 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.569
 we select here they open us list of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.200
 applications and in which is to choose the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.200
 that we want 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.220
 this when we started this application 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.920
 for the first time is to say that this all 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.439
 appears empty you have to select 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.120
 who we choose the home button 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:28.110
 for example let's go into a 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.000
 application here in pocket cash voucher and if 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.780
 you really go back to the sun 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.780
 as if you get here below 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:45.310
 we have the multitasking we have and we have 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.980
 this to have quick access to all 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.720
 the applications that you will say 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.370
 good if you already have this but you 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.829
 you imagine but if you find in this 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.739
 application in the few and we want to go 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:59.159
 to all the applications then so easy 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.159
 like this 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.129
 has no more good mystery then this 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.220
 is the first valdés wind pad application 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.080
 the other one is called virtual case víctor 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.069
 we install it but it does not appear 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.959
 icon by nowhere nor here in the 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.120
 against applications or anywhere 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.830
 it will not appear anywhere 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.260
 that is that icon is worth it because it is 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.890
 icon that we have here 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:34.040
 we do not go here for example 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.000
 we select that and we go to shortcuts and 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.610
 in shortcuts 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.640
 if we go down to the end of everything 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.620
 we have that which is virtual that if 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.800
 click here gives us to select 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:49.909
 nothing more than three three access home 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.009
 the multitasking and the search engine we mentioned 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.990
 I think what we had we would have 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:58.250
 there for example I here I have the post 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.250
 the next home 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.290
 and I have equipment this this home that you 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.180
 comes here because I like it more than a 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.180
 example this other 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:15.229
 from three virtual keys 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.300
 with colorful bottom part more 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.270
 uniform that I like more 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.650
 chosen this other but good for 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.110
 likes the colors each one can 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:29.430
 change the win 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:32.410
 and ultimately this is in the application 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:36.190
 are two remember this is one of these is 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.740
 with path and the virtual trans case 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.180
 but you have that it is usual that it is 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.940
 the only thing that gives us right now 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.970
 is the button 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.370
 of recent list of multitasking that 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.950
 is one of the ones that I like the most because if 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.350
 I like little to give the button to the image 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.360
 I like less to keep it pressed for 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.370
 with that multitasking face I'm on top of me 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.410
 hump more then I prefer in a 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.990
 audio moment here waits like this and so on 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.700
 we just finished homework today here we left 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.400
 an application and then on top it gives you the 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.820
 option to have more applications for 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.380
 that from this same panel you can 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.889
 access for example to twitter if what 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.600
 we have there 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:18.210
 you can access 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.100
 now in voices and then what you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.660
 you want to configure 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.940
 the 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.710
 the file explorer what you 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:31.680
 you want or I sincerely prefer as 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:35.880
 you see a fluid does not slow you down 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:40.200
 terminal goes very fast everything and you have to 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:42.120
 recognize that it's going to be great and good 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.090
 this is all I hope it serves you 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.800
 help in this application 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.889
 and I hope that 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:55.300
 as I used to avoid having 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:58.349
 to use the home button ds3 a greeting 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.349
 everyone and see you later
