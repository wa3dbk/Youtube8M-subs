me<00:00:54.040> too<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.489> upgraded<00:00:55.000> changed<00:00:55.540> all<00:00:55.690> these

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870

to bigger ones and upgraded to a
stronger<00:00:57.729> piece<00:00:57.879> of<00:00:58.059> metal<00:00:58.329> I<00:01:04.140> originally

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
stronger piece of metal I originally

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.910 
stronger piece of metal I originally
wanted<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.820> do<00:01:07.030> this<00:01:07.409> RC<00:01:08.409> because<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.799> thought

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
wanted to do this RC because I thought

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.890 
wanted to do this RC because I thought
it<00:01:09.009> would<00:01:09.100> be<00:01:09.250> neat<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.549> do<00:01:09.790> but<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.360> thought<00:01:10.780> it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
it would be neat to do but I thought it

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.870 
it would be neat to do but I thought it
would<00:01:10.990> be<00:01:11.140> neat<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.380> do<00:01:12.040> some<00:01:12.250> stunts<00:01:12.520> with<00:01:12.759> it

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
would be neat to do some stunts with it

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.070 
would be neat to do some stunts with it
like<00:01:13.000> they<00:01:13.119> do<00:01:13.240> with<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.420> stunt<00:01:13.659> shows<00:01:13.900> like

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
like they do with the stunt shows like

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.950 
like they do with the stunt shows like
front<00:01:14.409> stop<00:01:14.710> II<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:15.189> wheelie<00:01:15.880> I<00:01:16.330> doubt<00:01:16.780> if<00:01:16.900> I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
front stop II a wheelie I doubt if I

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.630

odds and ends on the bike in the front
here<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:25.930> notice<00:02:26.319> on<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.420> servos<00:02:28.420> I<00:02:32.760> have

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
here if you notice on the servos I have

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.530 
here if you notice on the servos I have
little<00:02:35.260> piece<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.770> rubber<00:02:36.160> tubing<00:02:36.250> like<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:37.270> gas

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
little piece of rubber tubing like a gas

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.990 
little piece of rubber tubing like a gas
tubing<00:02:38.020> have<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.040> gauge<00:02:39.310> than<00:02:39.580> what's<00:02:39.760> on<00:02:39.850> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
tubing have you gauge than what's on the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.580 
tubing have you gauge than what's on the
little<00:02:40.180> RC<00:02:40.600> there<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.900> this<00:02:40.990> is<00:02:41.170> pretty<00:02:41.500> much

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
little RC there and this is pretty much

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.400 
little RC there and this is pretty much
duplicates<00:02:42.280> what's<00:02:42.490> on<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.020> electric<00:02:44.020> RC

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
duplicates what's on the electric RC

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.310 
duplicates what's on the electric RC
that<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.650> got<00:02:44.830> there<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.600> that's<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.110> sort

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
that I got there and that's just to sort

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.620 
that I got there and that's just to sort
of<00:02:47.410> soften<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:48.670> steering<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.210> don't<00:02:49.360> want<00:02:49.510> to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
of soften the steering you don't want to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.330 
of soften the steering you don't want to
be<00:02:49.750> rigid<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.350> want<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.710> have<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.160> little

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
be rigid you want to have a little

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.730 
be rigid you want to have a little
flexibility<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.230> can<00:02:53.350> see<00:02:53.560> how<00:02:53.710> I

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
flexibility to it and you can see how I

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.380 
flexibility to it and you can see how I
just<00:02:53.800> took<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.520> rod<00:02:54.700> put<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:55.960> there

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
just took the rod put it through there

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.090 
just took the rod put it through there
put<00:02:58.390> these<00:02:58.570> two<00:02:58.810> stops<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.470> there<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.800> hold<00:02:59.950> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
put these two stops on there to hold it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.130 
put these two stops on there to hold it
in<00:03:00.190> place<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.390> know<00:03:01.420> screwed<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.020> to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
in place and just you know screwed it to

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:10.350 
in place and just you know screwed it to
the<00:03:02.260> servo<00:03:02.590> arm<00:03:05.640> up<00:03:06.640> here<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:09.760> notice<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.180> also

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
the servo arm up here you notice I also

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.310 
the servo arm up here you notice I also
still<00:03:11.670> put<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> spring<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:16.870> gives<00:03:17.080> just

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
still put a spring here so it gives just

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.720 
still put a spring here so it gives just
a<00:03:17.470> little<00:03:17.950> bit<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.190> recoil<00:03:18.640> but<00:03:18.850> not<00:03:19.000> too<00:03:19.180> much

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
a little bit of recoil but not too much

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.650 
a little bit of recoil but not too much
same<00:03:21.730> thing<00:03:21.910> as<00:03:22.030> these<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.300> don't<00:03:22.360> want<00:03:22.570> these

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
same thing as these you don't want these

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.140 
same thing as these you don't want these
so<00:03:22.900> tight<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.500> can't<00:03:23.740> steer<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.220> you

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
so tight that you can't steer it you

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.060 
so tight that you can't steer it you
know<00:03:25.240> turn<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:26.470> know<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.620> want<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:26.920> have

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
know turn it you know you want to have

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:36.150 
know turn it you know you want to have
some<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:28.570> know<00:03:29.520> light<00:03:30.520> resistance

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.130 

I<00:03:36.250> think<00:03:37.030> that's<00:03:37.210> about<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:39.810> can't<00:03:40.810> I'm<00:03:41.020> not

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
I think that's about it I can't I'm not

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.170 
I think that's about it I can't I'm not
going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.320> really<00:03:41.440> run<00:03:41.770> it<00:03:41.920> today<00:03:42.100> but<00:03:43.000> what

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
going to really run it today but what

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.660 
going to really run it today but what
I'm<00:03:43.300> gonna<00:03:43.450> do<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:47.800> turn<00:03:48.040> everything<00:03:48.220> on

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
I'm gonna do is just turn everything on

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.060 
I'm gonna do is just turn everything on
and<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:50.170> show<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.530> everything's

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
and just show you that everything's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.870 
and just show you that everything's
pretty<00:03:51.520> much<00:03:51.640> functional<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.460> I'll<00:03:54.460> start

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
pretty much functional and I'll start

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.130 
pretty much functional and I'll start
with<00:03:55.630> your<00:03:55.810> basic<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.590> turning<00:03:57.220> on<00:03:57.370> your

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
with your basic of turning on your

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.780 
with your basic of turning on your
transmitter<00:03:59.140> first<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:04.900> turning<00:04:05.320> on

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
transmitter first and then turning on

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.310 
transmitter first and then turning on
the<00:04:07.470> power<00:04:08.470> switch<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.100> battery<00:04:09.960> also<00:04:10.960> one

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
the power switch to the battery also one

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.260 
the power switch to the battery also one
other<00:04:11.350> thing<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.830> have<00:04:11.860> on<00:04:12.160> here<00:04:12.370> too<00:04:12.580> is<00:04:12.880> what's

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
other thing I have on here too is what's

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.730 
other thing I have on here too is what's
called<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.600> fail-safe<00:04:13.840> that's<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.560> little

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
called a fail-safe that's a little

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.680 
called a fail-safe that's a little
blinking<00:04:15.190> light<00:04:15.370> there<00:04:15.640> that's<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.540> in<00:04:16.660> case

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
blinking light there that's just in case

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.760 
blinking light there that's just in case
it<00:04:16.959> gets<00:04:17.049> too<00:04:17.380> far<00:04:17.620> out<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:18.510> range<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.959> know

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
it gets too far out of range you know

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.650 
it gets too far out of range you know
it's<00:04:20.980> you<00:04:21.730> really<00:04:21.940> don't<00:04:22.120> need<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.330> because

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
it's you really don't need it because

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.270 
it's you really don't need it because
you<00:04:23.200> know<00:04:23.320> most<00:04:23.710> people<00:04:23.770> aren't<00:04:24.070> going<00:04:24.220> to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
you know most people aren't going to

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.950 
you know most people aren't going to
look<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.940> don't<00:04:25.030> want<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.330> thing<00:04:25.510> to<00:04:25.540> get<00:04:25.930> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
look you don't want the thing to get a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.840 
look you don't want the thing to get a
visual<00:04:26.500> range<00:04:26.680> anyways<00:04:27.070> but<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.490> just<00:04:27.670> put<00:04:27.760> it

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
visual range anyways but I just put it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.450 
visual range anyways but I just put it
on<00:04:27.880> there<00:04:28.030> just<00:04:28.270> some<00:04:28.540> type<00:04:28.720> of<00:04:28.750> safety

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
on there just some type of safety

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.920 
on there just some type of safety
precaution<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.610> know<00:04:32.880> here<00:04:33.880> here's<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
precaution you know here here's the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.030 
precaution you know here here's the
front<00:04:35.200> wheel<00:04:35.440> it<00:04:36.160> moves<00:04:37.620> like<00:04:38.620> I<00:04:38.680> said<00:04:38.950> you

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
front wheel it moves like I said you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.070 
front wheel it moves like I said you
don't<00:04:39.130> have<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.370> turn<00:04:39.640> it<00:04:39.850> much<00:04:40.090> just<00:04:40.480> just<00:04:40.960> to

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
don't have to turn it much just just to

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.950 
don't have to turn it much just just to
get<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.410> leaning<00:04:42.390> replication<00:04:43.390> you<00:04:43.810> know

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
get that leaning replication you know

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.660 
get that leaning replication you know
replicating<00:04:44.590> how<00:04:44.770> someone<00:04:45.100> would<00:04:45.250> lean<00:04:45.460> on<00:04:45.640> a

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
replicating how someone would lean on a

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.570 
replicating how someone would lean on a
normal<00:04:45.910> motorcycle<00:04:49.950> that<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.100> rear<00:04:51.280> brake

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
normal motorcycle that the rear brake

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:02.330 
normal motorcycle that the rear brake
here

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.940 

got<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.460> front<00:05:03.640> brake<00:05:06.990> truck<00:05:07.990> was<00:05:08.560> gonna<00:05:08.710> try

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
got the front brake truck was gonna try

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.610 
got the front brake truck was gonna try
to<00:05:09.010> turn<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.400> tire<00:05:09.610> here<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.170> but<00:05:11.560> I

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
to turn the tire here for you but I

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.770 
to turn the tire here for you but I
think<00:05:11.830> well<00:05:12.030> I'll<00:05:13.030> turn<00:05:13.210> it<00:05:13.330> a<00:05:13.390> little<00:05:13.420> bit<00:05:13.750> I

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
think well I'll turn it a little bit I

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.480 
think well I'll turn it a little bit I
just<00:05:13.930> did<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.350> too<00:05:14.500> hard<00:05:14.740> and<00:05:15.010> we'll<00:05:15.130> stop<00:05:15.340> the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
just did it too hard and we'll stop the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.910 
just did it too hard and we'll stop the
whole<00:05:15.610> thing<00:05:15.790> over<00:05:19.200> stopped<00:05:20.200> it<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.740> they

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
whole thing over stopped it and they

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.970 
whole thing over stopped it and they
stopped<00:05:21.310> good<00:05:22.260> that's<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.350> most<00:05:23.530> important

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
stopped good that's the most important

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.100 
stopped good that's the most important
part<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.310> this<00:05:24.430> you<00:05:25.270> know<00:05:25.360> is<00:05:25.480> making<00:05:25.660> sure<00:05:25.930> you

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
part of this you know is making sure you

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.020 
part of this you know is making sure you
can<00:05:26.260> stop<00:05:26.500> it<00:05:27.540> I<00:05:32.370> think<00:05:33.370> that's<00:05:33.460> about<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:33.820> I

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
can stop it I think that's about it I

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.700 
can stop it I think that's about it I
think<00:05:34.060> that's<00:05:34.330> about<00:05:34.540> wraps<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.200> up<00:05:35.350> I<00:05:35.590> mean

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
think that's about wraps it up I mean

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.110 
think that's about wraps it up I mean
there<00:05:35.920> is<00:05:36.010> one<00:05:36.280> more<00:05:36.460> thing<00:05:36.730> I'd<00:05:36.880> like<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.240> do

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
there is one more thing I'd like to do

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.800 
there is one more thing I'd like to do
and<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.180> is<00:05:40.450> most<00:05:40.750> of<00:05:40.870> these<00:05:40.960> pocket<00:05:42.810> RC

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
and that is most of these pocket RC

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.380 
and that is most of these pocket RC
bikes<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.500> in<00:05:44.920> this<00:05:45.100> case<00:05:45.310> an<00:05:45.460> RC<00:05:45.790> pocket<00:05:46.210> bike

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
bikes and in this case an RC pocket bike

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.560 
bikes and in this case an RC pocket bike
you<00:05:47.260> pretty<00:05:47.500> much<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:48.430> hold<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.970> tail<00:05:49.180> of<00:05:49.450> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
you pretty much you hold the tail of the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.480 
you pretty much you hold the tail of the
bike<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:50.050> then<00:05:50.260> you<00:05:50.380> let<00:05:50.560> it<00:05:50.650> go<00:05:50.830> and<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.220> stays

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
bike and then you let it go and it stays

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.570 
bike and then you let it go and it stays
up<00:05:52.260> it<00:05:53.260> doesn't<00:05:53.440> have<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.650> gyro<00:05:54.160> in<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.400> back

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
up it doesn't have a gyro in the back

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.440 
up it doesn't have a gyro in the back
wheel<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:56.830> do<00:05:56.980> that<00:05:57.160> it's<00:05:57.340> just<00:05:57.430> momentum<00:05:58.180> and

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
wheel to do that it's just momentum and

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.900 
wheel to do that it's just momentum and
you<00:05:59.380> want<00:06:00.010> the<00:06:00.190> bike<00:06:00.400> as<00:06:00.850> much<00:06:01.360> as<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:01.960> can<00:06:02.910> to

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
you want the bike as much as you can to

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.500 
you want the bike as much as you can to
be<00:06:03.940> fully<00:06:04.870> gia<00:06:06.060> geometrical<00:06:07.060> you<00:06:07.210> want<00:06:07.390> it<00:06:07.450> to

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
be fully gia geometrical you want it to

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.710 
be fully gia geometrical you want it to
be<00:06:07.630> even<00:06:08.620> on<00:06:08.740> each<00:06:08.890> side<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.640> don't<00:06:10.510> want<00:06:10.630> to

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
be even on each side you don't want to

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.900 
be even on each side you don't want to
have<00:06:10.840> too<00:06:11.050> much<00:06:11.200> over<00:06:11.500> burn<00:06:11.650> away<00:06:11.770> or<00:06:12.070> if<00:06:12.669> you

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
have too much over burn away or if you

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.610 
have too much over burn away or if you
do<00:06:13.090> you<00:06:13.330> just<00:06:13.360> have<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:13.930> manipulate<00:06:14.200> your

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
do you just have to manipulate your

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.050 
do you just have to manipulate your
transom<00:06:15.040> that<00:06:15.160> are<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> little<00:06:15.430> bit<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.760> keep<00:06:15.910> it

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
transom that are a little bit to keep it

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.420 
transom that are a little bit to keep it
upright<00:06:16.530> but<00:06:17.530> one<00:06:17.710> of<00:06:17.800> the<00:06:17.890> things<00:06:18.040> I<00:06:18.190> want<00:06:18.370> to

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
upright but one of the things I want to

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.070 
upright but one of the things I want to
do<00:06:18.640> because<00:06:19.060> I<00:06:19.270> didn't<00:06:19.600> want<00:06:19.720> to<00:06:19.810> do<00:06:19.930> this

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
do because I didn't want to do this

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.680 
do because I didn't want to do this
little<00:06:20.350> show<00:06:20.590> thing<00:06:20.919> with<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.450> stunning<00:06:22.450> was

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
little show thing with it stunning was

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:25.600 
to have some type of system that could

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.420 
to have some type of system that could
have<00:06:27.930> when<00:06:28.930> it's<00:06:29.080> sitting<00:06:29.350> have<00:06:30.040> something

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430

have when it's sitting have something
dropped<00:06:30.700> down<00:06:30.850> to<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.150> ground<00:06:31.450> which<00:06:32.440> some

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
dropped down to the ground which some

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.320 
dropped down to the ground which some
may<00:06:32.770> be<00:06:32.830> some<00:06:33.070> casters<00:06:33.550> with<00:06:33.729> some<00:06:33.880> wheels<00:06:34.090> on

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
may be some casters with some wheels on

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.110 
may be some casters with some wheels on
it<00:06:34.540> you<00:06:34.660> know<00:06:34.830> just<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:35.890> hold<00:06:36.040> it<00:06:36.220> in<00:06:36.310> place<00:06:36.430> why

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
it you know just to hold it in place why

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.210 
it you know just to hold it in place why
it's<00:06:37.300> sitting<00:06:37.600> there<00:06:37.630> and<00:06:37.990> then<00:06:38.830> once<00:06:39.100> you

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
it's sitting there and then once you

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.219 
it's sitting there and then once you
start<00:06:39.280> going<00:06:39.640> the<00:06:40.180> wheels<00:06:40.390> come<00:06:40.690> up<00:06:40.840> I'm

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
start going the wheels come up I'm

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.300 
start going the wheels come up I'm
working<00:06:41.650> on<00:06:41.710> that<00:06:41.890> right<00:06:42.040> now

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
working on that right now

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:50.190 
working on that right now
but<00:06:43.150> uh<00:06:43.590> that's<00:06:44.590> about<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:48.720> if<00:06:49.720> you<00:06:49.840> have<00:06:50.020> any

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
the comments on YouTube hopefully I'll

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.230 
the comments on YouTube hopefully I'll
have<00:07:00.640> it<00:07:00.760> on<00:07:00.850> soon<00:07:02.310> this<00:07:03.310> here<00:07:03.580> is<00:07:03.700> the<00:07:03.850> antenna

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
have it on soon this here is the antenna

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.230 
have it on soon this here is the antenna
wire<00:07:04.860> that<00:07:05.860> picks<00:07:06.250> up<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.430> transmission<00:07:06.970> to

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
wire that picks up the transmission to

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.279 
wire that picks up the transmission to
the<00:07:07.270> receiver<00:07:07.660> from<00:07:08.229> the<00:07:08.380> transmitter<00:07:10.289> the

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
the receiver from the transmitter the

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.540 
the receiver from the transmitter the
basic<00:07:11.680> pull<00:07:11.890> start<00:07:12.220> right<00:07:12.430> there

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
basic pull start right there

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:21.279
