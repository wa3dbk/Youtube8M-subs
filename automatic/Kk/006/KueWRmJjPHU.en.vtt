00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.620
 Hello, today I want to show you 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.300
 setting geforce video card 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.810
 nvidia geforce under counter strike global 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.939
 offensive and so right click we 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.190
 click on our desktop 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.440
 pop up under the menu here we see 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.360
 nvidia control panel if it is you 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.480
 no, then you have to or another 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.930
 video card or do you need to move in 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.610
 screen resolution in additional 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 parameters and here it is here 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.070
 There should be a submenu but I have 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:54.010
 for some reason it is not even though I have a 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.930
 the menu here so open the panel 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.739
 control nvidia or inlet write 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.869
 nvidia here is the nvidia control panel 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.660
 then we open our setting 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.590
 video cards where in principle we can 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.680
 tune 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.850
 literally everything you need in terms of graphics 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:19.180
 in counter-strik, although of course it makes sense 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.320
 this go contest has been abolished enough 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.940
 as the video card setting habit 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.710
 more precisely configure the video card us 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.190
 left from counter strike 1 6 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.680
 although in the counter-strike go all settings 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.340
 video card except one that will show 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.710
 a little later there is the game itself in counter 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.320
 strike 1 6 there were no such settings 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:46.000
 so it is the video settings you need 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.960
 it was to tune a particular game but 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.909
 all the same 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:56.650
 so we move we move to management 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.420
 3d parameters here we can supply 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.810
 all at least then we absolutely 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.119
 all games including your other games in 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.299
 who are you used to playing beautiful 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.579
 resolution with nice graphics also 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.340
 deteriorate so I suggest all the same 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.049
 go to program settings right here 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.120
 select counter strike global offensive 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:20.890
 or add how or 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.110
 if again there is no review 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.799
 specify the desired file to from the head to the folder 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.000
 steam and also here you just need everything 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.269
 turn off strict filtering 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.410
 vertical 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.530
 impulse smoothing and so on 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.489
 literally put everything on 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.620
 put here at least high 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.919
 performance mode 1st display 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.449
 performance filtering texture 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:50.220
 here I have included on the base for what 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:54.420
 turn off all put on the menu 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.620
 and again all the same settings again 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 ask for buckwheat oskol 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.000
 herself in advanced settings with a goal 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.590
 substitute everything again to a minimum 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:14.190
 probably the most useful setting in 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:16.080
 kazgu which is the video card this this 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.010
 river color adjustment 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.410
 desktop 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.990
 here we are all by default except one 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.100
 digital settings 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.090
 intensity or digital vibrance 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.180
 in English who has the English version 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.870
 Drivers change from zero to one hundred 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:36.950
 default 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:39.600
 default top 5050 the default 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.190
 I do not know whether you saw how it changes 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.870
 the color of the image is most likely not 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.510
 changing but on my monitor 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.490
 enough color the colors become very 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.709
 saturated with whom new monitors can 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.900
 put there 7580 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.209
 since my monitoring is too old 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.310
 therefore I exhibit what does it give 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.709
 counter-strike go it literally gives 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.120
 much better picture for brighter and more fun 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.920
 and the most important thing 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.220
 much better views of the model 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.900
 adversary on map textures therefore 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.380
 I advise everyone to play with this 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.260
 setting and so do absolutely everything 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.459
 professional players therefore this 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.690
 setting is very important 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.410
 and surely that you can 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 interest this setting 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.430
 scaling the screen here it is 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.099
 Does that person have a monitor? 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.449
 does not automatically narrow the image here 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:43.509
 there need permission is not 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:47.830
 widescreen then this setting 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:50.050
 image format and accordingly 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.620
 video card should help narrowing 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.620
 monitors 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:02.430
 well, actually stay on it 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.430
