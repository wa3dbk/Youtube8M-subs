and the eight about a quarter of an inch

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.720 
and the eight about a quarter of an inch
if<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> big<00:02:10.950> table<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.489> want<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
if you're on a big table you want to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.450 
if you're on a big table you want to
have<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.720> tighter<00:02:13.140> game

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
have a little bit tighter game

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.890 
have a little bit tighter game
if<00:02:13.700> you're<00:02:13.850> on<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.060> small<00:02:14.360> table<00:02:14.570> like<00:02:14.870> a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
if you're on a small table like a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.270 
if you're on a small table like a
7-footer<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> want<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> have<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> little<00:02:16.220> bit

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
7-footer you want to have a little bit

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.940 
7-footer you want to have a little bit
wider<00:02:16.550> gap<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.480> you'll<00:02:18.020> see<00:02:18.230> why<00:02:18.380> in<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.590> second

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
wider gap and you'll see why in a second

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.490 
wider gap and you'll see why in a second
that's<00:02:19.070> important<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.120> we<00:02:20.210> go<00:02:20.300> like<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
that's important so we go like this and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.200 
that's important so we go like this and
these<00:02:21.950> gentle<00:02:22.340> taps<00:02:22.580> don't<00:02:22.910> really<00:02:23.090> hurt

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
these gentle taps don't really hurt

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.640 
these gentle taps don't really hurt
anything<00:02:23.480> on<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> table<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.320> sets<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
anything on the table it just sets the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.080 
anything on the table it just sets the
balls<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:24.980> position<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.700> they<00:02:25.790> don't<00:02:25.970> move

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
balls in position so they don't move

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.320 
balls in position so they don't move
around<00:02:26.470> with<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> space<00:02:27.830> between<00:02:28.190> them<00:02:28.340> now<00:02:29.180> if

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
around with a space between them now if

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.960 
around with a space between them now if
you<00:02:29.450> look<00:02:29.570> at<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.810> setup<00:02:30.370> you've<00:02:31.370> got<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> kind

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
you look at this setup you've got a kind

you look at this setup you've got a kind
of<00:02:32.030> an<00:02:32.120> X<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.690> 1/8<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.620> 5<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.040> has<00:02:34.070> one

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
of an X the 1/8 and the 5 it has one

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.060 
of an X the 1/8 and the 5 it has one
line<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.300> an<00:02:35.390> X<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.230> other<00:02:36.380> X<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.770> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
line of an X here and the other X is the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.530 
line of an X here and the other X is the
other<00:02:37.190> line<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.580> here<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:37.970> X<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.480> X

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
other line is here of the X so this X

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.620 
other line is here of the X so this X
and<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.560> want<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.770> make<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.010> 8-ball<00:02:40.630> to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
my right in this corner you would put

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.430 
my right in this corner you would put
the<00:02:43.430> cue<00:02:43.670> ball<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.630> left<00:02:44.840> side<00:02:45.020> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> X

facing the first ball here if you'd want
to<00:02:48.080> make<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> 8<00:02:48.380> ball<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.740> side<00:02:48.980> pocket

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
to make the 8 ball in this side pocket

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.760 
to make the 8 ball in this side pocket
you<00:02:50.240> would<00:02:50.360> place<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.720> cube<00:02:50.960> over<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:51.650> on

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
you would place the cube over here on

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.220 
you would place the cube over here on
this<00:02:52.430> line<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.970> X<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.510> when<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> 5<00:02:53.930> hits

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
this line of the X and when the 5 hits

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.410 
this line of the X and when the 5 hits
here<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.620> 8<00:02:54.770> goes<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.400> left<00:02:56.030> over<00:02:56.300> this

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
here the 8 goes to my left over this

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.120 
here the 8 goes to my left over this
side<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.990> then<00:02:57.320> on<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.440> other<00:02:57.530> side<00:02:57.710> table

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
side and then on the other side table

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.940 
side and then on the other side table
you<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.340> both<00:02:58.550> back<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.910> forth<00:02:59.180> now

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
you do both back and forth now

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.140 
you do both back and forth now
interesting<00:03:00.950> part<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.220> this<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.790> how

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
interesting part of this is that how

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.790 
interesting part of this is that how
does<00:03:02.210> this<00:03:02.420> actually<00:03:02.660> work<00:03:02.870> well<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.350> call<00:03:03.680> this

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
does this actually work well I call this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800 
does this actually work well I call this
a<00:03:03.860> clearance<00:03:04.310> shot<00:03:04.580> you<00:03:05.000> actually<00:03:05.360> clear<00:03:05.690> out

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
a clearance shot you actually clear out

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.840 
a clearance shot you actually clear out
some<00:03:06.020> balls<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.620> way<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.340> then<00:03:07.610> after

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
some balls out of the way and then after

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.850 
some balls out of the way and then after
you<00:03:07.940> clear<00:03:08.120> the<00:03:08.240> balls<00:03:08.450> out<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.840> way<00:03:08.990> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
you clear the balls out of the way the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.260 
you clear the balls out of the way the
8-ball<00:03:10.250> does<00:03:10.460> a<00:03:10.490> kind<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.820> an<00:03:10.970> interesting

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
8-ball does a kind of an interesting

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.850 
8-ball does a kind of an interesting
little<00:03:11.600> thing<00:03:11.870> called<00:03:12.050> for<00:03:12.290> tangent<00:03:12.680> lines

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
little thing called for tangent lines

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.010 
little thing called for tangent lines
the<00:03:13.010> double<00:03:13.310> tangent<00:03:13.700> line<00:03:13.790> shot<00:03:14.090> when<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
the double tangent line shot when the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.900 
the double tangent line shot when the
cue<00:03:15.230> ball<00:03:15.380> strikes<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:16.010> seven<00:03:16.520> ball<00:03:16.640> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
cue ball strikes the seven ball the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.670 
cue ball strikes the seven ball the
first<00:03:17.150> ball<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.420> move<00:03:17.720> besides<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.290> cue<00:03:18.500> ball

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
first ball to move besides the cue ball

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160 
first ball to move besides the cue ball
is<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.610> course<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> seven<00:03:20.330> ball<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.720> when<00:03:21.080> the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
is of course the seven ball and when the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.350 
is of course the seven ball and when the
seven<00:03:21.470> ball<00:03:21.590> moves<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.610> moves<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:22.970> three<00:03:23.240> and

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
seven ball moves it moves the three and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.300 
seven ball moves it moves the three and
the<00:03:23.420> three<00:03:23.540> goes<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.960> way<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:25.100> five

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
the three goes this way and the five

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.340 
the three goes this way and the five
goes<00:03:25.550> that<00:03:25.820> way<00:03:26.000> then<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> seven<00:03:27.110> ball<00:03:27.170> hits

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
goes that way then the seven ball hits

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.110 
goes that way then the seven ball hits
the<00:03:27.440> eight<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.250> eight<00:03:28.400> ball<00:03:28.640> does<00:03:28.880> what's

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
the eight and the eight ball does what's

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.540 
the eight and the eight ball does what's
called<00:03:29.210> a<00:03:29.390> double<00:03:29.740> carom<00:03:30.740> off<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.220> these<00:03:31.340> two

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
called a double carom off of these two

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.830 
called a double carom off of these two
balls<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:31.910> goes<00:03:32.030> in<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.240> corner<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:32.720> by

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
balls and goes in the corner so by

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.360 
balls and goes in the corner so by
clearing<00:03:33.260> this<00:03:33.380> out<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.710> way<00:03:33.860> called<00:03:34.280> the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
clearing this out of the way called the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.340 
clearing this out of the way called the
cleared<00:03:34.610> shot<00:03:34.880> part<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.240> this<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.080> ball

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
cleared shot part of this the a ball

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.560 
cleared shot part of this the a ball
then<00:03:36.560> follows<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.070> tangent<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.090> four

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
then follows the tangent to the four

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.810 
then follows the tangent to the four
ball<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.080> then<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.500> tangent<00:03:40.100> which<00:03:40.550> is<00:03:40.700> the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
ball and then the tangent which is the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.010 
ball and then the tangent which is the
ninety<00:03:41.030> degree<00:03:41.090> off<00:03:41.390> this<00:03:41.570> ball<00:03:41.810> goes<00:03:41.960> right

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
ninety degree off this ball goes right

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.620 
ninety degree off this ball goes right
to<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.350> corner<00:03:42.710> so<00:03:43.130> when<00:03:43.280> you<00:03:43.370> shoot<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
to the corner so when you shoot that the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.000 
to the corner so when you shoot that the
eight<00:03:44.720> ball<00:03:44.930> goes<00:03:45.170> right<00:03:45.440> off<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.710> double

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
eight ball goes right off the double

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.010 
eight ball goes right off the double
tangent<00:03:46.430> just<00:03:46.610> like<00:03:46.760> this<00:03:47.030> and<00:03:47.270> it<00:03:47.630> goes<00:03:47.780> back

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
tangent just like this and it goes back

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.830 
tangent just like this and it goes back
into<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:48.830> corner<00:03:49.100> pocket<00:03:49.130> like<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:50.090> what

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
into the corner pocket like that so what

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.480 
into the corner pocket like that so what
you<00:03:50.990> don't<00:03:51.140> see<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.830> when<00:03:52.070> you<00:03:52.160> do<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.310> all

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
you don't see is that when you do it all

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.860 
you don't see is that when you do it all
fast<00:03:52.730> because<00:03:53.090> you've<00:03:53.210> got<00:03:53.360> those<00:03:53.480> other<00:03:53.660> two

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
fast because you've got those other two

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.030 
fast because you've got those other two
balls<00:03:54.080> in<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.380> way<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.740> they're<00:03:54.890> actually

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
balls in the way and they're actually

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.640 
balls in the way and they're actually
creating<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:56.090> blockage<00:03:56.600> for<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.140> shot<00:03:57.350> so

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
creating the blockage for the shot so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.690 
creating the blockage for the shot so
when<00:03:57.770> we<00:03:57.890> focus<00:03:58.100> on<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.370> whole<00:03:58.520> thing

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
when we focus on the whole thing

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.610 
when we focus on the whole thing
together<00:03:58.850> we<00:03:59.510> don't<00:03:59.690> see<00:03:59.810> the<00:03:59.930> double<00:04:00.230> tangent

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
together we don't see the double tangent

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.130 
together we don't see the double tangent
effect<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.550> is<00:04:01.730> a<00:04:01.760> great<00:04:01.970> shot<00:04:02.300> it<00:04:02.660> became

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
effect so this is a great shot it became

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.600 
effect so this is a great shot it became
a<00:04:03.200> mainstay<00:04:03.740> in<00:04:03.860> my<00:04:03.980> arsenal<00:04:04.220> when<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:04.490> just

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610
