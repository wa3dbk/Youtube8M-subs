that Lapras and then the blizzards gonna
be<00:06:37.020> huge<00:06:37.349> on<00:06:37.500> Santino<00:06:37.860> Quinn<00:06:38.070> so<00:06:38.700> earthquake

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
be huge on Santino Quinn so earthquake

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.520 
be huge on Santino Quinn so earthquake
flappers<00:06:41.160> gonna<00:06:41.370> get<00:06:41.550> hit<00:06:41.729> up<00:06:41.759> really<00:06:42.270> hard

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530

Jolteon going to get knocked out from it
but<00:06:45.419> now<00:06:45.720> I<00:06:45.750> think<00:06:45.900> the<00:06:46.169> blizzard<00:06:46.530> range<00:06:46.770> is

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
but now I think the blizzard range is

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:47.480 
but now I think the blizzard range is
real

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.490 
real

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.330

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340
