 When is a list of several countries 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.000
 if the required country is not listed 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 here you can select the full list of countries 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.340
 pressing an additional button 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.010
 after choosing a country 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.870
 a list of cities in this country appears

 you can scroll through it 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.680
 or write the first letter of the city lepisto

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.510
 automatically 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.690
 this is a program setting 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.690
 are finished 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.270
 the main program window appears 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289
 first in this window 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.270
 It is written that it is receiving half a copy 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.350
 but after a few seconds 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.780
 the inscription disappears 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.250
 and the weather forecast appears 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.910
 in the first part we see a list of days 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.100
 temperature and residue data 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.860
 day 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 if practicing conditions 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950
 then the right side will be shown 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 Detailed description of daytime night 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.440
 temperatures 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.310
 clear and temperature speeds and 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.230
 wind direction 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.650
 in the lower part 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.260
 while you are a barometer view of the graph for the last 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.500
 24 hours 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.929
 million colors guys if the pressure 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.490
 changing and changing little 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.610
 if the pressure increases strongly or 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.460
 falls 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.080
 then the graph is colored in 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.690
 Red color 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.010
 it allows you to understand the reason 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.490
 feeling unwell 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.169
 weather change 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.689
 for example the pressure drop leads 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.439
 bad weather rain if not 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.739
 just replace 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.739
 its peak is good cloudless weather 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:20.719
 as we see 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.389
 because of the strong wind 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
 the temperature will be much colder 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.389
 what actually 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.180
 in the lower part 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.319
 there are also three buttons 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:34.180
 Euro 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.540
 allows you to show 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.540
 quality was forecast for the next 48 hours 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:41.769
 using any of that forecast 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.510
 You can find out how to start 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.919
 rain 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.009
 or snow them plan stump 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.209
 depending on that 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.389
 instead of a temperature graph 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.699
 if on the icon of the day but also canteens 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.049
 nutritional sign 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.870
 so this and penalties have a warning about 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.159
 dangerous weather events 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.859
 you can see them 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.619
 clicking on mediocre 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:07.419
 if it is possible to fix the vein 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.799
 several light shadows changing click 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.139
 topics by title 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.789
 several themes are available and issue 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.089
 black white 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.180
 me for example 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.909
 like black and white movies 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.089
 more advanced settings available 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.449
 by name 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.029
 you can change the language of the program unit 

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:26.569
 pressure temperature measurement 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:27.889
 jackets 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.019
 weather display icons 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.650
 for example the theme character looks like this is very 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.509
 simply 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:34.489
 eg 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.729
 special style of programs 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.659
 to add extra city 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.529
 just select the command in the menu, add 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:42.289
 corr 

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:45.439
 for example, we specify Russia 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.949
 and Petersburg 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.099
 then through the menu you can rename 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.029
 of the year 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.849
 when we close the program 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.179
 are you sure the weather is now displayed 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:57.189

 shown as current conditions and as forecast 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.969
 for the coming days 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:03.229
 so now 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.309
 to find out what's going on outside 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.979
 no need to look closely to 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.759
 the way the trees swing and if drops 

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:12.389
 rain puddles you can just look at 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.519
 communicator 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.440

 three day work period 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.420
 outflow in front of her 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.640
