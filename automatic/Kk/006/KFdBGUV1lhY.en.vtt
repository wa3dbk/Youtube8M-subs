canned<00:01:25.619> vegetables<00:01:26.189> there<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.580> feel<00:01:27.119> like

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
canned vegetables there I feel like

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.210 
canned vegetables there I feel like
they're<00:01:27.479> kind<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.990> lightly<00:01:28.409> cooked<00:01:28.890> it's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
they're kind of like lightly cooked it's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
they're kind of like lightly cooked it's
not<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.640> fresh<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> cook<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
not like fresh or you have to cook it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.859 
not like fresh or you have to cook it
all<00:01:30.780> day<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.430> potatoes<00:01:32.970> takes<00:01:33.329> longer

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
all day so the potatoes takes longer

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.319 
all day so the potatoes takes longer
than<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.680> beans<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.280> corn<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.939> done<00:01:36.150> in

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329

than the beans and corn to get done in
the<00:01:36.390> oven<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.350> why<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.619> gonna

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the oven so that's why I'm just gonna

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.010 
the oven so that's why I'm just gonna
steam<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.340> lightly<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:39.390> five<00:01:39.720> minutes

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
steam it lightly for about five minutes

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109

just<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.770> soften<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.549> little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just to soften it up a little bit and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.060 
just to soften it up a little bit and
then<00:01:42.479> I'm<00:01:42.659> gonna<00:01:42.960> put<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.680> casserole
