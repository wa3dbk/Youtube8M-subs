00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760 

I<00:00:00.269> got<00:00:00.780> involved<00:00:00.960> in<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.230> project<00:00:01.560> of<00:00:01.620> the

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I got involved in the project of the

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.910 
I got involved in the project of the
game<00:00:01.949> and<00:00:02.570> for<00:00:03.570> sure<00:00:03.720> it's<00:00:04.170> going<00:00:04.440> to<00:00:04.529> be<00:00:04.650> a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
game and for sure it's going to be a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.249 
game and for sure it's going to be a
really<00:00:05.520> really<00:00:05.730> exciting<00:00:06.540> game<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.020> think

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
really really exciting game and I think

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.690 
really really exciting game and I think
we're<00:00:07.799> trying<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.099> make<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.340> as<00:00:08.460> real<00:00:08.670> as

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
we're trying to make it as real as

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180 
we're trying to make it as real as
possible<00:00:08.910> for<00:00:09.480> whoever<00:00:10.380> cannot<00:00:10.740> drive<00:00:10.980> off<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
possible for whoever cannot drive off a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.950 
possible for whoever cannot drive off a
hat<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.580> circuit<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:12.690> they<00:00:12.840> just

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
hat in the circuit I think they just

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.870 
hat in the circuit I think they just
people<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.710> going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> go<00:00:14.519> nuts<00:00:14.670> when

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
people are just going to go nuts when

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210 
people are just going to go nuts when
they<00:00:15.030> play<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.900> game<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.680> experience

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
they play the game and if the experience

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.130 
they play the game and if the experience
that<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> game<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.840> one<00:00:19.109> of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
that the game is is not like one of

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.900 
that the game is is not like one of
those<00:00:19.350> easy<00:00:19.710> games<00:00:20.100> where<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.640> sit<00:00:20.880> down

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
those easy games where you just sit down

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.090 
those easy games where you just sit down
and<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.289> good<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.800> need<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and you get very good at it you need to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.529 
and you get very good at it you need to
put<00:00:23.279> effort<00:00:23.609> into<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> need<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.330> spend

luck<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.509> Lewis<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.490> no<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
luck for Lewis but no one is is a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.499 
luck for Lewis but no one is is a
mistake-free<00:01:53.340> everybody<00:01:53.880> makes<00:01:54.090> mistakes

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
mistake-free everybody makes mistakes

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
mistake-free everybody makes mistakes
either<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.170> driver<00:01:55.409> team<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> looser<00:01:56.729> than

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
either the driver team and looser than

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.389 
either the driver team and looser than
two<00:01:57.299> vital<00:01:57.630> mistakes<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.320> his<00:01:58.350> career<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
two vital mistakes in his career in this

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.020 
two vital mistakes in his career in this
year<00:01:59.670> where<00:02:00.600> he<00:02:00.630> lost<00:02:01.439> championship<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.159> what

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
year where he lost championship but what

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
year where he lost championship but what
else<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.299> he<00:02:03.390> hit<00:02:03.509> us<00:02:03.750> from<00:02:04.020> him<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.350> it's

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
else can he hit us from him because it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.700 
else can he hit us from him because it's
his<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:05.070> year<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.549> he's<00:02:06.240> done<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.600> well<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
his first year and he's done so well so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.619 
his first year and he's done so well so
I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.890> second<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.670> championship<00:02:08.700> from

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
I think second in the championship from

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.820 
I think second in the championship from
by<00:02:10.020> one<00:02:10.200> point<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.800> just<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.970> close<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
by one point it's just so close in it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.030 
by one point it's just so close in it
I<00:02:12.890> think<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.940> has<00:02:14.420> been<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:15.320> good<00:02:15.890> year

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I think really has been a very good year

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.940 
I think really has been a very good year
for<00:02:16.280> them<00:02:16.490> for<00:02:16.820> him<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.320> Alonzo<00:02:18.320> it's<00:02:18.620> pretty

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
for them for him and Alonzo it's pretty

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.420 
for them for him and Alonzo it's pretty
obvious<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:20.560> Louis<00:02:21.560> coming<00:02:21.800> into<00:02:22.100> Formula

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
obvious that Louis coming into Formula

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.880 
obvious that Louis coming into Formula
One<00:02:22.610> especially<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.050> many<00:02:24.200> years<00:02:24.440> without<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
One especially so many years without the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.770 
One especially so many years without the
British<00:02:26.230> champion<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.410> would<00:02:28.160> make<00:02:28.730> make<00:02:29.540> him<00:02:29.690> a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
British champion I would make make him a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.710 
British champion I would make make him a
phenomenon<00:02:30.500> he<00:02:30.680> especially<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> UK

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
phenomenon he especially in the UK

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.550 
phenomenon he especially in the UK
absolutely<00:02:32.720> everywhere<00:02:33.050> else<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.350> world

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
absolutely everywhere else in the world

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.860 
absolutely everywhere else in the world
he's<00:02:33.860> admired<00:02:34.490> but<00:02:34.790> he<00:02:35.030> especially<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.660> can

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
he's admired but he especially I can

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.890 
he's admired but he especially I can
stay<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> pressure<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.710> much<00:02:36.950> bigger<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.390> I

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
stay the pressure is much bigger but I

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.290 
stay the pressure is much bigger but I
think<00:02:39.530> he<00:02:40.220> deserves<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.790> attention<00:02:40.880> he's

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
think he deserves the attention he's

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.450 
think he deserves the attention he's
getting<00:02:41.330> he<00:02:42.080> has<00:02:42.650> done<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> really<00:02:43.070> really<00:02:43.280> good

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
getting he has done a really really good

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.860 
getting he has done a really really good
job<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:45.110> believe<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.130> obviously<00:02:46.640> all<00:02:47.570> the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
job and I believe that obviously all the

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.480 
job and I believe that obviously all the
conditions<00:02:48.020> went<00:02:48.500> right<00:02:48.710> he's<00:02:49.100> not<00:02:49.280> very

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
conditions went right he's not very

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.760 
conditions went right he's not very
often<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.970> come<00:02:50.330> into<00:02:50.930> Formula<00:02:51.500> One<00:02:51.650> and

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
often that you come into Formula One and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.010 
often that you come into Formula One and
you<00:02:51.890> sit<00:02:52.250> in<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.490> championship<00:02:53.390> winning<00:02:53.750> car

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
you sit in a championship winning car

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.130 
you sit in a championship winning car
but<00:02:55.010> he's<00:02:55.880> done<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.209> out<00:02:56.360> that<00:02:56.510> his<00:02:56.750> beating

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
but he's done so out that his beating

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.400 
but he's done so out that his beating
his<00:02:57.350> his<00:02:58.310> teammate<00:02:58.700> which<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> which<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.380> a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
his his teammate which was a which is a

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.050 
his his teammate which was a which is a
2<00:03:01.070> times<00:03:01.340> world<00:03:01.910> champion<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.430> with<00:03:04.430> much

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
2 times world champion and with much

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.449 
2 times world champion and with much
less<00:03:05.270> experienced<00:03:05.810> informal<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:06.920> alone

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
less experienced informal one then alone

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.000 
less experienced informal one then alone
so<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.630> really<00:03:08.810> shows<00:03:09.020> that<00:03:09.140> he's<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.410> very

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
