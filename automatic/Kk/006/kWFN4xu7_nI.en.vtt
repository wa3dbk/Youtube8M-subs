00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello friends hall youtube is back 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.600
 seriously today with a little tutorial 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.580
 special 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.920
 and I want to show you today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 how you play xbox 360 and there 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.889
 mind you currently supported 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.299
 become 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 I would like her here now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.900
 Show off a little here 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.660
 Overview of the list currently has 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.180
 currently supported so if you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.240
 in the beta program since the sport of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.160
 xbox to then you can currently following 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.550
 mirrors that have just been displayed 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.649
 on this list on your xbox 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.610
 install or download 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.430
 betrayed around 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
 it must be said now if you 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.629
 Of course you have acquired the games 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.730
 that means if they are in the download yes 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.410
 some players if you have this in the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.090
 download you can have them purchased 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.440
 Download now on the xbox and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 install and play 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.579
 Of course I want you first 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.430
 show what an xbox 360 game as well 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.890
 know what is going on in 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.829
 In my case it is mass effect 1 currently 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 will only mass effect 1 ins 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.960
 supports and thus I will 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.510
 now put in the drive once you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.210
 a game inserts what is currently on the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.320
 xbox com is supported by the xbox 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.810
 360 then this nice note appears 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.939
 and so you can now almost the 7 6 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.890
 Install gb 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.960
 here is now that it downloaded 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 So this will be 7.6 gigabytes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.439
 actually downloaded that can 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.790
 Of course, take some time 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.329
 that's why which one is which 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.329
 head Start 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.689
 after the game is complete then 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.470
 was downloaded 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.909
 So in that case the 7.6 gigabytes then 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.780
 The game is already directly in the area 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.210
 to start 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.420
 you have the whole system like this 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.880
 Of course, then we go biologically 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.090
 then simply sorted alphabetically and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.649
 you then mass effect play the like 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.119
 said before the 360 have come then 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 always on the left side so currently 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.509
 Of course, that can happen later 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.610
 change but currently they have on the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.819
 left side and wanner in it that one 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
 xbox 360 games and yes if you can do it then 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.010
 would start now then it will directly 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 start 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.700
 you always have to have the disc in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.950
 have that drive is very important in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.260
 this case so if it comes from cd 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
 as with the export of play the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.769
 Diskus will be in the drive though 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.459
 completely installed, but so much of the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.190
 drive is exactly the start now 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.329
 times that country he is aiming at that is 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.329
 as with the xbox com is 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.830
 he is now sitting here xbox 360 the logo 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 appropriate 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.190
 meyer clearly because earlier the game is yes 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.190
 so started 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.100
 and so on and so forth 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.270
 Well then, as I said , I just wanted that 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.740
 Show exactly one thing it will be 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.200
 Of course, games also have cloud 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.810
 memory function that means 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.830
 play this key here now 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.020
 the stupid memory levels are currently from 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.030
 Munich except for one or two games 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.290
 if you are still on the 360 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.410
 has played and now on the well 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.270
 play wolf, these provided the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.880
 memory city stored in the cloud 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.860
 he will be taken over with that too 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.180
 is also a pretty cool thing that 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.140
 the hostess has become open 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.760
 synchronized so now I want you 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.040
 that still shows it looks like if you're one 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.130
 have you already on the xbox 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.560
 360 online has bought this you can 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.360
 then, of course, as always said 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.160
 still emphasis is on beta program 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.890
 currently this will be in autumn for everyone 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.670
 come and / or even later me 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.560
 do not know exactly 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.780
 In any case, you will see here then 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.000
 download games now for example the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.070
 toy soldiers cold was that's natural 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.890
 and one in the list that I indeed you 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.570
 have shown of it and so it is her 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.240
 then you can just click on it and 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.920
 if they take longer 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.230
 because of course it's also under loaded 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.540
 works almost as well as with 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.910
 an installation of a game and 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.280
 Of course, then also under 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.650
 the queue reappears here 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.720
 you see the progress and the game 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.260
 then installed 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 so I hope this little insight has 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.330
 you like it 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.940

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.690
 xbox man finally it is there so me 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.730
 think that's really awesome very cool 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.900
 cause, because we can with us 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.000
