00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hence the line belezinha brazuca is not for 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.549
 You're going to be making a video today. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 good for you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.719
 the video there when you're already 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 tired let's say that way to eat 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.750
 that chicken you making chicken 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.730
 always grilled in your house imagine the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 that you should already be tired of eating 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.010
 only on chicken and you are maybe not 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 do as I do I do it this way 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.470
 Sometimes I eat like two days ago and like chicken 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.080
 two days I eat red meat 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.180
 after two days it 's like fish so it 's 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 give a check-up so you do not get sick of the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 chicken nÃ© 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.120
 Can you be making this meal? 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.670
 What are you doing here in your 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.440
 diet will you and you adapt and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.120
 maybe put in your diet 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.399
 So what I 'm doing here is linked to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.800
 this panela here a panela that makes 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.629
 Steam food does not make steak do 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 It's simply cooking the food there 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.670
 A little below we put water and 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 there are two contents on top I put 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 the vegetables and underneath this here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 Is there I have down here the fish 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.100
 I'll show you what kind of fish is 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.710
 is a tilapia is a fish of this type you 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 You can find in your grocery store I 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 I'm sure you'll find a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.530
 so fish a tilapia instead of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 you do is in the frying pan or something 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.280
 you can do a bad way more 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.790
 Let's just say that natural 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.880
 then the vegetables are there the carrot broccoli 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.110
 and other more normal vegetables 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.090
 here you can also find 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 supermarket without problem the only 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.710
 here I am going to make my own 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.259
 I make my way and not put 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.119
 no kind of seasoning then maybe 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.920
 Do you have your chicken in your house? 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 also does not put any type of seasoning 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.390
 and does not use any type of seasoning 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 so I'll put it here it'll be 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.079
 how to get here I'll put these 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 containers and I'll show you how it is 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.250
 that I do separate them here I found 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.619
 mine and I keep them in the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.719
 refrigerator and light at work or who 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.060
 You know there during the day as I already mentioned 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.130
 in other videos and you can use it 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.140
 to eat during the day you already know the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.240
 meal you are ingesting there 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.599
 the amount in the case of proteins have 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.330
 here the fish has here the 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.650
 nutrition facts in the case would be the form 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 nutritional 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 one gram of protein in each fish 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.549
 10 grams of carbohydrates means a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.290
 excellent in case for your diet who 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.659
 Do you know even my friend there? 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.579
 making a clarion call or even not 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.069
 is making a barrel but want to use here 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:32.010
 fish substitute another form 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.470
 chicken or even red meat 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.390
 so when it's ready for me 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.250
 I will bring you here for you to see 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.109
 I do not know where I bought the pot 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.359
 unfortunately I bought here think 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.280
 It was in a little shop here near my house. 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.440
 I have this one here is this way they have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.639
 different leads and have this here is 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.170
 bamboo that you see there, okay, there's a 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.720
 similarly but you have to 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.120
 use another deep pan where 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.319
 you put the water is also works 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.599
 the same way just like this here 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.670
 this is more easy practice to do 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.680
 so we use more this one is more 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.329
 easy to wash and takes up less space I 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.329
 I always find out people sit outside. 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.099
 using this then I'll do it here 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.810
 Let it cook, it's all here. 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.900
 inside I show to you how I 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.629
 I'll make the separation of the food beauty 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.859
 We ended up here now to do it. 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.840
 Turn it off, it's hot now 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.750
 be very careful if you have a straw 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.250
 10 or if you do something similar 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.599
 It is what I'm doing quite a bit 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.949
 Careful then, why are you going to be well? 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.829
 Hot the father, right? 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:40.500
 is using a cloth here 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.209
 I have an idea how I said it's fine 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:50.120
 Warm up, I'll put it here on my 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:50.120
 here we have the vegetables 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:57.599
 together with the fish 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:05.430
 Let's open some of the water space. 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:07.859
 warm is here by the sink and there 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.790
 we have the vegetables and we have the fish now 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.129
 It's quite easy for you to do the separation. 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.459
 in your container in case I in my 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:22.139
 diet I use two pieces of fish 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.450
 usually a glass to a glass I did not sign 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.480
 12 cups right 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.130
 two glasses 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.080
 I have to measure a glass of measures if 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.170
 Do you have a drawing in your house? 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.340
 you can use or what you use in your 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.740
 diet ne 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.310
 so I use two serving glasses 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.310
 vegetables 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.980
 there would be more or less this way the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.410
 your meal 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.170
 there depends you can replace or you 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.010
 you can add a rice there maybe 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.630
 integral who knows a sweet potato 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.760
 if you have different content 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.760
 add a little bit more 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.530
 additional sweet potato a carbohydrate 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.930
 something like that I'm going to do the 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.600
 My meal is already going to take advantage and I'm going 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.860
 save her there for me to eat tomorrow and 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.930
 that's what I'm going to take my job 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.330
 tomorrow 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.430
 the meal that I'm going to take my work 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.290
 tomorrow you can also make a 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.230
 different way you might want to move 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.550
 a little out of the roasted chicken at one 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.410
 option for you too 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.230
 so you want it there as a more 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.990
 natural you can go to pick up the 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.080
 option or buying even so 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.090
