00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.840 

this<00:01:43.290> next<00:01:43.560> move<00:01:43.740> Scotty<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.190> think<00:01:44.550> is<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this next move Scotty I think is one of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.200 
this next move Scotty I think is one of
the<00:01:44.940> most<00:01:45.150> underutilized<00:01:46.490> shots<00:01:47.490> today<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the most underutilized shots today and I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.150 
the most underutilized shots today and I
think<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.570> an<00:01:48.960> ultimate<00:01:49.410> weapon<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:50.010> the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
think it's an ultimate weapon it's the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.970 
think it's an ultimate weapon it's the
old<00:01:50.810> Korean<00:01:51.810> rolling<00:01:52.200> hook<00:01:52.440> across<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
old Korean rolling hook across the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.320 
old Korean rolling hook across the
middle<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.580> just<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.970> big<00:01:54.120> guys

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
middle but it's not just for big guys

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.730 
middle but it's not just for big guys
guards<00:01:55.080> do<00:01:55.230> it<00:01:55.350> too

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
guards do it too

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.650 
guards do it too
yeah<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.160> is<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.790> difficult<00:01:57.060> shot<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
yeah it is a very difficult shot to

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.750 
yeah it is a very difficult shot to
master<00:01:58.260> I<00:01:58.290> think<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.310> say<00:01:59.550> one<00:01:59.730> of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
master I think as long as you say one of

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.700 
master I think as long as you say one of
the<00:01:59.880> greatest<00:02:00.090> shots<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.720> game<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the greatest shots in the game but this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.470 
the greatest shots in the game but this
is<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> shot<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> people<00:02:03.300> can

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
is a shot that not a lot of people can

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.720 
is a shot that not a lot of people can
utilize<00:02:03.660> but<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.290> allows<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.130> be

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
utilize but it allows you to really be

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.310 
utilize but it allows you to really be
able<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:05.970> get<00:02:06.090> your<00:02:06.270> shot<00:02:06.510> off<00:02:06.690> what<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:06.930> used<00:02:07.230> to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
able to get your shot off what I used to

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.620 
able to get your shot off what I used to
call<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.680> when<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.800> play<00:02:08.280> basketball<00:02:08.610> was<00:02:09.420> my

this is lesson 4 in our post progression
this<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.150> scoring<00:03:55.450> move<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.380> need<00:03:56.710> to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
this is the scoring move you need to

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.860 
this is the scoring move you need to
have<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.310> jump<00:03:57.670> hook<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> lane<00:03:58.180> but<00:03:58.720> you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
have that jump hook in the lane but you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.750 
have that jump hook in the lane but you
also<00:03:59.050> need<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.830> a<00:03:59.860> counter<00:04:00.340> move<00:04:00.490> if

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
also need to have a counter move if

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.610 
also need to have a counter move if
they're<00:04:00.970> playing<00:04:01.240> against<00:04:01.690> it

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.830 

now<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:06.040> are<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.190> solutions<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.599> catch

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
now here are the solutions on the catch

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.710 
now here are the solutions on the catch
this<00:04:08.170> is<00:04:08.349> called<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.830> jump<00:04:09.220> hook<00:04:09.430> when<00:04:10.300> you<00:04:10.450> go

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
this is called the jump hook when you go

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.020 
this is called the jump hook when you go
to<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.080> mid<00:04:11.290> line<00:04:11.319> you<00:04:11.739> want<00:04:11.890> to<00:04:11.980> take<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.459> step

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
to the mid line you want to take a step

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.780 
to the mid line you want to take a step
with<00:04:13.840> your<00:04:14.019> inside<00:04:14.080> foot<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.010> foot<00:04:15.250> closest

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
with your inside foot the foot closest

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.390 
with your inside foot the foot closest
to<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.090> basket<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.530> what<00:04:17.709> I<00:04:17.739> would<00:04:17.980> do<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.280> I

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to the basket so what I would do is I

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.260 
to the basket so what I would do is I
would<00:04:18.430> step<00:04:19.000> triple<00:04:19.750> step<00:04:20.609> it<00:04:21.609> find<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.060> long

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
would step triple step it find the long

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.960 
would step triple step it find the long
and<00:04:22.750> I'm<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:23.380> some<00:04:23.620> speed<00:04:23.950> and<00:04:24.100> power<00:04:24.340> that's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
and I'm have some speed and power that's

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.000 
and I'm have some speed and power that's
going<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.330> very<00:04:25.479> effective<00:04:25.900> if<00:04:26.650> not<00:04:26.979> I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
going to be very effective if not I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.219 
going to be very effective if not I
might<00:04:27.430> have<00:04:27.639> to<00:04:27.760> take<00:04:28.000> two<00:04:28.330> dribbles<00:04:28.570> step

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
might have to take two dribbles step

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.300 
might have to take two dribbles step
step

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
step

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.090 
step
once<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.150> get<00:04:31.210> here<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.720> want<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:32.080> start<00:04:32.470> low<00:04:32.740> I

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
once I get here I want to start low I

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520 
once I get here I want to start low I
want<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.700> keep<00:04:33.880> my<00:04:34.210> body<00:04:34.510> in<00:04:34.900> between<00:04:35.139> the

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
want to keep my body in between the

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.350 
want to keep my body in between the
defender<00:04:36.100> and<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.340> ball<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.880> always

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
defender and the ball it's always

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.890 
defender and the ball it's always
defender<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.740> will<00:04:39.280> never<00:04:40.120> show<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.690> ball

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
defender you will never show the ball

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.510 
defender you will never show the ball
because<00:04:41.200> then<00:04:41.350> it's<00:04:41.530> exposed<00:04:42.040> ball

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
because then it's exposed ball

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.629 
because then it's exposed ball
protection<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.389> stance<00:04:44.139> are<00:04:44.500> very<00:04:45.040> important

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
protection and stance are very important

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.000 
protection and stance are very important
so<00:04:46.180> once<00:04:46.389> I<00:04:46.510> have<00:04:46.750> my<00:04:46.930> stance<00:04:47.320> my<00:04:47.590> leverage

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
so once I have my stance my leverage

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.460

one more time here's the jump hook or
two<00:05:16.930> steps<00:05:20.100> two<00:05:21.100> dribbles<00:05:21.400> here's<00:05:22.389> the

another<00:05:43.720> important<00:05:44.350> skill<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.650> have<00:05:44.830> in<00:05:45.250> the

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
another important skill to have in the

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.490 
another important skill to have in the
post<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:45.910> that<00:05:45.940> is<00:05:46.480> if<00:05:46.690> you<00:05:46.840> catch<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.320> ball

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
post is that is if you catch the ball

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.380 
post is that is if you catch the ball
and<00:05:47.620> you're<00:05:47.770> not<00:05:47.920> super<00:05:48.400> close<00:05:48.610> to<00:05:48.640> the<00:05:48.820> basket

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
and you're not super close to the basket

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.060 
and you're not super close to the basket
so<00:05:49.420> I<00:05:49.600> cannot<00:05:50.050> be<00:05:50.200> able<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.380> just<00:05:50.590> do<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.770> simple

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
so I cannot be able to just do a simple

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.940 
so I cannot be able to just do a simple
drop<00:05:51.460> step<00:05:51.880> middle<00:05:52.690> or<00:05:52.840> baseline<00:05:53.170> if<00:05:53.770> the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
drop step middle or baseline if the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.920 
drop step middle or baseline if the
defense<00:05:54.340> is<00:05:54.490> push<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.030> out<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:55.540> the<00:05:55.660> floor

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
defense is push this out on the floor

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.680 
defense is push this out on the floor
now<00:05:56.650> we<00:05:56.710> can<00:05:57.070> execute<00:05:57.430> what<00:05:57.700> we<00:05:57.820> call<00:05:58.060> a<00:05:58.090> crab

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
now we can execute what we call a crab

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.930 
now we can execute what we call a crab
