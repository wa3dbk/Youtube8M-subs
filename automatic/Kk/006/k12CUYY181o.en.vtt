tomatoes are doing well you will notice
this<00:00:54.539> we<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.930> down<00:00:55.170> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.590> closer<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
this we get down kind of closer that the

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.779 
this we get down kind of closer that the
are<00:00:57.629> continuing<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.590> some<00:00:59.280> problems

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
are continuing to have some problems

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.310 
are continuing to have some problems
with<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:01.129> blight<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> leaves<00:01:02.760> there's

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
with the blight on the leaves there's

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.820 
with the blight on the leaves there's
this<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:07.280> Amish<00:01:08.280> paste<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> seems<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.570> be

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
this is a Amish paste and it seems to be

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.260 
this is a Amish paste and it seems to be
one<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> more<00:01:11.220> effective<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.939> again

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
one of the more effective and again

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.899 
one of the more effective and again
we'll<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.430> once<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.610> plant

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
we'll see here so that's once we plant

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
we'll see here so that's once we plant
it<00:01:15.000> at<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> same<00:01:15.570> time<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:17.070> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
it at the same time and this one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
it at the same time and this one
continues<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.210> much<00:01:18.450> better<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:19.049> reasons

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
continues to do much better for reasons

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.929 
continues to do much better for reasons
I'm<00:01:20.159> not<00:01:20.340> sure<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.570> base<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.820> having<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I'm not sure we have base on having a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.149 
I'm not sure we have base on having a
little<00:01:24.180> more<00:01:24.500> difficulty<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> year<00:01:25.950> than

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
little more difficulty this year than

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
little more difficulty this year than
last<00:01:26.189> year<00:01:26.610> perhaps<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.540> we<00:01:27.950> started<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
last year perhaps because we started it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.120 
last year perhaps because we started it
earlier<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.049> beginning<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> bit

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
earlier but it's beginning to do a bit

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
earlier but it's beginning to do a bit
better<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.270> something's<00:01:33.780> been<00:01:33.990> eating

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
better see that something's been eating

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.800 
better see that something's been eating
on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> leaves<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.270> though<00:01:38.659> well

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
on the leaves here though well

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.460 
on the leaves here though well
and<00:01:44.009> over<00:01:45.009> here<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.340> our<00:01:45.520> Donna<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.049> that<00:01:47.079> one

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
and over here is our Donna and that one

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.730 
and over here is our Donna and that one
really<00:01:48.040> has<00:01:48.520> leaf<00:01:48.850> curl<00:01:49.180> in<00:01:49.450> a<00:01:49.539> big<00:01:50.170> bad<00:01:50.470> way

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
really has leaf curl in a big bad way

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.340 
really has leaf curl in a big bad way
but<00:01:50.799> the<00:01:51.700> spring<00:01:52.060> regime<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:53.020> I've<00:01:53.170> done

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
but the spring regime that I've done

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.910 
but the spring regime that I've done
with<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.710> co<00:01:53.979> side<00:01:54.250> copper<00:01:54.729> dust<00:01:54.970> and<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.920> mix

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
with the co side copper dust and the mix

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
with Serenade organic approach to this

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.810 
with Serenade organic approach to this
seems<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.509> be<00:02:01.539> working<00:02:02.039> pretty<00:02:03.039> well<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.549> see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
seems to be working pretty well you see

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.910 
seems to be working pretty well you see
down<00:02:04.030> here<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.600> curled<00:02:04.899> leaves<00:02:05.140> again<00:02:05.530> on<00:02:05.740> the

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
them that have already set so I think

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.460 
them that have already set so I think
within<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.220> month<00:02:45.430> we<00:02:45.700> will<00:02:46.140> begin<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.290> have

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
within the month we will begin to have

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.740 
within the month we will begin to have
quite<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.829> few<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.190> those<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.790> I<00:02:49.209> didn't<00:02:49.540> show

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
quite a few of those and I didn't show

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.080 
quite a few of those and I didn't show

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
you tomatoes on the other but most of

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.300 
you tomatoes on the other but most of
these<00:02:52.209> tomato<00:02:52.630> plants<00:02:53.109> all<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.560> at<00:02:54.010> least

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
these tomato plants all have at least

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.319 
these tomato plants all have at least
some<00:02:55.049> Tomatoes<00:02:56.049> set<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:57.340> our<00:02:57.459> peppers<00:02:57.940> are

some Tomatoes set and our peppers are

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.140 
some Tomatoes set and our peppers are
going<00:02:58.690> very<00:02:58.989> very<00:02:59.170> well<00:02:59.470> indeed<00:02:59.950> if<00:03:00.160> we<00:03:00.340> look

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
going very very well indeed if we look

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.960 
going very very well indeed if we look
closely<00:03:01.299> in<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:03.160> may<00:03:03.340> should<00:03:03.700> be<00:03:03.880> able

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
closely in here you may should be able

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.059 
closely in here you may should be able
to<00:03:04.150> see<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> little<00:03:04.660> blossoms

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.339 

it's<00:03:10.549> a<00:03:10.640> little<00:03:10.879> hard<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.269> see<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.659> there's<00:03:11.989> one

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
it's a little hard to see if there's one

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.869 
it's a little hard to see if there's one
right<00:03:12.650> there<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:15.230> on<00:03:16.040> this<00:03:16.280> when<00:03:16.549> you<00:03:16.670> maybe

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
right there and on this when you maybe

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:22.509 
right there and on this when you maybe
can<00:03:17.180> see<00:03:17.450> them<00:03:17.629> also<00:03:18.730> see<00:03:19.730> right<00:03:19.999> in<00:03:20.150> there<00:03:21.519> and

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
can see them also see right in there and

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.129 
can see them also see right in there and
they're<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.209> going<00:03:23.450> well<00:03:23.749> they're<00:03:24.019> all

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
they're all going well they're all

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.129 
they're all going well they're all
branching<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.799> at<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.129> bottom<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.959> they're

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
branching out at the bottom so they're

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.539 
branching out at the bottom so they're
growing<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.739> pace<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:31.209> Carman's<00:03:32.209> and
