00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.460 
has a pickup truck if you haul things he
has<00:00:15.790> a<00:00:15.820> way<00:00:16.090> of<00:00:16.119> setting<00:00:16.600> it<00:00:16.720> up<00:00:16.869> so<00:00:17.080> that<00:00:17.110> you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
has a way of setting it up so that you

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.730 
has a way of setting it up so that you
could<00:00:17.710> really<00:00:17.920> anchor<00:00:18.369> anything<00:00:19.330> down

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
could really anchor anything down

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.859 
could really anchor anything down
tightly<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:20.980> not<00:00:21.490> lose<00:00:21.700> anything<00:00:22.360> out<00:00:22.630> the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
tightly and not lose anything out the

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.839 
tightly and not lose anything out the
back<00:00:23.080> of<00:00:23.259> your<00:00:23.349> truck<00:00:23.529> so<00:00:24.310> let's<00:00:24.490> go<00:00:24.640> take<00:00:24.790> a

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
back of your truck so let's go take a

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.480 
back of your truck so let's go take a
look<00:00:25.119> at<00:00:25.180> what<00:00:25.300> he<00:00:25.390> has<00:00:25.570> okay<00:00:26.380> hi<00:00:26.920> everybody

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
to show a little trick that I think is a

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.139 
to show a little trick that I think is a
kind<00:00:32.649> of<00:00:32.829> cool<00:00:33.010> it's<00:00:33.250> worked<00:00:33.460> out<00:00:33.640> for<00:00:33.700> me<00:00:33.880> real

there<00:00:36.489> that<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.470> pickup<00:00:38.739> truck<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:40.180> I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
there that got a pickup truck what I

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.450 
there that got a pickup truck what I
what<00:00:40.480> I'm<00:00:40.600> going<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.050> show<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.230> is<00:00:41.620> just<00:00:41.920> a<00:00:42.280> way

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
what I'm going to show you is just a way

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.450 
what I'm going to show you is just a way
to<00:00:44.040> rig<00:00:45.040> up<00:00:46.080> some<00:00:47.080> simple<00:00:47.290> pieces<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.160> hardware

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
to rig up some simple pieces of hardware

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.910 
to rig up some simple pieces of hardware
that<00:00:49.360> will<00:00:49.540> give<00:00:49.720> you<00:00:49.930> type<00:00:50.410> points<00:00:50.770> all

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
that will give you type points all

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.580 
that will give you type points all
across<00:00:51.340> both<00:00:51.610> sides<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.180> bed<00:00:52.360> I<00:00:52.630> know<00:00:53.200> most

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
across both sides of the bed I know most

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.160 
across both sides of the bed I know most
pickups<00:00:54.460> come<00:00:54.700> with<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.300> couple<00:00:55.900> of<00:00:55.990> tied

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
pickups come with a couple of tied

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.220 
pickups come with a couple of tied
points<00:00:56.590> in<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> corners<00:00:57.250> but<00:00:57.430> I<00:00:58.360> find<00:00:59.050> that

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
points in the corners but I find that

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.140 
points in the corners but I find that
it's<00:00:59.500> it's<00:01:00.130> hard<00:01:00.430> when<00:01:00.670> you're<00:01:00.760> just<00:01:00.940> trying

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
it's it's hard when you're just trying

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.880 
it's it's hard when you're just trying
to<00:01:01.270> tie<00:01:01.450> something<00:01:01.780> small<00:01:02.170> down<00:01:02.470> or<00:01:02.680> something

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
to tie something small down or something

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.649 
to tie something small down or something
awkward<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.520> shape<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:04.000> when<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:04.269> want<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.509> get

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
awkward in shape or when you want to get

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.300 
awkward in shape or when you want to get
a<00:01:04.689> lot<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.049> points<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.470> just<00:01:05.500> don't<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.100> them

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
a lot of points you just don't have them

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.340 
a lot of points you just don't have them
so<00:01:06.939> what<00:01:07.180> I<00:01:07.210> figured<00:01:07.930> out<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.229> do<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:10.350> some

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
so what I figured out to do is some

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.410 
so what I figured out to do is some
chain<00:01:11.649> chains<00:01:12.159> not<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.549> cheapest<00:01:13.000> thing<00:01:13.210> but

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
chain chains not the cheapest thing but

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.230 
chain chains not the cheapest thing but
it's<00:01:13.570> not<00:01:14.009> that<00:01:15.009> expensive<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.729> maybe<00:01:15.909> have

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
it's not that expensive and maybe have

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's not that expensive and maybe have
some<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.659> even<00:01:16.900> laying<00:01:17.080> around<00:01:17.260> the<00:01:17.560> house

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
some of it even laying around the house

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.730 
some of it even laying around the house
the<00:01:19.060> garage<00:01:19.210> that<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.900> might<00:01:20.050> be<00:01:20.200> able<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.470> use

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
the garage that you might be able to use

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.180 
the garage that you might be able to use
I<00:01:21.040> believe<00:01:22.030> this<00:01:22.300> is<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.680> 3/16<00:01:23.680> chain<00:01:23.950> but

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
I believe this is a 3/16 chain but

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.219 
I believe this is a 3/16 chain but
obviously<00:01:24.610> any<00:01:24.880> any<00:01:25.180> size<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.020> had

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
obviously any any size that you had

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.190 
obviously any any size that you had
would<00:01:26.440> probably<00:01:27.310> work<00:01:27.520> so<00:01:27.790> what<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.570> do<00:01:28.720> is

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
would probably work so what I do is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.020 
would probably work so what I do is
basically<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.890> take<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.190> length<00:01:30.430> of<00:01:30.580> chain<00:01:30.640> that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
basically I take a length of chain that

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.200 
basically I take a length of chain that
runs<00:01:31.090> down<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.630> side<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.170> bed<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.700> I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
runs down the side of the bed and then I

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.969 
runs down the side of the bed and then I
just<00:01:37.750> have<00:01:37.930> to<00:01:38.110> have<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.290> couple<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.710> quick

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
just have to have a couple of quick

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:46.690 
just have to have a couple of quick
links<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.200> use<00:01:41.650> to<00:01:42.840> fasten<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.869> chain

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.100 

to<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.450> loop<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.219> tide<00:01:49.460> point<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.909> bed

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:02.039 

basically<00:01:54.110> just<00:01:54.320> type<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:54.799> quick<00:01:55.219> link<00:01:55.520> up

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.440 

and<00:02:03.049> I<00:02:03.229> suppose<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:03.619> can<00:02:03.799> use<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.450> shackle

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and I suppose you can use a shackle

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.210 
and I suppose you can use a shackle
piece<00:02:06.020> of<00:02:06.170> hardware<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:06.619> something<00:02:07.189> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
piece of hardware just something that

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.660 
piece of hardware just something that
will<00:02:07.429> tie<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.510> type<00:02:11.510> own<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
will tie it right you the type own and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.960 
will tie it right you the type own and
then<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> take<00:02:14.060> another<00:02:14.090> quick<00:02:14.599> link<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:16.160> the

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
then I take another quick link and the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.390 
then I take another quick link and the
turnbuckle<00:02:17.660> here<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.950> know<00:02:19.010> there<00:02:19.310> are

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
turnbuckle here and I know there are

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.190 
turnbuckle here and I know there are
some<00:02:19.580> other<00:02:19.730> devices<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.420> may<00:02:20.660> have<00:02:20.900> laying

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
some other devices you may have laying

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800 
some other devices you may have laying
around<00:02:21.319> for<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:22.000> tightening<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.239> chain<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
around for a tightening up chain and

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.539 
around for a tightening up chain and
stuff<00:02:24.049> like<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.530> you<00:02:24.739> can<00:02:24.890> probably<00:02:25.099> use

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
stuff like that you can probably use

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.970 
stuff like that you can probably use
something<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.239> as<00:02:26.390> well<00:02:26.630> but<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.799> me

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
something like that as well but for me

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.240 
something like that as well but for me
this<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.579> a<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.900> real<00:02:30.260> heavy-duty<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.130> it

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
this is a not real heavy-duty but it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.460 
this is a not real heavy-duty but it
seems<00:02:31.549> to<00:02:31.790> hold<00:02:32.209> every<00:02:32.660> load<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.140> I've<00:02:33.260> ever

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 

and<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.930> pretty<00:03:41.140> much<00:03:41.230> got<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.560> nice<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:41.890> snug

here to tie to I think it's pretty cool
because<00:03:50.340> most<00:03:51.340> bungee<00:03:51.880> cords<00:03:52.300> can<00:03:53.290> hook<00:03:53.560> into

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
because most bungee cords can hook into

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.800 
because most bungee cords can hook into
any<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.370> chain<00:03:54.670> or<00:03:54.970> hook<00:03:55.210> around<00:03:55.600> the

any of the chain or hook around the
chain<00:03:56.080> easily<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:59.110> can<00:03:59.880> run<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> rope<00:04:01.210> you<00:04:01.480> want
