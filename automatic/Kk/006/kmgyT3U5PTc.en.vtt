00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello everyone I am the vine in this video 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.069
 we'll see when people will go to 5 to 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 pc why it took so long and what things 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.070
 are you going to improve when 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.639
 jump for good mainly gta pc 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.639
 5 has been delayed 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.779
 in going to pc good because it is very much 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.820
 easier since filtering files from the 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.160
 game is much easier to moderate a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.660
 game when you have it for computers 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.510
 that when you have it for a console 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 so good to the creators in general 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.580
 of games do not like that much 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.230
 we put mods so good the 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.790
 true that they are patching very well and 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.980
 besides that they have to change him 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.230
 a lot of things since it's not the same 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.470
 you there is a certain level of compatibility 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 between an xbox and a playstation but not 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.269
 between a computer besides that such 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.040
 include surprise content 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.170
 besides the things that we already know as 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.400
 the first person and all those things 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.729
 how good is it going to leave for 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.309
 playstation 4 and xbox one and good now 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.259
 we'll see 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.149
 what things will improve him good 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.920
 things that will improve you are things that 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.840
 Well, more or less worth it is what 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.979
 same as for nexgen consoles 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.259
 they will improve the view at first 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.539
 person will add some cars 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.270
 in addition to missions and content 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.090
 Exclusive downloadable for these games 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.610
 of lex good and good that by when is going to 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.909
 leave when we are going to be able to have our 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.640
 game of gta 5 for pc in and to our 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.710
 good hands the date is already not there 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.009
 confirmed but it is believed that it will come out 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:44.179
 for January 15, January 15, 2015 to 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.159
 January 15, 2015 but I still do not know no 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.340
 not sure what is known 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 it's going to come out in January 2014 but 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.149
 what is not known would still be in January 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.240
 of 2015 but what is not yet known 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.740
 it is still what we still do not know what 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.610
 I said good what I still do not know 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.750
 knows 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 the date this in specific and good this 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 it was all the truth that it is a very video 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.179
 short but I had to explain it 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.280
 because there are many people who do not know 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.659
 kakÃ¡ or because this the truth that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.329
 rockstar for some reason has 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.400
 delayed and good is something very strange the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.989
 truth what they are doing and well I have 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.560

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:27.120
