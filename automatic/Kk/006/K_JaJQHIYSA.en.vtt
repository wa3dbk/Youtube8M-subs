obviously Portugal had a had a defeat in

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.410 
obviously Portugal had a had a defeat in
their<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:19.980> their<00:03:20.130> first<00:03:20.340> qualifying<00:03:20.880> game<00:03:21.209> is

their in their first qualifying game is

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.240 
their in their first qualifying game is
that<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:22.080> important<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.590> bounce<00:03:22.830> back<00:03:23.070> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that it's important to bounce back to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.590 
that it's important to bounce back to
that<00:03:23.400> when<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.640> play<00:03:23.820> Denmark<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> week<00:03:24.480> or

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
that when you play Denmark in a week or

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.050 
that when you play Denmark in a week or
so<00:03:24.720> time<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.140> course<00:03:25.500> we<00:03:26.160> have<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.340> new<00:03:26.520> manager

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
so time of course we have a new manager

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.710 
so time of course we have a new manager
and<00:03:27.590> he<00:03:28.590> he'll<00:03:28.980> probably<00:03:29.250> want<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.760> start<00:03:30.570> with

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
and he he'll probably want to start with

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.140
