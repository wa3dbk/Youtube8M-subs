hello<00:00:05.279> world<00:00:05.520> so<00:00:06.390> today<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.379> something

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hello world so today I have something

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.610 
hello world so today I have something
pretty<00:00:07.980> cool<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.670> show<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.880> guys<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.510> am<00:00:10.349> going

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
pretty cool to show you guys I am going

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.799 
pretty cool to show you guys I am going
to<00:00:10.679> show<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.099> survival<00:00:11.730> friendly<00:00:12.360> method

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to show you a survival friendly method

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.839 
to show you a survival friendly method
of<00:00:12.990> hiding<00:00:13.440> secrets<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> middle<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
of hiding secrets in the middle of the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.260 
of hiding secrets in the middle of the
air<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> as<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.279> see<00:00:17.520> there<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> great

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
air so as you can see there is a great

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
air so as you can see there is a great
chasm<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.900> front<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.230> us<00:00:19.380> with<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:20.039> looks

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
chasm in front of us with what looks

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.920 
chasm in front of us with what looks
like<00:00:20.580> something<00:00:21.180> important<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> other

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
like something important on the other

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.740 
like something important on the other
side<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:23.400> let's<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.850> bridge<00:00:24.090> across<00:00:24.269> really

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
side so let's just bridge across really

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.450 
side so let's just bridge across really
quickly<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.710> what<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> find<00:00:28.460> now

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
quickly and see what we can find now

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.979 
quickly and see what we can find now
that<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.789> are<00:00:29.939> across<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.750> clearly<00:00:31.050> see

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
that we are across we can clearly see

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.100 
that we are across we can clearly see
nothing<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.309> nothing<00:00:35.309> happened<00:00:35.610> at<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.110> that

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
nothing and nothing happened at all that

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
nothing and nothing happened at all that
is<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.920> order<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.399> solve<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.910> puzzle

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is because in order to solve this puzzle

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.030 
is because in order to solve this puzzle
we<00:00:39.420> must<00:00:39.719> bridge<00:00:40.020> across<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.739> certain

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
we must bridge across in a certain

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
we must bridge across in a certain
pattern<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.059> let's<00:00:42.510> rewind<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.170> try<00:00:43.290> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
pattern so let's rewind and try that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
pattern so let's rewind and try that
again

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.160 

and<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:59.400> we<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.690> have<00:01:00.720> access

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and there we have it we now have access

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:14.109 
and there we have it we now have access
to<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:03.620> supercool<00:01:04.620> transition

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.819 

as<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.329> can<00:01:15.509> see<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.930> concept<00:01:16.439> uses

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
as you can see this concept uses

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.590 
as you can see this concept uses
daylight<00:01:17.219> sensors<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.390> bit<00:01:18.509> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
daylight sensors and a little bit of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.139 
daylight sensors and a little bit of
redstone<00:01:19.280> although<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.429> the<00:01:20.549> surface<00:01:20.969> the

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
redstone although on the surface the

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.029 
redstone although on the surface the
principle<00:01:21.600> behind<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.049> concept<00:01:22.289> may<00:01:22.740> seem

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
principle behind this concept may seem

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.679 
principle behind this concept may seem
rather<00:01:23.310> simple<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.149> actually<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
rather simple it can actually be a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.080 
rather simple it can actually be a
little<00:01:24.990> bit<00:01:25.140> tricky<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.799> order<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> better

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
little bit tricky in order to better

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
little bit tricky in order to better
understand<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> system<00:01:28.289> works<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.039> first

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
understand how the system works we first

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
understand how the system works we first
need<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> understand<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.270> daylight<00:01:30.659> sensors

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
need to understand how daylight sensors

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.779 
need to understand how daylight sensors
receive<00:01:31.560> light<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> be

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
receive light and how it can be

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.219 
receive light and how it can be
manipulated<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:35.450> here<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> daylight

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
manipulated so here we have a daylight

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.770 
manipulated so here we have a daylight
sensor<00:01:37.649> with<00:01:37.799> full<00:01:38.069> signal<00:01:38.520> strength<00:01:38.819> now<00:01:39.719> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
sensor with full signal strength now the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
sensor with full signal strength now the
redstone<00:01:40.409> light<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.159> reduced<00:01:41.520> by<00:01:41.610> placing

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
redstone light can be reduced by placing

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.899 
redstone light can be reduced by placing
blocks<00:01:42.299> above<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> daylight<00:01:43.200> sensor<00:01:43.679> in

not be very practical but I thought I

not be very practical but I thought I
would<00:03:16.190> let<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.460> know<00:03:16.640> anyway<00:03:18.550> there's<00:03:19.550> also

would let you know anyway there's also
one<00:03:20.150> more<00:03:20.180> thing<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.690> would<00:03:20.750> like<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:20.960> mention

one more thing I would like to mention

one more thing I would like to mention
and<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.190> fact<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.520> this<00:03:22.760> device<00:03:23.150> is

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
and that is the fact that this device is

and that is the fact that this device is
daylight<00:03:23.660> sensitive<00:03:24.230> meaning<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.520> will<00:03:25.640> only

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
daylight sensitive meaning it will only

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
makes the concept even harder to crack

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.490 
makes the concept even harder to crack
as<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.120> only<00:03:50.270> be<00:03:50.510> activated<00:03:50.930> at<00:03:51.170> certain

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
to it a relatively simple concept that

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.070 
to it a relatively simple concept that
allows<00:03:58.520> you<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.790> hide<00:03:59.030> things<00:03:59.270> in<00:03:59.510> plain<00:03:59.750> sight

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
allows you to hide things in plain sight

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.500 
allows you to hide things in plain sight
it<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:00.950> even<00:04:01.370> survival<00:04:01.760> friendly<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.270> that<00:04:02.300> is

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
it is even survival friendly so that is

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.870 
it is even survival friendly so that is
always<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> plus<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.320> hope<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.400> enjoyed<00:04:04.700> this
