00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.519
 So everyone lost to the next episode of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.650
 Five-fingered minecraft you know 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.580
 So should not know yet 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.540
 did not know existed two different 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 series thinks about it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.740
 I hope to see some things again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.330
 chosen to fit this and if you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.010
 have more ideas to write 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.490
 in the comments because the post office 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.689
 latest broken is that's why 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.160
 I think all things should know 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.180
 as for me , I had to fall for it 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.180
 we see it starts and big space 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.170
 the first thing is from captain 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 you sign that you know 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.800
 putting pumpkin upside down , so to speak 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.379
 Endermann who do nothing and yes that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 is actually true if you look at yourself 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.420
 then you can face public fat 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.760
 without problems look at endermann 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.879
 without even a wittenberger here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.440
 moment game modes 0 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 of course I hope it shows for me 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
 just deep down I do not believe yet 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.390
 So yes, change it altogether 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.039
 unaffected 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 However, once you have his shirt 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.489
 and then look at them 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310
 the pretty kurstÃ¤dter moment do that 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.930
 not right 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 The next thing is from Shawn and he 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.159
 do not write that villager 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 Exchange items indefinitely and that's right 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.909
 I'll go and try 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.650
 simply times as much as it goes 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.210
 to exchange and you see it's off one 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.770
 certain amount gone now 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 just exchanged 13 47 times and wants more 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.869
 he does not come out I also have here 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.400
 the hands are packed back table 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.869
 did not really make it difficult 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.610
 have an offer we are both comes 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.920
 nothing over it skin I have no more 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.329
 of which for a little different 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.850
 new offers are being made for that 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.780
 unlocked and years if something 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 has good and exploit machines 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 the next thing is rap fans tv 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.570
 Signs Dogs Refer For Both 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 kill sheep to mission we counted 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 just see the wolf can be quite 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.430
 apart from the sheep 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.020
 sometimes it takes a little bit 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.840
 until he gets hungry again but like that 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 slowly and surely he eats himself completely 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.380
 dissolves through the whole sheep 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.869
 by definitely true 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 in fact, if you are somewhere 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 has lying around and is wonderful 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.340
 maybe that was a wolf 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.510
 Friendship has eaten the next 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 thing you should know is from 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.180
 error or error 2000s she writes 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.970
 Should you know never watson can you 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.590
 only on breeding working head of course 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.000
 also in the normal world is like that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.319
 Of course not as you can too 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.910
 pulling outside would not always be necessary 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.069
 go out there from that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.319
 you have already found everything 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.200
 outside and in the old days it was like that too 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.790
 how dark is she based on adult 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.459
 that still is so much has changed 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 modified a version but yes it is 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.430
 definitely and the last for today 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.780
 which we should know from ovi com 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.700
 and he writes one can that a map 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.900
 zoom out when you paper heavily 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.470
 Turned around and her husband can card 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.569
 expand 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.250
 it will be a good look 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.480
 small detail still shown but there 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.650
 you can actually run very quickly 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.330
 has come to the end 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.190
 that's why you can make it bigger 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.200
 we have to show ourselves and last rank 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.450
 succeeded because of a recent 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.920
 relief colleagues was that demand 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 those of little sense and I have too 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 said the ju is going to expand the chamber 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.440
 just celebrate a club and then 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.790
 one paper lying around 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.800
 I can also equal several stages one 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.800
 distribute so far this year 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.920
 you can see here 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.330
 how much chance do I believe in it 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.980
 I believe that is already shown 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.110
 look at the maximum build and you see 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.030
 we have a much bigger one 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.680
 Area to choose from our sight falls 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 is so tiny little can do much more 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.769
 customers and also a much larger one 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.390
 view if a small map wants 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.680
 you have to take a little one if 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 someone wanted a big map that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.330
 whole empire under supervision then wants 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.080
 you have to take the big ones after how 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.780
 great she builds up 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.560
 otherwise yes that would have been me 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.750
 my for watching 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.099
 the crack until next time me 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.569
 hope you all knew when you talk 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.409
 like to write comments and then 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.409
 show
