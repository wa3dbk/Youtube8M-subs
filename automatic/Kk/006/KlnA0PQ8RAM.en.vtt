00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:01.379
 Outdoor wear 

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.530
 Especially the function of trekking 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
 Let's talk about pants this time 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.109
 In terms of material 

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:11.459
 Of eco-car 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.279
 Same as trekking and 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.009
 Quick drying is required 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:18.259
 Yeah and it's my parents 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.189
 Ease of movement 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.939
 It's just so important 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.349
 Ekko's model is 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.349
 stretch 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.480
 Say that the house will grow 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 I'm thinking specially 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.450
 22 no stress 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.170
 Stretchability is important 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.530
 In addition, as the direction of the stretch 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.810
 There are also real and vertical directions. 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.200
 Freshly made 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.470
 Yokoo either 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.180
 There is also one model to dedicate 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.900
 That stretch 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.340
 The growth of the material itself 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.100
 There is something different from the growth rate, so be sure to enter 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 Let's try it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.800
 To prosecute mobility 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 Draping is being done 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
 If you press this too, it will become a docks slack type 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.140
 However 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.220
 esl intelligence 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.580
 Please try a bit 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 Quite 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.520
 It can extend to the left and right 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.740
 Furthermore, as a feature of eco-friendly materials 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.070
 Yes mode 6bp water repellant also has become strong 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 The first in the groove company 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 Please take a look at it and it will break off in season 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.900
 Yeah 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.420
 Code length specified by 3 countries 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.960
 There is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.830
 However 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 I will repel the outside water and still take care of 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.830
 I also do sightseeing in Kurachi 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.639
 In the past 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.139
 Recommended style and one 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.229
 Large esata port 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:15.369
 Station worker 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.329
 Do you call it Kochi parts 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.739
 I'm wearing tights that support muscles indirectly 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:22.539
 You 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.099
 Yeah it's over 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.499
 Recently I like to put something like Scard 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.249
 Things are coming out though 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.889
 Be alert to the station 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.559
 In addition, it is excellent in functionality 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.409
 British popular 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.659
 It is also a style that has been generalized with the plain 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:47.079
 This model is about the stability of the 8002 knee joint 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.939
 Go mountain climbing 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:51.769
 Specialized 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 It approaches and becomes a model 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.569
 Now this is the birth board shorts 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.449
 Will be reached 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.759
 It was a little hard to understand earlier 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:06.689
 It is around the waist Also the function to stabilize the waist around 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.799
 Type or digitization 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.799
 Just women 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.579
 It is so even men, but to use in mountain climbing 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.729
 I mean, I don't care if I put on short bread 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.459
 It seems that there are many people who wear tampons 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.269
 If it is the trail running Toukajin system, it is already this way 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.539
 If you are running 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.539
 I like this 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.999
 * It is a stance 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.869
 I'm fine 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.349
 In the case of Yunai 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.789
 Such Tamba style is also light and quite good 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.759
 However 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.669
 Please be careful with the bolt of Takayama 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.570
 If you say this from 2000 people 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.189
 The amount of UV light 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.379
 Because you will not be able to Keihan 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.659
 If there is 1 day English 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.689
 It will be the completion of a high-rise building 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:01.689
 Be careful with UV rays too! 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.749
 What is required for mountaineering pants 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.889
 Ease of movement 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.349
 It becomes a base 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.759
 When I sweated 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.759
 The ease of movement when it gets wet due to rain 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.999
 Contains 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.189
 Putt 

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:22.109
 After all skin feel 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.389
 British people 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.340
 Because this skill is different one by one 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.040
 Please try to get in and feel it
