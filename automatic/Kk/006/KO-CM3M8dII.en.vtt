00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
so that isn't that and it stays like

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:50.089 
so that isn't that and it stays like
this<00:03:41.599> for<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:43.400> while

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.170 

stays<00:03:51.099> like<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.280> for<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.549> couple<00:03:51.819> like<00:03:52.030> you
