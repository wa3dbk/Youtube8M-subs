 It's true how they launch if you 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.400
 Enrolling gets easier on you 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:45.880
 what is the tip of today is 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:51.020
 also in lipstick it is kind of sparkling, right? 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.550
 who has or who likes button mach 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.070
 pretty good right 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.399
 but sometimes the person does not like it very much 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.920
 then never invested ba or she 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.100
 did not find a matte lipstick the color she 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:09.079
 likes then how to solve this situation 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.990
 is a lucid boss in case you are using 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:14.630
 This one from mary kay is the translucent 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.640
 can be compact does not have to be 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.479
 that does not interfere with the color of the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:26.600
 lipstick 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:30.229
 The intersecting atom is this one 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.390
 it already has the number 6 shine of jasmine 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.700
 button plus voice 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.119
 you find yourself in my help to leave 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.100
 The link to you is then passed lipstick 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.990
 the way you like the way you 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 you usually do 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.220
 You will get the translucent powder there 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.960
 always a goal that are together 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.299
 with others 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.180
 then you will get a little bit 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 contest you can pick up in heaven but 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.310
 I think it's more practical with a finger and there 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:11.790
 it's just going to hit your mouth so understand 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.349
 which has to be translucent than the other 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.349
 will be another color of the mouth 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.080
 this trick 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.709
 besides leaving the matt lipstick is a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:35.430
 Trendy 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:38.630
 nowadays will also make the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.630
 your animals lipstick 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.740
 they realize the difference once again only 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.260
 left a before and after picture for you 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.860
 but still only this 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.640
 This is a tip to keep lipstick on. 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.010
 longer and take lmat okay if you just 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.980
 want to keep lipstick longer but 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.560
 You do not like it, mate, you pass. 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.330
 again a layer of your lipstick time 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.540
 will return to consistency and color 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.660
 original but will last much longer now 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.720
 When you tint it, leave it mate. 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.170
 Nati, I got baptized, I do not know. 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.380
 when you leave debate or beyond 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.030
 harder it avoids staining your teeth then 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.410
 This is very cool for whoever is going through 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.930
 dark lipstick okay because there is not 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.120
 scoring by staining your teeth will not 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.180
 it will last a lot longer 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.070
 should be matte and not yet dirty 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.410
 your mouth theirs right? 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.420
 very good who does not like button he 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.270
 Who has not stained tooth already? 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.760
 that way you avoid all this and 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.560
 with matt lipstick as you button 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.790
 want a tone that you want but 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.580
 remembering to be a powder the translucent 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.410
 not to affect the color of your lipstick 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.670
