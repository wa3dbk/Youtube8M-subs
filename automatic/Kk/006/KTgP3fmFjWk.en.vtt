00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.809
 since we have here the translations 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.230
 lighthouse but I would like to call it more 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.670
 as a sacred altar and because good 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.450
 as you can see here they had this chest 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.340
 emeralds and diamonds and this that 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.770
 we have here is the beacon how can 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.939
 see being surrounded by diamond blocks 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.910
 because that is what is going to help 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.649
 give power all this business and good 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.719
 here nothing else is a system to which 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.340
 I put it there so that it would turn off 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.989
 and this was caught, they do not have it 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.300
 what do you do but if you like 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.850
 they can leave on forever and good 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.390
 here it looks very very chunky at night 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.440
 this for the ones I 'm telling them for 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.679
 east adventure maps do not see such vi 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.230
 with and put you do not give the skill because 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.230
 good when you give right click to the east 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.699
 the Vikings are going to give you all this 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.050
 those little things that we have here for 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.020
 example this one is going to give us 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.750
 the first the primary power and that is going 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.300
 to give this speed good rush more 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.720
 well to look faster is our 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.400
 mother be the impulse when jumping may not 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380
 You can jump if you're a bastard 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.869
 the chinga of good strength and regeneration 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.580
 and good what we have to do votes 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.990
 let's take first what will be then 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.050
 speed I say good what are you going to give 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.110
 click at speed and as you can see here 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 Below is the speed or 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.979
 regeneration and we have to give it to 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.950
 change or a diamond or an emerald or 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.580
 good the gold the bars of gold or of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.380
 steel from iron forgiveness Iraqi good since 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.600
 we put it on and it's going to activate that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.440
 popcorn or cancel and hey they click 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.030
 and it has finished and automatically 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.460
 have that sequential blessing here 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 as you can see says speed like that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 it's going to end but in reality I think 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.429
 I do not know how long it lasts but actually 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.869
 it does not end and well you have it 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:08.960
 to play for who if they notice the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.700
 difference the speed increased 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.530
 I do not remember what you have to put in 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 that you go like that in a bit but in 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.090
 actually if I'm running faster 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.650
 normal, so I invite you to 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.290
 I check in and well I do not like it very much 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.510
 speed since it does not show as much but 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.920
 we can right click on it again and 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.920
 now let's put this 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.730
 a diamond landmark and we're going to get 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.940
 I think we're going to get 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.440
 impulse to jump and well the same is not 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.020
 jump like that is the fucking sky like that 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 bastard but good in itself yes gives them a 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.730
 I like when I do when you 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.290
 feel if they are going to feel like jumping 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.510
 unfortunately do not jump the two this 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.140
 the two blocks or is this one very 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.750
 chingón that we say but if it jumps a 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.790
 little bit more and as you can see 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.380
 Well, they simply go to a 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.270
 close you already know that the fences do not 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.670
 can go by and see how they can here 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.730
 see I'm not even sprint t ando and 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.500
 I can jump the fences without any 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.800
 problem you can already see that a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.210
 little mother when you come here 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.480
 and that is so funny about those of the 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.270
 blessings and so I want to call him and 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.120
 well you see that dress looks funny 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.350
 all powers and well you will see 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.390
 They hung up how they are going to be 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.430
 using a lot in on the maps of 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.890
 adventure and good this baby that you see here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.950
 it's the best thing that could have happened to 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.070
 minecraft and also good I repeat it 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.660
 once again for the systems of 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.710
 adventures simply and simply because 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.940
 because these are the famous blocks of 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.880
 good commands like you can see land 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.210
 right click to the block and well here is 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.130
 a code here is going to explain to you that 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:00.520
 write a certain letter to apply 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.620
 that effect to the player is closer to 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.060
 all or as you like and good for 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.700
 example here in this button apply it and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.270
 As you can see, my way is changing 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.760
 from creative game to survival to creative 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.070
 to survival and this is good what can 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.799
 to occupy very very very very fucking mind 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.700
 the adventure maps I hope someone 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.960
 he raffled 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.450
 a chingón because now of now in 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.710
 forward now you will have a reason to 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.240
 play the adventure maps not that all 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.600
 they are chatting if they are all the same 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.820
 but with this if you see one well used 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.250
 is going to be this bastard enough if I eat 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.140
 good as you can see here this I gave him 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.220
 click to put my spawn to a certain 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:43.390
 crazy point and it's around here and good and 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.020
 this button for a bastard that happened because 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.880
 I'm here suddenly good because you're 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.430
 are the coordinates that I put to that 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.620
 block that was my spawn 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.250
 but right now they're going to see what I put on 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.090
 this block that is here is 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.760
 teleports good here is our 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.540
 spawn and this is to teleport to 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.520
 cryer when you put that button towards the 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.160
 resonating system any coordinate 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.290
 that you like so this is going to be 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.120
 very very cool alike here change the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
 difficulty I do not know what goes into a villa 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.330
 where there are no zombies and good the change 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.890
 on the track so that the 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.440

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.210
 cave this I am talking to you more than 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.460
 Click here with for example and not

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.920
 a little zombie egg and he enters them 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.330
 a cave and they have to pass I do not know by 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 a tributary you do not realize 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.390
 you think it's still on floor 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.760

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.890
 amounts of nothing good are activated more 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.510

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.330
 that then do not appear and normal in the 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.460
 other difficulties and good here as 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.770
 can see it I squeezed it and it disappeared 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.230
 because I was in pee and well this is 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.030
