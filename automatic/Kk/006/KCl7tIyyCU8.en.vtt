00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
and we're gonna be playing similar to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.740 
and we're gonna be playing similar to
what<00:00:35.080> we<00:00:35.229> did<00:00:35.379> before

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
what we did before

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
we actually now play three strings

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.710 
we actually now play three strings
instead<00:00:40.059> of<00:00:40.210> two<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:41.339> we're<00:00:42.339> playing

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
instead of two and we're playing

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.780 
instead of two and we're playing
triplets<00:00:43.720> one<00:00:44.260> two<00:00:44.940> three<00:00:45.940> times<00:00:47.549> and<00:00:48.549> this<00:00:48.640> is

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
triplets one two three times and this is

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.200 
triplets one two three times and this is
a<00:00:48.820> cool<00:00:49.409> jump<00:00:50.409> blues<00:00:50.650> technique<00:00:51.190> I<00:00:51.549> think<00:00:51.909> you

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
a cool jump blues technique I think you

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.810

could<00:00:52.390> call<00:00:52.540> it<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:53.650> sounds<00:00:54.040> really<00:00:54.250> sweet<00:00:54.430> so

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
could call it it sounds really sweet so

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.869 
could call it it sounds really sweet so
ver<00:00:55.000> this<00:00:55.479> type<00:00:55.690> of<00:00:55.720> song<00:00:56.049> so<00:00:56.920> what<00:00:57.790> I'm

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
ver this type of song so what I'm

ver this type of song so what I'm
playing<00:00:58.089> here<00:00:58.449> is<00:01:01.650> it's<00:01:02.650> sort<00:01:02.799> of<00:01:02.890> like<00:01:03.070> a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
playing here is it's sort of like a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
playing here is it's sort of like a
diminished<00:01:03.760> chord<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.510> half<00:01:05.290> step<00:01:05.560> down<00:01:05.890> from

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
diminished chord a half step down from

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.630 
diminished chord a half step down from
which<00:01:08.470> would<00:01:08.680> be<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:09.270> c7<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.950> we're<00:01:12.100> going<00:01:12.430> down

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
which would be a c7 but we're going down

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.660 
which would be a c7 but we're going down
here<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.750> 11th<00:01:17.320> fret<00:01:17.500> here<00:01:18.250> with

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
here so I'm on the 11th fret here with

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.460 
here so I'm on the 11th fret here with
my<00:01:18.820> middle<00:01:18.970> finger<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:20.260> ring<00:01:20.290> finger

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
my middle finger and the ring finger

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.750 
my middle finger and the ring finger
here<00:01:22.050> similar<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.080> what<00:01:23.260> we<00:01:23.350> did<00:01:23.440> before<00:01:23.760> but

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
here similar to what we did before but

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.730 
here similar to what we did before but
now<00:01:24.820> we<00:01:25.000> add<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.630> index<00:01:25.930> finger<00:01:26.200> here<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.650> the

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
now we add the index finger here on the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.690 
now we add the index finger here on the
10th<00:01:26.950> fret<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:29.050> we<00:01:29.350> Bend<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:30.160> little<00:01:30.460> bit

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
10th fret and then we Bend a little bit

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.340 
10th fret and then we Bend a little bit
to<00:01:30.880> shake<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.360> strings<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> little<00:01:31.870> bit<00:01:34.350> this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
to shake the strings a little bit this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.170 
to shake the strings a little bit this
is<00:01:35.409> up<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.890> interpretation<00:01:36.250> how<00:01:36.820> much<00:01:37.030> you

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
is up to interpretation how much you

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.700 
is up to interpretation how much you
want<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.420> bend<00:01:37.630> I<00:01:37.810> think<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.230> a<00:01:38.320> little<00:01:38.470> bit

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
want to bend I think just a little bit

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.510 
want to bend I think just a little bit
sounds<00:01:39.070> best

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
sounds best

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.940 
sounds best
if<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.600> bend<00:01:40.840> too<00:01:40.960> much<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.350> sounds<00:01:41.680> out<00:01:41.800> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
if you bend too much it sounds out of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.930 
if you bend too much it sounds out of
pitch<00:01:43.320> alright<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:44.620> try<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:44.950> Bend<00:01:45.100> all<00:01:45.400> three

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
pitch alright but try and Bend all three

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.980 
pitch alright but try and Bend all three
strings<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.420> little<00:01:46.479> bit<00:01:46.780> if<00:01:46.900> you<00:01:47.020> can

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
strings a little bit if you can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.380 
strings a little bit if you can
and<00:01:50.310> then<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.490> mute<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.820> after<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.180> with

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and then we mute it after that with

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.060 
and then we mute it after that with
right<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:55.440> then<00:01:56.440> we<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> kind<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.010> a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
right then and then we have a kind of a

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.770 
right then and then we have a kind of a
follow<00:01:57.340> up<00:01:57.460> link<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:58.000> which<00:01:58.420> sounds<00:01:58.630> like

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
follow up link to that which sounds like

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.399 
follow up link to that which sounds like
this<00:02:01.770> which<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.070> lick<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.450> got<00:02:04.659> from<00:02:04.930> my

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
this which is a lick that I got from my

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.890 
this which is a lick that I got from my
student<00:02:05.830> Esteban<00:02:06.400> I<00:02:06.670> heard<00:02:07.390> him<00:02:07.540> play<00:02:07.570> this

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
student Esteban I heard him play this

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.449 
student Esteban I heard him play this
and<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.200> thought<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.590> was<00:02:08.709> pretty<00:02:08.920> cool<00:02:09.159> so

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
and I thought that was pretty cool so

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.630 
and I thought that was pretty cool so
let's<00:02:09.489> include<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.179> in<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.690> lesson<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> it's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
let's include it in a lesson so it's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.770 
let's include it in a lesson so it's
just<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.980> C<00:02:14.980> minor<00:02:15.280> pentatonic<00:02:15.640> on<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.630> D

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
just the C minor pentatonic on the D

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.240 
just the C minor pentatonic on the D
string<00:02:18.450> up<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.510> G<00:02:19.930> string<00:02:22.319> back<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.650> D<00:02:23.920> string

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
string up to G string back to D string

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.080 
string up to G string back to D string
and<00:02:25.709> then<00:02:26.709> here's<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.370> little<00:02:27.459> bit<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.819> tricky

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and then here's a little bit of a tricky

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.940 
and then here's a little bit of a tricky
thing<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:28.690> switch<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.260> g<00:02:29.560> string<00:02:29.860> on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
thing you now switch to the g string on

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.339 
thing you now switch to the g string on
the<00:02:30.040> same<00:02:30.220> fret<00:02:30.490> hit<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.420> note<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> bend<00:02:32.140> it

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
the same fret hit that note and bend it

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.080 
the same fret hit that note and bend it
come<00:02:35.349> back<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.189> index<00:02:36.430> finger<00:02:36.549> on<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.939> g

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
come back on the index finger on the g

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.690 
come back on the index finger on the g
string<00:02:37.120> here<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.680> end<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.030> D<00:02:40.180> string

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
string here and end it on the D string

00:02:41.700 --> 00:03:01.170 
string here and end it on the D string
like<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.530> let's<00:02:51.310> do<00:02:51.489> all<00:02:51.519> thing<00:03:00.180> sultrily

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
like that so let's do all thing sultrily

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.450 
like that so let's do all thing sultrily
cool
