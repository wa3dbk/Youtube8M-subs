00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.920
 hi and welcome to my garden 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.680
 today we will talk a little bit 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.880
 raised bed wood all those things there 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.619
 so I'm often asked the question 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.570
 which way to choose what is needed 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.930
 treat what is longevity and so 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.980
 right now 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.599
 so personally i love it i love them 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.820
 gardens in quarters and I love levy 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.560
 raised I already did a lot of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.270
 videos about why and how it's 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.420
 really a method and a technique 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.850
 who who is pretty fantastic and who 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.350
 works really well and so I'm asked 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.420
 the question which way to choose all 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.100
 these things there for the one in quarters and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.440
 so I just play just build 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.230
 this new lion because and I finally make them 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.270
 the bread just stopped for me 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.870
 it is the save all the less expensive that I 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.270
 can find 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.940
 so it stays in my budget for everyone 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.100
 who elect elevated I am in rental 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.189
 it's not something that's going to be long 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.600
 term for me so the bread will do the 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.060
 work and it's the cheapest 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.040
 longevity with bread that will depend 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.170
 a little bit of several parameters 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.950
 the first parameter of course it will be 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.450
 the thickness of your boards and 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.759
 the second parameter know everything that 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.079
 is climate so if if you live in 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.899
 a little more difficult climate 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.659
 like mine obviously the 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.999
 longevity of this kind of construction is going 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.119
 to be a little more limited I had 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:35.840
 made this bed reads elevated there are two 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.569
 years I think it's all is impeccable 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.380
 there is not no of 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.990
 mold all these things there 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.689
 so the bread is going to do the job it's 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.119
 not the ideal wood but it's the least 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.490
 dear it is the easiest to work 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.119
 they are everywhere and it's okay 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.670
 to resist 5 to 10 years if I had to choose 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.759
 a single wood for if you aim 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.039
 maybe maybe more longevity 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.479
 for your constructions 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.999
 if I had to choose a single wood this 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.709
 would be the cedar the cedar this palisade 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:09.770
 for example the cedar parties is here 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.569
 about 25 years old we also just planted 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.610
 our potatoes in barrels so we 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.670
 will talk about it again in a video more 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.520
 + gardening so puts the potatoes 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.200
 are going very well planting anbari very 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.720
 interesting but so these barrels have 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.410
 also made of cedar the cedar is 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.720
 interesting 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.720
 for us simply because he's going 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.940
 offer some natural barriers 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.280
 especially with regard to insects and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.860
 humidity so we'll have here a 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.750
 longevity compared to the woods he goes 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 to be quite exceptional and so if you 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.770
 want to build in longevity 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.720
 build your squares your raised bed 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.890
 all these things 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.870
 personally I will look at the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.430
 cedar I'm asked the question too 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.790
 should wood be treated 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.200
 I do not treat wood this 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.000
 environment is made for the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.580
 food production so I do not want 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.740
 no chemicals next door and so 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.570
 it's out of the question for me to 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.520
 treat the wood the bread will do the 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.960
 work both in five to ten years the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.570
 cedar will do the work during 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.850
 about thirty years so if I had to 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.840
 to choose a single wood that would be cedar 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.840
 and that was where
