00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
that's one of the stars one is

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.220 
that's one of the stars one is
completion<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> third<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.750> being<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.310 
completion and the third one is being a
level<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.590> certain<00:00:25.920> amount<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.130> time<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
level with a certain amount of time and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140 
level with a certain amount of time and
the<00:00:28.320> hard<00:00:28.590> part<00:00:28.830> about<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the hard part about this is it's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.730 
the hard part about this is it's
actually<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.689> difficult<00:00:30.960> level<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
actually a really difficult level just

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.889 
actually a really difficult level just
to<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.130> through<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> be

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
to get through so this is going to be

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.280 
to get through so this is going to be
really<00:00:34.110> challenging<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.329> barely<00:00:36.329> I've

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
really challenging for me I barely I've

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.100 
really challenging for me I barely I've
barely<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.920> through<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.850> level<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.540> beat

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
barely got through the the level to beat

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.490 
barely got through the the level to beat
it<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.530> unlock<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.100> swabs<00:00:41.370> own<00:00:41.579> challenge<00:00:41.969> so

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
it to unlock the swabs own challenge so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.840 
it to unlock the swabs own challenge so
what<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.620> probably<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.550> is

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
what I'm probably going to have to do is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.290 
what I'm probably going to have to do is
go<00:00:45.300> through<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> metals<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.730> run

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
go through and get the metals on one run

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
go through and get the metals on one run
through<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.780> then<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> speed<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
through and then get the speed on the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.369 
through and then get the speed on the
second<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> second<00:00:51.960> metal<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> here

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
second one so the second metal is here

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
second one so the second metal is here
and<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> middle<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.670> first<00:00:53.910> metal<00:00:54.149> was

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and in the middle the first metal was

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.389 
and in the middle the first metal was
back<00:00:54.570> there<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.410> jump<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> left
