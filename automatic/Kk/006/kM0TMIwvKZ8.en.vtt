a certain distance from your face it's
all<00:03:26.510> my<00:03:26.660> bad<00:03:26.810> i<00:03:26.840> can't<00:03:27.140> be<00:03:27.290> bored<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.590> go<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:27.739> and

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
all my bad i can't be bored to go up and

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.949 
all my bad i can't be bored to go up and
get<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.010> but<00:03:28.519> it's<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.510> bright<00:03:29.720> light

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
get it but it's just a bright light

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.540 
get it but it's just a bright light
leash<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.320> your<00:03:30.470> face<00:03:30.620> much<00:03:30.830> like<00:03:31.010> my<00:03:31.160> filming

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
leash on your face much like my filming

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.150 
leash on your face much like my filming
like<00:03:31.700> actually<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:33.080> it<00:03:33.410> doesn't<00:03:33.620> have<00:03:33.860> UV

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
like actually and it it doesn't have UV

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.470 
like actually and it it doesn't have UV
rays<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.519> it's<00:03:34.640> not<00:03:34.760> dangerous<00:03:35.000> but<00:03:35.209> it's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
rays so it's not dangerous but it's

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.120 
rays so it's not dangerous but it's
designed<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.959> keep<00:03:36.110> you<00:03:36.290> exposed<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:37.010> light

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
designed to keep you exposed to light

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.650 
designed to keep you exposed to light
and<00:03:37.400> hopefully<00:03:37.760> improves<00:03:38.090> your<00:03:38.239> energy

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
and hopefully improves your energy

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.479 
and hopefully improves your energy
levels<00:03:38.959> new<00:03:39.140> mood<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> figured<00:03:40.100> as<00:03:40.250> it's

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
levels new mood so I figured as it's

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.009 
levels new mood so I figured as it's
just<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.820> light<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.300> basically<00:03:41.570> have<00:03:41.900> to

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
just a light that I basically have to

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.140 
just a light that I basically have to
sit<00:03:42.170> in<00:03:42.200> front<00:03:42.350> of<00:03:42.530> why<00:03:42.739> not<00:03:42.890> try<00:03:43.100> out<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.550> has

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
sit in front of why not try out so has

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.490 
sit in front of why not try out so has
to<00:03:44.269> do<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.420> every<00:03:44.660> day<00:03:44.690> for<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:45.019> week<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:45.410> then

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
to do it every day for a week and then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.740 
to do it every day for a week and then
have<00:03:46.430> every<00:03:46.700> other<00:03:46.760> day<00:03:47.000> from<00:03:47.060> then<00:03:47.330> on<00:03:47.480> it

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
have every other day from then on it

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.290 
have every other day from then on it
should<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.890> might<00:03:49.250> show<00:03:49.489> improvement<00:03:49.940> after<00:03:50.090> a

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
should it might show improvement after a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.360 
should it might show improvement after a
week<00:03:50.540> but<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.170> might<00:03:51.350> take<00:03:51.380> up<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:51.920> six<00:03:52.190> weeks

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
week but it might take up to six weeks

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.550 
week but it might take up to six weeks
so<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.730> don't<00:03:53.090> really<00:03:53.180> know<00:03:53.600> but<00:03:54.260> I've<00:03:54.410> just

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.410 
so I don't really know but I've just
decided<00:03:54.830> to<00:03:55.070> throw<00:03:55.190> everything<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.880> can<00:03:56.090> at<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
decided to throw everything I can at the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.630 
decided to throw everything I can at the
fatigue<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.080> high<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.320> get<00:03:57.440> it<00:03:57.560> get<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.190> going

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
fatigue and high and get it get it going
