like showing the model here this would
be<00:00:28.080> heavy<00:00:28.289> tartar<00:00:28.710> obviously<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> would

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
be heavy tartar obviously this would

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
dog's mouth which would be a tip that

you might want to get your veterinary to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
have a look at that because this is the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.850 
have a look at that because this is the
case<00:00:36.960> they're<00:00:37.260> likely<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> need<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
case they're likely to need a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.200 
case they're likely to need a
professional<00:00:38.460> dental<00:00:38.760> cleaning<00:00:39.030> under

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
as possibly some extractions before

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
as possibly some extractions before
brushing<00:00:44.190> would<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.550> appropriate<00:00:44.969> because

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
brushing would be appropriate because

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.510 
brushing would be appropriate because
brushing<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.600> top<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.020> heavy<00:00:46.280> charge<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
brushing on top of a heavy charge of the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
brushing on top of a heavy charge of the
tooth<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.090> doesn't<00:00:48.390> do<00:00:48.480> any<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.690> but

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
tooth but he doesn't do any good but

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.930 
tooth but he doesn't do any good but
assuming<00:00:49.890> they're<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.670> regular

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
assuming they're not your regular

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
assuming they're not your regular
veterinary<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.510> recommended<00:00:51.899> regular<00:00:52.379> teeth

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
veterinary has recommended regular teeth

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
veterinary has recommended regular teeth
brushing<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:54.120> I'm<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.660> over<00:00:54.719> on

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
brushing and I'm just gonna go over on

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
brushing and I'm just gonna go over on
the<00:00:55.020> bottle<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.620> works<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the bottle how that works so you want to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
the bottle how that works so you want to
focus<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> upper<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.780> molars<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.469> like

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
focus on the upper back molars just like

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
focus on the upper back molars just like
that<00:00:58.859> especially<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.879> molar<00:01:00.120> here

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that especially on this molar here

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
that especially on this molar here
because<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> salivary<00:01:01.350> duct<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> right<00:01:01.980> over

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
because the salivary duct is right over

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
because the salivary duct is right over
top<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.609> tooth<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
top of that tooth right there so the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.850 
top of that tooth right there so the
dogs<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.899> continually<00:01:04.260> drooling<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.710> this

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
dogs are continually drooling on this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.320 
dogs are continually drooling on this
too<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> gets<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> tartar<00:01:06.060> buildup

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
too so it gets a lot of tartar buildup

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
too so it gets a lot of tartar buildup
so<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.170> behind<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.619> gum<00:01:07.799> line<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
so that would be behind the gum line you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
so that would be behind the gum line you
won't<00:01:08.220> comes<00:01:08.640> won't<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:08.970> able<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
won't comes won't be able to see it but

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
won't comes won't be able to see it but
that's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.770> important<00:01:11.189> tooth<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> brush

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that's a very important tooth to brush

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.870 
that's a very important tooth to brush
so<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.470> continue<00:01:13.830> along<00:01:14.250> across<00:01:14.549> here

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
so you would continue along across here

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
so you would continue along across here
on<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.090> molars<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:16.170> forget<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
on these molars I don't forget the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
on these molars I don't forget the
canine<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.070> lower<00:01:17.250> canine<00:01:17.700> lower<00:01:18.240> molars

canine here in lower canine lower molars

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.990 
canine here in lower canine lower molars
here<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> notice<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> lower<00:01:20.400> molars<00:01:20.790> back

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
here but I notice the lower molars back

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
here but I notice the lower molars back
here<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.509> access<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:21.990> until<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
here you don't get access to until you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.800 
here you don't get access to until you
open<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.189> most<00:01:23.369> likely<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
incisors at the front okay obviously I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.629 
incisors at the front okay obviously I
was<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> little<00:03:07.950> bit<00:03:08.040> shorter<00:03:08.370> there<00:03:08.519> you're

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
was a little bit shorter there you're

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.740 
was a little bit shorter there you're
going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> be<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.969> little<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.329> longer<00:03:09.540> than

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
going to be a little bit longer than

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.959 
going to be a little bit longer than
that<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.109> probably<00:03:10.709> about<00:03:10.889> a<00:03:10.950> minute<00:03:11.730> for<00:03:11.879> the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
that but probably about a minute for the

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.589 
that but probably about a minute for the
entire<00:03:12.239> mouth<00:03:12.450> is<00:03:12.719> sufficient<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:15.000> that's

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
entire mouth is sufficient so that's

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.020 
entire mouth is sufficient so that's
basically<00:03:16.500> how<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.739> do<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.040> brush<00:03:17.190> right<00:03:17.400> now

for your blog I did that once and I

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
definitely can't confirm that the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.809 
definitely can't confirm that the
toothpaste<00:03:40.560> does<00:03:40.979> taste<00:03:41.189> like<00:03:41.310> chicken

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
toothpaste does taste like chicken

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.979

brushing<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.479> you<00:03:48.569> do<00:03:48.689> get<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> little<00:03:49.079> bit<00:03:49.199> of

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
brushing and you do get a little bit of

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.469 
brushing and you do get a little bit of
bleeding<00:03:49.409> along<00:03:49.769> the<00:03:49.889> gum<00:03:50.069> line<00:03:50.120> that's<00:03:51.120> okay
