00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the layer of 0.25 because my whole

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.419 
the layer of 0.25 because my whole
computer<00:02:07.240> could<00:02:07.690> not<00:02:07.720> take<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.349> short<00:02:08.979> delay

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
computer could not take this short delay

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.699 
computer could not take this short delay
the<00:02:10.060> delay<00:02:10.390> has<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.599> lot<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.989> do<00:02:11.110> with<00:02:11.140> what<00:02:11.530> your

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
the delay has a lot to do with what your

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.730 
the delay has a lot to do with what your
computer<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.520> process<00:02:12.550> at<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.120> time<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.080> if<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
computer can process at a time so if you

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.380 
computer can process at a time so if you
spam<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.310> too<00:02:15.520> much<00:02:15.700> especially<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.360> have

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
spam it too much especially if you have

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.730 
spam it too much especially if you have
a<00:02:16.510> macro<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.080> lot<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> things

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
a macro with a lot of things

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.100 
a macro with a lot of things
what<00:02:18.340> happens<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:18.940> your<00:02:19.750> computer's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
what happens is that your computer's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.050 
what happens is that your computer's
gonna<00:02:20.200> freeze<00:02:20.530> up<00:02:20.740> or<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.250> could<00:02:21.490> lack<00:02:21.760> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
gonna freeze up or it could lack and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.640 
gonna freeze up or it could lack and
make<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:22.600> make<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.290> lag<00:02:23.560> okay<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:25.090> delay

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
make you make you lag okay so that delay

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.290 
make you make you lag okay so that delay
you<00:02:26.650> make<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.250> how<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.610> think<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.180> to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
you make it how you think it's going to

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.690 
you make it how you think it's going to
be<00:02:28.390> better<00:02:28.570> for<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.960> I<00:02:28.990> say<00:02:29.470> don't<00:02:29.950> do<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.160> one

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
be better for you I say don't do it one

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.600 
be better for you I say don't do it one
second<00:02:31.180> don't<00:02:31.960> do<00:02:32.080> half<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:32.380> second<00:02:32.800> or<00:02:32.920> less

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
second don't do half a second or less

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.980 
second don't do half a second or less
than<00:02:33.790> half<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.030> second<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:34.630> global

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
than half a second just because global

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.410 
than half a second just because global
cool<00:02:35.350> downs<00:02:35.560> okay<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.460> what<00:02:36.820> does<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.180> macro

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
cool downs okay so what does this macro

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.080 
cool downs okay so what does this macro
do<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:38.020> all<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.890> micro<00:02:39.190> zoo<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.550> do<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
do or all this micro zoo that I do and

do or all this micro zoo that I do and
my<00:02:40.720> hope<00:02:41.190> side<00:02:42.190> view<00:02:42.520> on<00:02:42.760> my<00:02:42.940> whole<00:02:43.120> pad<00:02:43.710> this

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
my hope side view on my whole pad this

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.000 
my hope side view on my whole pad this
micro<00:02:45.130> what<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.490> does<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.940> so<00:02:46.240> when<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.010> click

plastic<00:03:12.790> under<00:03:13.330> that<00:03:13.950> grows<00:03:14.950> old<00:03:15.280> we<00:03:15.670> could

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
plastic under that grows old we could

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.400 
plastic under that grows old we could
say<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.090> how<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:16.300> say<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.570> grows<00:03:16.840> old<00:03:17.080> it

say it's how you say it grows old it

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.430 
say it's how you say it grows old it
gets<00:03:17.650> all<00:03:17.860> anyway<00:03:18.460> and<00:03:18.730> get<00:03:19.000> ya<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.450> eat<00:03:19.930> what

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
gets all anyway and get ya you eat what

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.600 
gets all anyway and get ya you eat what
it<00:03:20.560> wear<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.280> tear<00:03:21.520> okay<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.800> yeah<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:24.100> you

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
it wear and tear okay so yeah so you

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.090 
it wear and tear okay so yeah so you
makes<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.480> hole<00:03:25.780> into<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.260> plastic<00:03:26.500> and<00:03:26.950> then

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
makes a hole into the plastic and then

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.700 
makes a hole into the plastic and then
eventually<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.910> won't<00:03:28.090> click<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.500> the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
eventually you won't click it so the

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.640 
eventually you won't click it so the
same<00:03:29.920> thing<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.280> with<00:03:30.580> those<00:03:31.440> right<00:03:32.440> here<00:03:32.620> I

same thing I do with those right here I
have<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.250> my<00:03:33.490> critical<00:03:33.970> AOE<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:35.200> dis<00:03:35.440> keys

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
have to my critical AOE I just dis keys

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.740 
have to my critical AOE I just dis keys
normally<00:03:36.460> I<00:03:36.490> use<00:03:36.790> these<00:03:37.000> two<00:03:37.180> kids<00:03:37.390> were<00:03:37.570> here

normally I use these two kids were here
for<00:03:37.960> a<00:03:38.110> OES<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.770> I<00:03:38.800> make<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> macro<00:03:39.760> suit<00:03:40.090> also

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
for a OES and I make a macro suit also

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.140 
for a OES and I make a macro suit also
clicks<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.500> me<00:03:41.740> so<00:03:42.340> let's<00:03:42.520> go<00:03:42.610> to<00:03:42.670> Mac<00:03:42.910> rose

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
clicks for me so let's go to Mac rose

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.230 
clicks for me so let's go to Mac rose
again<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.390> I'll<00:03:43.630> show<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:43.990> one<00:03:45.240> what's

person<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.850> figure<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.240> out<00:03:58.360> if

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
person is but you can figure it out if

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.080 
person is but you can figure it out if
you<00:03:58.660> actually<00:03:58.750> mean<00:03:59.050> okay<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.770> didn't<00:04:00.730> read<00:04:00.880> any

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
you actually mean okay I didn't read any

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.600 
you actually mean okay I didn't read any
other<00:04:01.270> guys<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:01.660> figure<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.050> out<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> I

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
other guys and I figure it out so I

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.460 
other guys and I figure it out so I
don't<00:04:03.820> think<00:04:04.150> it's<00:04:04.300> hard<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:04.720> just<00:04:05.050> have<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.320> get

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
don't think it's hard I just have to get

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.100 
don't think it's hard I just have to get
into<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:05.980> read<00:04:06.220> really<00:04:07.000> most<00:04:07.600> most<00:04:07.960> of<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
into it and read really most most of the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.420 
into it and read really most most of the
time<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.410> magic<00:04:08.740> of<00:04:08.830> learning<00:04:09.130> things<00:04:09.310> is

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
time the magic of learning things is

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.150 
time the magic of learning things is
just<00:04:09.460> read<00:04:09.910> how<00:04:10.900> do<00:04:10.960> you<00:04:11.050> get<00:04:11.200> better<00:04:11.410> well<00:04:11.740> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
just read how do you get better well you

just read how do you get better well you
read<00:04:12.370> every<00:04:12.640> single<00:04:12.670> skill<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.740> then<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:14.860> try

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
read every single skill and then you try

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.060 
read every single skill and then you try
to<00:04:15.040> figure<00:04:15.280> out<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.730> skills<00:04:16.030> are<00:04:16.150> for<00:04:17.070> a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
to figure out what the skills are for a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.520
