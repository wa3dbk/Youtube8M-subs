of the solid rocket boosters this was
our<00:00:26.390> other<00:00:26.600> great<00:00:27.110> journey<00:00:28.300> but<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.480> view

our other great journey but the view
from<00:00:29.720> space<00:00:30.350> has<00:00:30.830> changed<00:00:31.340> as<00:00:31.490> well<00:00:31.700> since<00:00:32.150> we

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
from space has changed as well since we

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.920 
from space has changed as well since we
first<00:00:32.540> went<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.110> moon

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
first went to the moon

first went to the moon
today's<00:00:35.930> astronauts<00:00:36.590> seemed<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.489> be<00:00:37.640> looking

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
today's astronauts seemed to be looking

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.340 
today's astronauts seemed to be looking
in<00:00:38.180> a<00:00:38.300> different<00:00:38.330> direction

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
in a different direction

in a different direction
I<00:00:40.750> met<00:00:41.750> astronaut<00:00:42.350> Julie<00:00:42.770> Payette<00:00:43.010> at<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
I met astronaut Julie Payette at the

this<00:00:49.220> is<00:00:49.400> a<00:00:49.430> mock-up<00:00:49.730> of<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.090> real<00:00:50.330> thing<00:00:50.600> is

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
this is a mock-up of the real thing is

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.939 
this is a mock-up of the real thing is
it<00:00:50.900> I<00:00:50.989> mean<00:00:51.110> is<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.350> all<00:00:51.440> done<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.800> is

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
it I mean is it all done this is

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.030 
it I mean is it all done this is
actually<00:00:52.370> scale<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:53.030> scale<00:00:53.059> mock-up<00:00:53.860> this<00:00:54.860> is

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
actually scale a scale mock-up this is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.160 
actually scale a scale mock-up this is
to<00:00:55.220> really<00:00:55.519> show<00:00:55.790> what<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.269> cargo<00:00:56.809> bay<00:00:56.960> looks

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
to really show what the cargo bay looks

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.079 
to really show what the cargo bay looks
like<00:00:57.379> but<00:00:57.589> we<00:00:57.710> when<00:00:58.040> we<00:00:58.159> train<00:00:58.489> here<00:00:58.879> in<00:00:58.909> this

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
like but we when we train here in this

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.820 
like but we when we train here in this
particular<00:00:59.330> facility<00:00:59.629> we<00:01:00.170> really<00:01:00.470> use<00:01:00.650> the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
particular facility we really use the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.560 
particular facility we really use the
front<00:01:01.309> part<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.729> cockpit<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.360> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
front part of the cockpit and the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.980 
front part of the cockpit and the
mid-deck<00:01:06.190> building<00:01:07.190> nine<00:01:07.630> it's<00:01:08.630> where<00:01:08.870> you

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
mid-deck building nine it's where you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.410 
mid-deck building nine it's where you
practice<00:01:09.200> how<00:01:09.680> to<00:01:09.740> spend<00:01:10.100> days<00:01:10.400> or<00:01:10.820> months<00:01:11.060> in

and<00:02:03.820> every<00:02:04.820> time<00:02:05.240> you<00:02:05.420> see<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.750> very<00:02:05.780> well<00:02:06.320> that

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
and every time you see it very well that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.730 
and every time you see it very well that
thin<00:02:07.310> thin<00:02:08.030> thin<00:02:08.060> layer<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.320> above<00:02:09.500> the

thin thin thin layer just above the
surface<00:02:09.920> we're<00:02:10.340> way<00:02:10.610> above<00:02:10.940> that<00:02:11.000> thin<00:02:11.360> there

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
surface we're way above that thin there

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.660 
surface we're way above that thin there
and<00:02:12.110> that's<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:12.860> atmosphere<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> earth

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
and that's the atmosphere of the earth

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.380 
and that's the atmosphere of the earth
that<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.710> if<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.920> tend<00:02:16.460> doesn't<00:02:17.210> come

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
that is it if you tend doesn't come

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.220 
that is it if you tend doesn't come
