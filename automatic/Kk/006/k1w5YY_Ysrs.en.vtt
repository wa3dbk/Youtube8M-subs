00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.920 
their mouth that's all my cats do anyway
and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:47.010> thought<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.730> what's<00:00:48.239> different<00:00:48.809> then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
and I thought well what's different then

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.360 
and I thought well what's different then
I<00:00:48.960> realized<00:00:49.200> oh<00:00:49.379> he's<00:00:49.649> cheek<00:00:49.890> stove<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> it

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I realized oh he's cheek stove of it

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
I realized oh he's cheek stove of it
also<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.879> he<00:00:51.059> plays<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.719> vibrato<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
also in he plays the vibrato is

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:04.780 
also in he plays the vibrato is
completely

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.880 

so<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> question<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.960> mean

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
so it's more a question of I mean

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.560 
so it's more a question of I mean
they're<00:01:08.070> their<00:01:08.340> ups<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.820> down<00:01:08.939> side<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.420> when

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
they're their ups and down side so when

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.999 
they're their ups and down side so when
I<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.259> feel<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.649> bit<00:01:10.860> more

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
I do that I can feel a little bit more

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.620 
I do that I can feel a little bit more
of<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> push<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.610> back<00:01:11.820> than<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.270> other<00:01:12.420> way

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
of a push in my back than the other way

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
of a push in my back than the other way

flu<00:01:15.570> feels<00:01:15.840> lighter<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.680> why<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
flu feels lighter and that's why I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.980

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.889 
hesitate to use the word share because
it's<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.640> overused<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.390> share<00:01:24.690> this

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
it's so overused but share this

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's so overused but share this
information<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.060> flu<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.479> feel<00:01:27.690> heavy

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
information the the flu can feel heavy

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.080
