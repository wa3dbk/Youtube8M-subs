00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hey cousin do you remember the riots in 2005? 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.930
 or Larzac 2003 it's always the same who clink 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 The third world outside of Europe fortress ghettos, precarious and millions 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.180
 of distress Nothing stops the arms sellers and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.180
 their mass media Nothing stops the advertisers they take 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 the whole space And while the ecological deal is red 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.070
 It's the biggest polluters who repaint everything in green 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.820
 At the moment do not put a hi-kick in the decor 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:42.420
 It is to veil one's face and whip one's own brothers 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.090
 Because while they add the word sustainable to each sentence 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.649
 They continue to plunder iron, cotton, gas 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.980
 Must cost drip or not dismount all that 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.469
 Must block the ports roads and villas Séguéla 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:54.469
 Must climb the towers of firms and rip all their contracts 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.469
 To requisition the land and grow the hillia 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.469
 Like Henry David Thoreau as the Yomango movement 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:57.469
 We disobey (chorus) Like the popular assembly of peoples 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:07.170
 of Oaxaca Like the Volunteer Reavers as the party 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:21.729
 Black Panthers Like the Landless Movement as the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.179
 antinuclear 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.939
 Hey Rhouya disobey it's now rather fashion 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.920
 We can no longer feed on their sick animals 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.849
 Almost all rivers carry their pesticides 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:39.310
 And silence when France supervises a genocide We will always hear that breaking everything 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.490
 it's not good Or the eternal "what good is it for 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:50.159
 for nothing "We forget that for putting the planet to 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.159
 knees They were not really understanding peace 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.539
 and sweet It's the race against the clock it takes 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.859
 now all farting With the countries of the South it is solidarity 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.439
 We are riddled with love no RFID chip 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:07.639
 The DNA of bullshit we will all decode it at any cost drip 

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:15.830
 or not disassemble all that must block the Bolloré, the Monsanto, the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.830
 Areva We obey our values ​​and we build our 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.270
 arm On boycotts it is ruse and on the occasion they are 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.270
 fuck the Darwa 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.540
 Like the Neon Clan, like the Unbinders like the Aggression Resistance group 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.620
 Advertising Like Clown Brigades, or Yes Men 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 and their jokes Like the genocide group Made In France at 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190
 Champ de Mars As the movement of Conti smashing the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.550
 prefecture like the call of the 200 masters, like the action 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.970
 Black Thursday As the endurance of the Education Network Without 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.770
 Border Like Rockin to Denisot or Tiken Jah to victories 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.770
 The films of Coline Serreau, Pierre Carles or Michael Moore 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.770
 Like Wikileaks sites like millions of hackers 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.330
 Like Hessel, Rosa Parks, like Mandela and Gandhi 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.760
 Like Yves Peirat, Sankara or Adolfo Kaminsky Like the people of Egypt, Iceland 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.150
 and Tunisia Like what we do every day modestly 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.720
 of our lives 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.750
 Must cost drip or not dismount all that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.114
 Should block EADS Dassault Thomson and Matra Must stop the industrialists and stop 

00:03:08.114 --> 00:03:09.114
 their damage Must roll up the sleeves and unscrew 

00:03:09.114 --> 00:03:10.114
 all their gear 

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.114
 Should not entrust the controllers to all these pegs of the ENA 

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:21.670
 Must cost drip or not dismount all that 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.398
 We obey our values ​​and build our arms 

00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:23.410
 We boycot on cunning and on the occasion we fuck them Darwa
