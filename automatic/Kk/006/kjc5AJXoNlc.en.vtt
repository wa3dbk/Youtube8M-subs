00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
any reason at all I can just observe him

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.580 
any reason at all I can just observe him
I'm<00:00:47.950> probably<00:00:48.400> a<00:00:48.520> little<00:00:48.640> bit<00:00:48.850> close<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:50.170> this

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
I'm probably a little bit close but this

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.440 
I'm probably a little bit close but this
is<00:00:50.740> a<00:00:50.770> way<00:00:50.980> of<00:00:51.010> observing<00:00:51.880> their<00:00:52.060> natural

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
is a way of observing their natural

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.870 
is a way of observing their natural
behavior<00:00:52.989> it's<00:00:53.560> just<00:00:53.710> trying<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.160> warm<00:00:54.460> up<00:00:54.670> and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
behavior it's just trying to warm up and

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.680 
behavior it's just trying to warm up and
get<00:00:55.000> moving

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
get moving

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.740 
get moving
it's<00:00:56.440> eyesight<00:00:57.040> is<00:00:57.310> not<00:00:57.520> very<00:00:57.790> good<00:00:58.060> probably

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
it's eyesight is not very good probably

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's eyesight is not very good probably
can't<00:00:58.989> even<00:00:59.230> see<00:00:59.500> me<00:00:59.560> because<00:00:59.890> I'm<00:01:00.010> not<00:01:00.160> moving

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
can't even see me because I'm not moving

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.600 
can't even see me because I'm not moving
once<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.060> move<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:02.770> it<00:01:02.890> will<00:01:02.980> pick<00:01:03.130> up<00:01:03.250> on<00:01:03.460> that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
once I move then it will pick up on that

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.560 
once I move then it will pick up on that
movement<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.369> flat<00:01:06.610> bellies<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.240> scale

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
movement the flat bellies and that scale

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.170 
movement the flat bellies and that scale
pick<00:01:07.930> up<00:01:08.110> vibrations<00:01:08.530> in<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.250> ground<00:01:09.340> the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
pick up vibrations in the ground the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.780 
pick up vibrations in the ground the
sand<00:01:10.570> here<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.170> very<00:01:11.560> soft<00:01:11.920> and<00:01:12.159> low<00:01:12.399> me<00:01:12.460> and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
sand here is very soft and low me and

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120 
sand here is very soft and low me and
it's<00:01:13.420> not<00:01:13.509> sent<00:01:13.840> here<00:01:13.930> a<00:01:14.140> lot<00:01:14.320> of<00:01:14.439> vibrations

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
it's not sent here a lot of vibrations

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.640 
it's not sent here a lot of vibrations
so<00:01:15.969> I<00:01:16.000> was<00:01:16.119> able<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.420> sneak<00:01:16.869> up<00:01:17.049> very<00:01:17.320> quietly

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
so I was able to sneak up very quietly

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.420 
so I was able to sneak up very quietly
on<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:18.190> guy<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:23.350> not<00:01:23.409> threatening<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.250> in

any way snakes will react badly to

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.469 
any way snakes will react badly to
violence<00:01:27.729> or<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.330> stress<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:31.060> red-bellied

look across the nape of the neck they
just<00:03:05.180> form<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.600> beautiful<00:03:06.260> pattern<00:03:06.530> that's

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
just form this beautiful pattern that's

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.430 
just form this beautiful pattern that's
what<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:07.040> goes<00:03:07.190> in<00:03:07.400> bit<00:03:07.610> like<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
what it goes in bit like that just the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.050 
what it goes in bit like that just the
way<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.680> life's<00:03:09.920> catching<00:03:10.400> them<00:03:10.549> at<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.730> at

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
way that life's catching them at just at

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.590 
way that life's catching them at just at
this<00:03:11.150> moment<00:03:12.370> makes<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.579> it's<00:03:14.209> almost<00:03:14.450> an

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
this moment makes it it's almost an

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.509 
this moment makes it it's almost an
optical<00:03:15.019> illusion<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.769> eyes<00:03:15.920> sort<00:03:16.400> of

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
optical illusion that the eyes sort of

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.770 
optical illusion that the eyes sort of
you<00:03:16.850> know<00:03:17.000> seeing<00:03:18.160> those<00:03:19.160> shapes<00:03:19.519> there<00:03:19.850> also

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
you know seeing those shapes there also

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.910 
you know seeing those shapes there also
to<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.320> there

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
to put that there

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.590 
to put that there
it's<00:03:22.850> almost<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.660> aboriginal<00:03:24.230> art<00:03:24.410> has

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
it's almost like the aboriginal art has

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.150 
it's almost like the aboriginal art has
what<00:03:26.600> looks<00:03:26.780> like<00:03:26.870> ribs<00:03:27.260> there<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:27.980> the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
what looks like ribs there there so the

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.770 
what looks like ribs there there so the
patterns<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:28.820> scales<00:03:29.120> are<00:03:29.390> forming

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
patterns that the scales are forming

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.559 
patterns that the scales are forming
they're<00:03:31.630> very<00:03:32.630> delicate<00:03:33.049> in<00:03:33.590> snake<00:03:33.920> too

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.280 

the<00:03:38.569> cheek<00:03:38.930> here<00:03:40.239> swells<00:03:41.239> out<00:03:41.450> bet<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.930> venom

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
the cheek here swells out bet the venom

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.320 
the cheek here swells out bet the venom
glands<00:03:42.530> right<00:03:42.890> in<00:03:43.099> there<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:43.670> how<00:03:43.879> you<00:03:43.940> snake

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
glands right in there it's how you snake

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.619 
glands right in there it's how you snake
that<00:03:44.510> would<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:44.959> really<00:03:45.440> swell<00:03:45.890> out<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:47.450> does

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
that would so really swell out it does

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.350 
that would so really swell out it does
look<00:03:47.840> very<00:03:47.870> much<00:03:48.230> like<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.500> tiger<00:03:48.830> snake<00:03:49.360> but

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
look very much like a tiger snake but

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.990 
look very much like a tiger snake but
here<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.930> venom<00:03:51.200> glands<00:03:51.410> not<00:03:51.709> quite<00:03:52.430> as<00:03:52.730> much

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
here the venom glands not quite as much

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.050 
here the venom glands not quite as much
and<00:03:53.390> which<00:03:53.989> is<00:03:54.140> sort<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.680> angle<00:03:55.190> there

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
and which is sort of the angle there

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.589 
and which is sort of the angle there
goes<00:03:57.049> up<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.379> bit<00:03:57.410> more<00:03:58.299> there's<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.360> very<00:03:59.540> very

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
goes up a bit more there's a very very

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.979 
goes up a bit more there's a very very
subtle<00:04:00.110> differences<00:04:00.910> little<00:04:01.910> frontal<00:04:02.660> style

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
subtle differences little frontal style

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.150 
subtle differences little frontal style
there<00:04:03.260> between<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.830> eyes<00:04:05.349> again<00:04:06.349> take<00:04:06.830> snakes

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
there between the eyes again take snakes

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.539 
there between the eyes again take snakes
much<00:04:07.400> wider<00:04:07.730> crosshairs<00:04:08.330> is<00:04:08.630> sort<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:08.930> flatter

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
much wider crosshairs is sort of flatter

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.430 
much wider crosshairs is sort of flatter
more<00:04:10.549> narrow<00:04:10.880> for<00:04:11.299> other<00:04:11.390> bit<00:04:12.110> more<00:04:12.290> like<00:04:12.410> a

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
more narrow for other bit more like a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.030 
more narrow for other bit more like a
copperhead

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
copperhead

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.610 
copperhead
but<00:04:13.670> again<00:04:13.910> hasn't<00:04:14.299> got<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.450> gluttony<00:04:15.380> yeah

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
but again hasn't got that gluttony yeah

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.860 
but again hasn't got that gluttony yeah
copy<00:04:15.860> its<00:04:16.070> own<00:04:16.280> had<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:16.579> shiny<00:04:17.450> gloss

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
copy its own had this shiny gloss

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.810 
copy its own had this shiny gloss
machine<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.799> him<00:04:18.950> that<00:04:20.049> this<00:04:21.049> black<00:04:21.290> snake<00:04:21.470> has

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.760 

right<00:04:25.820> now<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:26.120> snake<00:04:26.600> cannot<00:04:27.260> see<00:04:27.590> me

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
right now the snake cannot see me

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.830 
right now the snake cannot see me
because<00:04:28.010> I'm<00:04:28.160> not<00:04:28.310> moving<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:29.060> can't<00:04:29.360> hear<00:04:29.690> me

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
because I'm not moving it can't hear me

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.440 
because I'm not moving it can't hear me
it<00:04:30.110> doesn't<00:04:30.350> have<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.740> ears<00:04:31.100> I'm<00:04:31.490> not<00:04:32.090> moving

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
it doesn't have the ears I'm not moving

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.180 
it doesn't have the ears I'm not moving
around<00:04:32.539> too<00:04:32.930> much<00:04:33.169> so<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.530> cannot<00:04:33.800> feel

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
around too much so it cannot feel

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.390 
around too much so it cannot feel
vibrations<00:04:34.970> through<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.539> ground

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
vibrations through the ground

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.790 
vibrations through the ground
it<00:04:37.400> sort<00:04:37.940> of<00:04:38.000> suspects<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:38.810> I'm<00:04:39.020> here<00:04:39.470> it's

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
it sort of suspects that I'm here it's

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.219 
it sort of suspects that I'm here it's
tongues<00:04:40.160> flickering<00:04:40.820> it<00:04:41.090> knows<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:41.720> there's

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
tongues flickering it knows that there's

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.290 
tongues flickering it knows that there's
something<00:04:42.500> around<00:04:42.979> but<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.880> survival

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
something around but the survival

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.909 
something around but the survival
strategy<00:04:44.900> for<00:04:44.930> this<00:04:45.200> animal<00:04:45.560> there's

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
strategy for this animal there's

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.400 
strategy for this animal there's
probably<00:04:46.220> just<00:04:46.280> a<00:04:46.550> keep<00:04:46.820> still<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:48.110> keeps

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
probably just a keep still the keeps

the other snakes that I've seen on the

the other snakes that I've seen on the
side<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.310> first<00:05:31.680> couple<00:05:32.680> rows<00:05:32.830> of<00:05:33.100> scales<00:05:33.550> it
