commit your career yes a lot of reasons
a<00:00:14.180> lot<00:00:14.270> of<00:00:14.420> factors<00:00:17.350> for<00:00:18.350> me<00:00:18.500> I<00:00:18.529> think<00:00:18.920> it's<00:00:19.250> I

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
a lot of factors for me I think it's I

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.739 
a lot of factors for me I think it's I
really<00:00:22.339> feel<00:00:22.730> that<00:00:22.759> the<00:00:22.999> club<00:00:23.179> is<00:00:23.240> going<00:00:23.390> in

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
really feel that the club is going in

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:26.409 
really feel that the club is going in
the<00:00:24.050> right<00:00:24.169> direction<00:00:24.349> I<00:00:24.919> felt<00:00:25.640> that<00:00:25.789> for<00:00:26.029> some

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
the right direction I felt that for some

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.849 
the right direction I felt that for some
time<00:00:26.449> now<00:00:26.660> I<00:00:28.749> think<00:00:29.749> the<00:00:29.839> squad<00:00:30.109> is<00:00:30.140> getting

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
time now I think the squad is getting

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.250 
time now I think the squad is getting
stronger<00:00:31.070> each<00:00:31.279> year<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:31.909> I<00:00:32.060> think<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:33.110> way

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
stronger each year and I think the way

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.960 
stronger each year and I think the way
to<00:00:33.320> manage<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:33.800> club<00:00:33.980> is<00:00:34.190> brilliantly

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
to manage the club is brilliantly

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.990 
to manage the club is brilliantly
brilliant<00:00:35.720> they<00:00:36.440> they<00:00:37.340> managed<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.699> keep<00:00:37.820> the

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
brilliant they they managed to keep the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.779 
brilliant they they managed to keep the
players<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:38.510> I<00:00:39.460> had<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.789> few<00:00:41.090> really<00:00:41.570> good

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
players and I had a few really good

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.740 
players and I had a few really good
silence<00:00:43.789> every<00:00:44.030> year<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.789> it's<00:00:46.789> very<00:00:47.570> healthy

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
silence every year and it's very healthy

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.110 
silence every year and it's very healthy
out<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.140> how<00:00:48.230> they<00:00:48.350> run<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:48.620> club<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.120> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.370

I<00:01:36.710> think<00:01:37.509> it's<00:01:38.509> proven<00:01:38.840> last<00:01:39.020> few<00:01:39.200> years<00:01:39.229> that

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
I think it's proven last few years that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.780 
I think it's proven last few years that
is<00:01:39.590> a<00:01:39.619> he's<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.040> top<00:01:40.280> player<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:40.729> league

is a he's a top player in this league

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.300 
is a he's a top player in this league
and<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:43.270> think<00:01:44.270> we<00:01:44.329> really<00:01:44.540> connected<00:01:45.280> on<00:01:46.280> the

and I think we really connected on the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.940 
and I think we really connected on the
pitch<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.170> love<00:01:48.170> playing<00:01:48.409> with<00:01:48.500> him<00:01:48.740> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
hopefully it could be to be a long-term

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.550 
hopefully it could be to be a long-term
