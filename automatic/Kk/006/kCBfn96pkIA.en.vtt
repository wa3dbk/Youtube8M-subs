all<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> metal<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.670> legs<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.090> metal

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
all of it is metal the legs are metal

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.200 
all of it is metal the legs are metal
the<00:00:40.110> base<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> metal<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.340> slider<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
the base is metal the slider for the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
the base is metal the slider for the
adjuster<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.809> metal<00:00:43.230> underneath<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.640> movers

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
adjuster is metal underneath the movers

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.209 
adjuster is metal underneath the movers
and<00:00:45.210> stuff<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.719> metal<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.890> only<00:00:47.039> things

and stuff for all metal the only things

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.970 
and stuff for all metal the only things
that<00:00:47.309> are<00:00:47.430> plastic<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.110> lock<00:00:49.350> or

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that are plastic on it is the lock or

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.389 
that are plastic on it is the lock or
the<00:00:50.340> slider<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.390> well<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.190> knobs

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the slider as well as I think the knobs

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
the slider as well as I think the knobs
here<00:00:54.120> aren't<00:00:54.600> plastic<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.170> they're<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
here aren't plastic but they're the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
here aren't plastic but they're the
knobs<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.489> very<00:00:56.730> strong<00:00:57.059> plastic<00:00:57.570> they're

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
knobs are very strong plastic they're

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
knobs are very strong plastic they're
not<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> cheap<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.579> but<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.120> first

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
not like the cheap kind but the first

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.039 
not like the cheap kind but the first
thing<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.469> mental<00:01:03.049> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

second thing that I like about it is you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.530 
second thing that I like about it is you
adjust<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.860> sliding<00:01:08.340> bar<00:01:08.549> by<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:09.479> foot<00:01:09.840> and

works

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450 
works
whenever<00:01:15.659> nobody's<00:01:16.320> working<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> pedal

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
whenever nobody's working on the pedal

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.649 
whenever nobody's working on the pedal
and<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.960> unlock<00:01:19.470> position<00:01:20.659> move

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and this is on the unlock position move

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
and this is on the unlock position move
this<00:01:21.869> down<00:01:22.310> wherever<00:01:23.310> at<00:01:23.549> once<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.210> not

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this down wherever at once it's not

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
this down wherever at once it's not
going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.840> anywhere<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.829> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> have

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
going to go anywhere but if you have

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.270 
going to go anywhere but if you have
like<00:01:29.460> bigger<00:01:29.729> projects<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:31.409> slides<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like bigger projects this slides all the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.289 
like bigger projects this slides all the
way<00:01:32.400> off<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.829> then<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> reverse<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:35.939> this

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
way off and then you can reverse it this

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.640 
way off and then you can reverse it this
way

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760 

in<00:01:41.250> case<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.550> have<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.820> bigger<00:01:42.030> item<00:01:42.590> it<00:01:43.590> was

in case you have the bigger item it was

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.680 
in case you have the bigger item it was

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
so close it also comes with another

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.650 
so close it also comes with another
slider<00:01:48.690> that's<00:01:49.320> all<00:01:49.590> metal<00:01:50.300> that's<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.420> little

it back out and then back in there's a
little<00:03:34.260> hole<00:03:34.470> right<00:03:34.860> under<00:03:35.519> here<00:03:35.820> where<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
little hole right under here where it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.170 
little hole right under here where it
can<00:03:37.050> go<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.680> compressed<00:03:38.070> in<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:38.430> and

can go and it compressed in them and
then<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.959> make<00:03:40.110> sure<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.320> stays<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.709> there<00:03:40.920> you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
then to make sure it stays in there you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.160 
then to make sure it stays in there you
can<00:03:41.160> tighten<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.550> up<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.660> not<00:03:42.900> going

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
can tighten it up and now it's not going

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.729 
can tighten it up and now it's not going
anywhere

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
anywhere

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the legs fold up real easily the knobs I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.010 
the legs fold up real easily the knobs I
just<00:03:46.590> told<00:03:46.769> you

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
just told you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:04:01.490 
just told you

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.960 

wasn't<00:04:02.500> talking<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.280> probably<00:04:03.580> have<00:04:03.760> gotten

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
wasn't talking I probably have gotten

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.050 
wasn't talking I probably have gotten
that<00:04:04.120> done<00:04:04.330> in<00:04:04.420> about<00:04:04.480> 30<00:04:04.900> seconds<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.820> now<00:04:06.820> it

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
that done in about 30 seconds and now it

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.680 
that done in about 30 seconds and now it
is<00:04:07.180> collapsed<00:04:07.870> it's<00:04:08.650> easy<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:09.100> take<00:04:09.690> just

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
is collapsed it's easy to take just

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.550 
is collapsed it's easy to take just
about<00:04:10.900> anywhere

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
about anywhere

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.500 
about anywhere
another<00:04:12.160> feature<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.550> I<00:04:12.700> like<00:04:12.850> about<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.210> is

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
another feature that I like about it is

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.680 
another feature that I like about it is
a<00:04:13.590> little<00:04:14.590> adjuster<00:04:15.370> right<00:04:15.610> here<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.270> this

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
a little adjuster right here and this

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.890

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
just take it off it just slides off like

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.980 
just take it off it just slides off like
that<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.460> they<00:04:30.520> can<00:04:30.670> pull<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.940> off<00:04:31.090> but<00:04:31.870> this

that and they can pull it off but this
is<00:04:32.170> a<00:04:32.200> good<00:04:32.530> safety<00:04:33.250> measure<00:04:34.000> here<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.470> just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
is a good safety measure here it just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.530 
is a good safety measure here it just
keeps<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.370> from<00:04:36.520> falling<00:04:36.910> off<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:37.240> in<00:04:37.360> case

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
keeps it from falling off just in case

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.190 
keeps it from falling off just in case
if<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.870> happens<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.560> break<00:04:38.890> underneath<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:41.050> as
