00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Beauty and the sound oberdan and boy 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 We are here to make a gameplay 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.610
 pokémon shudder and it was not 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 The name of the game is the same as the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.470
 It is a machine in which the day is a ps3 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 pokemon based arcade machine 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 little box goes away choosing me 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.090
 boot is piloting the beauty machine 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm just recording nintendo crap 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.119
 none of pokémon 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 you can put there to demonstrate the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 machine and its panel is this green part 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.640
 It's there to put the cards. 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.170
 put a little card on each card 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.520
 card that means a pokémon 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 will enter the game 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.610
 now it will choose the region appears 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.710
 Pokémon the line can go out to 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.430
 face in the end he will get the chance 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.010
 to catch one of them is a shout 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.640
 here this machine is new has four 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 cabinets here on the side and is full of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.149
 people playing here and on the side have a 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.949
 playground and a lot of children 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.250
 shouting is putting the cards on 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.250
 there 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.710
 and only that he has actually been like this 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.630
 he got as each death 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.090
 leading to the analysis of buying and selling 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.790
 can have value and second because 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.200
 today nobody took tinga in luck he 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.500
 was all happy screaming here in the 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.500
 arcade 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 I found the pokemon indemnity he 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 so cool 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.799
 and that's hygiene is weird does not ring 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.210
 also is pp also the look of the game is 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.240
 There are cute people there, he will choose 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.770
 the attack has one more little panel there 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.479
 but a skin underneath I 'm using 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.670
 Sélvio here to see if no one catches me 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:56.840
 recording the concierge flavor I remember 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:03.310
 I always choose the attack and there it goes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.310
 to scare the buttons there it's gone 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.929
 the attack is that way but the saints 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.019
 Who plays for you, only chooses the bug. 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.030
 beat up button panics will choose it 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.890
 again and which will only beat the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.830
 usually from what I understood the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.840
 damage on all pokémon still understands 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.099
 right as the game works but 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.730
 The way you 're doing is working. 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.730
 for a while 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.920
 What are we doing there? 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.260
 let's go to that person who played against 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 the animals is the son he is in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.670
 The next day he's in the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.990
 the choice of back 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.260
 I tried the palette one more window 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.400
 side indicating time to 10 98 chose 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 I do not know what about gay. 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.600
 Then my father will involve you and you will see the idol 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.720
 ex-pilot gerhard arrives and leaves the ground 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:25.959
 disappeared was because if the car was 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:28.120
 wrong that the eventual fault is not now and will 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.580
 choose paper because good it will play 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.170
 in animal or why many thousand ball 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.350
 Can we help the bugs? 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.920
 he wants her to squeeze you in the 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:43.500
 normal roll ball poker 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.500
 There they do something that will arrest someone, right? 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.870
 I suggest to others it was from these two 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.550
 he will be able to choose an ambassador 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:00.270
 so that it exists 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.860
