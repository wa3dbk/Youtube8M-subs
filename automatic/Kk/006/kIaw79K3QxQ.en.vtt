00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
kind of extending that a little bit

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.039 
kind of extending that a little bit
adding<00:02:43.610> some<00:02:43.819> two<00:02:43.970> five<00:02:44.239> ones<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:44.840> adding

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
adding some two five ones and adding

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.339 
adding some two five ones and adding
some<00:02:45.260> kind<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.590> chromatic<00:02:46.069> ideas<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:47.349> I'll

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
some kind of chromatic ideas and I'll

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.220 
some kind of chromatic ideas and I'll
play<00:02:48.620> it<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> slow<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.000> I'll<00:02:50.989> kind<00:02:51.200> of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
play it for you slow and I'll kind of

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.860 
play it for you slow and I'll kind of
break<00:02:51.379> down<00:02:51.590> when<00:02:51.739> I'm<00:02:51.830> doing<00:02:52.599> so<00:02:53.599> here<00:02:53.780> I'm

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
break down when I'm doing so here I'm

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.940 
break down when I'm doing so here I'm
going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.019> start<00:02:54.110> off<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> one<00:02:54.680> chord

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
going to start off on the one chord

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.160 
going to start off on the one chord
first<00:02:58.269> four<00:02:59.269> chord<00:03:01.599> now<00:03:02.599> instead<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.019> just

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
first four chord now instead of just

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.990 
first four chord now instead of just
staying<00:03:03.440> on<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.799> four<00:03:04.129> chord<00:03:04.459> and<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:04.730> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
staying on this four chord and then I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 
staying on this four chord and then I
mean<00:03:05.180> sorry<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.019> one<00:03:06.230> chord<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.680> going<00:03:06.860> back

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
mean sorry this one chord and going back

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
mean sorry this one chord and going back
to<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.220> four<00:03:07.400> chord<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:08.239> gonna<00:03:08.450> do<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.720> very

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
to the four chord I'm gonna do a very

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.050 
to the four chord I'm gonna do a very
traditional<00:03:09.440> thing<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:10.040> jazz<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.519> using<00:03:10.940> a

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
traditional thing in jazz and using a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.119 
traditional thing in jazz and using a
two<00:03:11.269> five<00:03:11.569> one<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.200> lead<00:03:12.349> back<00:03:12.500> into<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.890> four

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
two five one to lead back into the four

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:19.630 
two five one to lead back into the four
instead<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.030> doing<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:18.190> just<00:03:19.190> leaning<00:03:19.489> back

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
instead of doing this just leaning back

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.300 
instead of doing this just leaning back
from<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:19.940> b-flat<00:03:20.269> I'm<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.629> do<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:22.930> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
from the b-flat I'm gonna do this and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.880 
from the b-flat I'm gonna do this and
that's<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.459> very<00:03:25.670> cool<00:03:26.060> way<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.299> to<00:03:27.200> lead<00:03:27.379> into

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
that's a very cool way to to lead into

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.890 
that's a very cool way to to lead into
the<00:03:27.980> four<00:03:28.220> chord<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.700> instead<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.690> going

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the four chord just instead of going

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.869 
the four chord just instead of going
from<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.170> b-flat<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.220> together<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.670> sounds

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
from the b-flat so together that sounds

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:45.490 
from the b-flat so together that sounds
like<00:03:31.940> this<00:03:43.359> notice<00:03:44.359> I'm<00:03:44.599> just<00:03:44.810> kind<00:03:45.139> of<00:03:45.169> moving

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
like this notice I'm just kind of moving

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.150 
like this notice I'm just kind of moving
the<00:03:45.590> nine<00:03:45.799> raising<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.579> little<00:03:46.760> bit

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.710 

okay<00:03:52.760> now<00:03:52.910> we're<00:03:53.060> going<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.210> go<00:03:53.300> back<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.630> the

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
okay now we're going to go back to the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.200 
okay now we're going to go back to the
b-flat<00:03:54.110> but<00:03:54.740> insane<00:03:55.070> instead<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.880> staying<00:03:56.060> on

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
b-flat but insane instead of staying on

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.850 
b-flat but insane instead of staying on
the<00:03:56.300> b-flat<00:03:56.630> for<00:03:56.930> another<00:03:57.140> two<00:03:57.410> measures

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
the b-flat for another two measures

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.620 
the b-flat for another two measures
we're<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.580> do<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.700> really<00:03:59.030> cool<00:03:59.240> kind<00:03:59.570> of

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
we're going to do a really cool kind of

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.210 
we're going to do a really cool kind of
chromatic<00:04:00.230> approach<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:02.300> G<00:04:02.600> over<00:04:02.840> here

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
chromatic approach to this G over here

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.260 
chromatic approach to this G over here
that's<00:04:04.220> gonna<00:04:04.400> sound<00:04:04.670> kind<00:04:04.940> of<00:04:05.000> something

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
that's gonna sound kind of something

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.270 
that's gonna sound kind of something
like<00:04:05.360> this<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:11.240> that<00:04:11.860> so<00:04:12.860> now<00:04:13.010> we<00:04:13.070> have

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
like this just like that so now we have

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:30.540 
like this just like that so now we have
this<00:04:13.430> all<00:04:13.640> together

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.560 

just<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:33.100> then<00:04:33.580> set<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.210> then<00:04:34.300> and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
just like that and then set and then and

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.530 
just like that and then set and then and
then<00:04:34.780> instead<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.140> just<00:04:35.260> leading<00:04:35.770> back<00:04:36.540> from

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
then instead of just leading back from

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.200 
then instead of just leading back from
the<00:04:37.720> your<00:04:38.470> five<00:04:38.770> which<00:04:39.220> would<00:04:39.370> be<00:04:39.520> F<00:04:39.700> instead

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
the your five which would be F instead

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.580 
the your five which would be F instead
of<00:04:40.300> just<00:04:40.420> leading<00:04:40.600> back<00:04:40.870> we're<00:04:41.320> gonna<00:04:41.380> do

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
of just leading back we're gonna do

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.860 
of just leading back we're gonna do
another<00:04:41.800> two<00:04:42.130> five<00:04:42.430> approach<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.510> lead<00:04:43.660> back

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
another two five approach to lead back

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.460 
another two five approach to lead back
into<00:04:44.140> it<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.470> we're<00:04:45.280> going<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.430> be<00:04:45.520> here<00:04:45.700> at<00:04:45.790> G

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
into it so we're going to be here at G

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.710 
into it so we're going to be here at G
we're<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.650> use<00:04:47.830> your<00:04:48.370> C<00:04:49.240> minor<00:04:49.420> nine

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
we're going to use your C minor nine

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.879 
we're going to use your C minor nine
chord

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.690 

-<00:04:54.889> f

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
- f

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.460 
- f
and<00:04:56.790> then<00:04:57.330> I'm<00:04:57.450> gonna<00:04:57.540> turn<00:04:57.720> around<00:04:57.870> we're

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
and then I'm gonna turn around we're

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.830 
and then I'm gonna turn around we're
gonna<00:04:58.560> we're<00:04:58.950> gonna<00:04:59.010> go<00:04:59.280> from<00:04:59.820> this<00:04:59.940> F<00:05:00.180> to

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
gonna we're gonna go from this F to

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.240 
gonna we're gonna go from this F to
b-flat

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
b-flat

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.950 
b-flat
-<00:05:04.090> gee

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
- gee

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.020 
- gee
to<00:05:06.960> see<00:05:07.170> minor<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.960> F

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
to see minor to F

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.300 
to see minor to F
and<00:05:11.450> then<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.810> b-flat<00:05:12.110> start<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:12.860> progression

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
and then to b-flat start the progression

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.390 
and then to b-flat start the progression
all<00:05:13.580> over<00:05:13.910> again<00:05:14.200> so<00:05:15.200> I'll<00:05:15.710> play<00:05:15.980> it<00:05:16.130> for<00:05:16.340> you

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
all over again so I'll play it for you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.890 
all over again so I'll play it for you
the<00:05:16.730> whole<00:05:16.910> thing<00:05:17.120> through<00:05:17.330> and<00:05:17.570> I'll<00:05:17.660> break

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
the whole thing through and I'll break

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.930 
the whole thing through and I'll break
down<00:05:17.930> where<00:05:18.740> I'm<00:05:18.860> at<00:05:19.010> in<00:05:19.130> the<00:05:19.220> progression

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:46.300 

four<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:26.420> five<00:05:27.880> for<00:05:32.440> Madison

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.900 

just<00:05:47.000> like<00:05:47.210> that<00:05:47.420> that's<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.410> very<00:05:48.680> cool<00:05:49.130> and

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
just like that that's a very cool and
