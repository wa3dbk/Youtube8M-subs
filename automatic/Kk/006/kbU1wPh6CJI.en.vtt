this<00:01:20.920> has<00:01:21.070> just<00:01:21.160> been<00:01:21.369> released<00:01:21.520> is<00:01:22.030> there

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
this has just been released is there

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.999 
this has just been released is there
roughly<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:23.050> any<00:01:23.290> pricing<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.890> it

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
roughly like any pricing of it

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.480 
roughly like any pricing of it
availability<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:25.180> starts<00:01:25.479> from<00:01:25.660> US<00:01:25.990> dollars

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
availability it starts from US dollars

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
availability it starts from US dollars
999999<00:01:27.490> yes<00:01:27.970> ok<00:01:28.540> so<00:01:29.580> how<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.000> different<00:01:31.360> to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
999999 yes ok so how is is different to

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.840 
999999 yes ok so how is is different to
the<00:01:31.659> original<00:01:32.140> Spectre<00:01:32.710> which<00:01:33.040> was<00:01:33.310> launched

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
the original Spectre which was launched

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.570 
the original Spectre which was launched
at<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.479> beginning<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.990> year<00:01:35.049> so<00:01:36.040> the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
at the beginning of this year so the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.270 
at the beginning of this year so the
original<00:01:37.030> Spector<00:01:37.510> was<00:01:37.810> made<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.890> lot<00:01:39.159> of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
original Spector was made of a lot of

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.370 
original Spector was made of a lot of
focus<00:01:39.490> was<00:01:39.790> put<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.390> glass<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:40.990> design

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
focus was put on the glass the design

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.090 
focus was put on the glass the design
the<00:01:41.979> materials<00:01:43.140> whereas<00:01:44.140> Spectre<00:01:44.530> XT<00:01:44.560> is

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
the materials whereas Spectre XT is

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.580 
the materials whereas Spectre XT is
really<00:01:45.400> about<00:01:45.760> its<00:01:46.060> mobility<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.470> about

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
really about its mobility so it's about

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.039 
really about its mobility so it's about
that's<00:01:47.890> thinners<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:48.460> its<00:01:48.820> weight<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:49.869> that's

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
that's thinners and its weight so that's

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.390 
that's thinners and its weight so that's
the<00:01:50.170> difference<00:01:50.350> between<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.860> two<00:01:51.010> but<00:01:51.190> of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
the difference between the two but of

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.840 
the difference between the two but of
course<00:01:51.640> we<00:01:51.790> have<00:01:51.880> Spectre<00:01:52.390> having

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
course we have Spectre having

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.219 
course we have Spectre having
differentiating<00:01:54.850> features<00:01:55.299> from<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.990> spec

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
differentiating features from the spec

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.890 
differentiating features from the spec
txt<00:01:56.680> as<00:01:56.799> well<00:01:57.010> so<00:01:57.490> we<00:01:57.580> are<00:01:57.670> selling<00:01:57.939> both<00:01:58.119> today
