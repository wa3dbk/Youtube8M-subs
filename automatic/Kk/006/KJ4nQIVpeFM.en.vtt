00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:04.359 
see it's fairly bright so now I'm
sitting<00:02:00.770> here<00:02:01.099> reading<00:02:02.889> this<00:02:03.889> is<00:02:04.099> what<00:02:04.249> I'm

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
sitting here reading this is what I'm

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.899 
sitting here reading this is what I'm
seeing<00:02:04.700> with<00:02:04.789> the<00:02:04.909> lights<00:02:05.119> on<00:02:06.579> this<00:02:07.579> is<00:02:07.759> what

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
seeing with the lights on this is what

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.969 
seeing with the lights on this is what
I'm<00:02:07.999> seeing<00:02:08.149> with<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.420> lights<00:02:08.599> off<00:02:08.950> now<00:02:09.950> I

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
I'm seeing with the lights off now I

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.410 
I'm seeing with the lights off now I
know<00:02:10.099> the<00:02:10.280> camera<00:02:10.610> messes<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.120> lighting

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
know the camera messes with the lighting

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.460 
know the camera messes with the lighting
a<00:02:11.480> little<00:02:11.510> bit<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.230> does

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
a little bit but it really does

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.050 
a little bit but it really does
illuminate<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.010> nicely<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:13.520> can<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:13.849> right

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
illuminate it nicely and I can see right

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.120 
illuminate it nicely and I can see right
down<00:02:14.209> into<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> cases<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.920> see<00:02:16.040> the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
down into the cases and I can see the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.640 
down into the cases and I can see the
powder<00:02:16.310> that's<00:02:16.580> in<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:17.260> now<00:02:18.260> this<00:02:18.440> normally

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
powder that's in there now this normally

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
powder that's in there now this normally
comes<00:02:19.099> like<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.400> mentioned<00:02:19.730> at<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.849> start<00:02:19.940> with

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
comes like I mentioned at the start with

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.960 
comes like I mentioned at the start with
a<00:02:20.420> short<00:02:20.870> LED<00:02:21.290> strip<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.890> three<00:02:22.160> LED<00:02:22.490> strip<00:02:22.790> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
a short LED strip a three LED strip and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.690 
a short LED strip a three LED strip and
a<00:02:23.030> longer<00:02:23.390> 5<00:02:23.810> LED<00:02:24.260> strip<00:02:24.560> now<00:02:25.129> when<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.310> got<00:02:25.430> mine

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
a longer 5 LED strip now when I got mine

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.210 
a longer 5 LED strip now when I got mine
the<00:02:26.480> five<00:02:26.780> LED<00:02:27.319> strip

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the five LED strip

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820 
the five LED strip
which<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.760> right<00:02:28.940> here<00:02:29.290> actually<00:02:30.290> has<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.590> loose

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
which is right here actually has a loose

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.080 
which is right here actually has a loose
connection<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.370> there<00:02:31.520> or<00:02:31.640> something<00:02:31.820> and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
connection in there or something and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.940 
connection in there or something and
that<00:02:32.150> wasn't<00:02:32.360> working<00:02:32.600> right<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> contacted

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
that wasn't working right so I contacted

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
that wasn't working right so I contacted
Dan<00:02:34.430> at<00:02:34.640> inline<00:02:34.880> fabrication<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.840> he<00:02:36.140> was

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
Dan at inline fabrication and he was

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.600 
Dan at inline fabrication and he was
really<00:02:36.380> good<00:02:36.500> sent<00:02:36.890> me<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.010> replacement<00:02:37.250> right

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
really good sent me a replacement right

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
really good sent me a replacement right
out<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.480> did<00:02:38.690> ask<00:02:38.870> him<00:02:39.050> to<00:02:39.140> send<00:02:39.350> me<00:02:39.440> a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
out but I did ask him to send me a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.260 
out but I did ask him to send me a
shorter<00:02:39.890> one<00:02:40.070> instead<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.610> longer<00:02:40.910> one<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
shorter one instead of the longer one so

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
shorter one instead of the longer one so
I<00:02:41.330> now<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> have<00:02:41.630> two<00:02:41.810> short<00:02:42.110> ones<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
I now I have two short ones and the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.120 
I now I have two short ones and the
reason<00:02:43.640> for<00:02:43.670> that<00:02:43.790> is<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.300> long<00:02:44.510> one<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.980> know

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
reason for that is the long one you know

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.640 
reason for that is the long one you know
that<00:02:46.370> he<00:02:46.610> shows<00:02:46.910> it<00:02:47.090> here<00:02:47.360> on<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.570> website<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
that he shows it here on the website and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
that he shows it here on the website and
I've<00:02:49.040> got<00:02:49.220> this<00:02:49.340> really<00:02:49.580> nifty<00:02:49.910> zip-tie

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
I've got this really nifty zip-tie

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.270 
I've got this really nifty zip-tie
installation<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.470> bullet<00:02:51.830> right<00:02:52.040> here

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
installation of this bullet right here

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.320 
installation of this bullet right here
so<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.460> didn't<00:02:52.640> really<00:02:52.850> want<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.030> mess<00:02:53.180> with

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
so I didn't really want to mess with

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330 
so I didn't really want to mess with
that<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.750> actually<00:02:54.740> I<00:02:54.950> thought<00:02:55.130> it<00:02:55.220> was

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
that and actually I thought it was

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.400 
that and actually I thought it was
better<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.060> LED<00:02:56.330> strip<00:02:56.840> up<00:02:56.990> top<00:02:57.200> like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
better to have the LED strip up top like

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.810 
better to have the LED strip up top like
this<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.860> really<00:02:57.950> shining<00:02:58.280> straight<00:02:58.640> down

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
this and really shining straight down

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.760 
this and really shining straight down
into<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> cases<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.050> I<00:03:00.080> went<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.560> two

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
into the cases so I went with the two

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.590 
into the cases so I went with the two
shorter<00:03:01.340> LEDs<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.910> it's<00:03:02.060> working<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.420> well

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
shorter LEDs and it's working out well

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.920 
shorter LEDs and it's working out well
for<00:03:02.750> me

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
for me

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.400 
for me
so<00:03:03.860> all<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.340> all<00:03:04.430> I'm<00:03:04.610> happy<00:03:04.640> with<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.780> I<00:03:05.840> did

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
so all in all I'm happy with it I did

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.830 
so all in all I'm happy with it I did
have<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.560> little<00:03:07.060> problem<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.630> one

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
have a little problem with this one

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.890 
have a little problem with this one
coming<00:03:09.170> down<00:03:09.850> over<00:03:10.850> time<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.390> think<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.660> had<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
coming down over time I think I had the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.200 
coming down over time I think I had the
wires<00:03:12.140> pulling<00:03:12.620> on<00:03:12.740> it<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.190> they<00:03:13.880> had<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.060> keep

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
wires pulling on it and they had to keep

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.240 
wires pulling on it and they had to keep
sticking<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.690> back<00:03:14.720> up<00:03:15.020> there<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.800> finally

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
sticking it back up there so I finally

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.310 
sticking it back up there so I finally
just<00:03:16.370> took<00:03:16.820> some<00:03:17.000> superglue<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.750> give<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.260> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
just took some superglue and give it a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.300 
just took some superglue and give it a
little<00:03:18.410> help<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.890> think<00:03:18.920> that's<00:03:19.190> gonna

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
little help and I think that's gonna

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.910 
little help and I think that's gonna
hold<00:03:19.460> just<00:03:19.700> fine
