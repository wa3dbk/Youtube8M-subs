for<00:01:39.150> PCs<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.070> think<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.220> app<00:01:41.460> thing<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.820> an

for PCs I think this app thing is an

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
for PCs I think this app thing is an
entirely<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:42.869> phenomenon<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:44.040> my

entirely new phenomenon in in my
lifetime<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:45.119> your<00:01:45.149> lifetime<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> think

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
lifetime in your lifetime so I think

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.219 
lifetime in your lifetime so I think

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
people are using apps what we know they

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.260 
people are using apps what we know they
are<00:01:49.350> using<00:01:49.500> apps<00:01:49.770> way<00:01:50.189> more<00:01:50.549> than<00:01:51.119> they're

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
are using apps way more than they're

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.980 
are using apps way more than they're
using<00:01:51.630> search<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.360> want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> make

got to figure out a way back to your app
and<00:02:19.680> even<00:02:20.400> if<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.300> you've<00:02:21.900> got

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
and even if you can do that you've got

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.510 
and even if you can do that you've got
to<00:02:22.140> figure<00:02:22.350> out<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.710> some<00:02:22.890> cases<00:02:23.070> how<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.400> get

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
to figure out in some cases how to get

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.370 
to figure out in some cases how to get
back<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:23.910> exact<00:02:24.180> place<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:24.990> app<00:02:25.170> if

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
back to the exact place in your app if

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.360 
back to the exact place in your app if
you're<00:02:25.470> playing<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> game<00:02:25.890> you're<00:02:26.280> probably

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you're playing the game you're probably

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.560 
you're playing the game you're probably
not<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.790> make<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.030> back<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> same

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
not going to make it back to the same

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.850 
not going to make it back to the same
place<00:02:28.160> so<00:02:29.160> wouldn't<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:29.970> be<00:02:30.060> great<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.960> mobile

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
place so wouldn't it be great if mobile

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.100 
place so wouldn't it be great if mobile
ads<00:02:32.070> didn't<00:02:32.970> take<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.270> out<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.600> app<00:02:33.780> but

rather took over the screen gave you

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.440 
rather took over the screen gave you
this<00:02:36.720> great<00:02:37.200> experience<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:38.190> an<00:02:39.030> interactive

off right where you left off in your app

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.250 
off right where you left off in your app
people<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:51.030> explore<00:02:51.630> them<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.960> don't<00:02:52.140> have

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
people would explore them you don't have

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.730 
people would explore them you don't have
faith<00:02:52.530> than<00:02:52.740> anyone<00:02:53.070> else<00:02:53.220> can<00:02:53.430> do<00:02:53.580> it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
faith than anyone else can do it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.030 
faith than anyone else can do it
sure<00:02:55.740> but<00:02:56.160> nobody<00:02:56.550> else<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.030> doing<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.040> so

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
sure but nobody else is doing it and so

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.240 
sure but nobody else is doing it and so
we<00:02:59.460> could<00:02:59.730> build<00:02:59.910> it<00:03:00.150> into<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> OS<00:03:01.070> so<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
we could build it into the OS so the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.210 
we could build it into the OS so the
apps<00:03:02.460> don't<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.650> can<00:03:04.860> make<00:03:05.070> it

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
apps don't have to do it we can make it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.220 
apps don't have to do it we can make it
so<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.670> app<00:03:05.880> developer<00:03:06.540> can<00:03:06.690> add<00:03:06.990> these

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
so that an app developer can add these

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.070 
so that an app developer can add these
interactive<00:03:07.980> ads<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.550> their<00:03:08.670> apps<00:03:08.880> with<00:03:09.690> 30

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
interactive ads and their apps with 30

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.820 
interactive ads and their apps with 30
minutes<00:03:10.500> worth<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.860> work<00:03:12.140> versus<00:03:13.140> working

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
minutes worth of work versus working

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.460 
minutes worth of work versus working
with<00:03:14.160> every<00:03:14.460> advertiser<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:15.990> custom

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
with every advertiser to do some custom

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.530 
with every advertiser to do some custom
thing<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.800> their<00:03:16.950> app<00:03:17.100> which<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.490> crazy<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
thing in their app which is crazy and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.530 
thing in their app which is crazy and
because<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.500> owned<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.860> OS<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.209> put<00:03:21.450> it

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
because we owned the OS so we can put it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.720 
because we owned the OS so we can put it
right<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.990> in<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> bowels<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.220> system

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
right in the in the bowels of the system

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.760 
right in the in the bowels of the system
could<00:03:24.540> somebody<00:03:24.930> else<00:03:25.110> figure<00:03:25.440> out<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.590> way<00:03:25.740> to

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
could somebody else figure out a way to

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.580 
could somebody else figure out a way to
do<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.270> maybe<00:03:27.270> they<00:03:27.540> could<00:03:27.810> but<00:03:28.440> they

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
do that maybe they could but they

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.760 
do that maybe they could but they
weren't<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.610> did<00:03:29.820> okay<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.510> think<00:03:31.050> we<00:03:31.620> need

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
weren't so we did okay I think we need

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.090 
weren't so we did okay I think we need
to<00:03:31.860> wrap<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.070> up<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:32.400> what
