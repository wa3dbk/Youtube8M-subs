brought<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.820> last<00:01:09.000> year<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.720> our

last week I should say and got it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.399 
last week I should say and got it
sighted<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> most<00:01:12.840> part<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.290> we're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
all right so last week and I was

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.150 
all right so last week and I was
actually<00:01:30.390> using<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.960> kale<00:01:31.500> slug<00:01:31.830> which<00:01:32.010> is

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
actually using a kale slug which is

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually using a kale slug which is
sending<00:01:32.460> am<00:01:32.520> using<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.880> year<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.420> noticed

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
sending am using this year but I noticed

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.540 
sending am using this year but I noticed
this<00:01:34.350> year<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> boxes<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.310> actually

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
this year the boxes have actually

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.860 
this year the boxes have actually
changed<00:01:35.910> they<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.030> their<00:01:36.240> new<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.479> improved

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
changed they have their new and improved

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.050 
changed they have their new and improved
kale<00:01:37.530> slug<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> looks<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.910> got<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
kale slug and looks like it's got a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
kale slug and looks like it's got a
different<00:01:39.300> widen<00:01:39.660> it<00:01:39.720> shoots<00:01:39.930> faster<00:01:40.440> so<00:01:40.680> at

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
different widen it shoots faster so at

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270 
different widen it shoots faster so at
75<00:01:41.940> yards<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.450> wasn't<00:01:43.050> on<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> target<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.250> we

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
75 yards I wasn't on a target so we

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
75 yards I wasn't on a target so we
stepped<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.760> here<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.270> don't<00:01:45.690> I'd<00:01:45.780> say

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
stepped up here to I don't I'd say

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.090 
stepped up here to I don't I'd say
probably<00:01:45.960> 25<00:01:46.440> yards<00:01:46.740> we're<00:01:46.830> gonna<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
probably 25 yards we're gonna take a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.969 
probably 25 yards we're gonna take a
shot<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.369> from<00:01:47.729> an<00:01:47.820> annealing<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.170> see

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
shot just from an annealing and see see

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.260 
shot just from an annealing and see see
exactly<00:01:50.220> which<00:01:50.460> direction<00:01:50.760> we're<00:01:50.970> off<00:01:51.030> make

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
exactly which direction we're off make

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:00.520 
exactly which direction we're off make
