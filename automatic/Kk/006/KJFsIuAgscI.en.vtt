00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.829
 good morning good afternoon good night 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.610
 friends of youtube cristino again in 

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:12.200
 your screens for a new video 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.150
 after this long stop of almost a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910
 month in which it has been impossible to have 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.949
 contained in the channel and returned with a 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.560
 new game new delivery of our 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.150
 Abandon game room war saga that has 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.999
 spent quite some time since the last 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.699
 delivery but come back today with the game 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:30.570
 'Joan of Arc' based on heroin 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 historical 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.280
 for everything is well known in this case 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 embodying the protagonist of this 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
 historical rpg in which we will have to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 face the hordes of the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.160
 English I've been playing in a little 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.350
 Yesterday I downloaded it and it was 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.780
 playing trying it out a bit to see how 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.750
 it was going to luxury for the old 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.269
 which is from the year 2004 already has its 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 10 scant years the game that is not 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.280
 nothing bad is not bad and it's cool 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.350
 quite 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.649
 so I'll follow the game where 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.649
 leave 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 Let's go there 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.550
 If I still point at the point of completing 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.990
 the first mission does not advance much just 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.600
 I played this first mission which is a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.510
 little bit 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.510
 almost more tutorial roll 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.720
 as you can see it is a rpg game in third 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.720
 person 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.950
 the controls are totally 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 customizable in my case for example 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.010
 I do it with the directional arrows that 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.010
 is what I find most comfortable 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 the combat controls are very 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.060
 intuitive is to make combos 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.900
 with the mouse you can configure a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.900
 joystick I think that also 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.360
 you can configure combos 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.360
 Let's see 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.840
 like this for example 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.480
 along the map we find by 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.069
 example apples or breads that eating 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.760
 the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:31.560
 they allow us to recover lost health 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.540
 and sometimes in our campaign for 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.440
 we have companions like you finish 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.430
 to see 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.430
 that will help us 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 equally as we are fighting 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.970
 We are gaining experience 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.830
 increasing the level of both Joan of 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.050
 arch as of his companions 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.050
 and making them stronger and stronger 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.249
 then allow us as we go up 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.569
 level go assigning points to the 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.750
 skills that we want to increase 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.380
 life the defense 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.380
 and else 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.950
 I made boys those French pigs 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.410
 they are in front of us killing you leave 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:20.140
 prisoners or is entirely in 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.140
 Spanish entirely, it is very good 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.950
 very ground very well 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.829
 to be careful because peers 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.629
 they can die if they suffer too much damage and 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.290
 you have to be a little attentive to their 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.290
 life bars 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.660
 and cure them whenever necessary 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.520
 OK 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.360
 in this case maybe I should eat something 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.250
 we cover inventory with f1 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
 this allows us apples to recover 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.820
 the energy is to say this bar here 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.110
 that allows us to perform the skills 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.180
 special 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.890
 this is the experience bar and 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.100
 we are just a point to level up 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.500
 money that we have life the energy and 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.550
 The attributes of strength defense dexterity 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.580
 and leadership 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.080
 apart from our statistics well 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.960
 we eat it with the right button of the 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:19.320
 mouse and we will continue to like 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.320
 take plenty die 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.470
 we can finish off an enemy that is 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.790
 knocked down on the ground with the q 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.790
 and we just level up 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.660
 move on 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.050
 let's fight with the sword we can 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.449
 fight also with weapons of attack to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.330
 distance 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.279
 like the bow for example I do not know if then 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.960
 crossbows or other type will be unlocked 

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.960
 of weapons not the truth that I have no idea 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.780
 my mother 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:58.010
 and also our partner 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.010
 pretty tea 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.490
 so I can finish it off and that's the exact 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.490
 mechanical but 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.100
 our partner has just come up from 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.190
 level 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:19.000
 and we have gone up earlier so 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.950
 let's assign attributes 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.400
 to upload something 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.870
 the perfect skills a series of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.810
 points to spend is already our decision 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.350
 if we put it alive in energy in the 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.330
 attributes or whatever we want and 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.530
 by clicking on the portrait we can 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.530
 change character 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.270
 and see then that we are interested in 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.960
 interest increase we are going to give you more 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.210
 life for example in this case 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.180
 OK 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.990
 and save the game I keep quite a 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:57.360
 often because I do not know what's wrong with my 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.840
 computer many times with 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.000
 with certain games I get a blackout 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.740
 and a reboot systems do not know why 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.300
 I do not know why 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.599
 the attributes have all been spent 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.599
 true 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.479
 it will continue towards our 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.479
 objective 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.669
 so in this first gameplay we can 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.669
 complete the same first 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:34.589
 dubbing I love the voices 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.570
 attention French soldiers approach the 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.570
 castle on the bridge 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.850
 nothing then this if I see that you like it if 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:57.900
 I see that it generates attention that you like 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.670
 of this game because I will record more we will 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.110
 a small series even put me in the 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:04.860
 comments that you think if you fancy 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.020
 to do more or if we leave it here and nothing 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.410
 guys, past this cinematic, we'll go 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.760
 leaving and I hope you liked it 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.500
 You say you are not the Duke of Alençon 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.060
 I have orders to just open these 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.460
 doors to alençon itself or to its 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.780
 messenger we need the permission of 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.780
 our duke to let you in 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.650
 we must arrive with the carrier of the 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.650
 Duke's letter 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:33.060
 it is worth leaving us behind before 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.800
 It's worth nothing, guys, let's leave it 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.480
 here like favorite comment if it has 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.950
 liked and we'll see each other against the next 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.950
 video a greeting and see you later
