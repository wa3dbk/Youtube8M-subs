00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:20.570
 room so much for a bunch of books 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:24.330
 pile of something else, a lot of players 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:30.810

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.280
 Well, what have we got? 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:02.930
 we get a fool with strange skins 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.760
 that he can buy here and 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.180

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.930
 here is such a world here is such a server 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.610
 let's see if somewhere here is a way out 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.040
 here it begins directly 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.890
 the game world can see what it is 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.590

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.510
 Kohl a little bit see what we have here 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.020

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:35.170
