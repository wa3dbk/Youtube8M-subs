silver packages I showed these I did a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.500 
silver packages I showed these I did a
video<00:00:19.560> review<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.330> earlier<00:00:21.330> they're

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
video review on them earlier they're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.660 
video review on them earlier they're
made<00:00:21.660> by<00:00:21.690> a<00:00:21.870> company<00:00:21.900> called<00:00:22.230> lemon<00:00:22.890> just

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
made by a company called lemon just

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.320 
made by a company called lemon just
wanted<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.480> would<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:26.150> light<00:00:27.150> in

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
wanted to see if they would a light in

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.270 
wanted to see if they would a light in
fire<00:00:27.600> or<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> wet<00:00:28.860> fire<00:00:29.100> if<00:00:29.220> they

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:29.280 
fire or just like a wet fire if they

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.999 
fire or just like a wet fire if they
light<00:00:29.610> in<00:00:29.760> water<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:31.350> can<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.680> there<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
light in water and you can see there it

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.810 
light in water and you can see there it
is<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> your<00:00:32.850> wet<00:00:33.000> fire<00:00:33.270> tender<00:00:34.640> in<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
is just like your wet fire tender in a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.720 
is just like your wet fire tender in a
bowl<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> water<00:00:36.300> floating<00:00:36.960> around<00:00:37.280> burning<00:00:38.280> up

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.139 

so<00:00:41.730> even<00:00:42.300> wit<00:00:42.890> they'll<00:00:43.890> uh<00:00:43.999> they'll<00:00:44.999> burn

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
so even wit they'll uh they'll burn

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.399 
so even wit they'll uh they'll burn
don't<00:00:48.149> know<00:00:48.269> if<00:00:48.359> it<00:00:48.449> will<00:00:48.510> stay<00:00:48.780> burning<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.289> if

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
don't know if it will stay burning or if

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.560 
don't know if it will stay burning or if
it<00:00:49.499> will<00:00:49.559> relight

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.150 

see<00:00:56.570> it<00:00:56.660> goes<00:00:56.870> out<00:00:57.079> if<00:00:57.230> you<00:00:57.320> totally<00:00:57.710> dunk<00:00:57.980> it

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
see it goes out if you totally dunk it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.790 
see it goes out if you totally dunk it
but<00:00:58.820> I'm<00:00:58.910> pretty<00:00:59.059> sure<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.570> wet<00:01:00.350> fire<00:01:00.590> would

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
but I'm pretty sure the wet fire would

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:12.630 
but I'm pretty sure the wet fire would
do<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.070> same<00:01:01.100> thing<00:01:06.220> get<00:01:07.220> it<00:01:07.340> up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.830 

just<00:01:13.300> like<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.570> wet<00:01:13.750> fire<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.320> really<00:01:15.840> you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
just like the wet fire you really you

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:31.600 
just like the wet fire you really you
want<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.110> try<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.320> get<00:01:17.560> some<00:01:25.619> powder<00:01:26.619> on<00:01:26.800> it

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.300 

of<00:01:32.610> course<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.060> totally<00:01:33.890> drenched<00:01:34.890> its<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
of course I totally drenched its and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.680 
of course I totally drenched its and
that's<00:01:35.460> probably<00:01:35.820> gonna<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> liar<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
that's probably gonna make a liar out of

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's probably gonna make a liar out of
me<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.140> right<00:01:37.380> again

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:09.270 

see<00:01:50.410> if<00:01:50.500> we<00:01:50.650> can<00:01:50.800> get<00:01:50.920> it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.000 

alright<00:02:10.960> it<00:02:11.960> took<00:02:12.110> me<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> second<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.740> get<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
alright it took me a second to get it

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.630 
alright it took me a second to get it
lit<00:02:13.190> but<00:02:16.870> it's<00:02:17.870> lit<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.860> take<00:02:19.160> this<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.520> and

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
lit but it's lit and take this one and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:29.990 
lit but it's lit and take this one and
just<00:02:19.700> dunk<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.210> there<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.420> see<00:02:20.720> if<00:02:20.960> it'll

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.830 

so<00:02:30.660> not<00:02:31.470> quite<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.340> same<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.640> wet<00:02:33.060> fire<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.570> far

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
so not quite the same as wet fire as far

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.460 
so not quite the same as wet fire as far
as<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:35.150> burning<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.390> goes<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:37.080> see<00:02:37.320> these

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
as the burning of it goes you see these

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.070 
as the burning of it goes you see these
you<00:02:37.710> just<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.190> pack<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.080> if

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
you just like the pack on them and if

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.330 
you just like the pack on them and if
you've<00:02:40.290> got<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> lighter<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.100> like<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
you've got a lighter you can like the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.370 
you've got a lighter you can like the
pack<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> will<00:02:42.000> burn<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.210> get<00:02:43.200> everything

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
pack and it will burn and get everything

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.600 
pack and it will burn and get everything
going<00:02:43.800> for<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.100> as<00:02:44.220> well<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:50.160> does<00:02:50.370> do

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
going for you as well but it does do

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
going for you as well but it does do
very<00:02:50.880> very<00:02:50.970> similar<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.320> say

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
very very similar I'm not going to say

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.280 
very very similar I'm not going to say
it's<00:02:52.620> exactly<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.130> wet<00:02:53.459> fire<00:02:53.670> tender<00:02:54.060> I

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
it's exactly like wet fire tender I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's exactly like wet fire tender I
think<00:02:55.290> wet<00:02:55.440> fire<00:02:55.680> takes<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.160> spark<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.610> little

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
think wet fire takes a spark a little

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.780 
think wet fire takes a spark a little
bit<00:02:57.000> easier<00:02:57.180> than<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.690> does<00:02:58.130> but<00:02:59.130> if<00:02:59.580> you

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
bit easier than this does but if you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540 
bit easier than this does but if you
crumble<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.240> up<00:03:00.360> real<00:03:00.600> small<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:02.280> know<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.459> you

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
crumble it up real small you know if you

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.330 
crumble it up real small you know if you
break<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:03.090> stuff<00:03:03.510> into<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> powder<00:03:06.560> then<00:03:07.560> it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
break this stuff into a powder then it

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.310 
break this stuff into a powder then it
usually<00:03:08.610> takes<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.209> spark<00:03:09.450> fairly<00:03:09.900> fast

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.610 

provided<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.410> actually<00:03:13.800> hit<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:15.500> you<00:03:16.500> can

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
provided you actually hit it and you can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.680 
provided you actually hit it and you can
see<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.880> it'll<00:03:18.030> start<00:03:18.360> burning

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
see it you know it'll start burning

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.800 
see it you know it'll start burning
right<00:03:18.840> quick<00:03:19.110> on<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.820> not<00:03:21.420> too<00:03:21.660> much

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
right quick on you so not too much

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.350 
right quick on you so not too much
difference<00:03:22.320> in<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.860> wet<00:03:22.980> fire<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.150> see

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
difference in this and wet fire you see

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.400 
difference in this and wet fire you see
it<00:03:24.450> sitting<00:03:24.600> there<00:03:24.810> floating<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> water

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
it sitting there floating in the water
