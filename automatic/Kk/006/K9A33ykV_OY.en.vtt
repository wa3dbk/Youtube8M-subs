 lectures and is accompanying our 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.140
 work at the time of the click 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.730
 and today I want to talk about some of them 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.309
 camera issues so today we go 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 divide wants to talk about the diaphragm 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 very fast but that's for you guys are 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.070
 starting in the picture or to the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.650
 people who are already 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.900
 photography will be easy to understand that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.780
 we explain a graph then it goes 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.370
 be a quick and trouble-free thing 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.420
 none to understand this we do not want 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.790
 hinder 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.900
 Some people wrote us I want to 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.610
 thank everyone who goes 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.440
 writing sometimes takes people 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.510
 answer because there are many many, 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.640
 mails have been upset not 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.549
 I understood well the explanation always has 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.659
 Someone who wants to say something has messed up 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.260
 May but I want to say that people 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.740
 Spend some time here to go and send the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.060
 video for you guys to follow the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.439
 that you are paying for a course 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 professional you know it is a cost 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.409
 very high even though we want to give a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.229
 online course and just log on to our site 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.000
 school of pontocom photographer that you 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.009
 will find all the details there and will 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.710
 be live to be very cool a cost 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.499
 very cheap but let's go to the day what 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.600
 is the aperture diaphragm is nothing more to 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.490
 people on target beyond the lens 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.799
 it is behind the lens is a 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.049
 opening we call a little eye is 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.539
 he who controls the entrance of light 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.420
 understood it is he who will control the 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.460
 portion of the light input or if you go 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.909
 want lots of light you will want - 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.450
 light then the diaphragm controls the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.950
 act actor lightness then we 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.479
 let's follow this with the graphics 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.810
 Follow here with us. 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.560
 first bowl graphic are watching the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.560
 first chart 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.730
 If I see this drawing, it's a day. 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 make looks like those 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.580
 Alien film is the one there 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.690
 full of razors full of 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.700
 compartments 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.030
 so this is what you have to 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.440
 understand that the diaphragm configuration 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.380
 is made according to your lens you do not 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.780
 you can forget that because opening the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.530
 diaphragm is measured by the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.360
 if you see this graph below it f2 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.850
 kroeff who is represented by jaguar 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.760
 2.8 is because it is very clear 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.120
 I understand one thing the greater 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.300
 The smaller the number the lighter the lens looks 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.490
 there besides 2.8 is a clear lens you 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.220
 will absorb light to catch all 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.720
 color light details the 5 point is 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.560
 a dark lens 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.560
 You can see the 8.0 so dark the eleven 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.290
 It happens the most when I'm going to take 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.380
 photography put my lens at maximum and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.460
 weak in the sea, showing itself three 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.440
 half 4 sometimes give five because of course the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.040
 its dark lens that you have to 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.830
 to understand the diaphragm it works 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.050
 According to well that you have so 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.500
 It's a bit more expensive but it's worth it 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.320
 you invest by the next when you 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.570
 have a clear mind you want to look for 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.310
 do not use the flash much you do not want 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.750
 use a hard light you do not want to use a 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.460
 light if you want to get details 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.710
 especially at night 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.750
 so that you use a clear lens that 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.130
 It will give you a total opening and you 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.110
 Are you going to be able to shoot then? 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.690
 of course if you have a dark lens 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.100
 you do not want the diaphragm in the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:58.790
 maximum maximum it will reach the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.740
 bursting 4.5 when it gives 3.8 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.460
 depending but it is a dark lens 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.370
 you will not be able to 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.110
 compensates with very high iso at a 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.820
 very low speed and must have 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.800
 Watch out, and I'll talk about it later. 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.340
 in another program're 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.270
 Look at these numbers you see there. 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.450
 1.4 22.8 and so on when you 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:25.590
 hear the word stop 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:30.480
 tÃ¡ a stop a stop middle two tops 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:36.290
 stop middle is the opening is 1.4 1.4 or two 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:41.910
 are half is half spot stop from 1.4 to 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:44.010
 2.812 stop from point 4 to 14 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.360
 it's two spot and a half you go 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.490
 Finding and ways you're going 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.470
 find this language with the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.440
 photographers understand you will see the 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.480
 Photographer talking to raise it for me. 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.640
 there is 2.4 increase for me there two and a half 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.970
 stop increased 63 the stock decreases 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.430
 Topical means then you will already understand 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.680
 what has happened will already capture that each 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:18.150
 half and half rise is half story 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:20.190
 1.4 1.426 sport 1.4 to 2.811 sport 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.470
 So you get used to it 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.620
 So, people want to make a good 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.270
 photography is the diaphragm that makes the 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.100
 opening of your light 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.010
 so if you when you can 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.630
 invest the camera you can have a tit 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.520
 theme 3 is a 2 and the makin da quina or 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.600
 of the nikon you want there in what 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.690
 do not be professional 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.300
 it does not matter if you have a good lens 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.200
 This will help you, yes. More beautiful.
