three<00:01:31.680> inches<00:01:32.130> wide<00:01:32.189> weighs<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.119> 19<00:01:33.540> grams

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
three inches wide weighs just 19 grams

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.980 
three inches wide weighs just 19 grams
and<00:01:34.880> should<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> blast<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.390> fly<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.810> let's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and should be a blast to fly so let's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.380 
and should be a blast to fly so let's
get<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> up<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.740> flavor<00:01:37.979> deal

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
get it up and do a little flavor deal

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.340 
get it up and do a little flavor deal
all<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.630> we're<00:01:39.720> gonna<00:01:39.840> take<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> up<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
all right so we're gonna take it up and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.289 
all right so we're gonna take it up and
see<00:01:40.500> how<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.710> flies<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.939> supposed<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> be

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
see how it flies and it's supposed to be

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.020 
see how it flies and it's supposed to be
really<00:01:42.509> quiet<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.000> really

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
really quiet and actually it is really

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
really quiet and actually it is really
quiet<00:01:45.509> compared<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.259> other<00:01:46.409> little<00:01:46.829> quad

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
quiet compared to other little quad

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.359 
quiet compared to other little quad
Zeeland<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:49.130> half<00:01:50.130> as

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
Zeeland this thing is like a half as

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.889 
Zeeland this thing is like a half as
loud<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.970> any<00:01:51.149> other<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.450> I've<00:01:51.600> ever<00:01:51.750> had

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
loud as any other one I've ever had

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.529 
loud as any other one I've ever had
so<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.229> instability<00:01:54.649> mode<00:01:55.119> or<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.299> safe

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
so this is instability mode or the safe

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.450 
so this is instability mode or the safe
mode<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.439> gonna<00:01:57.649> fly<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.950> around<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.340> room

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
mode just gonna fly it around the room

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.020 
mode just gonna fly it around the room
here<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.020> I<00:02:00.020> pretty<00:02:00.890> much<00:02:00.979> fully<00:02:01.369> tipped<00:02:01.759> here

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
here and I pretty much fully tipped here

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.959 
here and I pretty much fully tipped here
that's<00:02:02.840> about<00:02:03.049> as<00:02:03.259> much<00:02:03.429> speed<00:02:04.429> as<00:02:04.460> it<00:02:04.759> gives

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
that's about as much speed as it gives

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.120 
that's about as much speed as it gives
you<00:02:05.179> when<00:02:05.959> you're<00:02:06.140> in<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:06.380> safe<00:02:06.649> mode<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.069> you

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
you when you're in the safe mode but you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.059 
you when you're in the safe mode but you
have<00:02:07.219> funniest<00:02:07.700> play<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.330> Steve<00:02:08.539> and<00:02:09.069> plenty

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
have funniest play of Steve and plenty

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.190 
have funniest play of Steve and plenty
of<00:02:10.099> ability<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.970> correct<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.989> you're<00:02:12.110> gonna

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
of ability to correct that you're gonna

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.460 
of ability to correct that you're gonna
hit<00:02:12.410> something<00:02:12.650> come<00:02:13.549> by<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> camera<00:02:14.150> here

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
hit something come by the camera here

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.020 
hit something come by the camera here
and<00:02:15.470> that's<00:02:15.739> our<00:02:15.890> pair<00:02:16.190> watch<00:02:16.400> that's<00:02:16.790> pretty

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
and that's our pair watch that's pretty

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.570 
and that's our pair watch that's pretty
quick

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.310 

and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.330> we'll<00:02:22.450> just<00:02:22.600> go<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.080> middle<00:02:23.200> of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
and then we'll just go in the middle of

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.890 
and then we'll just go in the middle of
the<00:02:23.380> room<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:24.210> though<00:02:25.210> their<00:02:25.450> hands<00:02:25.780> off

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
the room here though their hands off

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.010 
the room here though their hands off
hover<00:02:26.170> might<00:02:26.560> need<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> little<00:02:26.980> throttle<00:02:29.550> but

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
hover might need a little throttle but

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.240 
hover might need a little throttle but
with<00:02:32.020> nothing<00:02:32.350> other<00:02:32.440> than<00:02:32.620> throttle<00:02:33.070> that's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
with nothing other than throttle that's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.020 
with nothing other than throttle that's
pretty<00:02:33.550> good

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030

and it's a little room when I haven't

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.650 
and it's a little room when I haven't
flown<00:03:29.650> CP<00:03:30.250> holley's<00:03:30.670> for<00:03:30.910> a<00:03:30.940> little<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.600> know

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
flown CP holley's for a little you know

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.030 
flown CP holley's for a little you know
a<00:03:31.720> little<00:03:31.930> while<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.140> few<00:03:32.410> months<00:03:32.620> at<00:03:32.709> least<00:03:32.739> now

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
a little while a few months at least now

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.790 
a little while a few months at least now
so<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.030> might<00:03:34.270> be<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.480> little<00:03:34.720> tricky<00:03:35.050> here<00:03:35.080> but

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
so I might be a little tricky here but

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.100 
so I might be a little tricky here but
as<00:03:35.920> you<00:03:36.040> can<00:03:36.130> see<00:03:36.190> it's<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.239> gonna<00:03:37.510> auda<00:03:37.690> level

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
as you can see it's not gonna auda level

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.350 
as you can see it's not gonna auda level
anymore<00:03:38.470> if<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:38.920> push<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.489> stick<00:03:40.000> somewhere

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
anymore if I push the stick somewhere

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.690 
anymore if I push the stick somewhere
it's<00:03:40.660> gonna<00:03:40.810> keep<00:03:41.110> wanting<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.680> go<00:03:41.860> I'm<00:03:42.640> just

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
it's gonna keep wanting to go I'm just

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.100 
it's gonna keep wanting to go I'm just
kind<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.000> going<00:03:43.150> back<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.480> forth<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.959> guys

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
kind of going back and forth so you guys

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.680 
kind of going back and forth so you guys
can<00:03:44.260> see<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.670> gonna<00:03:45.790> keep<00:03:46.030> wanting<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.450> go

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
can see it's gonna keep wanting to go

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.960 
can see it's gonna keep wanting to go
where<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.680> stick<00:03:47.920> was<00:03:48.070> laughed<00:03:48.310> at<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.820> this

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
where the stick was laughed at so this

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.740 
where the stick was laughed at so this
is<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.360> full<00:03:49.660> control<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.510> basically

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
is like full control and you basically

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.979 
is like full control and you basically
have<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.400> be<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.430> pretty<00:03:54.730> good<00:03:54.970> pilot<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.810> you

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
have to be a pretty good pilot as you

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.160 
have to be a pretty good pilot as you
can<00:03:56.110> see<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.500> can<00:03:56.680> really<00:03:57.250> hook<00:03:58.050> over<00:03:59.050> the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
can see it can really hook over the

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.729 
can see it can really hook over the
ground<00:04:00.209> knowing<00:04:01.209> too<00:04:01.540> much<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:02.320> got<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> lot<00:04:02.709> of

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
ground knowing too much you got a lot of

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.520 
ground knowing too much you got a lot of
tip<00:04:03.130> in<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.400> mode<00:04:03.670> so<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:05.110> isn't<00:04:05.350> really

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
tip in this mode so this isn't really

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.140 
tip in this mode so this isn't really
the<00:04:05.800> mode<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.310> want<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.550> find<00:04:06.760> until<00:04:07.030> you

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
the mode that you want to find until you

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.970 
the mode that you want to find until you
know<00:04:07.300> all<00:04:07.570> your<00:04:07.870> orientations<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:08.800> it's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
know all your orientations and it's

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.430 
know all your orientations and it's
thick<00:04:09.160> control<00:04:09.570> but<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.600> can<00:04:10.810> tell<00:04:11.050> just<00:04:11.080> when

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
thick control but I can tell just when

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.020 
thick control but I can tell just when
flying<00:04:11.680> in<00:04:11.860> here<00:04:12.040> how<00:04:12.250> much<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.550> was<00:04:12.640> tipping

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
flying in here how much it was tipping

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.390 
flying in here how much it was tipping
it<00:04:13.180> has<00:04:13.390> a<00:04:13.420> lot<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.870> control<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.190> for<00:04:15.340> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
it has a lot of control so for the

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.949 
it has a lot of control so for the
experts<00:04:15.790> out<00:04:15.970> there<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.330> want<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.630> have<00:04:16.750> fun

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
experts out there that want to have fun

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.050 
experts out there that want to have fun
with<00:04:17.169> this<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.640> really<00:04:18.640> flip<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:18.970> around

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
with this and really flip it around

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.960 
with this and really flip it around
outside<00:04:19.450> or<00:04:19.930> even<00:04:20.109> inside<00:04:20.609> this<00:04:21.609> could<00:04:21.850> be

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
outside or even inside this could be

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.090 
outside or even inside this could be
pretty<00:04:22.180> darn<00:04:22.480> cool<00:04:22.720> for<00:04:23.050> those<00:04:23.620> types<00:04:23.950> of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
pretty darn cool for those types of

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.130 
pretty darn cool for those types of
fires<00:04:24.340> as<00:04:24.610> well

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.390 

not<00:04:29.140> gonna<00:04:29.260> obviously<00:04:29.380> do<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.830> flip<00:04:30.100> in<00:04:30.220> here

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
not gonna obviously do a flip in here

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400 
not gonna obviously do a flip in here
but<00:04:30.550> this<00:04:30.670> is<00:04:30.850> pretty<00:04:31.300> dine<00:04:31.540> connected<00:04:32.020> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
but this is pretty dine connected and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.720 
but this is pretty dine connected and
like<00:04:32.620> I<00:04:32.740> said<00:04:32.920> I'm<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.070> little<00:04:33.190> squirrely

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
like I said I'm a little squirrely

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.840 
like I said I'm a little squirrely
haven't<00:04:34.120> flown<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.590> CP<00:04:36.190> for<00:04:36.400> awhile<00:04:36.460> I'm<00:04:36.670> so

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
haven't flown and CP for awhile I'm so

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.340 
haven't flown and CP for awhile I'm so
used<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.090> these<00:04:37.210> little<00:04:37.480> quads<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.900> just<00:04:38.170> fly

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
used to these little quads that just fly

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.570 
used to these little quads that just fly
themself<00:04:38.800> basically<00:04:41.070> now<00:04:42.070> this<00:04:42.220> thing<00:04:42.430> has

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
themself basically now this thing has

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.420 
themself basically now this thing has
those<00:04:42.820> Easy<00:04:43.060> Ups<00:04:43.090> as<00:04:43.480> well<00:04:43.690> well<00:04:44.530> hit<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
those Easy Ups as well well hit the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.330 
those Easy Ups as well well hit the
couch<00:04:45.610> has<00:04:46.450> these<00:04:46.690> ETS<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.530> long<00:04:47.680> as<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.130> saw

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
couch has these ETS as long as you saw

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.850 
couch has these ETS as long as you saw
me<00:04:48.670> we're<00:04:48.910> looking<00:04:49.180> at<00:04:49.330> them<00:04:49.450> are<00:04:50.380> really<00:04:50.590> nice

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.250 
me we're looking at them are really nice
and<00:04:51.160> protected<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:51.850> it<00:04:52.570> is<00:04:52.690> supposed<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.110> be

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
and protected so it is supposed to be

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.170 
and protected so it is supposed to be
pretty<00:04:53.590> darn<00:04:53.770> good<00:04:54.100> at<00:04:54.310> not<00:04:54.490> getting<00:04:54.520> damaged

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
pretty darn good at not getting damaged

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.150 
pretty darn good at not getting damaged
and<00:04:55.480> I<00:04:56.230> bounced<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:56.650> off<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.890> wall<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.070> couple

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
and I bounced it off the wall a couple

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.460 
and I bounced it off the wall a couple
times<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:57.910> nothing's<00:04:58.419> happened<00:04:58.810> it's

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
times and nothing's happened it's

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.840 
times and nothing's happened it's
supposed<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.770> be<00:04:59.919> pretty<00:05:00.190> much<00:05:00.490> one<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.730> the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
supposed to be pretty much one of the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.300 
supposed to be pretty much one of the
most<00:05:01.180> durable<00:05:01.419> clods<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:02.050> blades<00:05:02.740> made<00:05:03.010> here

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
most durable clods that blades made here

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.120 
most durable clods that blades made here
so<00:05:03.340> far<00:05:05.160> castle<00:05:06.160> very<00:05:06.370> care<00:05:07.620> it's<00:05:08.620> all<00:05:08.770> fly

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
so far castle very care it's all fly

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.770 
so far castle very care it's all fly
around<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.669> little<00:05:09.850> more<00:05:10.150> as<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.419> kind<00:05:10.690> of

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
around here a little more as I kind of

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.500 
around here a little more as I kind of
finish<00:05:11.020> up<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.320> review<00:05:11.910> I'd<00:05:12.910> say<00:05:13.210> for<00:05:13.419> how

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
finish up the review I'd say for how

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.050 
finish up the review I'd say for how
this<00:05:13.690> flies<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.260> how<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:14.530> connected<00:05:15.060> I'd
