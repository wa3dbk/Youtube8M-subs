00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.900
 Good ! Today we are going to prepare Pan Baozi and for that we are going to China to 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.510
 these steamed buns stuffed with meat 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.749
 although you can fill them with whatever you want 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:16.109
 from vegetables, to fish, to something sweet. 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.269
 As you can see the ingredients of the dough do not involve any mystery you can get them 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:26.720
 in any place, if you do not find fresh yeast you can use the dry one. 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.919
 As we did Monday with the vegetable coca we are going to put in a bowl all the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.879
 ingredients less the yeast and a little water that will serve to dissolve it. 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.460
 Once we have all the ingredients we are going to put our clean hand 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.340
 and let's mix them. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.630
 Now let's knead for about five to ten minutes until we have one 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.130
 smooth mass and very manageable. 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.960
 The dough you will see that is not very elastic and does not stick in the hands. 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 Now we let them ferment about 45 minutes. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.759
 While we are preparing the filling, you can make the one you want this has a bittersweet touch 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.450
 and he is very rich. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 We will start peeling and chopping both garlic and onion. 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.550
 In a pan with a little oil we put our garlic and when 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.090
 doren 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 we add the onion. 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.800
 When it is golden to our liking we add the meat. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.620
 Once I have done the meat, I usually soil it with the 'wooden spoon' 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.430
 avoid making such ugly churros to me personally not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.720
 I like them as they are. 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.870
 So the meat is more loose and juicy 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.210
 and now what it touches is to add the rest of the ingredients 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.430
 add the proportions that you like and try to taste 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.799
 Once our dough is fermented, we will divide it into portions of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.180
 35 to 40 g 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.979
 and we form balls with them. 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.190
 Then we stretch it so that it is as circular as possible 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.059
 we can also help with the fingers 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:26.029
 I have left it quite fine since I like that there is much more filling than bread. 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.439
 Now we put a spoonful of filling and close in a spiral 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.499
 It's a little bit complicated 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:36.209
 although it really is more skillful and practical than anything else. 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 I have to admit that I have not done very well 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.659
 I need a lot of practice but well, they were really good 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.139
 I am sure that if you put yourselves you give a thousand laps to mine 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:57.719
 We will let them rest on a little oven paper 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.339
 now we let them ferment for 30 to 45 minutes 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:07.889
 and it's time to cook them. You can use a traditional steamer 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.979
 or a current 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:15.939
 that if, try not to touch the walls or bump into each other because they stick 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.699
 in 10 minutes they will be ready, yes 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.439
 once finished do not open the steamer immediately but leave a couple of minutes 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:28.069
 let it rest and then open slowly 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.699
 And we can enjoy our Pan Baozi 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:35.449
 I usually accompany it with soy sauce or sweet chilli sauce. 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:38.709
 I love putting a bit of soy sauce through the hole 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.719
 Makes the meat super juicy 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.799
