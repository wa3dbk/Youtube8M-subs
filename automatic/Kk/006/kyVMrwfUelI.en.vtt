00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
slightly different to the one I'm used

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
slightly different to the one I'm used
to<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> corners<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> back

to it some of the corners on the back
end<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> circuit<00:01:07.890> slightly<00:01:08.369> different<00:01:08.790> so

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
end of the circuit slightly different so

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.420 
end of the circuit slightly different so
I<00:01:09.210> struggle<00:01:09.869> with<00:01:09.899> those<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:11.159> an

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
