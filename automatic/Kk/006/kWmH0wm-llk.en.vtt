get to it of course I'll be making and
recording<00:01:10.650> videos<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.880> we'll<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.540> how<00:01:12.570> much

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
recording videos but we'll see how much

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
recording videos but we'll see how much
that<00:01:13.110> will<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.549> probably<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:16.670> yeah

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that will be probably not so much yeah

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
that will be probably not so much yeah
but<00:01:17.850> that's<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.890> we'll<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.280> how

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
but that's that and we'll just see how

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.109 
but that's that and we'll just see how
things<00:01:20.670> turn<00:01:20.790> out<00:01:21.560> I'll<00:01:22.560> most<00:01:23.490> probably<00:01:23.850> make

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
things turn out I'll most probably make

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.670 
things turn out I'll most probably make
videos<00:01:24.979> about<00:01:26.570> just<00:01:27.570> what's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.439> on

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
let's get to this project that you're

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.090 
let's get to this project that you're
probably<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.860> interested<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:46.020> I've<00:01:46.530> been

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
probably more interested in so I've been

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
probably more interested in so I've been
growing<00:01:47.399> again<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.970> little<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.290> year

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
growing again a little bit and this year

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.429 
growing again a little bit and this year
inside<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> character<00:01:50.790> art<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.210> i<00:01:51.439> created

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
inside is a character art that i created

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.690 
inside is a character art that i created
a<00:01:52.799> while<00:01:53.040> ago

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
a while ago

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.810 
a while ago
and<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:55.079> thought<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.320> would<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> 3d<00:01:56.520> model<00:01:56.790> from

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and I thought I would do a 3d model from

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
and I thought I would do a 3d model from
that<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:59.450> I'm<00:02:00.450> still<00:02:00.689> unsure<00:02:00.930> if<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.380> will

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
that but I'm still unsure if I will

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.969 
that but I'm still unsure if I will
really<00:02:02.040> continue<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.740> one<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.829> these

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
really continue this it's one of these

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.730 
really continue this it's one of these
projects<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> I'm<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.659> very<00:02:06.869> sure<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
projects that I'm not very sure if it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.330 
projects that I'm not very sure if it
will<00:02:08.009> work<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.759> well<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.450> way<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.629> wanted<00:02:10.319> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
will work out well the way I wanted to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.070 
will work out well the way I wanted to
but<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:13.319> it<00:02:13.800> does<00:02:14.010> I'll<00:02:14.810> tell<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.900> more<00:02:16.019> about

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but if it does I'll tell you more about

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.680 
but if it does I'll tell you more about
that<00:02:16.410> now<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.370> only<00:02:17.489> interesting<00:02:18.239> thing<00:02:18.269> that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that now the only interesting thing that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.740 
that now the only interesting thing that
I<00:02:18.720> wanted<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.010> show<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.430> today<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.510> is

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I wanted to show you today what is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.110 
I wanted to show you today what is
though<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.010> approach<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> use

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
though the kind of approach that I use

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.920 
though the kind of approach that I use
for<00:02:24.420> creating<00:02:25.019> all<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:26.420> mechanics<00:02:27.420> around

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
for creating all this mechanics around

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.490 
for creating all this mechanics around
the<00:02:28.049> hips<00:02:28.910> which<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.870> a<00:02:30.959> hard<00:02:31.200> thing

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
the hips which is a kind of a hard thing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.020 
the hips which is a kind of a hard thing
to<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:35.220> don't<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.700> know

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
to do because you you don't really know

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.440 
to do because you you don't really know
every<00:02:36.420> single<00:02:36.660> part<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> system<00:02:37.709> here

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
every single part in the system here

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
every single part in the system here
beforehand<00:02:39.450> because<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.870> just<00:02:40.049> a<00:02:40.170> drawing

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
beforehand because it's just a drawing

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.559 
beforehand because it's just a drawing
it's<00:02:40.709> just<00:02:40.980> when<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.849> draw<00:02:42.030> something<00:02:42.330> you

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
it's just when you draw something you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.630 
it's just when you draw something you
can<00:02:42.780> just<00:02:43.140> draw<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.500> where<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.069> shapes<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
can just draw in where it's shapes and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.330 
can just draw in where it's shapes and
it<00:02:44.730> will<00:02:44.910> look<00:02:45.120> good<00:02:45.480> where<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.989> quickly<00:02:46.980> but

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it will look good where we quickly but

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.339 
it will look good where we quickly but
in<00:02:47.430> 3d<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.849> have<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.239> know<00:02:48.630> every<00:02:49.110> single

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
in 3d you have to you know every single

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.130 
in 3d you have to you know every single
screw<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.250> every<00:02:50.459> single<00:02:50.610> part<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.239> that's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
screw and every single part and that's

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.589 
screw and every single part and that's
why<00:02:52.410> I'm<00:02:52.739> using<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.700> very<00:02:54.060> low<00:02:54.329> poly

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
why I'm using here a very low poly

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.720 
why I'm using here a very low poly
version<00:02:54.989> of<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.230> which<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.829> quite<00:02:56.400> easy<00:02:56.430> to

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
version of it which is quite easy to

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.900 
version of it which is quite easy to
handle<00:02:57.030> with<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:58.019> similar<00:02:58.709> approach<00:02:58.920> Roth

shapes<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.540> all<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.989> this<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.989> haven't<00:03:03.989> done

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
shapes of all of this and I haven't done

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.430 
shapes of all of this and I haven't done
the<00:03:04.230> next<00:03:04.500> step<00:03:04.680> yet<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.640> would<00:03:05.940> be

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
the next step yet but that would be

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.589 
the next step yet but that would be
trying<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> make<00:03:08.250> those<00:03:08.489> more<00:03:08.730> detail<00:03:09.120> trying

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
trying to make those more detail trying

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.780 
trying to make those more detail trying
to<00:03:09.750> find<00:03:10.079> ways<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.769> connect<00:03:11.069> various<00:03:11.370> parts

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
to find ways to connect various parts

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.129 
to find ways to connect various parts
here<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:13.700> making<00:03:14.700> look<00:03:14.940> better<00:03:15.150> now<00:03:16.109> for

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
here and making look better now for

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.430 
here and making look better now for
other<00:03:16.530> parts<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.540> at<00:03:18.540> least<00:03:18.750> for<00:03:18.989> now<00:03:19.170> I<00:03:19.410> just

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
other parts I at least for now I just

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
other parts I at least for now I just
use<00:03:21.049> some<00:03:24.139> lines<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.760> preview<00:03:26.760> me<00:03:27.239> how<00:03:27.599> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
use some lines that preview me how it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.420 
use some lines that preview me how it
will<00:03:27.900> look<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.079> since<00:03:28.530> I'm<00:03:28.709> not<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.280> to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
will look like since I'm not going to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.089 
will look like since I'm not going to
focus<00:03:29.639> on<00:03:29.880> anything<00:03:30.090> else<00:03:30.329> so<00:03:30.660> far<00:03:30.930> by<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:31.920> way

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
focus on anything else so far by the way

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.759 
focus on anything else so far by the way
in<00:03:32.250> case<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.579> wondering<00:03:33.170> this<00:03:34.170> part<00:03:34.440> here

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
in case you're wondering this part here

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.210 
in case you're wondering this part here
is<00:03:35.010> one<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.180> sculpted<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> created<00:03:38.040> a

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
is one that I sculpted so I created a

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.250 
is one that I sculpted so I created a
very<00:03:38.400> simple<00:03:38.670> base<00:03:39.000> mesh<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.690> sculpted<00:03:40.169> the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
very simple base mesh and sculpted the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.460 
very simple base mesh and sculpted the
details<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.859> which<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.849> why<00:03:42.090> at<00:03:42.630> least<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.200> think

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
details in which is why at least I think

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.000 
details in which is why at least I think
it<00:03:43.590> looks<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:44.069> bit<00:03:44.099> more<00:03:44.489> natural<00:03:45.139> and<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.769> think

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it looks a bit more natural and I think

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.300 
it looks a bit more natural and I think
it's<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.250> better<00:03:47.519> method<00:03:47.760> for<00:03:48.150> if<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:48.569> work<00:03:48.810> on

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
it's a better method for if you work on

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.909 
it's a better method for if you work on
characters<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.810> going<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.169> sculptures

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
characters that I going to be sculptures

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.110 
characters that I going to be sculptures
but<00:03:53.669> I<00:03:55.010> liked<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.220> three<00:03:56.459> prints<00:03:56.849> and<00:03:57.000> things

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
but I liked like three prints and things

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.339 
but I liked like three prints and things
like<00:03:57.329> that<00:03:58.880> but<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.000> course<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.540> haven't<00:04:01.109> done

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
like that but of course I haven't done

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.930 
like that but of course I haven't done
many<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.650> these<00:04:01.919> yet<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.459> still<00:04:02.669> have<00:04:02.790> to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
many of these yet and I still have to

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.000 
many of these yet and I still have to
find<00:04:03.180> out<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:03.720> that's<00:04:04.169> really<00:04:04.440> good<00:04:04.620> technique

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
find out if that's really good technique

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.599 
find out if that's really good technique
and<00:04:05.160> things<00:04:05.519> like<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:06.769> now<00:04:07.769> one<00:04:08.250> other<00:04:08.459> thing

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
and things like that now one other thing

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.449 
and things like that now one other thing
that<00:04:09.120> I've<00:04:10.079> done<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:11.730> create<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.359> do<00:04:13.019> some

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
that I've done to create this is do some

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.870 
that I've done to create this is do some
sketches<00:04:14.459> on<00:04:14.639> how<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.000> parts<00:04:15.299> look<00:04:15.480> like<00:04:15.750> so

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
sketches on how the parts look like so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.190 
sketches on how the parts look like so
we're<00:04:17.880> really<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.419> big<00:04:18.780> deal<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:20.269> just

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
we're really not a big deal here just

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.910 
we're really not a big deal here just
I<00:04:23.060> think<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.330> this<00:04:24.780> pro<00:04:25.080> in<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.410> step<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.830> the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
I think in this pro in this step in the

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.910 
I think in this pro in this step in the
progress<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.660> designing<00:04:27.660> character<00:04:28.050> it's<00:04:28.680> not

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
progress of designing character it's not

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.430 
progress of designing character it's not
so<00:04:29.100> important<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.640> you<00:04:29.970> really<00:04:30.330> are<00:04:31.110> good<00:04:31.320> at

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
so important that you really are good at

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.070 
so important that you really are good at
drawing<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:31.920> or<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.510> shapes<00:04:33.780> right

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
drawing or or just get the shapes right

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.800 
drawing or or just get the shapes right
in<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.530> in<00:04:34.890> this<00:04:35.040> kind<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.700> work<00:04:35.910> it's<00:04:36.540> more

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
in this in this kind of work it's more

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.290 
in this in this kind of work it's more
about<00:04:36.990> spending<00:04:37.350> time<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.790> character

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
about spending time with the character

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.140 
about spending time with the character
and<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:40.050> design<00:04:40.410> so<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.640> get<00:04:41.790> more

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and the design so that you get more

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.200 
and the design so that you get more
familiar<00:04:42.360> with<00:04:42.840> all<00:04:43.500> the<00:04:43.680> things<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> that

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
familiar with all the things so that

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.820 
familiar with all the things so that
when<00:04:45.600> you<00:04:45.750> monitor<00:04:46.170> you'll<00:04:46.320> have<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.560> better

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
when you monitor you'll have a better

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.460 
when you monitor you'll have a better
understanding<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.610> even<00:04:47.940> though<00:04:48.470> this

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
understanding of it even though this

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.320 
understanding of it even though this
kind<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.980> sketches<00:04:50.490> don't<00:04:50.730> tell<00:04:50.910> me<00:04:51.030> anything

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
kind of sketches don't tell me anything

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.810 
kind of sketches don't tell me anything
in<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:52.380> end<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.890> don't<00:04:53.100> even<00:04:53.220> have<00:04:53.370> to<00:04:53.520> look<00:04:53.640> at

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
in the end I don't even have to look at

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.120 
in the end I don't even have to look at
those<00:04:54.000> anymore<00:04:54.450> it's<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.530> while<00:04:55.920> I<00:04:55.950> was

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
those anymore it's just I while I was

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.230 
those anymore it's just I while I was
sketching<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:57.530> progressed<00:04:58.530> my<00:04:58.830> idea<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.820> stay

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
sketching I progressed my idea to stay

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.930 
sketching I progressed my idea to stay
where<00:05:00.540> it<00:05:00.630> can<00:05:00.810> start<00:05:00.990> modeling<00:05:01.670> that's<00:05:02.670> kind

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
where it can start modeling that's kind

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.790 
where it can start modeling that's kind
of<00:05:02.970> how<00:05:03.150> how<00:05:03.480> this<00:05:03.630> one<00:05:03.840> goes<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.080> a<00:05:04.410> hobo<00:05:04.680> we'll

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
of how how this one goes in a hobo we'll

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.400 
of how how this one goes in a hobo we'll
be<00:05:04.920> continuing<00:05:05.430> this<00:05:05.970> we'll<00:05:06.870> see<00:05:07.080> how<00:05:07.200> we'll

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
be continuing this we'll see how we'll

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.980 
be continuing this we'll see how we'll
go<00:05:07.590> how<00:05:08.100> much<00:05:08.280> time<00:05:08.580> I'll<00:05:08.730> find<00:05:08.940> for<00:05:09.150> them<00:05:09.330> but

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990
