to look how you perform power steering
fluid<00:00:14.880> flush<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:17.039> will<00:00:17.279> start<00:00:17.609> with

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
fluid flush and I will start with

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.700 
fluid flush and I will start with
removing<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:19.320> much<00:00:19.400> as<00:00:20.400> possible<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:22.350> old

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
removing as much as possible of that old

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.710 
removing as much as possible of that old
dirty<00:00:24.350> contaminated<00:00:25.350> fluid<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> inside

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
dirty contaminated fluid which is inside

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.779 
dirty contaminated fluid which is inside
using<00:00:27.720> my<00:00:27.900> suction<00:00:28.349> gun<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> trying<00:00:29.490> to

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
using my suction gun and trying to

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.380 
using my suction gun and trying to
remove<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.420> much<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.279> possible<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.120> old

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
fluid from that container and now it's

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.950 
fluid from that container and now it's
empty<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.010> will<00:00:38.280> add<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.000> new<00:00:39.809> fluid<00:00:40.760> all

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
empty so I will add the new fluid all

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.299 
empty so I will add the new fluid all
the<00:00:42.960> way<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.710> max<00:00:44.399> mark<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.710> close

the way to the max mark I will close
this<00:00:47.610> container<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.600> put<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.989> cap<00:00:49.289> back

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
this container I will put that cap back

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.319 
this container I will put that cap back
after<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:52.110> inside<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.920> vehicle

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
after that I go inside of the vehicle

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.470 
after that I go inside of the vehicle
start<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> engine<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.879> turn<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
start up the engine and I will turn the

start up the engine and I will turn the
power<00:00:57.719> steering<00:00:58.260> all<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> one<00:01:00.030> side

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
power steering all the way to one side

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
power steering all the way to one side
in<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> case<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.500> hold<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.219> there

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
in this case to the right hold it there

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
in this case to the right hold it there
for<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:02.940> two<00:01:03.180> seconds<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.010> go<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> way

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
for like two seconds and go all the way

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.140 
for like two seconds and go all the way
to<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.909> other<00:01:06.060> side<00:01:07.130> hold<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.909> like

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to the other side hold it there in like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
to the other side hold it there in like
two<00:01:09.600> seconds<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.659> go<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> will

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
two seconds and go back and I will

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.770 
two seconds and go back and I will
repeat<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.689> probably<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.990> four<00:01:16.380> times<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
repeat this probably like four times and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
repeat this probably like four times and
then<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.170> shut<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.659> basically

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
then I will shut it off and basically

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
then I will shut it off and basically
what<00:01:21.900> happens<00:01:22.409> at<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.799> flush<00:01:23.189> I'm

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
what happens at this flush I'm

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.620 
what happens at this flush I'm
introducing<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.840> brand<00:01:25.380> new<00:01:26.180> fluid<00:01:27.180> into

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
introducing that brand new fluid into

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
introducing that brand new fluid into
the<00:01:27.659> system<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> reservoir<00:01:30.390> but

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the system not only in the reservoir but

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
the system not only in the reservoir but
while<00:01:31.650> turning<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> steering<00:01:32.700> wheel<00:01:33.119> it's

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
while turning the steering wheel it's

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.359 
while turning the steering wheel it's
going<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:33.990> through<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.680> hoses<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
going all the way through all hoses to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.649 
going all the way through all hoses to
the<00:01:35.400> power<00:01:36.299> steering<00:01:36.720> pump<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.659> I

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the power steering pump and back and I

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
the power steering pump and back and I
will<00:01:39.780> simply<00:01:40.710> keep<00:01:40.979> repeating<00:01:41.610> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
will simply keep repeating this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
will simply keep repeating this
procedure<00:01:42.409> until<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:45.060> will<00:01:45.689> have<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.740> power

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
procedure until I will have in the power

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.490 
procedure until I will have in the power
steering<00:01:48.470> system<00:01:49.470> only<00:01:50.340> nice<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.500> clean

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
steering system only nice and clean

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.700 
steering system only nice and clean
power<00:01:53.040> steering<00:01:53.610> fluid<00:01:54.020> here<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.439> give

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
power steering fluid here I will give

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.039 
power steering fluid here I will give
you<00:01:55.890> idea<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.939> power<00:01:57.180> steering<00:01:57.780> fluid

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you idea how that power steering fluid

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.459 
you idea how that power steering fluid
was<00:01:58.380> dirty<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:59.579> much<00:01:59.820> contamination<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:01.229> in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
was dirty how much contamination is in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.149 
was dirty how much contamination is in
it<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.700> see<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.380> that's<00:02:04.380> supposed<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
it you see that that's supposed to be

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.050 
it you see that that's supposed to be
absolutely<00:02:05.969> clear<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:08.310> power<00:02:08.550> steering

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
absolutely clear this power steering

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
absolutely clear this power steering
fluid<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.509> new<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.080> absolutely<00:02:10.770> clear

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
fluid a new one it's absolutely clear

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.770 
fluid a new one it's absolutely clear
and<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.510> what<00:02:12.720> was<00:02:12.900> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> system

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and this is what was in the system

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.490 
and this is what was in the system
so<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> really<00:02:15.100> needed<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:16.180> replaced<00:02:16.660> it

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
so it really needed to be replaced it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.550 
so it really needed to be replaced it
depends<00:02:18.430> how<00:02:18.970> much<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.050> fluid<00:02:20.440> was

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
depends how much the fluid was

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.240 
depends how much the fluid was
contaminated<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.330> general<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.740> will<00:02:23.890> use

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
contaminated but in general you will use

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.690 
contaminated but in general you will use
for<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.820> power<00:02:25.150> steering<00:02:25.630> fluid<00:02:25.870> flush<00:02:26.700> two

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
for this power steering fluid flush two

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.470 
for this power steering fluid flush two
quarts<00:02:28.570> these<00:02:28.840> two<00:02:29.080> cans<00:02:29.410> will<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.830> enough<00:02:30.480> so

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
quarts these two cans will be enough so

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.870 
quarts these two cans will be enough so
