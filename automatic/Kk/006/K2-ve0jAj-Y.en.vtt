you<00:02:19.260> could<00:02:19.409> say<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.519> here<00:02:20.670> we<00:02:20.760> go<00:02:20.790> quite<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.599> few

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
you could say so here we go quite a few

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.020 
you could say so here we go quite a few
things<00:02:22.019> going<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.680> even<00:02:23.040> right<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
things going on even right now for the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.050 
things going on even right now for the
sense<00:02:24.209> we've<00:02:24.450> got<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.959> autofocus<00:02:25.799> point<00:02:26.220> put

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
sense we've got the autofocus point put

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.449 
sense we've got the autofocus point put
it<00:02:27.120> over<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.079> exposure<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.189> put<00:02:29.370> it

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
it over here the exposure if we put it

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.099 
it over here the exposure if we put it
over<00:02:29.519> there<00:02:29.790> it'll<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.659> change<00:02:30.959> it

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
over there it'll kind of change it

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.619 
over there it'll kind of change it
because<00:02:31.319> of<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.560> light<00:02:31.790> also<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:33.000> really<00:02:33.480> like

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
because of the light also I really like

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.830 
because of the light also I really like
about<00:02:33.659> this<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.530> can<00:02:34.620> lock<00:02:35.519> both<00:02:36.480> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
about this is that you can lock both the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.179 
about this is that you can lock both the
exposure<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.959> focus<00:02:40.349> now<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.950> can

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
exposure and the the focus now you can

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.119 
exposure and the the focus now you can
do<00:02:41.370> this<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.700> iOS<00:02:42.030> 5<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:42.510> I'm<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.079> iOS<00:02:43.439> 4.3

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
do this in iOS 5 but I'm on iOS 4.3

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.059 
do this in iOS 5 but I'm on iOS 4.3
point<00:02:44.489> 3<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:44.940> great<00:02:45.629> feature<00:02:45.900> also<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:46.889> can

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
point 3 so great feature also you can

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.339 
point 3 so great feature also you can
set<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> white<00:02:47.489> balance<00:02:47.549> right<00:02:48.389> here<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:49.290> I

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
set the white balance right here or I

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.259 
set the white balance right here or I
think<00:02:49.889> like<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.250> think<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.549> lock<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.150> white

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
think like I think that's lock the white

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.990 
think like I think that's lock the white
balance<00:02:51.450> also<00:02:52.379> you<00:02:52.470> can<00:02:52.500> turn<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.819> LED

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
balance also you can turn on the LED

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.619 
balance also you can turn on the LED
light<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.370> just<00:02:56.370> keep<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.819> during

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
light and just keep it on during

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.559 
light and just keep it on during

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
screen because it is going in 480p so

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.850 
screen because it is going in 480p so
let's<00:04:29.080> go<00:04:29.199> ahead<00:04:29.229> and<00:04:29.409> stop<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.740> recording

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:31.509 
it's going to process it for a little

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.309 
it's going to process it for a little
bit<00:04:32.009> and<00:04:33.009> put<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:33.669> on<00:04:33.789> the<00:04:33.849> table<00:04:34.319> keep

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
bit and put this on the table keep

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:37.619 
bit and put this on the table keep
moving<00:04:35.620> out<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:35.860> frame<00:04:36.069> all<00:04:36.669> right<00:04:37.000> now<00:04:37.509> it's

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
link in description to see what this

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:24.570 
link in description to see what this
does<00:05:22.870> so<00:05:23.349> basically<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.919> can<00:05:24.069> just<00:05:24.250> like<00:05:24.370> put

does so basically you can just like put
it<00:05:24.669> on<00:05:24.729> your<00:05:24.849> iPhone<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.479> acts<00:05:25.750> like<00:05:25.870> as<00:05:26.110> i

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
it on your iPhone it acts like as i

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.309 
it on your iPhone it acts like as i
stand<00:05:26.469> in<00:05:26.710> a<00:05:26.800> tripod<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.719> tripod<00:05:28.719> mount<00:05:29.020> now<00:05:29.199> the

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
stand in a tripod a tripod mount now the

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.469 
stand in a tripod a tripod mount now the
fourth<00:05:29.590> way<00:05:29.830> isn't<00:05:30.250> either<00:05:30.669> software<00:05:31.300> or

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
fourth way isn't either software or

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.149 
fourth way isn't either software or
hardware<00:05:32.050> it's<00:05:32.830> basically<00:05:33.279> what<00:05:33.699> you<00:05:33.940> do

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
hardware it's basically what you do

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.200 
hardware it's basically what you do
practice<00:05:36.159> makes<00:05:36.310> perfect<00:05:36.669> in<00:05:36.940> that<00:05:36.969> is
