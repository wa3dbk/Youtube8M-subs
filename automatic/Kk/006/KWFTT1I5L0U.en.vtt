is a little ball size I hold that on
your<00:00:59.930> guide<00:01:00.140> two<00:01:00.290> sizes<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:00.950> check<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.309> bits

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
your guide two sizes and check it bits

your guide two sizes and check it bits
the<00:01:01.700> circle<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:02.480> then<00:01:03.440> we<00:01:03.559> make<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.770> little

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
the circle and then we make a little

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.770 
the circle and then we make a little
teardrop<00:01:04.369> shape<00:01:04.940> from<00:01:05.149> it<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:05.540> I've<00:01:05.630> got<00:01:05.750> a

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
teardrop shape from it so I've got a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.420 
teardrop shape from it so I've got a
point<00:01:06.020> at<00:01:06.200> one<00:01:06.380> end<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:06.890> rounded<00:01:07.220> at<00:01:07.340> the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
point at one end and it's rounded at the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.469 
point at one end and it's rounded at the
other<00:01:07.550> end<00:01:08.200> push<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.680> point<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:11.240> always<00:01:11.450> a

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
other end push the point it's always a

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.580 
other end push the point it's always a
little<00:01:11.600> bit<00:01:11.840> fiddly<00:01:12.080> when<00:01:12.350> they're<00:01:12.470> this

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
see the shape I've left there at the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.170 
see the shape I've left there at the
bottom<00:02:25.349> I've<00:02:25.530> got<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:25.890> smile<00:02:26.180> on

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
bottom I've got a little smile on

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.880 
bottom I've got a little smile on
depending<00:02:27.629> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> size<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> straw<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.590> have

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
depending on the size of straw you have

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.979 
depending on the size of straw you have
you<00:02:29.099> could<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> tiny<00:02:29.700> smile<00:02:30.150> or<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.420> big<00:02:30.629> smile

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
you could do a tiny smile or a big smile

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.350 
you could do a tiny smile or a big smile
all<00:02:31.560> depends<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.069> size<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.550> straw<00:02:32.819> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
all depends on the size of the straw so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.690 
all depends on the size of the straw so

now again I come to meet ladies heads
ladies<00:02:53.700> heads<00:02:53.910> are<00:02:54.030> more<00:02:54.180> difficult<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.629> do

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
ladies heads are more difficult to do

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.870 
ladies heads are more difficult to do

with a lady's head you want to give it a
slight<00:02:57.150> chin<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.349> end<00:02:58.530> the

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680

man's head and you stick it down onto
the<00:03:02.489> body<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.180> squashes<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.900> neck<00:03:04.140> she

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the body it squashes the neck she

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.140 
the body it squashes the neck she
doesn't<00:03:04.739> look<00:03:04.829> very<00:03:04.890> elegant<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.000> how

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
doesn't look very elegant so this is how

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.390 
doesn't look very elegant so this is how
you<00:03:06.209> make<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> lady's<00:03:06.870> head<00:03:07.079> I've<00:03:07.590> used<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.010> small

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
you make a lady's head I've used a small

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.610 
you make a lady's head I've used a small
D<00:03:08.760> size<00:03:09.209> ball<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.959> bit<00:03:10.110> smaller<00:03:10.440> than<00:03:10.530> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
D size ball so it's a bit smaller than a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.300 
D size ball so it's a bit smaller than a
man's<00:03:10.799> head

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
man's head

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.330 
man's head
I<00:03:11.340> shape<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.360> into<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.720> same<00:03:12.989> shape<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I shape it into the same shape as the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.430 
I shape it into the same shape as the
man's<00:03:14.549> head<00:03:14.880> which<00:03:15.329> is<00:03:15.450> an<00:03:15.569> oval<00:03:15.840> shape<00:03:16.170> and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
man's head which is an oval shape and

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
man's head which is an oval shape and
then<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.660> very<00:03:18.660> slightly<00:03:19.230> point<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.680> chin<00:03:20.480> like

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
then I very slightly point the chin like

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.240 
then I very slightly point the chin like
that<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.079> it's<00:03:22.230> slightly<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.799> elegant<00:03:23.040> with

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that so it's slightly more elegant with

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.130 
that so it's slightly more elegant with
the<00:03:23.400> shape<00:03:23.610> of<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.819> head<00:03:24.000> turn<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the shape of the head turn it to the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.370 
the shape of the head turn it to the
side<00:03:25.410> now<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.040> push<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:27.000> finger<00:03:27.390> there<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
side now and push your finger there so

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.900 
side now and push your finger there so
you're<00:03:28.530> actually<00:03:28.730> sloping<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.660> chin

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you're actually sloping the chin

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.370 
you're actually sloping the chin
backwards<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.239> goes<00:03:33.389> up<00:03:33.569> as<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> slope<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
backwards it goes up as a slope to the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.000 
backwards it goes up as a slope to the
back<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.799> head<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.269> your<00:03:36.450> lady's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
head shape we put her nose very low down

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.559 
head shape we put her nose very low down
on<00:03:42.900> her<00:03:43.049> face<00:03:43.609> and<00:03:44.609> it<00:03:44.730> wants<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.269> tight
