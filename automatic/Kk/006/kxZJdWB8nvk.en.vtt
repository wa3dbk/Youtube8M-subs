color<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> very<00:00:48.090> quick<00:00:48.480> job<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
color this was a very quick job of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
color this was a very quick job of
mixing<00:00:49.829> some<00:00:50.010> color<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.629> silicone<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.960> we

mixing some color with silicone and we

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
mixing some color with silicone and we
got<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> just<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.309> wanted<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
got a just we wanted just kind of a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
got a just we wanted just kind of a
cream<00:00:54.390> color<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.809> slight<00:00:55.530> off-white<00:00:56.190> bone

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.290 
cream color a slight off-white bone
color<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.949> want<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> spread<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.609> into

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
color and we want to spread that into

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.349 
color and we want to spread that into
our<00:01:00.420> mold<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.430> then<00:01:02.430> let<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> cure<00:01:03.120> for

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
our mold and then let that cure for

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
our mold and then let that cure for
about<00:01:03.510> thirty<00:01:03.750> minutes<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.890> D<00:01:05.129> mold<00:01:05.430> our

about thirty minutes and then D mold our

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
about thirty minutes and then D mold our
premade<00:01:06.330> bone<00:01:06.600> section<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.650> these<00:01:07.890> bone

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
premade bone section now these bone

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
premade bone section now these bone
sections<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.850> be<00:01:08.909> stored<00:01:09.390> for<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.659> little

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
sections can be stored for a little

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
sections can be stored for a little
while<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.260> keep<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.530> mind<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:10.860> bond<00:01:11.130> best

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
while just keep in mind they bond best

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.940 
while just keep in mind they bond best
to<00:01:11.880> gel<00:01:12.330> tin<00:01:12.659> when<00:01:13.200> they're<00:01:13.350> fresh

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
to gel tin when they're fresh

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
to gel tin when they're fresh
so<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.549> don't<00:01:14.760> make<00:01:14.970> these<00:01:15.150> until<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.840> were

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so we don't make these until we were

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
so we don't make these until we were
ready<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.460> least<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.790> day<00:01:17.939> or

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
ready to use them or at least a day or

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.749 
ready to use them or at least a day or
so<00:01:18.270> before<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:19.759> now

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
so before we're going to use them now

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
so before we're going to use them now
the<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.180> step<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.689> applying<00:01:22.110> our<00:01:22.380> compound

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the first step to applying our compound

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.910 
the first step to applying our compound
fracture<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.270> mix<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:24.960> gel<00:01:25.259> tin<00:01:25.560> with

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
fracture is to mix up some gel tin with

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.749 
fracture is to mix up some gel tin with
a<00:01:25.950> blood<00:01:26.670> color<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.799> use<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.340> glue

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
a blood color to it and use that to glue

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.230 
a blood color to it and use that to glue
down<00:01:30.060> our<00:01:30.950> compound<00:01:31.950> fracture<00:01:32.490> piece<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
down our compound fracture piece that we

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.929 
down our compound fracture piece that we
cast<00:01:33.509> up<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.280> we've<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
cast up now what we've done here is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.960 
cast up now what we've done here is

consistency<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:54.030> allows<00:01:54.270> us<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.990> stick

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
consistency and that allows us to stick

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
consistency and that allows us to stick
down<00:01:55.500> our<00:01:55.860> pre-made<00:01:56.280> bone<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> can

here<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.690> we've<00:02:21.930> added<00:02:22.200> another<00:02:22.650> layer<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.100> gel

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
here is we've added another layer of gel

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.850 
here is we've added another layer of gel
ten<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.390> time<00:02:24.660> we've<00:02:24.870> pigmented<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
ten and this time we've pigmented it a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.010 
ten and this time we've pigmented it a
flesh<00:02:26.280> tone<00:02:26.610> we've<00:02:27.210> added<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.690> some<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.930> our

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
flesh tone we've added just some of our

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.650 
flesh tone we've added just some of our
regular<00:02:28.500> flesh<00:02:29.040> tone<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.940> stir<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.540> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
regular flesh tone and stir it in a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080 
regular flesh tone and stir it in a
little<00:02:30.990> bit<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.140> flocking<00:02:31.740> some<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> light

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
little bit of flocking some of the light

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.360 
little bit of flocking some of the light
brown<00:02:33.420> or<00:02:33.750> flesh<00:02:34.080> tone<00:02:34.350> flocking<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.040> some<00:02:35.280> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
brown or flesh tone flocking and some of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.210 
brown or flesh tone flocking and some of
the<00:02:35.460> capillary<00:02:36.000> flocking<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.890> gives<00:02:38.070> us

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the capillary flocking and that gives us

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880 
the capillary flocking and that gives us
a<00:02:38.340> nice<00:02:38.580> flesh<00:02:39.120> tone<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.810> we<00:02:40.380> use<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.710> to

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
a nice flesh tone and we use that to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.910 
a nice flesh tone and we use that to
build<00:02:41.130> up<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.940> torn<00:02:42.660> flesh<00:02:43.080> where<00:02:43.770> the

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
build up that that torn flesh where the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.820 
build up that that torn flesh where the
bone<00:02:44.100> has<00:02:44.370> poked<00:02:44.640> through<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.030> skin<00:02:45.560> now<00:02:46.560> as

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
bone has poked through the skin now as

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.400 
bone has poked through the skin now as
the<00:02:47.370> gel<00:02:47.760> tin<00:02:48.000> starts<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.510> cure<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the gel tin starts to cure as you see it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.200 
the gel tin starts to cure as you see it
getting<00:02:49.650> kind<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.980> stringy<00:02:50.370> there<00:02:50.700> that

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
getting kind of stringy there that

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.880 
getting kind of stringy there that
allows<00:02:51.480> us<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.690> come<00:02:52.050> in<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.290> kind<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> pull<00:02:52.860> up

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
allows us to come in and kind of pull up

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.070 
allows us to come in and kind of pull up
the<00:02:53.190> edges<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> wound<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.330> give<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.020> a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the edges of the wound and give it a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.330 
the edges of the wound and give it a
nice<00:02:55.230> torn<00:02:55.770> flesh<00:02:56.250> effect<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:58.070> this<00:02:59.070> takes

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
nice torn flesh effect and this takes

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.150 
nice torn flesh effect and this takes
some<00:02:59.550> timing<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.630> used<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.800> working

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
some timing to get used to the working

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.460 
some timing to get used to the working
time<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.520> gel<00:03:02.730> ten<00:03:02.940> keep<00:03:03.210> in<00:03:03.330> mind<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:04.080> unless

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
time of gel ten keep in mind that unless

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.620 
time of gel ten keep in mind that unless
you<00:03:04.680> add<00:03:04.800> some<00:03:05.010> retarder<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.210> it's<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
you add some retarder to it or it's on a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.480 
you add some retarder to it or it's on a
really<00:03:06.900> cold<00:03:07.140> day<00:03:07.260> you're<00:03:08.070> gonna<00:03:08.160> have<00:03:08.280> about

really cold day you're gonna have about

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.790 
really cold day you're gonna have about
five<00:03:08.970> minutes<00:03:09.120> working<00:03:09.660> time<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.620> going

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
five minutes working time and it's going

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.320 
five minutes working time and it's going
to<00:03:10.980> cure<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.340> completely<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.910> 30<00:03:12.300> minutes<00:03:14.330> now

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
to cure up completely in 30 minutes now

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.790 
to cure up completely in 30 minutes now
you'll<00:03:15.540> notice<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:16.080> as<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.290> build<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:16.680> our

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
you'll notice here as we build up our

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.460 
you'll notice here as we build up our
wound<00:03:17.160> you'll<00:03:17.520> be<00:03:17.640> able<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.910> see<00:03:18.180> some<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
wound you'll be able to see some of that

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.140 
wound you'll be able to see some of that
blood<00:03:20.430> colored<00:03:21.000> gel<00:03:21.810> tin<00:03:22.170> through<00:03:23.130> that<00:03:23.790> layer

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
blood colored gel tin through that layer

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.290 
blood colored gel tin through that layer
of<00:03:24.530> silicone<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.640> adds<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:26.940> much

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
of silicone and that just adds that much

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.060 
of silicone and that just adds that much
more<00:03:27.360> realism<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.320> effect<00:03:28.710> since<00:03:28.920> you're

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
more realism to the effect since you're

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.600 
more realism to the effect since you're
actually<00:03:29.400> able<00:03:29.520> to<00:03:29.640> see<00:03:30.030> through<00:03:30.390> a<00:03:30.840> layer<00:03:31.410> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
actually able to see through a layer of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.100 
actually able to see through a layer of
flesh<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.210> some<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.600> bruising

idea<00:03:41.580> what<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.030> could<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.300> with<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.840> few

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
idea what you could do with just a few

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.510 
idea what you could do with just a few
minutes<00:03:43.320> of<00:03:43.590> work<00:03:43.860> with<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:44.370> these

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
minutes of work with one of these

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.150 
minutes of work with one of these
pre-made<00:03:45.060> fracture<00:03:45.990> parts<00:03:48.170> now<00:03:49.170> once<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.770> gel

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
pre-made fracture parts now once the gel

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.550 
pre-made fracture parts now once the gel
tin<00:03:50.460> is<00:03:50.700> unworkable<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.870> gets<00:03:52.350> really

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
tin is unworkable and gets really

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.560 
tin is unworkable and gets really
stringy<00:03:53.100> like<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.580> it's<00:03:54.030> time<00:03:54.210> to<00:03:54.360> leave<00:03:54.510> it

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
stringy like that it's time to leave it

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.990 
stringy like that it's time to leave it
alone<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.140> allow<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.440> cure<00:03:55.800> again<00:03:56.640> keep<00:03:56.850> in

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
alone and allow it to cure again keep in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.700 
alone and allow it to cure again keep in
mind<00:03:57.240> you've<00:03:57.450> got<00:03:57.480> five<00:03:57.930> minutes<00:03:58.170> working

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
mind you've got five minutes working

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.100 
mind you've got five minutes working
time<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.310> at<00:03:59.940> 30<00:04:00.210> minutes<00:04:00.570> you'll<00:04:00.750> achieve<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
time and at 30 minutes you'll achieve a

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.160 
time and at 30 minutes you'll achieve a
full<00:04:01.590> cure<00:04:02.010> now<00:04:03.000> once<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.600> can<00:04:03.810> touch<00:04:04.140> it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
full cure now once you can touch it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.530 
full cure now once you can touch it
without<00:04:04.560> pulling<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:05.010> away<00:04:05.100> it's<00:04:06.060> time<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.450> add

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
without pulling it away it's time to add

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.720 
without pulling it away it's time to add
some<00:04:06.780> blood<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.320> finish<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.860> effect<00:04:08.190> now<00:04:08.670> you

work great over silicone and don't beat

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.040 
work great over silicone and don't beat
up<00:04:31.889> as<00:04:32.099> much<00:04:32.310> as<00:04:32.639> some<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.419> water-based

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
up as much as some of the water-based

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.129 
up as much as some of the water-based
blood<00:04:34.590> formulas<00:04:35.360> now<00:04:36.360> what<00:04:36.629> I<00:04:36.659> like<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.020> do

any kind of detailing over the top we're

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.730 
any kind of detailing over the top we're
gonna<00:04:40.889> hide<00:04:41.159> some<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.490> those<00:04:41.580> little<00:04:41.849> sins<00:04:42.180> by

gonna hide some of those little sins by

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.680 
gonna hide some of those little sins by
stippling<00:04:43.740> blood<00:04:44.039> all<00:04:44.340> over<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.879> then<00:04:45.210> wiping

stippling blood all over and then wiping
it<00:04:45.810> away<00:04:45.870> we're<00:04:46.620> gonna<00:04:46.710> smudge<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.490> little

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
it away we're gonna smudge that a little

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.420 
it away we're gonna smudge that a little
bit<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.180> then<00:04:48.960> use<00:04:49.169> a<00:04:49.199> paper<00:04:49.530> towel<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.889> wipe

away<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:51.150> blood<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.690> create<00:04:51.930> some<00:04:52.110> streaking

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
away the blood and create some streaking

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.909 
away the blood and create some streaking
as<00:04:52.830> though<00:04:53.460> our<00:04:54.330> model<00:04:54.780> here<00:04:55.020> fell<00:04:55.349> down<00:04:55.590> broke

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
as though our model here fell down broke

as though our model here fell down broke
her<00:04:56.069> leg<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.580> smear<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.240> blood<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.900> you'll

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
her leg and smear the blood and you'll

00:04:58.349 --> 00:04:59.870 
her leg and smear the blood and you'll
see<00:04:58.560> with<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:59.069> little<00:04:59.400> bit<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.639> work<00:04:59.849> here

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
see with just a little bit of work here

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.990 
see with just a little bit of work here
we<00:05:00.599> get<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.810> very<00:05:01.169> impressive<00:05:01.530> very<00:05:02.159> realistic

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
we get a very impressive very realistic

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:12.760 
we get a very impressive very realistic
