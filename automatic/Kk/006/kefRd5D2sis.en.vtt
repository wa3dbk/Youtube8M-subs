00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.899
 justice and a victory for every

 have adjustments and 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.659
 and if the little public 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:24.579
 we always come to massamá and hope 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.859
 that it is 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.579
 dictated and publicly expressed as did the royal-court France 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.570
 this news this legal truth be said and proclaimed is a mere prostate 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.810
 to have how it was 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.810

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.120
 president 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.570
 isabel santos 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.660
 of self-government of a goal 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.470
 evidently from the mine of my family and my companions 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.230
 Who exactly were 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.750
 treated that we do not know who he is, he denies that there was any 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.860
 influence of the French government and in this 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.560
 and stresses that he has always believed in the independence of the organs that make up 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 this Italian justice 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.500
 a goal can be called into question 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.120
 because who said anything here 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.820
 It's the court did not go to the public prosecutor's office. 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.340
 but also the public prosecutor Roberto 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.780
 so we are safely with some friends boyfriends image of others 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.770
 africans 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.130
 I'm Latin American 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.540
 What was it about? 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.590
 a farce I think it was the stocking today thoughts and analysis I'd rather think 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.320
 that it was the turn of reading mateo gil's manipulation profile also 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.420
 defend the square 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.840
 Because it's a great country, France has good people too. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 only that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.700
 many people in france with the old thought did not want and did not admit 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.670
 oh the reality 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.620
 It's not like morana. 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.870
 the reality of each 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.690
 the reality of 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.080
 of the Avanian victory 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.319
 and the reality of the 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:08.009
 since given me 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.839
 of sovereignty mclaren 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.329
 finally in the mind 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.079
 Thanks to God and the people's graces. 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.909
 the entrepreneur reaffirms his determination to continue to help 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.700
 Angola 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.049
 achieve the goal of development and prosperity 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.829
 from now on thanks to God 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.239
 we survive baskets 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.039
 if the difficult times 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.319
 P 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.789
 just to build 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.789
 build share build and develop 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:33.850
 brace for forward 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.060
 felipe defense but despite the fame with the ball is developing 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.599
 but that this one there has to be or do not forget that I am a 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.709
 businessman with the present in 17 countries 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.870
 the current majority of the investments employed in their countries traveled very 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.689
 and I can compare the minerva per year compared to other countries that do not 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.209
 we are not even half the ordinary 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.159
 sought to take a shot and have to follow the Mass in that direction 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.799
 even that's the word 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.300
 remember that the outcome of this case proved that he always 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.740
 that could never have arms trafficking that had its end due in this case the law 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.970
 for the simple reason that other weapons will not leave France 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.660
 did not travel through France and were not destined for France and both the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.160
 law of the country of origin of the weapons as the detained country that was a class as the right 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.390
 This operation was considered critical for this reason. 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.750
 French law does not have jurisdiction over this fact was that I 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.800
 alzheimer's disease and I do not like anything public despite the political 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.980
 that caused a good image and prestige not only of the person who was 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.080
 judged and condemned but especially prostrate forms came to the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.300
 right angle was a process that was not 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.390
 fiction that should not have been when I lay down was in fact a garment on a 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.680
 which did not exist for ten years as food but more 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.090
 the news against the Angolan state exist the leaders warm up 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.950
 the press has repeatedly tried to rely on the wrongdoing and this despite the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.340
 repeated protests of the collar for whom the burden of having to prove 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.980
 his innocence and the normality of the cases should have been after action to 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.029
 to confirm the facts that, after all, he did not prove 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.569
 fortunately this norm of proof of law and morals in a troubled world 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.580
 by interests that are not often irreconcilable 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.319
 in which the lie is used to justify the options the humiliations 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.470
 and how many times a team of millions of 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:37.669
 third World 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.949
 when she acknowledged to be different 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.550
 in this case after the approved ratio prevailed over the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.749
 manipulation and insurgency
