00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
vinegar now we mix again and then we put

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.440 
vinegar now we mix again and then we put
it<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.769> bread<00:02:39.920> pan<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.220> we<00:02:40.280> bake<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.610> is<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it in the bread pan and we bake it is it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.009 
it in the bread pan and we bake it is it
ready<00:02:41.630> yet

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
ready yet

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.770 
ready yet
yeah<00:02:42.349> it's<00:02:42.530> good<00:02:42.920> oh<00:02:43.130> yeah<00:02:43.340> chunk<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.819> dough<00:02:44.090> in

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
yeah it's good oh yeah chunk of dough in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.550 
yeah it's good oh yeah chunk of dough in
pan<00:02:46.209> so<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.360> should<00:02:47.630> rise<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.380> bit

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
pan so it should rise a little bit

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.289 
pan so it should rise a little bit
because<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:49.099> baking<00:02:49.610> soda<00:02:49.849> will<00:02:50.030> interact

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
because the baking soda will interact

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.509 
because the baking soda will interact
with<00:02:50.780> apple<00:02:51.260> cider<00:02:51.379> vinegar<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.430> it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
with apple cider vinegar and so it

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.770 
with apple cider vinegar and so it
should<00:02:52.700> be<00:02:52.819> should<00:02:52.879> get<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.150> little<00:02:53.569> bit<00:02:53.690> of

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
should be should get a little bit of

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.630 
should be should get a little bit of
