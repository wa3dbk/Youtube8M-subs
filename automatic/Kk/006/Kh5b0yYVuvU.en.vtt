yeah<00:00:04.270> picked<00:00:04.569> up<00:00:04.720> my<00:00:04.870> solar<00:00:05.170> panels<00:00:05.649> the<00:00:05.769> other

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920 
yeah picked up my solar panels the other

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.980 
yeah picked up my solar panels the other
day<00:00:06.130> they're<00:00:06.460> either<00:00:08.040> rated<00:00:09.040> at<00:00:09.190> 80<00:00:09.370> watts

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
day they're either rated at 80 watts

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.589 
day they're either rated at 80 watts
besides<00:00:11.530> why's<00:00:11.799> there<00:00:12.070> an<00:00:12.219> AE<00:00:12.370> there<00:00:13.059> are<00:00:13.150> 88

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
besides why's there an AE there are 88

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.340 
besides why's there an AE there are 88
G's<00:00:14.019> through<00:00:14.379> high<00:00:14.740> efficiency<00:00:15.720> a<00:00:16.720> little<00:00:17.260> bit

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
G's through high efficiency a little bit

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.170 
G's through high efficiency a little bit
smaller<00:00:17.650> than<00:00:17.920> your<00:00:18.039> regular<00:00:18.369> size<00:00:18.610> and<00:00:18.940> for

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
smaller than your regular size and for

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.480 
smaller than your regular size and for
the<00:00:19.210> trailer<00:00:19.770> since<00:00:20.770> it's<00:00:20.950> so<00:00:21.100> small<00:00:21.430> I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
the trailer since it's so small I

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.550 
the trailer since it's so small I
thought<00:00:21.820> they'd<00:00:22.000> be<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.180> better<00:00:22.420> fit

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
thought they'd be a better fit

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.790 
thought they'd be a better fit
now<00:00:23.950> I<00:00:23.980> originally<00:00:24.610> got<00:00:24.790> them<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.530> picked

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
now I originally got them now I picked

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.230 
now I originally got them now I picked
them<00:00:26.890> up<00:00:26.980> here<00:00:27.190> in<00:00:27.280> town<00:00:27.520> but<00:00:27.820> there's<00:00:28.150> a

with the VMP of seventeen point six

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.090 
with the VMP of seventeen point six
fiddled<00:01:16.510> with<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.200> seventeen<00:01:17.770> point<00:01:18.040> six

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.420 
fiddled with the seventeen point six
from<00:01:18.670> my<00:01:18.820> understanding<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.830> will<00:01:21.220> just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
from my understanding that will just

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.810 
from my understanding that will just
allow<00:01:21.810> MPPT<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.070> controller<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.670> work

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
allow MPPT on the controller to work

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
going to take this two inch extruded

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.880 
going to take this two inch extruded
aluminum<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:52.080> here<00:01:53.080> are<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.290> mounting<00:01:53.680> holes

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
aluminum and here are the mounting holes

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.310 
aluminum and here are the mounting holes
here<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:54.729> I'm<00:01:55.119> going<00:01:55.240> to<00:01:55.360> cut<00:01:55.540> one<00:01:55.750> strip<00:01:56.080> that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
here so I'm going to cut one strip that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.910 
here so I'm going to cut one strip that
will<00:01:56.439> fit<00:01:56.650> here<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.420> then

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
will fit here and then

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.969 
will fit here and then
that'll<00:01:59.370> fit<00:01:59.580> here<00:02:00.120> and<00:02:00.350> then<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.440> gonna<00:02:01.650> bolt

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
that'll fit here and then I'm gonna bolt

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.840 
that'll fit here and then I'm gonna bolt
the<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:02.670> panels<00:02:03.330> together<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:05.460> I'll<00:02:05.580> take

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the two panels together then I'll take

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.910 
the two panels together then I'll take
another<00:02:05.880> piece<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> extruded<00:02:07.050> aluminum<00:02:07.650> cut

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
another piece of extruded aluminum cut

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
another piece of extruded aluminum cut
the<00:02:08.039> same<00:02:08.280> lengths<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.940> bolt<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the same lengths and bolt them to the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.890 
the same lengths and bolt them to the
trailer<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.370> there'd<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.720> through<00:02:12.720> these

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
trailer so there'd be through these

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.580 
trailer so there'd be through these
bolts<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> trailer<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.440> two<00:02:16.440> of

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
bolts of the trailer and then two of

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.510 
bolts of the trailer and then two of
these<00:02:16.709> bolt<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.270> opposite<00:02:18.660> direction

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
these bolt it in the opposite direction

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.730 
these bolt it in the opposite direction
to<00:02:20.520> hold<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> panels<00:02:21.330> together<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.590> I'm

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
to hold the panels together and then I'm

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.500 
to hold the panels together and then I'm
thinking<00:02:22.770> I'll<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.250> drill<00:02:23.640> holes<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.209> here

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
thinking I'll just drill holes in here

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.100 
thinking I'll just drill holes in here
and<00:02:25.230> I'll<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.530> able<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.739> hinge<00:02:26.570> hinge<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and I'll be able to hinge hinge it so I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.470 
and I'll be able to hinge hinge it so I
can<00:02:28.350> tilt<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:28.980> lay<00:02:29.250> flat<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.850> then<00:02:30.300> ought

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
can tilt up or lay flat and then ought

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.770 
can tilt up or lay flat and then ought
to<00:02:30.750> make<00:02:30.930> up<00:02:31.080> some<00:02:31.290> sort<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.590> locking<00:02:32.040> device

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
to make up some sort of locking device

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.350 
to make up some sort of locking device
also<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.580> I'm<00:02:35.700> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.239> I'm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
also then what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.110 
also then what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.600> wire<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.959> panels<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.590> series<00:02:38.120> so

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
going to wire the panels in series so

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.990 
going to wire the panels in series so
it'll<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.530> positive<00:02:40.800> F<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.310> one<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
it'll be the positive F of one to the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.240 
it'll be the positive F of one to the
negative<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.660> other<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.739> I'll<00:02:43.920> take<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
negative of the other and I'll take the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.220 
negative of the other and I'll take the
other<00:02:44.400> two<00:02:44.640> leads<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.510> feed<00:02:45.810> them<00:02:46.019> down

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
other two leads and feed them down

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.130 
other two leads and feed them down
through<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> trailer<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.400> well<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.360> will<00:02:48.690> take

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
through the trailer as well I will take

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.979 
through the trailer as well I will take
I<00:02:49.739> will<00:02:50.100> round<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.580> panel<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.150> will<00:02:51.510> run<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> wire

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
I will round the panel I will run a wire

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.250 
I will round the panel I will run a wire
I'll<00:02:52.890> run<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.310> down<00:02:53.630> inside<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.690> trailer<00:02:55.050> as

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I'll run it down inside the trailer as

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.650 
I'll run it down inside the trailer as
well<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.830> then<00:02:56.100> I'll<00:02:56.190> just<00:02:56.370> ground<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.000> now

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
well and then I'll just ground it now

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.509 
well and then I'll just ground it now
I'm<00:02:57.780> going<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.080> take<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:58.739> measurements<00:02:59.070> I'm

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
I'm going to take my measurements I'm

going to go outside and I'll cut the
aluminum<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.489> eight<00:03:02.850> foot<00:03:03.150> lengths<00:03:03.660> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
aluminum to eight foot lengths of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.789 
aluminum to eight foot lengths of
extruded<00:03:04.620> aluminum<00:03:05.100> two<00:03:05.280> inch<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:06.530> took<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.680> I

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
extruded aluminum two inch I took it I

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.920 
extruded aluminum two inch I took it I
cut<00:03:08.130> four<00:03:08.400> pieces<00:03:08.780> 41<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> half<00:03:10.170> inches<00:03:10.530> and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
cut four pieces 41 and a half inches and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
cut four pieces 41 and a half inches and
drilled<00:03:12.930> some<00:03:13.079> holes<00:03:13.110> I'll<00:03:13.530> straighten<00:03:13.769> it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
drilled some holes I'll straighten it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.490 
drilled some holes I'll straighten it
here's<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.959> extra<00:03:15.959> piece<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:16.470> left

here's the extra piece that was left
over<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.100> I<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.190> did<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.579> tap

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
over and I just did a tap

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.520 
over and I just did a tap
so<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.650> panel's<00:03:20.100> will<00:03:20.760> be<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:22.110> panels

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
so this the panel's will be the panels

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.090 
so this the panel's will be the panels
will<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.769> fastened<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.670> here<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:25.470> will<00:03:25.530> be<00:03:25.829> on

of the trailer stationary on the trailer

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.930 
of the trailer stationary on the trailer
like<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.079> there<00:03:31.350> will<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.620> bolt<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.670> either

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
like that there will be a bolt in either

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.770 
like that there will be a bolt in either
side<00:03:34.459> but<00:03:35.459> if<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.790> want<00:03:36.000> I'm<00:03:36.209> going<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.660> the

side but if I want I'm going to have the

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.319 
side but if I want I'm going to have the
option<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.040> need<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.579> tilt<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.940> panel's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
option if I need to tilt the panel's

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.300 
option if I need to tilt the panel's
once<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.019> drilled<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> holes<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.160> to

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
once I drilled the holes on here to

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.880 
once I drilled the holes on here to
actually<00:03:41.579> fit<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.030> panels<00:03:42.480> on<00:03:42.630> there<00:03:42.900> then

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
actually fit the panels on there then

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.650 
actually fit the panels on there then
I'll<00:03:44.010> set<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.280> up<00:03:44.459> on<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> trailer<00:03:44.910> mark<00:03:45.450> where

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
I'll set it up on the trailer mark where

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.750 
I'll set it up on the trailer mark where
the<00:03:45.870> mark<00:03:46.709> where<00:03:46.890> this<00:03:47.010> one<00:03:47.250> has<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.610> get

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
the mark where this one has to get

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.030 
the mark where this one has to get
drilled<00:03:47.970> into<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.420> trailer<00:03:48.690> now<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.620> roof<00:03:49.860> is

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
drilled into the trailer now the roof is

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.259 
drilled into the trailer now the roof is
rounded<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.579> I'm<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> have<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.060> few

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
rounded so I'm going to have a few

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.030 
rounded so I'm going to have a few
problems<00:03:51.480> himself<00:03:52.230> they<00:03:52.470> have<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> quarter

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
problems himself they have a quarter

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.500 
problems himself they have a quarter
inch<00:03:53.220> hole<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.700> them<00:03:53.880> I'm<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:54.329> use

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
inch hole in them I'm going to use

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.750 
inch hole in them I'm going to use
carriage<00:03:55.230> bolts<00:03:55.590> I've<00:03:55.799> oversize<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.579> hole

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
carriage bolts I've oversize the hole

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.470 
carriage bolts I've oversize the hole
here<00:03:57.030> it's<00:03:57.209> 5/16<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:59.160> because<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.820> carriage

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
here it's 5/16 just because the carriage

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.539 
here it's 5/16 just because the carriage
bolts<00:04:00.870> are<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.560> little<00:04:01.769> bigger<00:04:01.950> around<00:04:02.280> there

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
bolts are a little bigger around there

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.729 
bolts are a little bigger around there
now<00:04:03.180> I'm<00:04:03.299> thinking<00:04:03.660> of<00:04:03.720> carriage<00:04:04.109> bolts<00:04:04.530> I

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
now I'm thinking of carriage bolts I

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.810 
now I'm thinking of carriage bolts I
just<00:04:05.010> want<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> make<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.549> little<00:04:05.730> more

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
just want to make it a little more

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.490 
just want to make it a little more
difficult<00:04:06.359> if<00:04:06.480> anybody<00:04:06.840> decides<00:04:07.050> they<00:04:07.470> want

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
difficult if anybody decides they want

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.860 
difficult if anybody decides they want
to<00:04:07.739> try<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:07.980> steal<00:04:08.160> them<00:04:08.400> I'll<00:04:09.330> screw<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.720> in

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
to try and steal them I'll screw it in

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.120 
to try and steal them I'll screw it in
this<00:04:09.989> side

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
this side

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.130 
this side
then<00:04:11.340> on<00:04:11.490> the<00:04:11.640> other<00:04:11.670> side<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.690> I'll<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.990> the

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
then on the other side then I'll do the

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.390 
then on the other side then I'll do the
same<00:04:13.170> thing<00:04:13.590> with<00:04:13.740> the<00:04:13.860> other<00:04:14.010> piece<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
same thing with the other piece of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.150 
same thing with the other piece of
aluminum<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.690> I'll<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:16.050> four<00:04:16.410> bolts<00:04:16.860> holding

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
aluminum so I'll have four bolts holding

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.810 
aluminum so I'll have four bolts holding
the<00:04:18.060> two<00:04:18.300> panels<00:04:18.720> together<00:04:19.400> then<00:04:20.400> when<00:04:20.790> I

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
the two panels together then when I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.000 
the two panels together then when I
square<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.480> then<00:04:22.050> I<00:04:22.170> can<00:04:22.200> go<00:04:22.530> when<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:22.770> can

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
square it up then I can go when I can

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.070 
square it up then I can go when I can
mark<00:04:23.250> where<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.490> other<00:04:23.760> four<00:04:24.420> holes<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
mark where the other four holes have to

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.130 
mark where the other four holes have to
go<00:04:25.200> on<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.560> inside<00:04:25.680> edge<00:04:26.130> two<00:04:27.090> panels<00:04:27.600> squared

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
go on the inside edge two panels squared

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.170 
go on the inside edge two panels squared
up<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.710> bolt<00:04:28.980> it<00:04:29.130> together<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.760> can<00:04:29.940> see

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
up and bolt it together you can see

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360 
up and bolt it together you can see
there's<00:04:30.450> one<00:04:30.840> two<00:04:31.050> three<00:04:31.320> four<00:04:31.680> with

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
there's one two three four with

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.250 
there's one two three four with
stainless<00:04:32.850> steel<00:04:32.880> carriage<00:04:33.540> bolts<00:04:34.020> and

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
stainless steel carriage bolts and

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.960 
stainless steel carriage bolts and
there's<00:04:37.260> where<00:04:37.500> the<00:04:37.560> two<00:04:37.800> panels<00:04:38.280> meet<00:04:38.700> in<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
there's where the two panels meet in the

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.260 
there's where the two panels meet in the
middle

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
middle

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.970 
middle
now<00:04:39.690> once<00:04:39.900> everything's<00:04:40.320> set<00:04:40.530> up<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.920> know

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
now once everything's set up and I know

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.400 
now once everything's set up and I know
what's<00:04:41.220> working<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.850> might<00:04:42.510> just<00:04:42.690> put<00:04:42.720> epoxy

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
what's working I might just put epoxy

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.140 
what's working I might just put epoxy
putty<00:04:44.720> in<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.840> backside<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.800> the<00:04:47.550> bolts<00:04:47.880> there

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
putty in the backside of the bolts there

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.560 
putty in the backside of the bolts there
so<00:04:48.450> nobody<00:04:48.630> can<00:04:48.870> get<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.080> wrench<00:04:49.350> in<00:04:49.590> there<00:04:49.830> I

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
so nobody can get a wrench in there I

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.690 
so nobody can get a wrench in there I
cut<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.780> here<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.560> will<00:04:52.680> angle<00:04:53.070> up<00:04:53.250> but

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
cut this here so it will angle up but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.030 
cut this here so it will angle up but
it's<00:04:54.330> all<00:04:54.480> things<00:04:54.900> happen<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.590> didn't<00:04:55.860> quite

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
it's all things happen I didn't quite

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.480 
it's all things happen I didn't quite
think<00:04:56.100> everything<00:04:56.940> through<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:58.100> did<00:04:59.100> the<00:04:59.250> test

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
think everything through I did the test

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.110 
think everything through I did the test
with<00:04:59.760> just<00:05:00.060> the<00:05:00.720> bottom<00:05:01.050> piece<00:05:01.260> and<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:02.120> top

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
with just the bottom piece and the top

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.150 
with just the bottom piece and the top
piece<00:05:03.390> there<00:05:03.660> I<00:05:03.690> wasn't<00:05:03.960> thinking<00:05:04.380> about<00:05:04.650> this

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
piece there I wasn't thinking about this

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.840 
piece there I wasn't thinking about this
being<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.790> way<00:05:05.960> so<00:05:06.960> when<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.230> goes<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.850> tilt

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
being in the way so when it goes to tilt

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.540 
being in the way so when it goes to tilt
up<00:05:09.030> this<00:05:09.810> binds<00:05:10.170> here<00:05:10.500> now<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.280> what<00:05:11.430> I'll<00:05:11.520> have

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
up this binds here now so what I'll have

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.450 
up this binds here now so what I'll have
to<00:05:11.760> do<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.270> I'll<00:05:12.420> have<00:05:12.450> to<00:05:12.800> trim<00:05:13.800> this<00:05:13.950> one<00:05:14.010> here

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
to do is I'll have to trim this one here

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.820 
to do is I'll have to trim this one here
also<00:05:14.610> if<00:05:14.940> it

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.520 

I'm<00:05:18.890> gonna<00:05:19.010> have<00:05:19.220> my<00:05:19.370> panels<00:05:19.820> wire<00:05:20.060> together

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
I'm gonna have my panels wire together

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.730 
I'm gonna have my panels wire together
I'm<00:05:21.530> going<00:05:21.920> to<00:05:22.040> wire<00:05:22.220> them<00:05:22.460> in<00:05:22.550> series<00:05:23.740> this

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
I'm going to wire them in series this

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.490 
I'm going to wire them in series this
will<00:05:24.980> deliver<00:05:25.370> 4.8<00:05:26.270> amps<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.750> current<00:05:26.780> through

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
will deliver 4.8 amps of current through

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.990 
will deliver 4.8 amps of current through
the<00:05:27.710> line<00:05:27.890> to<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:29.000> controller<00:05:29.450> at<00:05:30.320> 33<00:05:31.160> point<00:05:31.580> 4

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
the line to the controller at 33 point 4

the line to the controller at 33 point 4
volts<00:05:32.030> in<00:05:33.130> optimal<00:05:34.130> conditions<00:05:34.790> so<00:05:35.690> what<00:05:35.870> you

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
volts in optimal conditions so what you

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.560 
volts in optimal conditions so what you
do<00:05:36.140> this<00:05:36.440> is<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.800> one<00:05:36.920> side<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.490> panel<00:05:37.910> I've

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
do this is the one side of panel I've

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.630 
do this is the one side of panel I've
taken<00:05:38.810> just<00:05:38.990> one<00:05:39.410> strand<00:05:39.770> of<00:05:39.950> that<00:05:40.070> 10<00:05:40.430> to

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
taken just one strand of that 10 to

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.950 
taken just one strand of that 10 to
cable<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.300> going<00:05:41.450> to<00:05:41.510> run<00:05:41.660> from<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
cable it's going to run from the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.420 
cable it's going to run from the
positive<00:05:42.500> on<00:05:42.740> this<00:05:43.040> panel<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:45.250> runs<00:05:46.250> over

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
positive on this panel and runs over

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.950 
positive on this panel and runs over
again<00:05:46.850> I'm<00:05:47.000> just<00:05:47.180> using<00:05:47.360> one<00:05:47.630> of<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.780> wires

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
again I'm just using one of the wires

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.750 
again I'm just using one of the wires
there's<00:05:48.200> two<00:05:48.350> wires<00:05:48.530> inside<00:05:48.950> there<00:05:49.220> I<00:05:49.250> snipped

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
there's two wires inside there I snipped

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.570 
there's two wires inside there I snipped
one<00:05:50.000> off<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.420> edge<00:05:50.660> and<00:05:51.100> we're<00:05:52.100> just<00:05:52.190> using

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
one off of the edge and we're just using

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.220 
one off of the edge and we're just using
one<00:05:52.730> here<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.180> want<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.510> keep<00:05:53.660> it<00:05:53.810> in<00:05:53.930> the<00:05:54.020> sheath

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
one here I want to keep it in the sheath

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.830 
one here I want to keep it in the sheath
though<00:05:54.500> cuz<00:05:54.740> that's<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.130> UV<00:05:55.400> protection<00:05:55.840> and

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
though cuz that's the UV protection and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.150 
though cuz that's the UV protection and
it's<00:05:57.050> running<00:05:57.440> over<00:05:58.870> this<00:05:59.870> is<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.290> here<00:06:00.650> coming

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
it's running over this is it here coming

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.840 
it's running over this is it here coming
into<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.550> negative<00:06:02.000> on<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.600> other<00:06:02.960> one<00:06:03.850> we

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
into the negative on the other one we

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.480 
into the negative on the other one we
then<00:06:05.090> take<00:06:05.660> another<00:06:05.840> of<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.470> 10/2<00:06:07.010> cable

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
then take another of that 10/2 cable

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.100 
then take another of that 10/2 cable
again<00:06:07.670> just<00:06:08.060> using<00:06:08.390> one<00:06:08.540> of<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.720> cables

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
again just using one of the cables

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.920 
again just using one of the cables
inside<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.620> sheath<00:06:10.210> snip<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.390> other<00:06:11.540> one<00:06:11.750> off

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
inside the sheath snip the other one off

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.430 
inside the sheath snip the other one off
here<00:06:12.580> so<00:06:13.580> this<00:06:13.910> is<00:06:14.180> composite<00:06:14.900> up<00:06:15.020> on<00:06:15.290> this

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
here so this is composite up on this

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.740 
here so this is composite up on this
panel<00:06:15.920> it<00:06:16.730> will<00:06:16.880> run<00:06:17.060> out<00:06:17.240> through<00:06:17.480> this

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
panel it will run out through this

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.520 
panel it will run out through this
strain<00:06:18.110> relief<00:06:18.850> down<00:06:19.850> here<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:21.170> that'll<00:06:21.410> be

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
strain relief down here and that'll be

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.280 
strain relief down here and that'll be
fed<00:06:21.800> down<00:06:22.070> to<00:06:22.730> a<00:06:22.760> plug<00:06:23.090> which<00:06:23.420> will<00:06:23.660> eventually

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
fed down to a plug which will eventually

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.940 
fed down to a plug which will eventually

panel's this will just be a ground for

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.750 
panel's this will just be a ground for
the<00:06:56.480> panel<00:06:56.900> ok<00:06:57.860> they're<00:06:58.070> all<00:06:58.220> connected

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
the panel ok they're all connected

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.670 
the panel ok they're all connected
together<00:06:59.890> ground<00:07:01.720> since<00:07:02.720> the<00:07:03.080> panels<00:07:03.500> are

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
connected with the bolts and all this

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.480 
connected with the bolts and all this
they'd<00:07:05.480> be<00:07:05.660> grounded<00:07:06.080> just<00:07:06.110> with<00:07:06.440> one<00:07:06.680> but<00:07:07.010> I'm

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
they'd be grounded just with one but I'm

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.290 
they'd be grounded just with one but I'm
being<00:07:07.730> extra<00:07:08.350> extra<00:07:09.350> careful<00:07:09.880> so<00:07:10.880> again<00:07:11.150> this

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.300 
being extra extra careful so again this

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.090 
being extra extra careful so again this
will<00:07:11.480> run<00:07:11.630> down<00:07:11.840> here<00:07:12.140> so<00:07:12.350> now<00:07:12.530> I've<00:07:12.680> got<00:07:12.860> three

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:13.100 
will run down here so now I've got three

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.420 
will run down here so now I've got three
wires<00:07:13.340> that<00:07:13.610> will<00:07:13.730> run<00:07:13.910> down<00:07:14.090> to<00:07:14.330> my<00:07:14.480> plug<00:07:15.430> this

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
wires that will run down to my plug this

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.700 
wires that will run down to my plug this
will<00:07:16.640> be<00:07:16.760> the<00:07:16.910> frame<00:07:17.150> of<00:07:17.360> the<00:07:17.420> panel<00:07:17.840> which

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
will be the frame of the panel which

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.350 
will be the frame of the panel which
will<00:07:18.890> eventually<00:07:19.400> run<00:07:19.610> down<00:07:19.820> to<00:07:20.000> the<00:07:20.120> three

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
will eventually run down to the three

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.840 
will eventually run down to the three
prong<00:07:20.630> plug<00:07:20.660> then<00:07:21.590> inside<00:07:22.010> the<00:07:22.220> trailer<00:07:22.490> and

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
prong plug then inside the trailer and

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.580 
prong plug then inside the trailer and
then<00:07:23.210> that'll<00:07:23.480> be<00:07:23.510> attached<00:07:23.900> somewhere<00:07:24.230> to<00:07:24.470> my

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:24.590 
then that'll be attached somewhere to my

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.100 
then that'll be attached somewhere to my
trailer<00:07:24.950> frame<00:07:25.420> this<00:07:26.420> will<00:07:26.630> go<00:07:26.720> down<00:07:26.900> to<00:07:26.930> the

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
trailer frame this will go down to the

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.110 
trailer frame this will go down to the
three<00:07:27.470> prong<00:07:27.740> plug<00:07:28.450> eventually<00:07:29.450> it'll<00:07:29.630> go

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 
three prong plug eventually it'll go

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.990 
three prong plug eventually it'll go
and<00:07:30.419> the<00:07:30.540> connect<00:07:30.900> of<00:07:31.110> A+<00:07:31.800> solder<00:07:32.280> in<00:07:32.520> on<00:07:32.790> the

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
and the connect of A+ solder in on the

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.450 
and the connect of A+ solder in on the
charge<00:07:33.240> controller<00:07:33.949> this<00:07:34.949> will<00:07:35.130> go<00:07:35.250> down<00:07:35.430> to

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
charge controller this will go down to

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.969 
charge controller this will go down to
the<00:07:35.790> three-pronged<00:07:36.479> plug<00:07:36.660> and<00:07:37.080> eventually

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 
the three-pronged plug and eventually

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:40.760 
the three-pronged plug and eventually
connect<00:07:38.310> to<00:07:38.490> the<00:07:38.610> negative<00:07:39.060> solar<00:07:39.360> in<00:07:39.770> from

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:40.770 
connect to the negative solar in from

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.640 
connect to the negative solar in from
the<00:07:40.860> charge<00:07:41.130> controller<00:07:42.110> so<00:07:43.110> these<00:07:43.320> three

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650 
the charge controller so these three

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.879 
the charge controller so these three
wires<00:07:43.889> I<00:07:44.280> just<00:07:44.520> taped<00:07:44.669> them<00:07:44.910> all<00:07:45.060> together

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889 
wires I just taped them all together

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:50.480 
wires I just taped them all together
encase<00:07:46.889> them<00:07:47.160> in<00:07:47.310> this<00:07:47.490> wire<00:07:48.030> loom<00:07:49.490> then

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490 
encase them in this wire loom then

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.800 
encase them in this wire loom then
they're<00:07:50.699> tied<00:07:50.970> into<00:07:51.210> here<00:07:52.760> so<00:07:53.760> again<00:07:53.940> this<00:07:54.570> one

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
they're tied into here so again this one

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.140 
they're tied into here so again this one
here<00:07:55.020> I've<00:07:55.199> designated<00:07:56.130> the<00:07:56.490> negative<00:07:56.940> so

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.150 
here I've designated the negative so

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.260 
here I've designated the negative so
that'll<00:07:57.449> eventually<00:07:57.690> go<00:07:58.110> to<00:07:58.729> negative<00:07:59.729> solar

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:00.270 
that'll eventually go to negative solar

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.659 
that'll eventually go to negative solar
in<00:08:00.540> and<00:08:00.750> the<00:08:00.810> charge<00:08:01.080> controller<00:08:01.669> positive

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:02.669 
in and the charge controller positive

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:04.460 
in and the charge controller positive
solar<00:08:02.940> in<00:08:03.210> and<00:08:03.360> the<00:08:03.449> charge<00:08:03.720> controller<00:08:04.199> and

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:04.470 
solar in and the charge controller and

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.980 
solar in and the charge controller and
the<00:08:05.250> third<00:08:05.460> one<00:08:05.729> will<00:08:05.910> be<00:08:06.030> ground<00:08:06.330> to<00:08:06.630> trailer

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:06.990 
the third one will be ground to trailer

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.279 
the third one will be ground to trailer
frame<00:08:08.000> so<00:08:09.000> again<00:08:09.360> that's<00:08:09.539> a<00:08:09.690> ground<00:08:09.990> that's

00:08:10.279 --> 00:08:10.289 
frame so again that's a ground that's

00:08:10.289 --> 00:08:12.830 
frame so again that's a ground that's
just<00:08:10.560> grounding<00:08:10.979> the<00:08:11.130> frame<00:08:11.490> of<00:08:11.970> the<00:08:12.600> solar

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 
just grounding the frame of the solar

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:16.490 
just grounding the frame of the solar
panels<00:08:13.410> to<00:08:13.650> the<00:08:13.740> frame<00:08:13.979> of<00:08:14.190> the<00:08:14.280> trailer
