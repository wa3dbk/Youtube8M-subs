 little I'm increasing my muscle mass 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.740
 I was taking a merengada call 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:29.470
 jogging but I'm over too 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.490
 I'm taking amino acids in capsules 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.590
 the brand now 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.290
 says I should take four capsules 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.260
 after the exercise I just take one 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.989
 due to which I am afraid that I 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.020
 damage my health due to my age and my 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.879
 texture that I think I need to know 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.559
 what is your recommendation to take 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.900
 these pills taking into account my 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.720
 age and context when width of 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.019

 muscles a little help me please 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.210
 another thing I was thinking about taking crea 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.570
 they have capsules but none of your 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.000
 videos and network and recommend not to take it if 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.360
 have kidney problems I 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.480
 I suffer from kidney stone when I went to 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.840
 doctor was alone 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.700
 sand 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.859
 and it's going to accomplish a lot also is 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.460
 I need to know if you can recommend me 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:33.039
 take it and as you say in the video I take 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.229
 enough water I always do two liters 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.450
 newspapers please wait for your prompt 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.680
 response greetings from nation the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.260
 Thank you 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.850
 well many questions we are going to 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.390
 answer them all if we can before 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.180
 nothing the amino acid pills do not you 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.830
 they will do no harm to the body 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.600
 but the much that four capsules 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.030
 excessive if you have here is the point 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.860
 fundamental of the video of the letter of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.620
 everything that has to do with you and of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.390
 Many people who are in your position 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:08.860
 if you have any kind of kidney failure 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.880
 or kidney problems you have to monitor 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.880
 what you take 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.730
 the creatine as I tell you to take it 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.980
 I do not think I have much to give why 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 because I tell you that first of all and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.030
 I recommend to the people who 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.650
 have three or four times a week in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.380
 your position when you have problems 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.270
 I recommend you enter three 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.860
 days per week with four days of 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.540
 rest because I'm giving our 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.160
 recommendation because with that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.140
 recommendation to only train three 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.240
 times per week we only go to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.520
 need to take creatine three times 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.430
 per week instead of four what it gives you 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.960
 your kidneys four more days of rest 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.600
 I only recommend taking the 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.940
 creatine 3 to 5 grams in many 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.770
 Sometimes the position is 5 grams 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.920
 make sure you are 3 miss him 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.900
 of powder 3 grams after 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.520
 training only after 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.530
 training and only in days that 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.720
 enter the other 4 days I notice more 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.240
 creative 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.930
 two liters of water for up to one 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.520
 person who does not take creatine is very little 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.860
 for a person who does not take creatine 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.920
 you should be taking three or four 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.230
 liters of water per day if it is willing 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:23.870
 to drink six liters of water per day 6 if 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.090
 you're willing if you do not think that 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.760
 have trouble taking 3 grams of 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.680
 creatine after training but 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.160
 you have to drink 6 liters of water per 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.400
 day and the 4 days have full you can 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.140
 take three or four but you can not take 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.940
 two liters two liters is for a dog 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.920
 you are a human being you have to take 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.430
 at least three or four liters and that 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.410
 is without creatine with creatine 6 liters me 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.520
 I do not drink that much water but I do not 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.170
 I recommend to you if you want to be 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.310
 healthy and especially with your age 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.709
 you have to drink a lot of water 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.810
 the amino acid pills the truth 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.250
 is that he takes some pills after 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.130
 in the middle takes lara theater that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.349
 If you have kidney problems, you will have 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.110
 to choose what supplement you are going to take 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.120
 now the protein powders if they have 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.680
 an effect on the kidneys and if it has 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.680
 an effect on him 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.039
 the gastrointestinal system but more than 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.070
 nothing about the kidneys because a lot 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.400
 protein can affect you in that portion 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.590
 of the body 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.020
 get your food or you get your 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.840
 protein through food when it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.670
 finish the non-acid bottle you are not going to 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.490
 buy more 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.930
 and if you are going to take creatine do not take powder 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.610
 of proteins is going to be taken by the 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.650
 proteins do not take creatine do you have to 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.330
 choose one of the two supplements but 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.850
 about creatine that is the one 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.370
 affects the kidneys more than 3 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.990
 grams after training in 10 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.460
 that you train, I recommend you only 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.180
 between about three days per week 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.010
 dumbbells 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.530
 if you want to do cardio finish 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:00.050
 swimming the other days I do not care and 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.940
 protein powder no capsules to me 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.190
 like capsules will not acid 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.810
 I like creatine capsules 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.820
 they like the vitamin capsules we 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.430
 they like arginine capsules to me 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.650
 like for what to take and mix to me 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.770
 the capsules have never liked one 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.180
 he never knows what he's taking powder or 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.550
 foods 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.550
 Thanks and good luck brothers luck
