00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
ahead than they do but that's probably

your<00:01:33.659> only<00:01:33.689> advantage<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.770> fact<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.280> you're

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
your only advantage the fact is you're

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.480 
your only advantage the fact is you're
less<00:01:35.909> maneuverable<00:01:36.810> than<00:01:36.840> most<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:38.040> takes<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
less maneuverable than most it takes you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.450 
less maneuverable than most it takes you
longer<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.119> accelerate<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.200> stop<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
longer to accelerate and to stop and you

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
longer to accelerate and to stop and you
can't<00:01:41.790> react<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.450> quickly<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:43.049> unexpected

can't react as quickly to unexpected
conditions<00:01:44.570> that<00:01:45.570> means<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.079> must<00:01:46.229> allow<00:01:46.530> for

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
conditions that means you must allow for

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560 
conditions that means you must allow for
