00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
you can mod it isn't it's a really easy

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.330 
you can mod it isn't it's a really easy
mod<00:02:02.869> in<00:02:03.020> my<00:02:03.140> opinion<00:02:03.530> I'll<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.159> take<00:02:04.310> some

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
mod in my opinion I'll just take some

mod in my opinion I'll just take some
straps<00:02:04.820> and<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.390> fit<00:02:06.110> this<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.350> easily<00:02:06.740> so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
straps and you can fit this on easily so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.759 
straps and you can fit this on easily so
let's<00:02:07.280> take<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.549> look<00:02:07.700> at<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.939> actual<00:02:08.769> toy

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
let's take a look at the actual toy

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.289 
let's take a look at the actual toy
right<00:02:10.040> here

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
right here

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.630 
right here
there's<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.870> on/off<00:02:12.290> switch<00:02:12.620> is<00:02:12.650> really

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
there's the on/off switch is really

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.850 
there's the on/off switch is really
horribly<00:02:14.570> placed<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.200> wish<00:02:15.350> they<00:02:15.500> could<00:02:15.530> put<00:02:15.769> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
horribly placed I wish they could put it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.590 
horribly placed I wish they could put it
like<00:02:15.890> somewhere<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.549> back<00:02:16.790> near<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
like somewhere on the back near the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.500 
like somewhere on the back near the
battery<00:02:17.959> compartment<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.459> make<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> sound

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
battery compartment so I make a sound

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.690 
battery compartment so I make a sound
and<00:02:20.840> their<00:02:21.500> lights<00:02:21.769> are<00:02:21.920> right<00:02:22.040> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.519> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and their lights are right here and the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.759 
and their lights are right here and the
really<00:02:23.209> well<00:02:23.420> hidden<00:02:23.630> buttons<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.590> one

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
really well hidden buttons this one

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.949 
really well hidden buttons this one
doesn't<00:02:25.100> do<00:02:25.160> anything<00:02:25.519> does<00:02:25.820> just<00:02:26.180> there<00:02:26.600> but

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
doesn't do anything does just there but

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.780 
doesn't do anything does just there but
that<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.620> next<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:27.980> does

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that one next to it does

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.500 
that one next to it does
it'll<00:02:29.599> say<00:02:29.750> search<00:02:30.049> in<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.319> red<00:02:30.920> LED<00:02:31.430> will<00:02:31.700> come

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
it'll say search in a red LED will come

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.770 
it'll say search in a red LED will come
in<00:02:32.689> and<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.879> make<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:35.000> look<00:02:35.150> like<00:02:35.329> you're

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
in and and make it look like you're

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.130 
in and and make it look like you're
pointing<00:02:36.680> on<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.219> something<00:02:37.780> which<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.810> why<00:02:39.109> I

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
pointing on to something which is why I

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.449 
pointing on to something which is why I
think<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.439> gets<00:02:39.530> his<00:02:39.709> name<00:02:39.859> but<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
think it gets his name but this is

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.490 
think it gets his name but this is
actually<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:40.909> a<00:02:40.969> binocular<00:02:41.329> mode<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.170> can<00:02:42.319> you

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
actually in a binocular mode you can you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.179 
actually in a binocular mode you can you
know<00:02:42.620> look<00:02:43.280> into<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.790> oh<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.239> can<00:02:44.689> see<00:02:45.189> X

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
know look into it like oh I can see X

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:47.890 
know look into it like oh I can see X
person<00:02:46.640> over<00:02:46.819> there<00:02:46.939> I<00:02:46.970> guess<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.510> I'm<00:02:47.720> gonna

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
person over there I guess and I'm gonna

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.319 
person over there I guess and I'm gonna
attack<00:02:48.409> that<00:02:48.590> person<00:02:48.859> so<00:02:49.280> uh<00:02:49.310> how<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.120> works

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
attack that person so uh how this works

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.550 
attack that person so uh how this works
is<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.599> take<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:50.870> mission<00:02:51.140> memory<00:02:51.409> this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
is you take the mission memory this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.080 
is you take the mission memory this
mission<00:02:51.859> memory<00:02:52.099> is<00:02:52.159> actually<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.549> same<00:02:52.819> from

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
mission memory is actually the same from

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.349 
mission memory is actually the same from
the<00:02:53.180> shots<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.709> sticker<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.430> whatnot<00:02:56.120> so

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
they'll fly really far away it's almost

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.649 
they'll fly really far away it's almost
like<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> getting<00:03:19.040> hit<00:03:19.129> by<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.310> shotgun<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:20.299> close

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
like a getting hit by a shotgun at close

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.849 
like a getting hit by a shotgun at close
range<00:03:20.959> so<00:03:21.500> uh<00:03:21.639> how<00:03:22.639> do<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.760> put<00:03:22.909> this<00:03:23.030> on<00:03:23.209> as

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
range so uh how do you put this on as

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.099 
range so uh how do you put this on as
essentially<00:03:24.859> like<00:03:25.099> this<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:25.819> facing<00:03:26.510> down<00:03:26.689> so

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
essentially like this and facing down so

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.199 
essentially like this and facing down so
this<00:03:27.769> thing<00:03:27.980> will<00:03:28.189> shoot<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.819> beam<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.180> light

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
this thing will shoot a beam of light

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.000 
this thing will shoot a beam of light
and<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.769> kill<00:03:31.220> you<00:03:31.370> and<00:03:31.609> turn<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.840> dust

and and kill you and turn you to dust
like<00:03:34.010> those<00:03:34.159> over<00:03:34.459> Notts<00:03:34.609> so<00:03:35.180> that's<00:03:35.449> pretty

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
like those over Notts so that's pretty

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.920 
like those over Notts so that's pretty
much<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.229> this<00:03:36.349> uh<00:03:36.579> there's<00:03:37.579> really<00:03:37.930> really

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
much it this uh there's really really

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.539 
much it this uh there's really really
much<00:03:39.139> to<00:03:39.379> this<00:03:39.500> at<00:03:39.709> all<00:03:39.889> so<00:03:40.129> if<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.340> want<00:03:40.519> to

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
much to this at all so if you want to

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.069 
much to this at all so if you want to
transform<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.150> back<00:03:41.389> it's<00:03:41.659> just<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.959> this

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
transform this back it's just like this

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.930 
transform this back it's just like this
and<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.349> pull<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.650> out<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:42.949> it<00:03:43.430> will<00:03:43.489> lock<00:03:43.790> it

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
and you pull it out and it will lock it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.479 
and you pull it out and it will lock it
back<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.120> place<00:03:44.299> just<00:03:44.810> don't<00:03:45.560> try<00:03:45.739> to<00:03:45.799> push<00:03:46.340> it

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
back in place just don't try to push it

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.059 
back in place just don't try to push it
out<00:03:46.669> it<00:03:47.299> might<00:03:47.540> break<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.019> so<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.349> always<00:03:48.680> have

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
out it might break it so you always have

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.979 
out it might break it so you always have
would<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.760> put<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.150> omission<00:03:50.540> memory<00:03:50.840> in

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
would have to put the omission memory in

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.509 
would have to put the omission memory in
there<00:03:51.199> now<00:03:51.889> if<00:03:51.979> you're<00:03:52.099> wanting<00:03:52.310> what<00:03:52.430> the

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
there now if you're wanting what the

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.789 
there now if you're wanting what the
mission<00:03:52.819> memory<00:03:53.120> looks<00:03:53.359> like<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.260> the

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
mission memory looks like the one the

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.500 
mission memory looks like the one the
mission<00:03:55.069> memory<00:03:55.310> from<00:03:55.519> because<00:03:55.879> a<00:03:55.909> driver<00:03:56.239> you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
mission memory from because a driver you

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.949 
mission memory from because a driver you
can<00:03:56.629> put<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:56.930> one<00:03:57.139> in<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:59.269> looks<00:03:59.479> a<00:03:59.750> little

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
can put this one in it looks a little

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.199 
can put this one in it looks a little
bit<00:04:00.109> better<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.379> it<00:04:00.650> but<00:04:00.889> uh<00:04:00.919> different<00:04:01.609> paints

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
bit better on it but uh different paints

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.180 
bit better on it but uh different paints
different<00:04:02.750> colors<00:04:03.079> so<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.620> cannot<00:04:03.859> take<00:04:04.099> this

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
different colors so you cannot take this

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.559 
different colors so you cannot take this
one<00:04:04.400> palette<00:04:04.699> and<00:04:04.940> uh<00:04:05.169> that's<00:04:06.169> pretty<00:04:06.379> much<00:04:06.500> it

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
one palette and uh that's pretty much it

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.210 
one palette and uh that's pretty much it
so<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.629> sums<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.260> Kaiser<00:04:09.590> pointer<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.190> a

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
so to sums up the Kaiser pointer is a

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.099 
so to sums up the Kaiser pointer is a
pretty<00:04:10.669> cool<00:04:10.849> toy<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.359> my<00:04:11.479> opinion<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:11.959> it's

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
pretty cool toy in my opinion but it's

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.409 
pretty cool toy in my opinion but it's
okay<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:13.159> not<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.400> best<00:04:13.790> but<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.239> want

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
okay it's not the best but if you want

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.149 
okay it's not the best but if you want
to<00:04:14.510> complete<00:04:14.840> your<00:04:14.870> collection<00:04:15.169> for<00:04:16.010> your

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
to complete your collection for your

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
belts for your Kaiser driver this is a

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.800 
belts for your Kaiser driver this is a
definite<00:04:19.459> must<00:04:19.489> since<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.180> does<00:04:20.389> come<00:04:20.599> with<00:04:20.690> an

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
definite must since it does come with an

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.330 
definite must since it does come with an
extra<00:04:21.019> slot<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.650> fit<00:04:21.889> this<00:04:21.979> on<00:04:22.159> the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
extra slot so you can fit this on the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.670 
extra slot so you can fit this on the
back<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.970> make<00:04:23.449> it<00:04:23.479> look<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.990> little<00:04:24.320> bit<00:04:24.530> more

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
back and make it look a little bit more

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.710 
back and make it look a little bit more
show<00:04:24.949> accurate<00:04:25.159> in<00:04:25.430> my<00:04:25.580> opinion<00:04:26.090> but<00:04:26.479> other

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
show accurate in my opinion but other

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.839 
show accurate in my opinion but other
than<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.930> there's<00:04:27.830> not<00:04:28.009> really<00:04:28.250> much<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.520> it

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
than that there's not really much to it

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.600 
than that there's not really much to it
now<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:29.659> being<00:04:29.900> Korean<00:04:30.349> is<00:04:30.560> no<00:04:31.159> different

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
now this being Korean is no different

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.730 
now this being Korean is no different
than<00:04:31.849> the<00:04:32.030> Japanese<00:04:32.539> version<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.259> just<00:04:33.650> a

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
than the Japanese version is just a

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.450 
than the Japanese version is just a
repackaged<00:04:34.580> toy<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.960> Korean<00:04:36.320> box<00:04:36.590> so<00:04:37.159> if
