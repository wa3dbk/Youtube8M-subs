of<00:00:38.430> research<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.620> talking<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.190> well

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
of research a lot of talking as well

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.880 
of research a lot of talking as well
because<00:00:42.020> we<00:00:43.020> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> appropriate<00:00:43.710> something

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
because we need to appropriate something

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.400 
because we need to appropriate something
that<00:00:44.190> we'd<00:00:44.399> never<00:00:44.670> see<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.930> very

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that we'd never see and it's very

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we'd never see and it's very
important<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.190> talk<00:00:47.340> with<00:00:47.579> people<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
important that to talk with people to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.049 
important that to talk with people to
have<00:00:48.360> another<00:00:49.100> perception<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.610> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
have another perception of this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.660 
have another perception of this
signature<00:00:51.510> Dom<00:00:51.809> because<00:00:52.399> when<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.520> are

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
signature Dom because when we are

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.080 
signature Dom because when we are
creating<00:00:54.120> game<00:00:54.660> you're<00:00:55.079> giving<00:00:55.800> emotions<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
creating game you're giving emotions to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
creating game you're giving emotions to
the<00:00:57.210> player<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:59.070> are<00:00:59.280> creating

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the player that's what we are creating

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.479 
the player that's what we are creating
some<00:01:00.030> unique<00:01:00.719> talent<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.039> want<00:01:02.250> to

your research

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.980 
your research
yeah<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.570> mostly<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.170> same<00:01:35.990> nothing's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
yeah but it's mostly the same nothing's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.710 
yeah but it's mostly the same nothing's
not<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> problematic<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.970> easily

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
not a problematic because we can easily

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.249 
not a problematic because we can easily
found<00:01:40.229> some<00:01:40.740> references<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.570> most<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
found some references but most of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.179 
found some references but most of the
artists<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.790> same<00:01:46.310> research<00:01:48.740> that's<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
artists is the same research that's like

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
artists is the same research that's like
I<00:01:50.430> did<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> dirt<00:01:51.210> road<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.259> yeah<00:01:52.590> but

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I did for the dirt road on but yeah but

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.030 
I did for the dirt road on but yeah but
for<00:01:53.070> sure<00:01:53.220> now<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.689> see<00:01:54.689> yesterday<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.409> like

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
for sure now I see yesterday I just like

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.810 
for sure now I see yesterday I just like
yes<00:01:56.549> before<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:58.020> give<00:01:59.009> me<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.369> key<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
yes before it was give me more key to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.819 
yes before it was give me more key to
recreate<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> decided<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.259> kind<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
recreate but I decided is kind of a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.459 
recreate but I decided is kind of a
drill<00:02:02.340> yeah<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.329> course

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
drill yeah of course

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.200 
drill yeah of course
you<00:02:05.009> mentioned<00:02:05.460> yesterday<00:02:05.850> actually

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you mentioned yesterday actually

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.340 
you mentioned yesterday actually
something<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.780> thought<00:02:06.990> was<00:02:07.140> really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
something I thought was really

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770 
something I thought was really
interesting<00:02:07.469> which<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.759> lot<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
interesting which is that a lot of the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.390 
interesting which is that a lot of the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
I've seen I mean it does look extremely

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370 
I've seen I mean it does look extremely
similar<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.940> no<00:02:48.210> Saddam<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.720> real<00:02:48.900> life

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
similar to the no Saddam in real life

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.950 
similar to the no Saddam in real life
what<00:02:49.890> exactly<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.400> different<00:02:50.910> about<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.330> yeah

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
what exactly is different about it yeah

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.140 
what exactly is different about it yeah
it's<00:02:52.170> just<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.440> way<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> perception<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:53.790> we

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
it's just a way of perception because we

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.970 
it's just a way of perception because we
give<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> illusion<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.410> same<00:02:55.650> like

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
give the illusion that is the same like

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
no Dom is it seems like it's one of the

no Dom is it seems like it's one of the
bigger<00:03:43.320> parts<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> game<00:03:44.310> how<00:03:44.880> exactly

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
bigger parts of the game how exactly

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
complexity of the architecture the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.730 
complexity of the architecture the
feeling<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:31.070> have<00:05:31.849> when<00:05:31.880> I<00:05:32.240> see<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:33.500> the
