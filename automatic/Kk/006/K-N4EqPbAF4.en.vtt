00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
then I didn't take up this project I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
then I didn't take up this project I
just<00:02:43.409> have<00:02:44.359> any<00:02:45.359> any<00:02:46.019> positive<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.040> keep<00:02:47.220> going

enclosure the music has a record drive
here's<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.780> secret<00:03:04.159> connection<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
here's the secret connection when you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.089 
here's the secret connection when you
take<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.900> out<00:03:07.019> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.260> just<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.920> in

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
take it out you can just put it in

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.539 
take it out you can just put it in
another<00:03:08.400> enclosure<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.359> use<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.340> that's

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
another enclosure and use it and that's

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.440 
another enclosure and use it and that's
how<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.790> works

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
how that works
