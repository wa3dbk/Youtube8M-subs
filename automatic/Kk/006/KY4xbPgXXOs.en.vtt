I'm<00:01:51.149> playing<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.479> helps<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.320> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I'm playing it helps a lot for me for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.039 
I'm playing it helps a lot for me for
FPS<00:01:52.860> games<00:01:53.159> they<00:01:53.670> feel<00:01:53.939> nice<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
FPS games they feel nice the thing that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.330 
FPS games they feel nice the thing that
I<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> best<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> said<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> second<00:01:56.280> ago

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
I like the best like I said a second ago

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.359 
I like the best like I said a second ago
is<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.329> creates<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.229> flat<00:01:58.500> surface<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:59.219> maybe

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
is it creates a flat surface or maybe

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
is it creates a flat surface or maybe
even<00:01:59.430> goes<00:01:59.700> over<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.299> don't<00:02:00.509> really

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
even goes over because I don't really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.030 
even goes over because I don't really
like<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.500> thing<00:02:01.680> i<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.950> about

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
like the one thing i don't like about

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
like the one thing i don't like about
these<00:02:02.399> controllers<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.719> analog<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
these controllers is in the analog the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.140 
these controllers is in the analog the
analog<00:02:04.920> dips<00:02:05.219> down

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
analog dips down

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.210 
analog dips down
big<00:02:06.330> fan<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.350> old<00:02:07.380> Duke<00:02:07.710> controllers<00:02:08.160> from

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
big fan of the old Duke controllers from

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.590 
big fan of the old Duke controllers from
the<00:02:08.369> Xbox<00:02:08.790> because<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
the Xbox because they actually the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600 
the Xbox because they actually the
analog<00:02:09.960> bubbles<00:02:10.680> up<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.100> bit<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.520> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
analog bubbles up a little bit so it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
analog bubbles up a little bit so it
feels<00:02:11.760> nice<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.540> fingers<00:02:12.900> when<00:02:13.440> I'm<00:02:13.530> going

it's very affordable for everybody what
I<00:02:34.740> say<00:02:34.980> they're<00:02:35.190> extremely<00:02:35.640> useful<00:02:35.970> or

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I say they're extremely useful or

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.600 
I say they're extremely useful or
useless<00:02:36.330> know<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.320> depends<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> take

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
useless know it depends on what you take

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.570 
useless know it depends on what you take
out<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.630> do<00:02:40.620> help<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> nice

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
different colors to you can get a lots

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.980 
different colors to you can get a lots
of<00:02:49.470> different<00:02:49.709> colors<00:02:50.010> blue<00:02:50.310> black<00:02:50.760> red<00:02:50.990> comes

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
all I would say that it does help if you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.680 
all I would say that it does help if you
want<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.459> bit<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.820> grip<00:02:57.209> extra<00:02:57.570> grip

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
want a little bit of a grip extra grip

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.090 
want a little bit of a grip extra grip
on<00:02:57.900> your<00:02:58.020> analog<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:58.590> they<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.860> tend<00:02:59.010> to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
on your analog because they can tend to

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.800 
on your analog because they can tend to
be<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.340> slick<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.940> over<00:03:00.150> time<00:03:00.330> they<00:03:00.600> can

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
be a little slick and over time they can

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.270 
be a little slick and over time they can
get<00:03:00.930> they'll<00:03:01.200> greasy<00:03:01.620> or<00:03:01.709> sleep<00:03:01.920> or<00:03:02.010> whatever

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
get they'll greasy or sleep or whatever

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.130 
get they'll greasy or sleep or whatever
so<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:02.850> do<00:03:02.910> cover<00:03:03.209> your<00:03:03.420> analog<00:03:03.690> pretty<00:03:03.959> well

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
so they do cover your analog pretty well

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.470 
so they do cover your analog pretty well
and<00:03:04.260> help<00:03:04.470> out<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.030> fact<00:03:06.209> that

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and help out I do like the fact that

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.900 
and help out I do like the fact that
does<00:03:06.720> create<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:07.020> nice<00:03:07.170> flat<00:03:07.530> surface<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
does create a nice flat surface with the

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.180 
does create a nice flat surface with the
dip<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:09.450> especially<00:03:10.080> on<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.410> PlayStation<00:03:10.920> 3

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
dip and especially on the PlayStation 3

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.130 
dip and especially on the PlayStation 3
since<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.489> PlayStation<00:03:12.030> 3<00:03:12.269> does<00:03:12.450> flex<00:03:12.750> over

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
since the PlayStation 3 does flex over

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.410 
since the PlayStation 3 does flex over
it<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.709> covers<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.010> nice<00:03:14.220> grip<00:03:14.760> area<00:03:15.030> on<00:03:15.180> there

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
it just covers a nice grip area on there

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.370 
it just covers a nice grip area on there
and<00:03:17.239> basically<00:03:18.239> anybody<00:03:18.690> can<00:03:18.959> enjoy<00:03:19.200> them

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
and basically anybody can enjoy them

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.840 
and basically anybody can enjoy them
it's<00:03:19.590> good<00:03:19.800> for<00:03:19.950> everybody<00:03:20.010> they're<00:03:20.610> cheap

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
it's good for everybody they're cheap
