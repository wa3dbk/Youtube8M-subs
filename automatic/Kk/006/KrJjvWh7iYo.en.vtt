order to reach that high of damage
you're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.330> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.780> after<00:00:43.260> his

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you're going to have to do it after his

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.180 
you're going to have to do it after his
powerup<00:00:44.730> move<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.239> down<00:00:45.630> down<00:00:45.840> 3<00:00:46.230> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
powerup move which is down down 3 and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.820 
powerup move which is down down 3 and
what<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.580> does<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.330> takes<00:00:48.620> you<00:00:49.620> can

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
what this does is it takes you can

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.190 
what this does is it takes you can
cancel<00:00:50.580> out<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:50.940> too<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:51.540> it<00:00:51.660> does<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
cancel out of it too but what it does is

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.350 
cancel out of it too but what it does is
it<00:00:52.470> takes<00:00:53.000> point<00:00:54.000> 5<00:00:54.210> percent<00:00:55.519> every<00:00:56.519> about

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it takes point 5 percent every about

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.200 
it takes point 5 percent every about
half<00:00:57.660> second<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.769> about<00:00:58.980> 1%<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.790> second

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
half second so it's about 1% a second

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.509 
half second so it's about 1% a second
but<00:01:00.839> what<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.110> does<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.470> it<00:01:01.589> increases<00:01:01.710> your

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
but what it does is it increases your

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.690 
but what it does is it increases your
damage<00:01:02.780> pretty<00:01:03.780> drastically<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
damage pretty drastically so from the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
damage pretty drastically so from the
power<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.090> state<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> jump<00:01:07.230> in
