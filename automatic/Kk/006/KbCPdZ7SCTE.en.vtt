kind of phenomenologically into it and

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080 
kind of phenomenologically into it and
why<00:06:42.199> five<00:06:42.440> five<00:06:42.650> five<00:06:42.830> what<00:06:43.430> happens<00:06:43.820> when<00:06:44.000> you

why five five five what happens when you

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.760 
why five five five what happens when you
add<00:06:44.240> modifiers<00:06:44.810> you<00:06:45.110> add<00:06:45.470> syllables

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
add modifiers you add syllables

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.990 
add modifiers you add syllables
modifiers<00:06:48.770> in<00:06:48.949> creates<00:06:49.250> the<00:06:49.340> syllable<00:06:49.759> and

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
modifiers in creates the syllable and

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.499 
modifiers in creates the syllable and
they<00:06:50.780> increase<00:06:51.110> the<00:06:51.320> noise<00:06:51.820> it<00:06:52.820> takes<00:06:53.150> more

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:53.509 
they increase the noise it takes more

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.590 
they increase the noise it takes more
syllables<00:06:54.199> more<00:06:54.680> time<00:06:55.039> more<00:06:55.820> bumps<00:06:56.300> in<00:06:56.449> the

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
syllables more time more bumps in the

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.990 
syllables more time more bumps in the
vent<00:06:56.840> in<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.020> consonants<00:06:57.680> to<00:06:58.280> say<00:06:58.490> the<00:06:58.699> same

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
vent in the consonants to say the same

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.560 
vent in the consonants to say the same
thing<00:06:59.570> and<00:07:00.160> so<00:07:01.160> the<00:07:01.190> interest<00:07:01.820> level<00:07:01.910> first

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:02.570 
thing and so the interest level first

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.750 
thing and so the interest level first
syllable<00:07:02.960> gets<00:07:03.350> dragged<00:07:03.800> out<00:07:04.130> watered<00:07:04.729> down

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
syllable gets dragged out watered down

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.350
