00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.330
 all major television manufacturers now have 4k televisions as top models 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.899
 in their range 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.249
 but because the fleet still shows very little where the fans watch 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:16.720
 falls 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.720
 a few years to come for a major vita breakthrough 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.390
 even if you do not want mrd TV 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.780
 with the arrival of good news because the prices of the HD top models thereby 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.679
 have become lower 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.289
 in this video looks ahead to the top model 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.289
 the 55 inception i at 9 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.730
 it is 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.530
 the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.530
 stop it 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.140
 9 series is available in sizes 40 46 and 55 ins 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 the smallest model costs just over a thousand euros 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.290
 we have what we viewed the 55 in skoft about 900 euros 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.890
 almost all features that are on the more expensive x 9 series are also on the roads 9 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.380
 main difference is that no 4k screen is used but just 19 20 at 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.170
 1080 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.420
 full hd screen 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.650
 Another difference with the x 9 series is the placement of the speakers 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.320
 not everyone designs the x79 in a prominent place next to the screens 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.560
 equally beautiful 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.049
 both legs egypt speakers neatly concealed at the bottom 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.550
 the design of the wine nine can be very successful 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.930
 narrow brushes made of brushed metal 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.150
 give the television and sleek appearance 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.350
 the edges of the television give a very distinct blue-green shine 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 the base has a chrome finish that gives the television a luxurious feel 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.770
 the only downside to the design is the emissions we do not 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.670
 bottom of the screen with optional logo 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.640
 the display is a bit of a big customer and therefore does a bit 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.640
 prejudice to the otherwise sleek design 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.030
 get from sony 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.159
 two distances hereby win 9 old-fashioned infrared as the loan 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.700
 that looks a bit dated in design 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.060
 and a modern smaller one because two points 4 data fell out of the lock 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.360
 plants with the television 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.059
 sony has provided a warm home with only the most essential buttons 

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:13.929
 so actually a bit of a disadvantage of the device according to it 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.019
 for example, no new button at all 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.560
 enter channel numbers 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.010
 being via an onscreen now selecting an external input should already be through it 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 menu which we consider the old-fashioned infrared as a piece 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.309
 find work more pleasant 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.269
 it should be possible to operate the television with a cap on you 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.729
 smartphone or tablet 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.099
 it will actually only get months of talking to a sony xperia 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.609
 all other devices that have tried including a mini retina exit 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.299
 and set the sony experience 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.089
 could not find the television via the network 

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:47.389
 even if we do it does not think it will add much 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:49.779
 and they have TV guide that can be useful 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.129
 but watching television via the N14 is not possible at all 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.339
 also the smart part of the television but not very much impression 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.279
 for many people it would be an advantage that an effect on television 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.269
 is available 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.289
 but most other ebs are not very interesting 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.359
 and its operation could always have been a little different 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.779
 Sony has provided the television with so-called long-dive speakers 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.359
 and they must then again provide a better bundle 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.850
 yet the bass response is not very impressive 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.720
 the speakers know when to get nice volume without the sound 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.279
 sounds upset 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.949
 but because the speakers are pointing downwards 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.390
 and not on your ears 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.490
 you actually only hear indirect sound and that is disadvantageous again 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.299
 the stereo playback 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.089
 the sound is therefore not much better than the 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:34.879
 most flat televisions 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.349
 where we are impressing many countries is the low input leak 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.789
 input tastiest time in television needs to display an image quickly 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.749
 because the television the long over by playing an accident on the television 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.309
 more difficult sony has understood as making the pvz consuls what fairground want 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:51.819
 a low input leak 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.989
 and nine of them have a good input from fewer than 20 people 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:55.979
 could 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.299
 most other televisions then soon one and a half to twice the half 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.129
 display round game images 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.929
 the image quality of the wheem 9 is excellent 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:09.119
 The contrast is good for an LCD TV though do plasma and only TV is it 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:10.659
 better at this point 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.420
 thanks to sony's three pupils as a berkel, television is very popular 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.189
 were displaying colors 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.689
 If the television is a whole color range, users simply leave it too much 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:20.959
 color an image 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.819
 the colors are also on the cool side 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.180
 with the right setting you can fine the television with the correct colors 

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:28.309
 have it displayed 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.309
 we must have written before the break 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.369
 The victory has big plans and many cyclists expected it 

00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:41.159
 nice finish 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.479
 with the right settings, television gives a beautiful image and it too 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.389
 noise can easily compete with the competition 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.039
 the ministry with here and there some handy skills and they also made four 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.779
 didn't ask so much 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.009
 But in terms of working life I have to win a very good one 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:57.469
 performance 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.789
 such a 9 is one of the 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.009
 button televisions for the rest of this moment
