00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.899
 we are already at the asus stand and 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.160
 we want to present to you on this occasion 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.960
 of the terminals that has most called us 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 the attention of this fair we are 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.679
 talking about the cen funds a device 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.360
 that was already presented a couple of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.220
 months but we did not want to lose the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 opportunity to show you how it counts 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.090
 with a specification of myocardial and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.680
 also with a design that goes quite 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.600
 well for the eyes so much for the part 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.750
 frontal as well as on the other hand 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 back that as you can see has 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 a pretty premium finish 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 if we talk about design precisely 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.469
 we can see that he has the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 Volume buttons on the back 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.540
 to the purest 'style the axis ahead 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.489
 we would have the menu buttons of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 pretty accessible navigation all 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.760
 them and the most important thing is that they are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.489
 off the screen in such a way that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 we can enjoy the whole screen in 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.570
 its fullness also comment that the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.079
 edges the frames are quite narrow 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.719
 and that allows us to have a broad management 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.750
 of the entire screen the only one that hits 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.059
 that we see the design would be rather the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.019
 unlock button as you see is in the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.719
 upper part 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.460
 prevents us from having obvious access to 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:11.439
 the right part that would be the most comfortable 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.750
 and we have to make a small turn of 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.060
 doll to be able to access it from all 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.640
 modes if we are also using the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.289
 Volume buttons will not be too much 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.200
 uncomfortable but luckily also 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.670
 has a mode similar to the axis 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 as for unlocking with a double 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560
 touch on the screen as we said a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.899
 pretty fine and elegant design and with a 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.209
 very very premium finish at the level of 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.939
 spectacular specifications we have 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.569
 that highlight the 5.5-inch screen 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.399
 and full hd resolution that will show us 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.970
 the contents in a spectacular way 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.860
 At the performance level, it does not leave anything 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.780
 nothing at random we are talking about a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.720
 device that has an intel atom 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.539
 64 bits to 4 cores of 233 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.459
 gigahertz that next to its 4 gb of 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.530
 ram memory we remember the first 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.420
 device in integrating this this 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.369
 ram memory capacity next to this 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.140
 ram memory allows us to have a 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.539
 completely fluid device like 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.039
 you see in no time we stop and 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.899
 we can have a thousand applications open 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.960
 that the performance will remain 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.840
 spectacular 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.730
 at camera level we have a camera 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 quite powerful in the back 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 we have a 13 megapixel camera with 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.950
 a sensor capable of capturing 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.660
 photographs with very little light is true 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.820
 find the level of detail quite 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.160
 even in low light on the part 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.630
 front we have 5 megapixels with a 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.460
 angulation of 85 degrees or the halt by 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.170
 last comment that at the level of 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.640
 specifications has 3000 milliamps 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.280
 of battery and 16 32 and 64 gb of 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.110
 storage all this translates into 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.820
 a terminal with a great relationship 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.110
 quality-price one of the best 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.620
 we are talking about a terminal that 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.990
 could not go around the 199 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.610
 dollars in the US market is 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.070
 say that if it reaches the European market 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.170
 could be maybe around 250 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.670
 euros in its free version in such a way 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.730
 we are talking about a device 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.370
 colossal at a fairly acceptable price and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.600
 quite affordable for many pockets 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.880
 and this is all on our part we 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.800
 we say goodbye from the asus stand 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.240
 not without telling you to subscribe to 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.890

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.210
