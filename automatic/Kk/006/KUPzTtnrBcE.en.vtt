sweet<00:03:37.739> slow<00:03:38.010> mo<00:03:38.160> head<00:03:38.310> shots<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.880> also<00:03:39.420> really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
sweet slow mo head shots I also really

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.449 
sweet slow mo head shots I also really
like<00:03:40.050> that<00:03:40.200> they<00:03:40.319> incorporated<00:03:40.860> both<00:03:41.130> close

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
like that they incorporated both close

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.280 
like that they incorporated both close
quarters<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:41.940> long-range<00:03:42.630> combat<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
quarters and long-range combat in the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.570 
quarters and long-range combat in the
multiplayer<00:03:43.680> maps<00:03:44.010> because<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.340> feel<00:03:44.549> like

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
multiplayer maps because I feel like

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.949 
multiplayer maps because I feel like
they<00:03:44.880> need<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.209> have<00:03:45.360> that<00:03:45.390> kind<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.780> dynamic

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
they need to have that kind of dynamic

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.199 
they need to have that kind of dynamic
in<00:03:46.380> order<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.709> keep<00:03:46.890> their<00:03:47.069> audience<00:03:47.430> together

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
in order to keep their audience together

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.059 
in order to keep their audience together
because<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.840> feel<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.830> some<00:03:50.040> people

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
because I feel like you know some people

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.580 
because I feel like you know some people
prefer<00:03:50.489> really<00:03:50.850> long<00:03:51.030> range<00:03:51.299> wraps<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.500> other

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
prefer really long range wraps and other

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.320 
prefer really long range wraps and other
people<00:03:52.980> prefer<00:03:53.370> really<00:03:53.730> close<00:03:53.910> quarters<00:03:54.299> and

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
people prefer really close quarters and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.030 
people prefer really close quarters and
it<00:03:54.540> definitely<00:03:54.720> separates<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.830> know<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
it definitely separates you know the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.530 
it definitely separates you know the
players<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.610> that's<00:03:56.730> obviously<00:03:56.880> not<00:03:57.209> good

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
players and that's obviously not good

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.150 
players and that's obviously not good
for<00:03:57.690> multiplayer<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.410> speaking<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.799> being<00:03:58.980> bad

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
for multiplayer so speaking of being bad

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.559 
for multiplayer so speaking of being bad
for<00:03:59.370> multiplayer<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.970> biggest<00:04:00.269> problems

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569
