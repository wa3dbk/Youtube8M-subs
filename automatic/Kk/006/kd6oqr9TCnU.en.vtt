00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 even some time ago it was picked up by rai 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.940
 3 on report a very discussion 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.740
 interested in coffee quality 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.559
 I came to open 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.810
 guide by andrea cherubini with a 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.660
 simple reason that he is a lover 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.570
 researcher and as you can see from the writing 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.970
 that life framed at the beginning yes 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.919
 specifies that cafe serves in this 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.590
 package because coffee costs 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:32.800
 but for all times it is the same 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.460
 heard a bitter 1 scialacqua was andrea 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.580
 70 differences between so many coffee veil yes 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.589
 scappa is a blend of coffee blend 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.629
 coffee means putting one together 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.360
 series of beans from the world 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.479
 with the same name or maybe but the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.239
 quality can vary and in the quality of 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:55.750
 hidden in the sense that the Arabica are there 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.879
 of practice is a typical different reason 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.330
 Arabs who give an example of wine 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.010
 yes the same various types of wines can 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.890
 the same vine must be composed but if 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.939
 invite him the earth comes from montalcino 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.460
 if it comes from the room how to make onions 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.920
 of tropea from us have the form of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.829
 those right mass but will be 10 then yes 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.710
 they know about the drones so it comes this way 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.950
 even poor even so but then the st 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.770
 definitely much later 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.380
 in toasting in processing 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.630
 then the extraction 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 in the cup means a procedure could have been done 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.729
 the methods of the car's police is 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.049
 all of a certain way the grinding 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.990
 water then the water collection 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.000
 anesa of miller mineral salts and all 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.070
 a set procedure that if a method that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.369
 exceeds ends no passage is exalted 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.090
 is badly done certainly prejudice 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 the quality carlos with me since you will 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.649
 proud of not being part of bad coffee 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 no no no no I don't pride myself for not 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.480
 brag despite 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.370
 now sees the modesty screen model 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.740
 imbeciles and I say then we will know 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.170
 to create but it is necessary to recognize a thing 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.060
 I like it for all these things but then 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.100
 after there is stefano that our basin 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 that puts them into practice because stefano 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.520
 when we see examples but 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.970
 because it's me 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.670
 and why not daddy that makes you laugh that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.890
 to apologize for example a question 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.580
 because every time you interview yourself 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.470
 rededicated to clarify is indeed true that 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.040
 let him be public if he ever could 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.010
 he had said he was and then here at the opera a 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.909
 part all the jokes because coffee 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.250
 it's good 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.710
 we have a mixture of a team and a factor 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.020
 here local 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.570
 for modest I must say a well-known il 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.010
 product surely and then for the whole 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.660
 supply chain for that protocol that we 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.790
 we use that is then available for 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.040
 all and more personally checks 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.560
 because only you are at dinner 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.890
 together and he still at dinner time 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.010
 checks on his premises but 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:09.250
 I believe that it is normal in the activities 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:11.020
 those of being verified 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.690
 especially the critics never be 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.150
 convinced to get the most out of one 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.710
 of the problems of us Italians above all 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.360
 with this case of coffee we are like 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.150
 Italian we are united and Italian coffee is 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.640
 good for Italian very often it is not 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.940
 done well therefore perego but never 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.610
 having a break, maybe go to a bar 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.410
 and ask a question is a question you can 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.360
 make one who takes a coffee to see 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.430
 they make good coffee 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.950
 but I can give you an answer is from 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.450
 come to us to apologize I do n't know 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.200
 one more than the devil look also 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.600
 how many canon variants these cursed 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.940
 greasers the Italian people is 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.090
 fattened he likes his past 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.460
 yes well then even the coffee 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.140
 you have this certainty and I can't 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.080
 guarantee because you know that it goes to 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.440
 I don't tell lies beyond advertisements 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.030
 leisure that you feel in so many places e 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.250
 that is your coast as much as from the others 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.970
 leave then why go to kisses 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.970
 private 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.220
 if it does not cancel I leave it out and how 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.220
 the ham the other on a pound and a half
