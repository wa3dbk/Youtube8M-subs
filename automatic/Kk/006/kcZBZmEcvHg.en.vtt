 google redeem them a resident time 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.700
 since it is a community app 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.290
 it's also about participating and it's about

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.770
 in the wake of wells for those who 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.020
 take transport more often than 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.960
 common as the car I advise you 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.280
 to download the move it car application 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 its principle is the same as that of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.060
 wayne community application so 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.410
 each user can signal to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 other the influx in transport 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.410
 he takes

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.890
 and wheelchair access well 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.480
 obviously at the move it is also a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.890
 route calculator that goes so 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.819
 for each of your trips you 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.620
 indicate the different paths 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.090
 possible depending on your art of 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.980

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.810
 and if you want to take a bus a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.890

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.799
 it makes you want to travel in the end the 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.299
 the only criticisms that can be formulated 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.730
 against this application 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.980
 first the quality of his cards with 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.079
 street names upside down according to their 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.030
 directions and then his lack of 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.250
 windows phone marketplace 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.340

 Free 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.940
 nick so now on iphone but 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.940
 still available on android 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.660
 I would now like to introduce a 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.690
 new game for iphone especially 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.700
 successful this is darkling in this 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.350
 endless survival game that is taking place 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.420
 in a totally imaginary world 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.000
 clash with light and darkness 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.820
 so I explain in dark times 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.960
 you play as light and this at 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.300
 through a small luminous character 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.970
 lights that needs to eliminate demonstrates everything 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.550
 black the darling who embody them 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.320
 the darkness and to eliminate them it's 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.480
 just simple each of these darkling 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.850
 sports on his forehead a luminous symbol 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.640
 that you will have to reproduce with your 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.320
 finger on the screen of your iphone then 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.030
 at first it seems simple but the 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.100
 things get tough very quickly because at each 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.750
 once you eliminate a dark line you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.450
 lose stars that you have to 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.250
 recover by catching them on the fly 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.890
 and then dragging them on your 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.200
 character and philemon are made more 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.000
 in more and then there are the super 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.160
 no what to eliminate by following a 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.810
 different instructions each time 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.280
 in short everything is not so simple in the country 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.570
 the darkling but the game is very 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.370
 addictive as much as the graphics 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.440
 are really very successful and 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.060
 the excellent soundtrack of the game listened 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.220
 with a helmet adds to the atmosphere 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.750
 disturbing and mesmerizing 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.280
 here we are only sorry that 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.290
 darkling this is only available for the 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.820
 moment that on iphone and we regret it 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.820
 especially since it is free 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.540
 last week I introduced you 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.669

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.250
 musical mix and following that Baptist who 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:43.669
 will recognize himself hand suggested on twitter 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.050
 to talk about drum not 24 who is not 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.460
 a competitor deejing is rather a 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.110
 complementary applications since 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.210

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.070
 for your smartphone or tablet 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.110
 an application that is therefore for 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.280
 musicians but not only since 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.050

 good time I assure you that nothing 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.590
 to know the music we come when 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.919
 even to compose small streets rather 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.919
 friendly 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.639
 I 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.639
 fire 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.200
 good it's not mozart but when 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.020
 not even bad episode use is 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.700
 simple when you launch drum pad 24

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.540
 color squares that match 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.100
 each a prerecorded sounds only remains 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.900
 more than to string them together by strumming on 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.030
 your smartphone you can even play 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.400
