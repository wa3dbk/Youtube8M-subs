going to take that yeah i'll probably
decide<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> time<00:01:49.170> because<00:01:49.680> i<00:01:49.860> don't<00:01:50.040> think

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
decide at the time because i don't think

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.649 
decide at the time because i don't think
it's<00:01:50.340> something<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:50.790> particularly<00:01:51.360> want

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
it's something that i particularly want

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.870 
it's something that i particularly want
to<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.799> i<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.070> i'll<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.369> experience

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to do but i think i'll be an experience

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.429 
to do but i think i'll be an experience
but<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> last<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.720> pretty<00:01:54.960> funny<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but on the last not be pretty funny and

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.870 
but on the last not be pretty funny and
i<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:56.070> even<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.340> I'm<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.790> get

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
i don't even know where I'm going to get

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.490 
i don't even know where I'm going to get
the<00:01:56.939> ghost<00:01:57.090> chili<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.899> we'll<00:01:58.020> see<00:01:58.200> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the ghost chili from but we'll see and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.300 
the ghost chili from but we'll see and
we<00:01:59.280> also<00:01:59.490> had<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.299> first<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.560> series<00:02:01.590> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
we also had the first in the series of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
we also had the first in the series of
deaths<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.540> mean<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.439> pretty<00:02:04.469> impressive

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
deaths I mean this is pretty impressive

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
deaths I mean this is pretty impressive
considering<00:02:05.610> how<00:02:05.909> many<00:02:05.969> our<00:02:06.240> middles<00:02:06.540> we've

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
considering how many our middles we've

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.859 
considering how many our middles we've
killed<00:02:07.489> cumulatively<00:02:08.489> between<00:02:09.149> me<00:02:09.420> spending

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
killed cumulatively between me spending

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.770 
killed cumulatively between me spending
and<00:02:09.959> pig<00:02:10.140> nose<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.410> probably<00:02:10.739> kill<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.780> 11

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and pig nose would probably kill like 11

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
and pig nose would probably kill like 11
and<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> half<00:02:13.020> care

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
and a half care

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970 
and a half care
Cree<00:02:14.550> Aras<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.750> had<00:02:15.960> our<00:02:16.110> first<00:02:16.140> death

Cree Aras and we had our first death
first<00:02:17.910> death<00:02:18.210> in<00:02:18.420> 1.5<00:02:19.020> k<00:02:19.260> kills<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.680> pretty

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
first death in 1.5 k kills it's pretty

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.670 
first death in 1.5 k kills it's pretty
damn<00:02:20.370> impressive<00:02:20.670> I'm<00:02:21.090> glad<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.050> wasn't<00:02:22.320> me<00:02:22.470> it

death in this episode it was you know it
was<00:02:47.940> borderline<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.440> i<00:02:49.500> think<00:02:49.740> i<00:02:49.890> am<00:02:50.010> gonna

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
was borderline and i think i am gonna

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.850 
was borderline and i think i am gonna
get<00:02:50.400> my<00:02:50.459> moment<00:02:51.090> where<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:52.050> know<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.770> going

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
get my moment where you know it is going

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.770 
get my moment where you know it is going
to<00:02:53.040> hit<00:02:53.190> me<00:02:53.310> hard<00:02:53.550> or<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.030> gonna<00:02:54.209> lag<00:02:54.570> or

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
to hit me hard or I'm gonna lag or

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.330 
to hit me hard or I'm gonna lag or
something<00:02:55.110> like<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.290> I'd<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.070> think<00:02:56.280> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
something like that I'd like to think I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.790 
something like that I'd like to think I
wouldn't<00:02:56.610> die<00:02:56.880> without<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.870> lying<00:02:58.320> spike<00:02:58.650> or

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
wouldn't die without a lying spike or

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.050 
wouldn't die without a lying spike or
something<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.280> but<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.730> guess<00:02:59.910> we'll

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
something like that but I guess we'll

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.699 
something like that but I guess we'll
see<00:03:00.209> what<00:03:00.390> happens<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.930> can't<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.380> hit<00:03:01.560> you

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
see what happens you can't get hit you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.890 
see what happens you can't get hit you
can<00:03:01.890> get<00:03:02.070> banged<00:03:02.310> for<00:03:02.580> 65<00:03:03.060> s<00:03:03.209> on<00:03:03.300> spawn<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.810> you

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
can get banged for 65 s on spawn if you

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.110 
can get banged for 65 s on spawn if you
press<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.590> bit<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.820> kind<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
press it a little bit and that kind of

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.420 
press it a little bit and that kind of
thing<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.440> know<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.739> can't<00:03:07.950> happen<00:03:08.100> it

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
thing so you know it can't happen it

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.370 
thing so you know it can't happen it
can't<00:03:08.670> happen<00:03:08.850> I'm<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.900> hoping<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.350> doesn't

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
can't happen I'm just hoping it doesn't

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.780 
can't happen I'm just hoping it doesn't
happen<00:03:10.770> soon<00:03:12.500> well<00:03:13.500> yeah<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.920> has<00:03:14.370> been<00:03:14.580> pretty
