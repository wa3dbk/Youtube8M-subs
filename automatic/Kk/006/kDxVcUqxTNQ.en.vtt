you're<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:10.080> going<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.380> use<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> heat<00:02:10.740> seekers

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
you're not going to use the heat seekers

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.100 
you're not going to use the heat seekers
too<00:02:11.220> much<00:02:11.400> because<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.510> pilots<00:02:12.870> are<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.050> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
too much because the pilots are going to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
too much because the pilots are going to
try<00:02:13.290> stay<00:02:13.530> below<00:02:13.620> radar<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.310> laser<00:02:15.150> painter

helps<00:02:15.960> you<00:02:16.080> here<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:18.000> those<00:02:18.270> choppers

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
helps you here to get those choppers

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.720 
helps you here to get those choppers
that<00:02:18.870> are<00:02:18.990> below<00:02:19.230> radar<00:02:19.640> especially<00:02:20.640> after

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that are below radar especially after

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.180 
that are below radar especially after
flying<00:02:21.090> backwards<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:22.200> missile<00:02:23.010> will

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
flying backwards the missile will

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.700 
flying backwards the missile will
usually<00:02:23.400> hit<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.750> very<00:02:24.930> useful<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
usually hit so it is very useful if you

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.290 
usually hit so it is very useful if you
face<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> good<00:02:26.130> pilot<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.670> knows<00:02:26.850> how<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.090> use

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
face a good pilot that knows how to use

radar the below radar stuff so that you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.700 
radar the below radar stuff so that you
can<00:02:30.390> don't<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.900> now<00:02:31.230> there's<00:02:31.650> one

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
can don't get it now there's one

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you're a jet pilot up this is definitely

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
below radar this is actually going to be

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.620 
below radar this is actually going to be
a<00:02:53.370> very<00:02:53.430> good<00:02:53.610> choice<00:02:53.850> unless<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.540> like

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
don't really need it but um besides that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.290 
don't really need it but um besides that
I<00:02:58.890> would<00:02:59.100> say<00:02:59.250> try<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.970> want<00:03:00.150> to

big thing I'll see to talk about and
that<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.680> differences<00:03:17.100> between<00:03:17.160> PC<00:03:17.880> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
that is the differences between PC and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.600 
that is the differences between PC and
console<00:03:18.480> no<00:03:19.440> that's<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:20.040> something<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.430> has

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
console no that's a something that has

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.860 
console no that's a something that has
been<00:03:20.720> talked<00:03:21.720> about<00:03:21.750> quite<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.230> lot<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:23.870> what

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
I've heard is that on PC there's one big

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.500 
I've heard is that on PC there's one big
difference<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:29.100> chopper<00:03:29.489> dogfights<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.239> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
difference in chopper dogfights and that

work none of my garnish is able to use
it<00:03:50.910> correctly<00:03:51.410> not<00:03:52.410> because<00:03:52.709> they're<00:03:52.980> bad<00:03:53.010> but

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
it correctly not because they're bad but

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.880 
it correctly not because they're bad but
simply<00:03:54.150> because<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.019> extremely<00:03:55.560> hard<00:03:55.799> to

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
simply because it's so extremely hard to

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.030 
simply because it's so extremely hard to
use<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.040> console<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:57.410> this<00:03:58.410> makes<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.830> Korra

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
use a console and this makes of Korra

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.500 
use a console and this makes of Korra
change<00:03:59.340> your<00:03:59.519> loadout<00:03:59.910> because<00:04:00.299> what<00:04:00.450> it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
change your loadout because what it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.110 
change your loadout because what it
makes<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.959> makes<00:04:01.260> chopper<00:04:01.650> chopper<00:04:02.610> dog

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
makes it makes chopper chopper dog

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.050 
makes it makes chopper chopper dog
fights<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.540> lot<00:04:03.570> faster<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.950> you're<00:04:05.700> not<00:04:05.880> gonna

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
fights a lot faster so you're not gonna

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.810 
fights a lot faster so you're not gonna
need<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.390> radar<00:04:06.780> for<00:04:06.930> example<00:04:07.549> which<00:04:08.549> means<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
need a radar for example which means you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.880 
need a radar for example which means you
can<00:04:08.940> switch<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.209> out<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:09.720> there<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.680> two

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
can switch it out and there is two

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.560 
can switch it out and there is two
things<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.280> I've<00:04:11.370> been<00:04:11.519> told<00:04:11.670> here<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
things that I've been told here and the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.790 
things that I've been told here and the
first<00:04:12.840> one<00:04:13.019> is<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.260> use<00:04:13.380> guided

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
first one is to use guided

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.270 
first one is to use guided
so<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.030> because<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:15.690> PC<00:04:16.140> the<00:04:16.470> maps<00:04:16.680> are<00:04:16.950> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
so this is because on PC the maps are a

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.820 
so this is because on PC the maps are a
special<00:04:18.030> conquest<00:04:18.360> large<00:04:18.540> are<00:04:18.989> there's<00:04:19.590> more

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
special conquest large are there's more

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.979 
special conquest large are there's more
vehicle<00:04:20.340> study<00:04:20.580> a<00:04:20.790> gun<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.420> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
vehicle study a gun and the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.050 
vehicle study a gun and the
guided-missile<00:04:22.260> helps<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.250> pilots<00:04:23.730> take<00:04:23.940> out

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
guided-missile helps the pilots take out

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.870 
guided-missile helps the pilots take out
da<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.300> gun<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.840> take<00:04:25.500> on<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.010> vehicles<00:04:26.730> that

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
da a gun and take on the vehicles that

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.670 
da a gun and take on the vehicles that
are<00:04:26.910> down<00:04:27.150> there<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.290> also<00:04:28.470> been

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
are down there so this is also been

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.490 
are down there so this is also been
contributed<00:04:29.190> to<00:04:29.250> my<00:04:29.370> trip<00:04:29.640> in<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.850> threat<00:04:30.150> and

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
contributed to my trip in a threat and

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.020 
contributed to my trip in a threat and
that's<00:04:31.500> where<00:04:31.650> I'm<00:04:31.830> saying<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.400> so<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:32.880> you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
that's where I'm saying it so if you

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.640 
that's where I'm saying it so if you
play<00:04:33.180> on<00:04:33.300> PC<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:33.870> definitely<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.350> great

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
play on PC this is definitely a great

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.530 
play on PC this is definitely a great
thing<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:34.950> use<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.970> will<00:04:36.090> most<00:04:36.300> likely

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
thing to use and it will most likely

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.220 
thing to use and it will most likely
help<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.110> but<00:04:37.820> um<00:04:38.820> besides<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.810> I<00:04:39.930> think

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
help you out but um besides that I think

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.020 
help you out but um besides that I think
it's<00:04:40.350> more<00:04:40.410> useful<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:41.010> piece<00:04:41.220> than<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.490> console

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
it's more useful a piece than a console

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.060 
it's more useful a piece than a console
I<00:04:42.240> myself<00:04:42.840> really<00:04:43.440> don't<00:04:43.650> think<00:04:43.710> about

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
I myself really don't think about

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.640 
I myself really don't think about
putting<00:04:44.190> out<00:04:44.370> enough<00:04:44.520> damage<00:04:44.940> but<00:04:45.600> um<00:04:45.780> maybe

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
putting out enough damage but um maybe

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.290 
putting out enough damage but um maybe
you<00:04:46.890> disagree<00:04:47.040> it<00:04:47.490> might<00:04:47.670> be<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:47.970> I'm<00:04:48.120> just

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
you disagree it might be that I'm just

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.080 
you disagree it might be that I'm just
bad<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.260> actually<00:04:49.410> is<00:04:49.710> very<00:04:49.770> helpful<00:04:51.800> then

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
bad and it actually is very helpful then

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.620 
bad and it actually is very helpful then
one<00:04:54.090> more<00:04:54.300> thing<00:04:54.540> I<00:04:54.660> have<00:04:54.690> been<00:04:55.050> told<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.860> that

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
one more thing I have been told is that

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.820 
one more thing I have been told is that
there's<00:04:57.630> one<00:04:57.870> more<00:04:57.990> set<00:04:58.230> up<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.530> I've<00:04:58.650> been

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
there's one more set up that I've been

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.820 
there's one more set up that I've been
suggested<00:04:59.730> by<00:04:59.760> I<00:05:00.360> got<00:05:01.140> in<00:05:01.230> the<00:05:01.290> forums<00:05:01.680> and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
suggested by I got in the forums and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.010 
suggested by I got in the forums and

that is esta pilot using stealth ECM and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.230

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
the map and autoloader now I see the

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.620 
the map and autoloader now I see the
point<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.380> this<00:05:16.560> as<00:05:16.890> as<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.220> pretty<00:05:17.820> set<00:05:18.060> on<00:05:18.090> PC

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
point of this as as a pretty set on PC

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.360 
point of this as as a pretty set on PC
it<00:05:18.750> can<00:05:19.080> be<00:05:19.260> very<00:05:19.290> important<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:19.950> put<00:05:20.130> up<00:05:20.250> more

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
it can be very important to put up more

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.360 
it can be very important to put up more
damage<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.000> since<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.410> don't<00:05:22.440> need<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.919> radar

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
damage and since you don't need a radar

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.970 
damage and since you don't need a radar
because<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.240> have<00:05:24.390> the<00:05:25.020> TV<00:05:25.200> missile<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:25.770> can

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
because you have the TV missile that can

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.340 
because you have the TV missile that can
decide<00:05:26.910> about<00:05:27.180> dogfights<00:05:27.840> really<00:05:28.169> really

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
decide about dogfights really really

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.180 
decide about dogfights really really
quickly<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:30.300> can<00:05:30.540> use<00:05:30.720> stealth<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.350> use<00:05:31.919> also

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
quickly you can use stealth and use also

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.810 
quickly you can use stealth and use also
to<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.330> a<00:05:34.050> lot<00:05:34.410> more<00:05:34.470> damage<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.130> that<00:05:35.669> is

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
to just do a lot more damage and that is

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.750 
to just do a lot more damage and that is
where<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.270> guy<00:05:36.390> what<00:05:36.870> a<00:05:36.900> guy<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.140> totem<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.310> told

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
where the guy what a guy a totem to told

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.690 
where the guy what a guy a totem to told
me<00:05:39.380> so<00:05:40.380> that's<00:05:40.650> also<00:05:40.800> one<00:05:40.980> of<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.160> setups<00:05:41.490> that

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
me so that's also one of the setups that

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.790 
me so that's also one of the setups that
guy<00:05:42.360> had<00:05:42.540> a<00:05:42.570> lot<00:05:42.780> of<00:05:42.810> helicopter<00:05:43.380> kills<00:05:43.590> so<00:05:43.740> I'm

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
guy had a lot of helicopter kills so I'm

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.860 
guy had a lot of helicopter kills so I'm
guess<00:05:43.980> it's<00:05:44.160> got<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.310> good<00:05:44.460> point<00:05:44.669> there<00:05:44.870> give

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
guess it's got a good point there give

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.870 
guess it's got a good point there give
it<00:05:45.960> a<00:05:45.990> try<00:05:46.140> against<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.740> some<00:05:46.980> as<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.640> said

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
it a try against it some as I said

so I Hogan up mad on seeing

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.219 
so I Hogan up mad on seeing
this<00:06:24.400> is<00:06:24.490> my<00:06:24.580> gameplay<00:06:25.000> I<00:06:25.210> always<00:06:25.810> like<00:06:26.199> to

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
this is my gameplay I always like to

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.350 
this is my gameplay I always like to
have<00:06:26.470> matches<00:06:26.860> which<00:06:27.009> are<00:06:27.220> on<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.520> competitive

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
have matches which are on a competitive

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.610 
have matches which are on a competitive
basis<00:06:28.870> which<00:06:29.020> means<00:06:29.199> the<00:06:29.319> enemy<00:06:29.500> team

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
basis which means the enemy team

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.490 
basis which means the enemy team
actually<00:06:29.800> tries<00:06:30.160> killing<00:06:30.849> us<00:06:31.020> so<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.050> guess

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
actually tries killing us so I guess
