00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and the mixer really did look good going

they kind of had him on a timer so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.590 
they kind of had him on a timer so
they've<00:00:35.460> run<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> little<00:00:36.149> bit<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
they've run for a little bit so the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.459 
they've run for a little bit so the
motors<00:00:36.930> wouldn't<00:00:37.290> overheat<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> had

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
motors wouldn't overheat and then we had

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.160 
motors wouldn't overheat and then we had
a<00:00:40.500> whole<00:00:40.770> row<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.690> modular<00:00:42.690> buildings

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
obviously these are all MOX I think this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.520 
obviously these are all MOX I think this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
in the mixer and then of course there's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
in the mixer and then of course there's
my<00:00:54.239> little<00:00:54.449> train<00:00:55.410> depot<00:00:55.980> train<00:00:56.489> stop<00:00:56.789> area

we're<00:01:30.180> supposed<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.600> running<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.200> some<00:01:31.470> of

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
we're supposed to be running but some of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.380 
we're supposed to be running but some of
the<00:01:31.619> pieces<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.549> messed<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:33.030> in

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
the pieces I think got messed up in
transit<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.200> he<00:01:34.470> didn't<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> right

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
transit so he didn't have the right

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
transit so he didn't have the right
Technic<00:01:35.460> pieces<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.240> running<00:01:36.390> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Technic pieces to get it running but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.560 
Technic pieces to get it running but
that<00:01:37.500> would<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.650> been<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:37.979> cool<00:01:38.570> they

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
spinning on top of my building so how
much<00:01:57.450> try<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.990> before<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.530> next<00:01:58.710> show

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
much try to do that before the next show

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.060 
much try to do that before the next show
and<00:01:59.250> also<00:02:00.240> maybe<00:02:00.659> put<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.990> motor<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.740> crane

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and also maybe put a motor on the crane

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950 
and also maybe put a motor on the crane
so<00:02:02.490> maybe<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.030> go<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.689> or

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
so maybe just go up and down or

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
so maybe just go up and down or
something<00:02:04.219> which<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.460> would<00:02:05.610> be<00:02:05.729> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
something which that would be really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.330 
something which that would be really
cool<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.409> see<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.799> kind<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.190> on

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
cool so as you can see this kind of on

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.529 
cool so as you can see this kind of on
this<00:02:08.489> end<00:02:08.729> was<00:02:08.910> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.239> my<00:02:09.390> little

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
section I had a bunch of modulars and I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
section I had a bunch of modulars and I
will<00:02:13.050> say<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.260> Alice
