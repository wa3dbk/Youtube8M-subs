children that they have Giants an

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.250 
children that they have Giants an
integral<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.400> not<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.909> says<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.420> first<00:01:21.869> ball

we<00:01:22.710> were<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.950> Giants<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> others<00:01:24.300> are<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
we were the Giants so the others are the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.580 
we were the Giants so the others are the
same<00:01:25.290> size<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.740> us<00:01:25.850> so<00:01:26.850> basically<00:01:27.390> these<00:01:27.960> these

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
same size as us so basically these these

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.630 
same size as us so basically these these
creatures<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.610> half<00:01:29.880> angel<00:01:33.080> not<00:01:34.080> America

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
creatures is half angel not America

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
creatures is half angel not America
Jesus<00:01:35.640> described<00:01:36.210> them<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.600> poisonous

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
Jesus described them as poisonous

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.920 
Jesus described them as poisonous
promise<00:01:37.890> amongst<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:38.850> crop<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.899> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
promise amongst the good crop and the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.380 
promise amongst the good crop and the
Bible<00:01:40.350> tells<00:01:40.619> us<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.550> hide<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.240> no

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
Bible tells us that we can hide when no

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.419 
Bible tells us that we can hide when no
one<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.570> at<00:01:42.780> Syria<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.220> basically

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
one is at Syria so that's basically

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.940 
one is at Syria so that's basically
that's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> reason<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.840> hidden<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that's the reason that they hidden but

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.600 
that's the reason that they hidden but
they<00:01:47.280> were<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.840> farthest<00:01:49.320> 8<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:50.429> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
they were the farthest 8 which is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.580 
they were the farthest 8 which is
why

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.649 

Jesus<00:01:55.070> told<00:01:55.340> us<00:01:55.460> in<00:01:55.609> the<00:01:55.700> Bible<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.359> whole

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
Jesus told us in the Bible the whole

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.980 
Jesus told us in the Bible the whole
world<00:01:57.049> will<00:01:57.409> be<00:01:57.439> deceived<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.630> by<00:01:59.630> doing<00:01:59.869> this

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
