00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
mind this is a new this actually was

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.150 
mind this is a new this actually was
just<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.960> wall<00:06:00.200> in<00:06:00.350> a<00:06:00.410> bookcase<00:06:00.620> right<00:06:00.860> there

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
just a wall in a bookcase right there

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.130 
just a wall in a bookcase right there
that<00:06:01.340> the<00:06:01.550> wall<00:06:02.000> will<00:06:02.210> reach<00:06:02.480> to<00:06:02.750> the<00:06:02.840> end<00:06:03.020> of

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
that the wall will reach to the end of

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.170 
that the wall will reach to the end of
the<00:06:03.200> door<00:06:03.380> but<00:06:04.130> they<00:06:04.250> open<00:06:04.520> that<00:06:04.640> up<00:06:04.790> as<00:06:04.910> part

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
the door but they open that up as part

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.720 
the door but they open that up as part
of<00:06:05.270> the<00:06:05.330> remodel<00:06:06.110> for<00:06:06.230> club<00:06:06.410> 33<00:06:06.560> has<00:06:07.400> no<00:06:07.550> real

of the remodel for club 33 has no real
purpose<00:06:07.940> that<00:06:08.240> I<00:06:08.390> guess<00:06:08.570> they<00:06:08.720> they<00:06:09.320> just<00:06:09.350> need

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
purpose that I guess they they just need

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.570 
purpose that I guess they they just need
to<00:06:09.800> fill<00:06:09.950> it<00:06:10.070> up<00:06:10.160> but<00:06:10.340> it<00:06:10.400> looks<00:06:10.520> different

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
to fill it up but it looks different

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.530 
to fill it up but it looks different
