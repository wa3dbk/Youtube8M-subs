not<00:01:46.799> quite<00:01:47.399> as<00:01:47.729> lean<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.689> conditioning<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
not quite as lean and conditioning the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.760 
not quite as lean and conditioning the
vascular<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.850> been<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.329> past<00:01:51.770> but

I also think it's a better package for
me<00:01:55.079> my<00:01:55.229> waist<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.680> coming<00:01:56.040> down<00:01:56.310> my<00:01:57.030> quads<00:01:57.299> come
