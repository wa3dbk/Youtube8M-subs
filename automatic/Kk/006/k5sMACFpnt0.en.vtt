the Kreutz path in fact aizen's orbit
suggests<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.549> may<00:01:55.579> gain<00:01:55.909> enough

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
suggests that it may gain enough

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
so it will pass within about forty

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.520
