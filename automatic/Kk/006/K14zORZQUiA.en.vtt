at<00:00:23.160> here<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.029> our<00:00:24.570> new<00:00:24.630> high<00:00:25.289> speed<00:00:25.350> press

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
at here this is our new high speed press

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.419 
at here this is our new high speed press

why<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.910> actually<00:00:42.149> stopped<00:00:42.420> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
why is that we actually stopped the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.150 
why is that we actually stopped the
machine<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:42.899> after<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.649> certain<00:00:44.070> amount

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
machine because after a certain amount

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
machine because after a certain amount
of<00:00:44.370> time<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.969> machine<00:00:45.390> heats<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> dye

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
of time the machine heats up the dye

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
of time the machine heats up the dye
seeped<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.710> have<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.890> take<00:00:47.100> off<00:00:47.309> wipe

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
seeped up and you have to take off wipe

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.279 
seeped up and you have to take off wipe
down<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.059> dyes<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> give<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
down the dyes to give it a little bit of

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.650 
down the dyes to give it a little bit of
a<00:00:49.350> bluing<00:00:49.739> condition<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.879> show<00:00:51.390> up<00:00:51.510> on

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a bluing condition that will show up on

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.100 
a bluing condition that will show up on
the<00:00:51.750> coin

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.870 
create it on the die so that it strikes
these<00:01:58.180> things<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.990> beauty<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.490> what<00:02:00.730> is<00:02:00.820> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
these things of beauty so what is the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.700 
these things of beauty so what is the
machine<00:02:01.120> that<00:02:01.300> we're<00:02:01.420> looking<00:02:01.540> at<00:02:01.870> here<00:02:02.110> well

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
machine that we're looking at here well

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.710 
machine that we're looking at here well
to<00:02:03.370> combine<00:02:03.730> with<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.000> high<00:02:04.150> speed<00:02:04.450> press

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
to combine with the high speed press

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.710 
to combine with the high speed press
again<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.320> was<00:02:05.890> purchased<00:02:06.400> back<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.850> about<00:02:07.690> a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
again that was purchased back in about a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.780 
again that was purchased back in about a
year<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.020> half<00:02:08.200> ago<00:02:08.380> we<00:02:09.280> had<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.490> also

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
year and a half ago we had to also

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.030 
year and a half ago we had to also
invest<00:02:10.090> in<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.330> high<00:02:10.510> speed<00:02:10.740> packaging<00:02:11.740> machine

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
invest in a high speed packaging machine

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.470 
invest in a high speed packaging machine
so<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.790> series<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.150> conveyors

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
so this is just a series of conveyors

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.420 
so this is just a series of conveyors
that<00:02:14.020> takes<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.350> silver<00:02:14.590> Maple<00:02:14.980> Leafs<00:02:15.160> from

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the high speed press and as we turn the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.130 
the high speed press and as we turn the
corner<00:02:18.340> you'll<00:02:18.850> see<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.150> auto<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.990> auto

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
corner you'll see the auto the auto

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.930 
corner you'll see the auto the auto

cots we always touch the point by the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.880 
cots we always touch the point by the
edge<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.500> our<00:02:53.650> own<00:02:53.769> internal
