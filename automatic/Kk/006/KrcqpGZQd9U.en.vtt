which is here now as I change the the
speed<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> motor<00:03:25.269> using<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.200> pulse<00:03:26.410> width

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
speed of the motor using the pulse width

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.000 
speed of the motor using the pulse width
modulator<00:03:27.070> circuit<00:03:28.590> there's<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.680> little<00:03:29.890> bit

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
modulator circuit there's a little bit

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.810 
modulator circuit there's a little bit
slower<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:33.600> that's<00:03:34.600> what<00:03:34.810> happens<00:03:35.140> to<00:03:35.200> the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
slower and that's what happens to the

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.610 
slower and that's what happens to the
the<00:03:36.820> output<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:39.060> op<00:03:40.060> toy<00:03:40.269> mitr<00:03:40.540> as<00:03:41.140> I<00:03:41.320> speed

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
the output of the op toy mitr as I speed

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.910 
the output of the op toy mitr as I speed
it<00:03:41.650> up<00:03:42.900> see<00:03:43.900> what<00:03:44.019> happens<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:45.450> waveform

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
it up see what happens to the waveform

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.740 
it up see what happens to the waveform
now<00:03:47.920> these<00:03:48.519> pulses<00:03:49.090> look<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.360> little<00:03:49.600> bit

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
now these pulses look a little bit

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.020 
now these pulses look a little bit
sloppy<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:51.040> what<00:03:51.250> I'll<00:03:51.340> probably<00:03:51.489> end<00:03:51.880> up

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
sloppy and what I'll probably end up

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.699 
sloppy and what I'll probably end up
doing<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.540> running<00:03:53.079> these<00:03:53.290> through<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:55.709> Schmitt

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
doing is running these through a Schmitt

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.860 
doing is running these through a Schmitt
coupler<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.310> clean<00:03:58.000> up<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.299> waves<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.720> make

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
coupler to clean up the waves and make

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.039 
coupler to clean up the waves and make
them<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.049> little<00:03:59.260> more<00:03:59.500> square<00:04:00.160> wave<00:04:00.810> but<00:04:01.810> so

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
them a little more square wave but so

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.460 
them a little more square wave but so
far<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.470> good<00:04:02.500> it's<00:04:03.010> working<00:04:03.579> good<00:04:04.230> my<00:04:05.230> main

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
far so good it's working good my main

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.130 
far so good it's working good my main
concern<00:04:05.920> was<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.940> height<00:04:07.239> of<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:10.140> opto

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
concern was that the height of the opto

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.390 
concern was that the height of the opto
coupler<00:04:11.350> wasn't<00:04:11.829> going<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.010> be<00:04:12.130> in<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.280> right

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
coupler wasn't going to be in the right

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.289 
coupler wasn't going to be in the right
position<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:14.680> meet<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:15.400> holes<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.209> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
position to meet the the holes in the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:16.650 
position to meet the the holes in the
dis

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
dis

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.160 
dis
in<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> disk<00:04:17.580> but<00:04:18.580> it's<00:04:18.760> perfect<00:04:19.360> so<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.900> just

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
in the disk but it's perfect so I just

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.050 
in the disk but it's perfect so I just
have<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.410> screw<00:04:20.650> them<00:04:20.830> down<00:04:20.860> put<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.850> better

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
have to screw them down put a better

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.620 
have to screw them down put a better
connector<00:04:22.540> over<00:04:22.570> here<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.360> continue<00:04:25.360> on<00:04:25.540> I'm
