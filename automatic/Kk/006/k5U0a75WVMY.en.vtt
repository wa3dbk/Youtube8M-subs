the<00:02:34.630> brick<00:02:34.870> break<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.320> /<00:02:36.100> guernsey

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the brick break and / guernsey

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.300 
the brick break and / guernsey
surprisingly<00:02:37.660> takes<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.380> really<00:02:38.860> well<00:02:39.040> I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
surprisingly takes it really well I

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.680 
surprisingly takes it really well I
thought<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.850> would<00:02:39.970> bring<00:02:40.090> me<00:02:40.269> down<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.570> at

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
thought it would bring me down to at

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.730 
thought it would bring me down to at
least<00:02:40.870> read<00:02:41.620> but

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
least read but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.830 
least read but
um<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.190> guess<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.970> advantage<00:02:44.450> of<00:02:44.510> having<00:02:44.630> a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
um I guess the advantage of having a

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.210 
um I guess the advantage of having a
trick<00:02:45.020> room<00:02:45.170> team<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.560> he<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:45.770> throw<00:02:45.800> all<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
trick room team as he can throw all the

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.280 
trick room team as he can throw all the
extra<00:02:46.490> v's<00:02:46.820> into<00:02:47.150> bulk<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.930> that's<00:02:48.080> always

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
extra v's into bulk so that's always

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.520 
extra v's into bulk so that's always

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
sucked because if they're not a rock

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.530 
sucked because if they're not a rock
polished<00:04:56.370> set<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.880> they<00:04:56.940> don't<00:04:57.060> have<00:04:57.180> speed

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
polished set and they don't have speed

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.730 
polished set and they don't have speed
v's<00:04:57.930> he's<00:04:58.560> most<00:04:59.130> likely<00:04:59.280> going<00:05:00.170> to<00:05:01.170> our<00:05:01.380> slow

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
v's he's most likely going to our slow

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.960 
v's he's most likely going to our slow
me<00:05:01.920> because<00:05:02.190> this<00:05:02.340> team<00:05:02.550> doesn't<00:05:02.790> have

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
me because this team doesn't have

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.390 
me because this team doesn't have
minimum<00:05:03.390> IVs<00:05:03.780> in<00:05:04.110> speed<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.800> is<00:05:04.950> before<00:05:05.130> I

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
minimum IVs in speed this is before I

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.710 
minimum IVs in speed this is before I
figured<00:05:05.940> out<00:05:06.000> how<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.180> do<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.480> with<00:05:06.630> the

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
figured out how to do that with the

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.330 
figured out how to do that with the
action<00:05:06.990> replay<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:07.800> really<00:05:08.100> not

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
action replay so it's really not

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.490 
action replay so it's really not
optimized<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.060> trick<00:05:09.240> room<00:05:09.450> and<00:05:09.810> now<00:05:10.260> I'm

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
optimized a trick room and now I'm

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.830 
optimized a trick room and now I'm
crapping<00:05:10.830> myself<00:05:11.240> because<00:05:12.240> this<00:05:12.420> tour<00:05:12.630> tara

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
crapping myself because this tour tara

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.150 
crapping myself because this tour tara
has<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.560> potential<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:14.190> just<00:05:14.430> destroying<00:05:15.030> me

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
has the potential of just destroying me

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.180 
has the potential of just destroying me
so<00:05:17.330> does<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.480> have<00:05:18.600> yace<00:05:19.020> what's<00:05:19.770> he<00:05:19.860> gonna<00:05:19.950> do

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
so does it have yace what's he gonna do

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.790 
so does it have yace what's he gonna do
I<00:05:20.400> I<00:05:20.460> really<00:05:21.240> have<00:05:21.360> no<00:05:21.570> idea<00:05:21.600> so<00:05:22.290> I'm<00:05:22.620> basically

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
I I really have no idea so I'm basically

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.260 
I I really have no idea so I'm basically
in<00:05:23.160> the<00:05:23.250> dark<00:05:23.490> here<00:05:23.700> hoping<00:05:23.970> that<00:05:24.030> he's<00:05:24.240> not

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
in the dark here hoping that he's not

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.030 
in the dark here hoping that he's not
gonna<00:05:24.630> would<00:05:24.900> hammer<00:05:25.140> my<00:05:27.200> octillery<00:05:28.200> because

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
gonna would hammer my octillery because

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.880 
gonna would hammer my octillery because
if<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:29.370> did<00:05:29.550> that's<00:05:29.760> instant<00:05:30.240> death<00:05:30.890> so

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
if you did that's instant death so

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.040 
if you did that's instant death so
anyway<00:05:32.340> Hariyama<00:05:33.090> how<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:33.270> slows<00:05:33.570> it<00:05:33.600> which<00:05:33.930> is

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
anyway Hariyama how it slows it which is

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.490 
anyway Hariyama how it slows it which is
nice<00:05:34.320> and<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:35.160> get<00:05:35.370> to<00:05:35.610> kill<00:05:36.150> off<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.810> skuntank

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
nice and I get to kill off that skuntank

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.740 
nice and I get to kill off that skuntank
because<00:05:37.950> sucker<00:05:38.220> punch<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.850> getting<00:05:39.330> kind<00:05:39.660> of

going well up until the sort era

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.150 
going well up until the sort era
survived<00:06:18.480> and<00:06:18.960> you<00:06:19.230> know<00:06:19.410> its<00:06:19.740> animation

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
survived and you know its animation

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.300 
survived and you know its animation
where<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.700> doesn't<00:06:21.450> die<00:06:21.720> at<00:06:22.080> like<00:06:22.290> laughs<00:06:22.650> so

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
where it doesn't die at like laughs so

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.700 
where it doesn't die at like laughs so
that<00:06:23.670> sucks<00:06:24.620> but<00:06:25.620> anyway<00:06:26.160> you<00:06:26.970> know<00:06:27.090> what<00:06:27.710> this

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
that sucks but anyway you know what this

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.100 
that sucks but anyway you know what this
next<00:06:28.890> turn<00:06:29.220> is<00:06:29.520> very<00:06:29.880> funny<00:06:30.240> because<00:06:30.900> my

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
next turn is very funny because my

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.790 
next turn is very funny because my
opponent<00:06:31.890> makes<00:06:32.070> a<00:06:32.310> really<00:06:32.730> stupid<00:06:33.450> move<00:06:33.960> or<00:06:34.770> I

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
opponent makes a really stupid move or I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.470 
opponent makes a really stupid move or I
guess<00:06:35.160> all<00:06:35.400> things<00:06:35.640> considered<00:06:36.090> in<00:06:36.270> their

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
guess all things considered in their

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.650 
guess all things considered in their
situation<00:06:36.690> it<00:06:37.320> might<00:06:37.560> not<00:06:37.740> be<00:06:37.800> that<00:06:37.980> stupid

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
situation it might not be that stupid

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.820 
situation it might not be that stupid
because<00:06:39.660> they<00:06:39.870> were<00:06:40.260> thinking<00:06:40.650> they<00:06:40.770> can

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
because they were thinking they can

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.010 
because they were thinking they can
finish<00:06:41.250> off<00:06:41.460> both<00:06:41.730> of<00:06:41.760> my<00:06:42.030> guys<00:06:42.300> and<00:06:42.810> then

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
finish off both of my guys and then

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.220 
finish off both of my guys and then
maybe<00:06:43.350> win<00:06:43.770> but<00:06:44.160> to<00:06:44.910> me<00:06:45.090> it<00:06:45.360> was<00:06:45.390> very<00:06:45.960> very

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
maybe win but to me it was very very

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.860 
maybe win but to me it was very very
