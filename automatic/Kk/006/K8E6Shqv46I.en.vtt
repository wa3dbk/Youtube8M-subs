00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello friends we are here again with 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 a newer tutorial there is no longer 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.759
 pain you will not like it and not the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.009
 pain this song is very easy to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.360
 touching it have two parts nothing else like this 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.980
 that if they have something to notice as 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.760
 always the first part is re major 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.760
 all right 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.600
 the biggest 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.630
 First 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.649
 major and major 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.289
 well this one is repeated twice at 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.090
 beginning of the song and after that is 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:45.990
 greater sun 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.990
 yes minor 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.829
 the biggest 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.540
 my minor 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.830
 the biggest one again 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.450
 and if it's less good, that is repeated once 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.270
 in part 2 it would be the 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.690
 chorus good now I'm going to do 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.880
 a small demonstration and then they 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.880
 I will teach the rhythm see part 1 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 my passion 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.380
 look at it 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.090
 following 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.090
 and the order 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.040
 my hands 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 yes 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.890
 and there comes part 2 which is the mini 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.890
 chorus part 2 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.220
 there is no pain 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 d 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.760
 all right 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.830
 the service and then the other part if 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.470
 all good 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.320
 that part repeats the song and he 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.780
 if the whole song goes away and then 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.930
 repeat the flight part in the round if 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.930
 all the mind the most time do it 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.990
 and then I finished that part I was going 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.990
 return 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.870
 and so it is repeated all the time already with 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.430
 the chords and when to play them 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.469
 now let's go to the rhythm 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.180
 but let's move on to the rhythm and I want 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.960
 pay close attention is nothing 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.780
 difficult nothing more 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.500
 when handling the times see the rhythm 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.500
 take off 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.550
 Y 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.969
 and we're playing down 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 every two times we change 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.520
 notes or we start with renault 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.540
 we started the king and played twice 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.799
 down 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.590
 and from there we move on to the next note 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.689
 and so we go two taps and each time 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.270
 we play the rope all rope learn 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.120
 the chord 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.880
 we squeeze and let's squeeze and 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:39.260
 let's go when we play or we're going to 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.750
 give example is not good to observe the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.940
 time to do the has to have to 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.870
 be a sound off those sounds 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.129
 parents is not to swallow 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.129
 they can not exercise 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.180
 are touching and turning off at the same time 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.620
 the sound when squeezing good then every 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.940
 time we want it down 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.640
 we tighten the chord and remember they are two 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.110
 touches down when going to the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.110
 another chord we played twice 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.989
 the last chord or always the last 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.800
 chord you want to play all that is 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.110
 more for example 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.910
 let's give an example in the refrain 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:33.790
 see 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:37.860
 no longer all here that you have space there 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:41.430
 Candela is being given four times below 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.430
 to fly 90 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.640
 the child playing work nothing else they have 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.430
 that I give my hand I recommend it for 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.820
 that are just beginning do not start 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.920
 singing and playing go playing first 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.810
 all that touch touch up to you 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.420
 have the melody of the song comes the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.980
 mind and there go in passions 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.170
 matching perfectly and then 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.960
 when you see that they are playing 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.820
 perfectly there yes to the king of the voice 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.550
 because that has the beginning they argued 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.160
 add the voice to the voice and touch it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.520
 time is going to make it harder for 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.520
 to learn 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.520
 this is a simple basic basic basic 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.150
 of this rhythm I reiterate again the 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.670
 rhythm 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:40.090
 remember they are two touches for basses by 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:43.810
 note and so we change and remember to be a 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:46.090
 new that every time they touch down 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.560
 you tighten the rope we tighten the 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.960
 rope in which we are doing the 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960
 chord and let's go obviously 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:58.090
 after we stop playing we highlight 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.090
 Y 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.750
