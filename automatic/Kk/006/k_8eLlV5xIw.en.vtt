00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.510
 we are with elisa bonandini houses on 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:12.799
 trees what only and why good morning 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:16.049
 we are the creators of this new one 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.940
 innovation in the field of tourism ed 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 hopefully in the future I hope not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 houses too far away 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.699
 residential trees because many 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.580
 customers have asked us to be able to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.269
 going to live in homes all year 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 on the trees and we had one 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.850
 beautiful collaboration with a company 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.969
 of the first French place he built 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.219
 tree houses throughout europe 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.899
 including the united states and there are in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.920
 the whole world is a reality that already 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.690
 also exists in South Africa because not 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.230
 safari camps for observation of the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.320
 of giraffe animals and so on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.789
 etc. with panoramic views and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 an experience that comes from mine 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.320
 experience for the bioarchitecture that it is 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.080
 resulted in this dreamlike idea of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 home and that is a bit of a dream 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.909
 we all had our childhood 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.570
 develops very well translated into 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.570
 field of tourism 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 and in fact we were invited as 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.439
 company leader even if a term a little 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 obsolete to be part of the commission 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.950
 examiner of a competition held in 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.299
 common of cles that precisely for objective 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 that of going to build a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.400
 village of tree houses to do 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.500
 so that the tourist vocation of that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.200
 region of that region may have 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.250
 large spaces and can adapt to those 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 which are the market demands 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 Today we remember the class in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.850
 Trentino 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.500
 as never in the aosta valley 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.259
 I hope that in the next 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.470
 legislature we too could have 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.110
 as they presented recently in the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.689
 Trentino region a motion to the law 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.810
 urban planning that then becomes 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.390
 approved and that ensures that with one 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.219
 small with a small amendment yes 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.399
 can achieve without any 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.920
 the concession is problematic 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.970
 building to be able to build to insert 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.960
 in our environment 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.300
 these fabulous tree houses well 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.850
 a dream of many but that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.080
 what are these infamous houses on 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:28.310
 album the tree houses are of the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.810
 houses built with all services 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.180
 because especially in the world 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.380
 tourism entrepreneurship 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.250
 It is obvious that the customer but above all 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 in this range have all the comforts 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.830
 so much so that we have also realized 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.540
 of the suites to make spas 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.640
 on trees and even with 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.450
 whirlpool sauna anything else as well 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.840
 double bedrooms suspended between 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.010
 the branches and completely immersed in the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.900
 nature to make people that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.700
 he runs away from his own cities and is 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.319
 stressed out maybe by their work yes 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.340
 find yourself blissfully relaxing 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.930
 customers can be either type 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.880
 private maybe they can have a nice one 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.830

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.860

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.910
 realized of the little observatories 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.150
 very high astronomical plants 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.989
