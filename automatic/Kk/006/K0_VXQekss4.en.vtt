00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.970 
and welcome to another video blog today
I<00:00:05.250> thought<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.970> would<00:00:06.000> talk<00:00:06.359> about<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:07.319> biggest

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I thought I would talk about the biggest

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.570 
I thought I would talk about the biggest
disappointing<00:00:08.970> games<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.139> 2012<00:00:11.130> and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
disappointing games of the 2012 and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.520 
disappointing games of the 2012 and
maybe<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.880> bit<00:00:12.059> controversial<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.900> my<00:00:12.990> decision

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
maybe a bit controversial in my decision

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.110 
maybe a bit controversial in my decision
but<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.920> think<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.670> me<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.969> most

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
but I think for me the most

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.269 
but I think for me the most
disappointing<00:00:15.780> game<00:00:16.289> would<00:00:16.770> probably

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
disappointing game would probably

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.179 
disappointing game would probably
Assassin's<00:00:18.119> Creed<00:00:18.390> 3<00:00:18.420> well<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> big

3<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.750> rounds<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
3 that I think as it rounds off the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.619 
3 that I think as it rounds off the
trilogy<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.070> expectations<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.450> be

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
trilogy the expectations for it to be

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.840 
trilogy the expectations for it to be
amazing<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.410> well<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:41.160> really<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.610> high

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
amazing as well we're really really high

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.020 
amazing as well we're really really high
and<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.950> probably<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> worst

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and for me it is just probably the worst

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
and for me it is just probably the worst
of<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.840> games<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> column<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.710> far<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
of all the games of column so far I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.029 
of all the games of column so far I
think<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> problem<00:00:48.000> for<00:00:48.180> me<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.559> think

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
think I'm a problem for me is I think

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.670 
think I'm a problem for me is I think
the<00:00:50.219> game<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.789> come<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.149> brother<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:52.379> seems

there<00:03:37.040> are<00:03:37.130> some<00:03:37.280> good<00:03:37.459> points<00:03:37.730> about<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
there are some good points about the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.259 
there are some good points about the
game<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.690> combat<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.519> vastly<00:03:40.519> improved<00:03:40.970> from

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
game the combat is vastly improved from

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.090 
game the combat is vastly improved from
the<00:03:41.600> other<00:03:41.810> games<00:03:42.080> it's<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.800> a<00:03:42.860> lot<00:03:42.950> more

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
the other games it's just a lot more

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.160 
the other games it's just a lot more
simple<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:44.030> have<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.480> know<00:03:44.540> your<00:03:44.750> attack<00:03:44.989> at

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
simple you have you know your attack at

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.660 
simple you have you know your attack at
your<00:03:45.290> lock<00:03:45.470> button<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.190> all<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.340> feels

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
your lock button and it all just feels

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.199 
your lock button and it all just feels
very<00:03:46.970> very<00:03:47.680> natural<00:03:48.680> smoother<00:03:49.220> but<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.970> course

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
very very natural smoother but of course

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.920 
very very natural smoother but of course
because<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:50.930> set<00:03:51.140> in

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
because it's set in

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.979 
because it's set in
setting<00:03:52.469> which<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.329> American<00:03:54.329> Revolution<00:03:54.780> a

lot of your engineers have rifles and

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.580 
lot of your engineers have rifles and
pistols<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.629> lot<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.140> time<00:03:58.319> you'll<00:03:58.530> be

two guys were they were talking and it
was<00:05:10.620> in<00:05:10.740> up<00:05:10.830> an<00:05:10.949> enemy<00:05:11.190> compound<00:05:11.699> so<00:05:12.120> you<00:05:12.659> have

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
was in up an enemy compound so you have

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.480 
was in up an enemy compound so you have

guard<00:05:21.840> towels<00:05:22.139> but<00:05:22.530> by<00:05:22.650> that<00:05:22.830> so<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.370> have<00:05:23.550> the

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
guard towels but by that so you have the

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.939 
guard towels but by that so you have the
approach<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.150> level<00:05:24.630> in<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> certain<00:05:25.139> way<00:05:25.380> for

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
approach that level in a certain way for

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.010 
approach that level in a certain way for
this<00:05:26.039> particular<00:05:26.190> level<00:05:26.880> I<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.060> got<00:05:27.509> seen<00:05:27.780> by

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
this particular level I I got seen by

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.070 
this particular level I I got seen by
God<00:05:28.320> and<00:05:28.699> had<00:05:29.699> to<00:05:29.820> run<00:05:30.060> attire<00:05:30.360> but<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.900> but

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
God and had to run attire but I but

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.560 
God and had to run attire but I but
early<00:05:31.320> i<00:05:31.349> fell<00:05:32.070> off<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.610> edge<00:05:32.880> of<00:05:33.180> the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
early i fell off the edge of the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.439 
early i fell off the edge of the
compound<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.770> fell<00:05:35.190> down<00:05:35.220> about<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.120> hundred

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:36.449 
compound and fell down about a hundred

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.360 
compound and fell down about a hundred
and<00:05:36.599> fifty<00:05:36.930> purposes<00:05:37.440> of<00:05:37.560> water<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:38.220> I<00:05:38.250> swam

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
and fifty purposes of water so I swam

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.870 
and fifty purposes of water so I swam
around<00:05:38.849> for<00:05:39.360> about<00:05:39.449> three<00:05:40.110> minutes<00:05:40.259> and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
around for about three minutes and

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.219 
around for about three minutes and
basically<00:05:41.880> there<00:05:42.090> was<00:05:42.180> no<00:05:42.389> way<00:05:42.539> to<00:05:42.570> get<00:05:42.900> out<00:05:42.930> of

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
basically there was no way to get out of

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.430 
basically there was no way to get out of
the<00:05:43.320> sea

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
the sea

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.110 
the sea
water<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.100> have<00:05:45.280> to<00:05:45.370> swim<00:05:45.580> all<00:05:45.700> the<00:05:45.730> way<00:05:45.880> back

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
water so I have to swim all the way back

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.020 
water so I have to swim all the way back
and<00:05:46.450> search<00:05:47.110> for<00:05:47.140> a<00:05:47.890> way<00:05:48.280> to<00:05:48.310> get<00:05:48.640> out<00:05:48.700> of<00:05:48.940> the

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
and search for a way to get out of the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.780 
and search for a way to get out of the
water<00:05:49.180> so<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.500> some<00:05:50.830> sort<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.160> bad<00:05:51.400> level

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
water so this some sort of bad level

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.280 
water so this some sort of bad level
because<00:05:52.000> I<00:05:52.090> didn't<00:05:52.360> know<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:52.900> developers

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
because I didn't know the developers

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.840 
because I didn't know the developers
must<00:05:53.440> have<00:05:53.620> noted<00:05:53.920> that<00:05:54.070> could<00:05:54.250> happen<00:05:54.580> you

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
must have noted that could happen you

must have noted that could happen you

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
I was whereas they could have just put

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.210 
I was whereas they could have just put
in<00:06:09.910> like<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.090> ladder<00:06:10.390> or<00:06:10.750> a<00:06:11.080> slope<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:11.890> take<00:06:12.070> it

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
American wilderness so it sought

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.570 
American wilderness so it sought
straight<00:06:37.450> buildings<00:06:38.080> brick<00:06:38.830> buildings<00:06:39.370> they

look for Simon it's just a bill as
interesting<00:06:43.300> i'm<00:06:43.420> totally<00:06:43.840> I<00:06:44.170> mean<00:06:44.350> there's

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
interesting i'm totally I mean there's

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.550 
interesting i'm totally I mean there's
not<00:06:44.920> really<00:06:45.070> much<00:06:45.220> damn<00:06:45.910> about<00:06:46.170> it<00:06:47.170> just<00:06:47.380> makes

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
not really much damn about it just makes

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.310 
not really much damn about it just makes
exploration<00:06:48.250> less<00:06:48.430> interesting<00:06:49.180> than

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
exploration less interesting than

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.960 
exploration less interesting than
previous<00:06:50.320> games<00:06:50.590> so<00:06:51.070> I<00:06:51.370> think<00:06:51.820> that's

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
previous games so I think that's

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.210 
previous games so I think that's
probably<00:06:52.150> about<00:06:52.419> it<00:06:52.840> so<00:06:53.320> as<00:06:53.440> I<00:06:53.530> say<00:06:53.740> it's

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
probably about it so as I say it's

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.530 
probably about it so as I say it's
probably<00:06:54.370> my<00:06:54.580> most<00:06:54.700> disappointing<00:06:54.910> game

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
probably my most disappointing game

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.540 
probably my most disappointing game
mainly<00:06:56.080> because<00:06:56.110> the<00:06:56.470> previous<00:06:56.800> head<00:06:57.010> were<00:06:57.220> so

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
mainly because the previous head were so

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.150 
mainly because the previous head were so
good<00:06:57.820> but<00:06:58.510> I<00:06:58.540> mean<00:06:59.020> maybe<00:06:59.500> you've<00:06:59.770> played<00:07:00.010> it

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
good but I mean maybe you've played it

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.460 
good but I mean maybe you've played it
and<00:07:00.340> you<00:07:00.700> feel<00:07:01.030> differently<00:07:01.570> please<00:07:02.169> let<00:07:02.350> me

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
and you feel differently please let me
