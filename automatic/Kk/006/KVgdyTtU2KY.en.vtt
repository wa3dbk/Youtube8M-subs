00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.040
 Hello dear visitors of ours 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.580
 garden site 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 you are the world today we have this 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.960
 wonderful excursion 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.790
 I am visiting 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.760
 amateur flower growers in general fans 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.000
 tropical plants i would say in his 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.690
 home greenhouse this greenhouse 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.360
 then they will tell more in detail 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:37.220
 built on the second floor ie two 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.960
 residential floor and it's like the third floor here 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.030
 privately such 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.780
 cottage house look how much 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 here different plants in us are all 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.629
 citrus fruits are found 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.559
 bougainvillea here's dawn we December 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.120
 month here is here persimmon 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.040
 so he expresses demonstrates and all this 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 practically in urban conditions that is 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:09.060
 we didn't even go outside the city 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.110
 and in front of us here is here is coffee with 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 the harvest is now true we have deciduous 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.790
 period is wild it is natural all 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.979
 the fact that the leaves turn yellow and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 flies, and now we Sergei Kurenkov 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.619
 will talk about how this greenhouse in 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.990
 principle 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.090
 arranged and how it works 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.579
 that contains such allows to contain 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.609
 such a large collection of tropical 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.539
 of plants 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:45.250
 Well, as Natalia said, was built on 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.920
 roof of the house 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:54.290
 the device used a number 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:02:00.740
 profile and field of carrara thick 25 25 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:04.730
 understand the heating here is almost not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:08.030
 turns on the fruit box that goes 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.330
 bottom turns on 4 batteries here by 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.700
 the perimeter stand only very cold on 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.360
 about 30 degrees of frost 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.940
 that 's basically enough heat 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.520
 enough you know cunt 10 degrees 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.400
 normal tropical plant necessary 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.830
 period of cool containing having escaped winter and 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.470
 will make them feel good 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.050
 and developed and therefore here just 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 such temperature is maintained 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.610
 it's a myth that tropical plants should 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.820
 constantly grow at high temperatures 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.190
 about 20 degrees and for from many here 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.680
 plant lovers this is just 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.680
 problem that is how to keep such 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.350
 heat up it turns out he 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.890
 now your burn for december-january 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.350
 yes we have snow outside the window and here 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.560
 moderate temperature we're all 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.310
 control thermometers before issuing 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.180
 it's worth showing the temperature 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.719
 because 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.030
 In principle, here is a minus and can not 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:18.019
 control a little if so heating 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.769
 Fully high here in skates how many 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.319
 here you have a height equal to 4 meters with 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:26.780
 half that we will execute that is this 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.689
 the greenhouse itself in to the legend the highest 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.629
 plants or she of course you go there by 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.980
 center to plant which I rearrange 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.590
 when someone grows up something 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.530
 imagine and here if you look under 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.669
 with skate just this system goes 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.510
 ventilation 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:46.549
 here these pipes with holes goes system 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:51.379
 ventilation which turns on in summer 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:54.010
 when the ball is too hot or thorough 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.540
 territories begin to hot 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.200
 must temperature greatly increases the strength 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.739
 of the year 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.680
 here in the summer braided 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 here you can see the string 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:10.849
 here the curtains of sleep that would 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.950
 torn to pieces burns because you teach something 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.970
 there are temperature sensors standing there 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:20.090
 and if it's hot it turns on the ventilation 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.769
 if it's completely cold there 30 degrees here 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.560
 I hand over the battery to the tier 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:31.360
 and on the screen opens another short 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.889
 Here we have an idea about our 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.010
 Florists were here in our little 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.260
 so this roller what plants are you 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.860
 here you grow well, although at the very same 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.280
 favorite main cultures here are very 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.280
 a lot of things 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:54.269
 although here we see already citrus tobi 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:59.519
 sketches of 70 varieties filter settles how 

00:04:54.269 --> 00:05:00.449
 then on top are dead shorter than you erofeys chorus 

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:06.139
 and weaved 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:09.869
 there is a quantity but metro sideros the world is here 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.439
 from Kazan from meters still sit in 

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:15.629
 there with fruits and with the price of the street it 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:18.200
 have a chinese which they winter with us 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:21.230
 there is an american one which 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.270
 This breasts will now follow, but I want 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.170
 highlight then fruit plants and here 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.990
 very much and citrus all these years 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.110
 bear and quietly bear fruit 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.290
 and now coffee is also ripening with him 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.470
 raft that is here not just like that 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.990
 You can look at all this beauty night 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.350
 try twigs it all fresh all 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.620
 this is still fragrant tell us 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.230
 Please here you let a beast 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.450
 give it to the summer besides brought 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.350
 open that is she's not even 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.560
 double 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:07.460
 and this is enough too 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:11.000
 to keep warm in the winter draft of this 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.590
 the greenhouse you yourself here is the whole and creation 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.530
 there was no project just 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:22.180
 drawing paper and its and then you 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.800
 just these polycarbonate sheets 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.470
 thank you very much we are 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.140
 received and then please look at 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.720
 on our website we will tell you in detail about 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:36.730
 some specific cultures here 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.730
 from the greenhouse and Sergey Brin whom
