growths<00:02:58.590> yet<00:02:59.040> right<00:02:59.670> there<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.750> go<00:03:00.959> there<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
growths yet right there you go there and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.980 
growths yet right there you go there and
this<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.150> another<00:03:03.450> miner

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
this is another miner

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.680 
this is another miner
another<00:03:04.230> big<00:03:04.560> miner<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.910> grass<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:06.510> grew

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
another big miner this grass really grew

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
another big miner this grass really grew
up<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:07.320> really<00:03:07.500> hard<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.040> me<00:03:08.130> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
up here so it's really hard for me to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.440 
up here so it's really hard for me to
get<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.520> here<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:10.430> big<00:03:11.840> miner

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.790 

against<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.570> south<00:03:17.810> facing<00:03:18.080> wall<00:03:18.440> here

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
against the south facing wall here

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.650 
against the south facing wall here
another<00:03:21.800> tricky

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.350 

see<00:03:25.380> most<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.220> I'm<00:03:26.670> thinking<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.210> is

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
see most of this I'm thinking this is

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.870 
see most of this I'm thinking this is
mostly<00:03:27.690> snow<00:03:27.810> damage<00:03:28.470> here<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.950> don't<00:03:29.010> think

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
mostly snow damage here I don't think

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.120 
mostly snow damage here I don't think
that<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.960> can<00:03:31.110> see<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.100> a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that some of it you can see is this is a

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.310 
that some of it you can see is this is a
burnt<00:03:32.460> tip<00:03:32.670> here<00:03:34.310> but<00:03:35.310> mostly<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.390> snow

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
burnt tip here but mostly this is snow

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.160 
burnt tip here but mostly this is snow
damaged<00:03:37.710> because<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.100> way<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.670> shredded

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
damaged because of the way it's shredded

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.370 
damaged because of the way it's shredded
makes<00:03:40.170> me<00:03:40.290> think<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.810> burn<00:03:43.050> damage

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
makes me think that this is burn damage

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.310 
makes me think that this is burn damage
regular<00:03:43.890> burn<00:03:44.100> damage<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:45.690> most<00:03:45.990> of<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.440> is

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
regular burn damage but most of it is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.690 
regular burn damage but most of it is
caused<00:03:49.320> by<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> snow<00:03:50.210> this<00:03:51.210> one<00:03:52.460> looks<00:03:53.460> like<00:03:53.580> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
caused by the snow this one looks like a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.070 
caused by the snow this one looks like a
head<00:03:53.880> maybe<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.180> little<00:03:54.330> rougher<00:03:54.690> time<00:03:54.870> it's

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
head maybe a little rougher time it's

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.240 
head maybe a little rougher time it's
probably<00:03:56.270> younger<00:03:57.270> than<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.600> other<00:03:57.750> ones

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
probably younger than the other ones

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.390 
probably younger than the other ones
see<00:03:59.250> how<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.510> seems<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.690> cut<00:04:00.960> there<00:04:01.400> but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
see how it's seems to be cut there but

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.070 
see how it's seems to be cut there but
you<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.820> all<00:04:03.060> these<00:04:03.240> palms<00:04:03.570> are<00:04:03.780> unprotected

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
you know all these palms are unprotected

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.300 
you know all these palms are unprotected

needle

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.710 

looks<00:05:30.039> pretty<00:05:30.370> damaged<00:05:30.819> from<00:05:30.940> that<00:05:31.120> snow<00:05:31.389> you

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
looks pretty damaged from that snow you

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.180 
looks pretty damaged from that snow you
can<00:05:31.870> see<00:05:32.020> all<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.349> fronds<00:05:32.650> are<00:05:32.860> really

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
can see all the fronds are really

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.480 
can see all the fronds are really
bricked<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:34.410> think<00:05:35.410> this<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.770> mostly<00:05:36.099> the<00:05:36.280> snow

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
bricked I think this is mostly the snow

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.719 
bricked I think this is mostly the snow
damaged<00:05:36.940> not<00:05:37.560> like<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.680> tip<00:05:38.919> Brown<00:05:39.160> here<00:05:39.580> the

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
damaged not like the tip Brown here the

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.379 
damaged not like the tip Brown here the
regular<00:05:39.849> tip<00:05:40.210> burn<00:05:41.639> but<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.759> rest<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.150> it<00:05:43.270> I'm

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
regular tip burn but the rest of it I'm

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.529 
regular tip burn but the rest of it I'm
thinking<00:05:43.569> is<00:05:43.900> a<00:05:44.729> damage<00:05:45.729> from<00:05:45.849> the<00:05:45.970> snow<00:05:46.270> I

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
thinking is a damage from the snow I

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.490 
thinking is a damage from the snow I

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.839 

I<00:06:11.259> think<00:06:11.740> I'm<00:06:11.860> going<00:06:12.069> to<00:06:12.129> break<00:06:12.370> this<00:06:12.550> into<00:06:12.819> two

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
I think I'm going to break this into two

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.330 
I think I'm going to break this into two
parts<00:06:13.030> because<00:06:13.599> there<00:06:13.810> are<00:06:13.870> more<00:06:14.229> in<00:06:15.129> a<00:06:15.189> more

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
parts because there are more in a more

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.249 
parts because there are more in a more
sheltered<00:06:15.849> location<00:06:16.419> see<00:06:16.629> the<00:06:16.749> grass<00:06:16.990> is<00:06:17.229> just

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:17.259 
sheltered location see the grass is just

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.909 
sheltered location see the grass is just
burn<00:06:18.719> just<00:06:19.719> front<00:06:20.110> here<00:06:20.349> and<00:06:20.469> I<00:06:20.620> think<00:06:20.800> they're

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
burn just front here and I think they're

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:21.689 
burn just front here and I think they're
watering<00:06:21.219> it

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
watering it

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.839

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
it's about upper 80s right now I think

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.790 
it's about upper 80s right now I think
we<00:06:25.029> got<00:06:25.360> a<00:06:25.389> break<00:06:25.689> I<00:06:26.080> don't<00:06:26.379> think<00:06:26.499> we<00:06:26.560> hit<00:06:26.620> 90

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800
