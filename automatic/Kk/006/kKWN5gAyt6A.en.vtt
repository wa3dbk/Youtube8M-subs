00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
intensity dial thing you can see it it's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.529 
intensity dial thing you can see it it's
sitting<00:00:52.210> over<00:00:52.510> here<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:54.070> one<00:00:54.340> I<00:00:54.550> believe<00:00:55.270> now

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
we've got the antenna for the radio

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.499 
we've got the antenna for the radio
system<00:01:58.899> pointing<00:01:59.380> out<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.649> back<00:01:59.829> here<00:02:00.509> we've

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
system pointing out the back here we've

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.620 
system pointing out the back here we've
got<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.079> tail<00:02:02.920> fin<00:02:03.280> whatever<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.390> want<00:02:04.539> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
got the tail fin whatever you want to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.910 
got the tail fin whatever you want to
call<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.880> blades<00:02:07.390> are<00:02:07.810> plastic<00:02:08.649> but

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
call it the blades are plastic but

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.370 
call it the blades are plastic but
actually<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.579> a<00:02:09.610> good<00:02:09.880> thing<00:02:10.119> because

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
actually that is a good thing because

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.990 
actually that is a good thing because
having<00:02:11.380> plastic<00:02:11.620> blades<00:02:12.130> means<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.880> you

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
having plastic blades means that if you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.850 
having plastic blades means that if you
crush<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.390> blades<00:02:13.900> will<00:02:14.140> snap<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.709> other

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
crush the blades will snap and other

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.780 
crush the blades will snap and other
stuff<00:02:15.220> won't<00:02:16.350> break<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.799> like<00:02:18.160> some<00:02:18.519> of<00:02:18.670> them

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
stuff won't break so like some of them

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.940 
stuff won't break so like some of them
have<00:02:19.060> wooden<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.750> strengthened<00:02:20.440> plastic

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
have wooden or strengthened plastic

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.060 
have wooden or strengthened plastic
blades<00:02:21.250> these<00:02:22.060> ones<00:02:22.299> are<00:02:22.630> better<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.739> sort

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
blades these ones are better in a sort

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.250 
blades these ones are better in a sort
of<00:02:24.130> way<00:02:24.310> because<00:02:24.549> actually<00:02:25.239> these<00:02:25.810> ones<00:02:26.049> will

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
of way because actually these ones will

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.130 
of way because actually these ones will
mean<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.769> if<00:02:27.670> you<00:02:27.819> do<00:02:28.030> crush<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.870> blades

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
mean that if you do crush the blades

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.020 
mean that if you do crush the blades
will<00:02:29.410> break<00:02:29.620> instead<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.250> i<00:02:30.489> think<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.000> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
will break instead of i think it is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
will break instead of i think it is
called<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.450> swash<00:02:31.780> plate

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
called the swash plate

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.559 
called the swash plate
won't<00:02:32.980> break<00:02:33.250> instead<00:02:33.610> so<00:02:34.060> here<00:02:34.209> we<00:02:34.239> got<00:02:34.450> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
won't break instead so here we got the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.430 
won't break instead so here we got the
fly<00:02:34.840> bar<00:02:35.170> at<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.739> top<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:37.300> sturdy<00:02:37.720> firm

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
fly bar at the top really sturdy firm

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.120 
fly bar at the top really sturdy firm
fly<00:02:38.890> bar<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.660> connecting<00:02:41.170> rods<00:02:41.440> are<00:02:41.800> sitting

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
fly bar the connecting rods are sitting

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.760 
fly bar the connecting rods are sitting
