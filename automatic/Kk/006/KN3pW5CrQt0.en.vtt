00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
so I've already placed them in the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.180 
so I've already placed them in the
microwave<00:05:36.880> for<00:05:37.000> about<00:05:37.210> 30<00:05:37.599> seconds<00:05:38.229> stop<00:05:39.039> that

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.060 
microwave 30 seconds it has warmed up so
I<00:05:43.570> think<00:05:43.690> we<00:05:43.960> want<00:05:44.169> to<00:05:44.229> do<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.530> just<00:05:44.710> toast<00:05:44.919> the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
I think we want to do is just toast the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.270 
I think we want to do is just toast the
outside<00:05:45.520> of<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.700> egg<00:05:45.880> rows<00:05:47.099> we're<00:05:48.099> going<00:05:48.220> to

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
outside of the egg rows we're going to

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.800 
outside of the egg rows we're going to
keep<00:05:48.430> flipping<00:05:48.849> that<00:05:49.030> cuz<00:05:49.210> we<00:05:49.360> don't<00:05:49.510> want<00:05:49.720> it

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
keep flipping that cuz we don't want it

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.900 
keep flipping that cuz we don't want it
to<00:05:49.960> burn<00:05:50.169> we<00:05:50.440> don't<00:05:50.620> we<00:05:50.950> want<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.639> toast

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
to burn we don't we want it to toast

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.680

toast<00:05:52.840> evenly<00:05:53.320> all<00:05:53.620> over<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.300> only<00:05:55.479> takes

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
toast evenly all over so it only takes

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.990 
toast evenly all over so it only takes
about<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.080> minute<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.650> tell<00:05:56.860> some<00:05:57.220> miniature
