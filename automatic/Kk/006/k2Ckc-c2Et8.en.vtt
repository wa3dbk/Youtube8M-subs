hey guys this is cody's building tips

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.730 
hey guys this is cody's building tips
number<00:00:03.670> one<00:00:04.019> we're<00:00:05.019> going<00:00:05.109> to<00:00:05.169> be<00:00:05.319> taking<00:00:05.470> a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740 
number one we're going to be taking a

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.180 
number one we're going to be taking a
look<00:00:05.859> at<00:00:06.009> trim<00:00:06.309> today

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:08.190 
look at trim today

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.680 
look at trim today
okay<00:00:09.190> so<00:00:09.250> up<00:00:09.610> here<00:00:09.639> you'll<00:00:09.969> see<00:00:10.059> I<00:00:10.180> have<00:00:10.450> some

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
okay so up here you'll see I have some

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.170 
okay so up here you'll see I have some
trim<00:00:10.990> already<00:00:11.260> set<00:00:11.440> up<00:00:11.530> on<00:00:11.650> this<00:00:11.769> building<00:00:12.190> now

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
trim already set up on this building now

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.060 
trim already set up on this building now
it's<00:00:13.450> pretty<00:00:13.660> simple<00:00:13.990> it's<00:00:14.320> just<00:00:14.709> a<00:00:14.830> prime

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
it's pretty simple it's just a prime

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.930 
it's pretty simple it's just a prime
voxel<00:00:15.639> on<00:00:15.790> top<00:00:16.180> of<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.539> 45-degree<00:00:17.440> voxel<00:00:17.940> so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
voxel on top of a 45-degree voxel so

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.439 
voxel on top of a 45-degree voxel so
nothing<00:00:19.330> too<00:00:19.449> complicated<00:00:19.869> there<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:22.000> what<00:00:22.420> I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
nothing too complicated there but what I

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.329 
nothing too complicated there but what I
want<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.720> show<00:00:22.930> you<00:00:22.990> today<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.560> how<00:00:23.830> we<00:00:24.039> can

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:24.339 
want to show you today is how we can

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.429 
want to show you today is how we can
wrap<00:00:24.640> this<00:00:24.970> trim<00:00:25.689> around<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.230> square

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
wrap this trim around the square

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.130 
wrap this trim around the square
building<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.130> have<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.759> clean<00:00:28.210> look<00:00:28.749> to<00:00:28.990> it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
building and have a clean look to it

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.140 
building and have a clean look to it
alright<00:00:29.859> so<00:00:30.039> first<00:00:30.249> thing<00:00:30.519> we<00:00:30.609> want<00:00:30.789> to<00:00:30.820> do<00:00:30.970> is

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
alright so first thing we want to do is

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.930 
alright so first thing we want to do is
grab<00:00:31.300> some<00:00:31.720> trim<00:00:33.660> control<00:00:34.660> copy<00:00:35.400> ctrl<00:00:36.400> V<00:00:36.640> and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
grab some trim control copy ctrl V and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.450 
grab some trim control copy ctrl V and
then<00:00:37.420> we're<00:00:37.540> going<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.690> hit<00:00:37.870> shift<00:00:38.200> tab<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:39.310> get

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
then we're going to hit shift tab to get

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.520 
then we're going to hit shift tab to get
our<00:00:39.640> rotation<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:40.480> then<00:00:40.960> we're<00:00:41.080> going<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> do

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
our rotation and then we're going to do

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.570 
our rotation and then we're going to do
the<00:00:41.950> mouse<00:00:42.160> wheel<00:00:42.460> down<00:00:42.790> one<00:00:43.270> time<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:45.460> we're

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
the mouse wheel down one time then we're

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.790 
the mouse wheel down one time then we're
going<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.730> position<00:00:46.270> it

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.770 

and<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> position<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> trim<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.629> want

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and when you position the trim you want

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.479 
and when you position the trim you want
to<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:51.960> sure<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.590> overlapping<00:00:53.070> by

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to make sure that it's overlapping by

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.229 
to make sure that it's overlapping by
one<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> sticks<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:56.090> okay<00:00:57.090> now

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
one so it sticks out like that okay now

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.740 
one so it sticks out like that okay now
that<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.899> trim<00:00:58.170> where<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.470> want<00:00:58.710> it

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
that we have the trim where we want it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.340 
that we have the trim where we want it
let's<00:01:00.750> correct<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.649> wall<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.050> easiest

let's correct this wall and the easiest
way<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> correct<00:01:05.309> flat<00:01:05.670> walls<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.690> select

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
way to correct flat walls is just select

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.870 
way to correct flat walls is just select
it<00:01:07.759> select<00:01:08.759> your<00:01:08.880> ad<00:01:09.450> tool<00:01:10.550> make<00:01:11.550> sure<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it select your ad tool make sure you

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.680 
it select your ad tool make sure you
have<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> correct<00:01:12.950> texture<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.190> just<00:01:15.150> pop<00:01:15.540> it

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
have the correct texture and just pop it

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.310 
have the correct texture and just pop it
in<00:01:16.190> okay<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:17.250> let's<00:01:18.210> try<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> fix<00:01:18.690> up<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.050> trim

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
in okay so let's try to fix up this trim

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.290 
in okay so let's try to fix up this trim
so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.590> look<00:01:19.710> smooth<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.610> first<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.210> going

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
to take our smooth tool

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
to take our smooth tool
on<00:01:23.609> the<00:01:23.820> smallest<00:01:24.149> square<00:01:24.600> setting<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
on the smallest square setting and we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.380 
on the smallest square setting and we
want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.219> make<00:01:26.280> sure<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.759> it's<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.119> the

the end but we don't want to go past the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.139 
the end but we don't want to go past the
end<00:01:51.890> that's<00:01:52.280> important<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.820> will<00:01:52.939> do<00:01:53.030> the

end that's important and will do the
same<00:01:53.180> thing<00:01:53.509> for<00:01:53.659> this<00:01:53.810> side

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
same thing for this side

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.950 
same thing for this side
you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.039 

okay<00:02:01.650> now<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> looking<00:02:02.220> better<00:02:02.900> but<00:02:03.900> it's

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
okay now it's looking better but it's

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.430 
okay now it's looking better but it's
not<00:02:04.110> perfect<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.659> let's<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> get<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.380> a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
not perfect so let's have you get with a

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.270 
not perfect so let's have you get with a
smooth<00:02:07.680> tool<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> bottom<00:02:08.610> portion

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.880 

correct<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.120> wall

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.600 

and<00:02:16.010> there<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.560> nice<00:02:18.560> clean<00:02:18.980> 45

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610
