00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.109
 coffee expert

 lv reeds and then they 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.890
 Pitcher reduced to a thousand euro orally and also something very beautiful 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.280
 to deliver 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.840
 to the function of the elfferich well there he is 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.340
 silver messed up with familiar menu 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.660
 for a point through a runner that minute 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.610
 of a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.060
 two espresso 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.640
 two regular coffee 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.980
 a bigger one 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.110
 and a latte macchiato 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.900
 and a cappuccino 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.340
 can you with one 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.930
 a button start operation is started hour per week 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.130
 and very high class and then you see here 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.660
 can't lose 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.010
 among these 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 camps china to learn it is zemst system 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.040
 to make a demo 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.770
 at least a double espresso 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.039
 and some what the market are talking about 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.640
 some cappuccino 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 is terribly handy and it is also adjustable in height 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.850
 now it's time for a scoop 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 then a cappuccino 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
 I have to turn the coffee spout says he can start the ek 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.310
 6 the other side was really inciting 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.400
 I notice that the mill is a bit quieter than I am used to 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.409
 later the randmeren returned to us 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.200
 because to one 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.470
 and that makes a difference it does make the system the atmosphere 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.650
 whole 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.180
 have entered into 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.720
 besides that milk cup that have caught members of a different type that is 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.870
 optionally save the chance with another cup of course or the suit 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.759
 milk on the other hand tube 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.299
 is included 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.779
 now he is going to find fifteen barton peter drucker 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.359
 for the coffee 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.939
 to pivot to this channel 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.159
 and then I'm curious 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.819
 how it makes cappuccinos 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.289
 because that is me 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.799
 not only curious about 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.089
 and also convinced that it will work out in practice 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.789
 met via this number and that may apply but look at it 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.079
 that image 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.079
 it is built 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.589
 I can still start here 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.159
 that is a cool water market 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.230
 could make two of them 21 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.359
 in action 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.539
 that's nice didn't have to be any time 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.710
 we go to a very important element for taste 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.369
 when coffee 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.319
 here you have the adjustment 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.189
 of the once 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.640
 that is guaranteed to beyoncÃ© that the facts stand 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.400
 or to guarantee that we know that a nice coffee can come out 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.439
 what that eye has is and 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.889
 i got you for decaf 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.049
 per portion 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.099
 can here 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:35.039
 ground decaf in for if you have a guest or yourself 

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.239
 that has a tendency to go 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.479
 the z group 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:41.619
 quintiq in the side heli 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.969
 I don't know that trick 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.589
 there is a robert you 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.589
 and that comes out a book 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.709
 that is suitable for people like you and me all 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.490
 3 not the erp 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.579
 read about this 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:03:59.969
 then remains to be seen 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.519
 everything in image and icon 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.799
 costa's handy 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.379
 the set group 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:06.509
 step there 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.129
 the coffee is brewing 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.639
 there is the press chief 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.239
 that's the thing that you 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.789
 but all kinds of weird sounds happen but it helps 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.120
 all the more so if that man has done his job 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.169
 with ceramic discs which is very important 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.279
 and the coffee is reached by 15 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.020
 then you are done 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.909
 this group ouvry don't put it's poles 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.909
 because the machine does that itself 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.289
 very important is the maintenance of the coffee machine 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:38.729
 in addition to the type of rinsing of the z group 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.159
 you have to descale 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.759
 assume that once or six a year is therefore very important every two months 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.270
 is that he next 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.099
 descaling 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.099
 the machine also has to be a number of times a year and we have to go with it 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.999
 that is done with gun dil 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.900
 and this pill 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.400
 depending on the machine 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.800
 is often added to the water or in a separate compartment 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.520
 of course this is for sale 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520
 to tell us care for a whole year 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:18.009
 people killed nespresso what do you expect from a car or cappuccino or a large cow 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:18.960
