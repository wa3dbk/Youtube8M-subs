up I figured they meant this one
so<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.240> some<00:00:24.269> ideas<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.050> cuz<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.260> says

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
so have some ideas for it cuz it says

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.970 
so have some ideas for it cuz it says
you<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.769> place<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.300> thing<00:00:27.300> into<00:00:27.980> at

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you have to place the thing into at

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.529 
you have to place the thing into at
least<00:00:29.220> five<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> eight<00:00:29.760> centimeters<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.510> water

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
least five to eight centimeters of water

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.139 
least five to eight centimeters of water
and<00:00:30.990> obviously<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.769> water<00:00:31.980> just<00:00:32.940> in

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and obviously I don't have water just in

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.650 
and obviously I don't have water just in
my<00:00:33.329> Krusty's<00:00:33.750> tank<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.489> figured<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
my Krusty's tank so I figured right I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.470 
my Krusty's tank so I figured right I
could<00:00:37.170> put<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.190> tub<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.879> little<00:00:39.300> tub<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
could put it in a tub a little tub of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
could put it in a tub a little tub of
water<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.020> could<00:00:40.200> oh<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> thought<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.010> could

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
water and I could oh I thought I could

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
water and I could oh I thought I could
put<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.300> skull<00:00:42.960> hide<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
put it in the skull hide that I have for

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.560 
put it in the skull hide that I have for
my<00:00:43.950> crested<00:00:44.309> gecko<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.329> could<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.539> come

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
my crested gecko and it could all come

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.569 
my crested gecko and it could all come
out<00:00:45.899> it'd<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.170> really<00:00:46.320> awesome<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
could put it at the back of the tank and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.349 
could put it at the back of the tank and
for<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> spoking<00:00:58.109> system<00:00:59.000> that<00:01:00.000> hasn't

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
for the spoking system that hasn't

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.040 
for the spoking system that hasn't
arrived

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
arrived

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.740 
arrived
but<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> fogging<00:01:01.590> system<00:01:02.100> has<00:01:02.250> today<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
but the fogging system has today and you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
but the fogging system has today and you
can<00:01:03.840> imagine<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.530> surprise<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.909> turned

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
can imagine my surprise when this turned

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.980 
can imagine my surprise when this turned
up<00:01:06.530> so<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.979> beyond<00:01:08.729> why<00:01:08.939> expected<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.780> I'm

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
up so this is beyond why expected so I'm

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.920 
up so this is beyond why expected so I'm
so<00:01:10.229> happy<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.560> now<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.180> firstly<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so happy right now so firstly and this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
so happy right now so firstly and this
is<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.939> Terra<00:01:14.939> fog<00:01:16.740> system<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.250> guess

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is a Terra fog system I guess

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.130 
is a Terra fog system I guess
and<00:01:17.750> firstly<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.950> tube<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.140> then

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and firstly we have this tube and then

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.920 
and firstly we have this tube and then
we<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.310> sticks<00:01:23.970> inside<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.600> glass

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
we have this sticks inside of the glass

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.120 
we have this sticks inside of the glass
and<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> believe<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.960> fog<00:01:28.740> actually

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and and I believe that the fog actually

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.359 
and and I believe that the fog actually
comes<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> top<00:01:29.759> um<00:01:30.710> no<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:32.040> stick

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
comes out the top um no you like stick

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.510 
comes out the top um no you like stick
it<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.439> if<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.829> stuck<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it down and if this was stuck to the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
it down and if this was stuck to the
glass<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> tank<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.810> then<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> comes

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
glass of the tank and then it comes

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.780 
glass of the tank and then it comes
through<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> mesh<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.780> then

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
through the mesh and then

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.450 
through the mesh and then
the<00:01:41.690> main<00:01:41.930> part<00:01:42.260> which<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.770> was<00:01:43.250> really

now please bear with me because I am
doing<00:02:37.670> this<00:02:37.850> like<00:02:38.750> its<00:02:39.080> brand<00:02:39.290> new<00:02:39.500> so

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
doing this like its brand new so

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.540 
doing this like its brand new so
apparently<00:02:41.990> what<00:02:42.290> we<00:02:42.410> do<00:02:42.620> is<00:02:44.680> connect<00:02:45.680> this

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
apparently what we do is connect this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.370 
apparently what we do is connect this
part<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:48.590> part<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.330> this<00:02:50.600> end<00:02:50.930> goes

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
part this part and I think this end goes

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.850 
part this part and I think this end goes
in<00:02:51.860> here<00:02:53.380> um<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.950> then<00:02:56.050> click<00:02:57.050> this<00:02:57.350> part<00:02:57.680> to

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
in here um and then click this part to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.860 
in here um and then click this part to
the<00:02:57.950> machine<00:02:59.739> which<00:03:00.739> I'm<00:03:01.700> assuming<00:03:01.820> goes<00:03:02.570> in

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
the machine which I'm assuming goes in

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.270 
the machine which I'm assuming goes in
here<00:03:03.320> yeah<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.220> fits<00:03:04.670> pretty<00:03:04.910> securely<00:03:05.360> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
here yeah that fits pretty securely and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.720 
here yeah that fits pretty securely and
fix<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.489> elbow<00:03:07.940> pipe<00:03:08.180> which<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.840> this<00:03:09.700> well<00:03:10.700> on

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
fix the elbow pipe which is this well on

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.850 
fix the elbow pipe which is this well on
the<00:03:11.000> back<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> glass<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.260> that<00:03:12.290> means<00:03:12.680> my

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
the back of the glass so that means my

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.140 
the back of the glass so that means my
tank<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:14.239> quite<00:03:14.450> easy<00:03:14.720> setup<00:03:15.850> okay<00:03:16.850> so<00:03:16.910> I've

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
tank is quite easy setup okay so I've

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.020 
tank is quite easy setup okay so I've
set<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.420> up<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.959> side<00:03:18.019> um<00:03:18.860> it's<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.880> little

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
set it up on this side um it's a little

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.610 
set it up on this side um it's a little
bit<00:03:20.209> difficult<00:03:20.390> cuz<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.810> rarely<00:03:21.019> achieve<00:03:21.500> is

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
bit difficult cuz it rarely achieve is

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.270 
bit difficult cuz it rarely achieve is
so<00:03:21.800> long<00:03:22.100> it<00:03:22.850> does<00:03:23.090> they<00:03:23.300> keep<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.660> straight

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
so long it does they keep it straight

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.979 
so long it does they keep it straight
it's<00:03:25.280> not<00:03:25.459> kinked<00:03:25.970> everywhere<00:03:26.360> anyway<00:03:26.780> it's

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
it's not kinked everywhere anyway it's

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.020 
it's not kinked everywhere anyway it's
just<00:03:27.080> slightly<00:03:27.709> loose<00:03:28.040> so<00:03:28.459> hopefully<00:03:28.820> this

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
just slightly loose so hopefully this

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.600 
just slightly loose so hopefully this
will<00:03:29.209> be<00:03:29.360> fine<00:03:29.570> um<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.400> obviously

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
will be fine um and this obviously

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.540 
will be fine um and this obviously
requires<00:03:32.150> being<00:03:32.420> plugged<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.680> now<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.310> think

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
requires being plugged in so now I think

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.570 
requires being plugged in so now I think
I<00:03:34.610> need<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.790> fill<00:03:35.000> this<00:03:35.090> up<00:03:35.150> water<00:03:36.400> okay<00:03:37.400> guys

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
I need to fill this up water okay guys

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.540 
I need to fill this up water okay guys
so<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.390> filled<00:03:38.870> up<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> little<00:03:39.440> bit<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.709> water<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
so I filled up a little bit of water and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.330 
so I filled up a little bit of water and
it<00:03:41.330> should<00:03:41.690> be<00:03:41.900> coming<00:03:42.200> out<00:03:42.320> over<00:03:42.620> there<00:03:43.130> when

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
it should be coming out over there when

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.860 
it should be coming out over there when
I<00:03:43.370> turn<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.820> on<00:03:46.209> okay<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.330> should<00:03:47.390> be<00:03:47.660> on<00:03:47.750> its

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
