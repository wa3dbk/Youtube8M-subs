00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
ones in the center all right now

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.389

then those down this way just like that

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.150 
then those down this way just like that
we<00:00:52.969> want<00:00:53.149> these<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.539> be<00:00:54.219> pretty<00:00:55.219> thick<00:00:56.020> and

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
we want these to be pretty thick and

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.860 
we want these to be pretty thick and
give<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:58.250> some<00:00:58.399> width<00:01:01.329> all<00:01:02.329> right

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
give it some width all right

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.609 
give it some width all right
sub<00:01:03.800> patch<00:01:04.039> that<00:01:04.930> take<00:01:05.930> these<00:01:06.050> two<00:01:06.259> endpoints

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
sub patch that take these two endpoints

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.430 
sub patch that take these two endpoints
here<00:01:07.190> just<00:01:08.149> the<00:01:08.300> two<00:01:08.450> end<00:01:08.630> points<00:01:11.200> move<00:01:12.200> those

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
here just the two end points move those

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.130 
here just the two end points move those
a<00:01:12.470> bit<00:01:12.740> out<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:17.289> subdivide<00:01:18.289> that<00:01:18.910> shifty

grab these points here move them down a
bit<00:01:31.479> all<00:01:32.479> right<00:01:32.830> add<00:01:33.830> these<00:01:34.550> end<00:01:34.849> points<00:01:35.119> here

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
bit all right add these end points here

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:49.610

ghost<00:02:55.450> like<00:02:55.660> looking<00:02:55.959> thing<00:02:56.170> it's<00:02:56.739> a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
ghost like looking thing it's a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.530 
ghost like looking thing it's a
surprisingly<00:02:57.430> simple<00:02:57.670> model<00:02:58.209> but<00:02:58.239> when<00:02:58.450> we

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
surprisingly simple model but when we

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.150 
surprisingly simple model but when we
add<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.870> cloth<00:02:59.140> dynamics<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.830> gonna<00:02:59.980> get<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
add the cloth dynamics is gonna get a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.699 
add the cloth dynamics is gonna get a
lot<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:01.470> slick<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:04.350> lot<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.440> really

tutorial<00:03:27.640> let's<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.120> turn<00:03:28.209> on<00:03:28.420> smoothing

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
tutorial let's just turn on smoothing

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.830 
tutorial let's just turn on smoothing
and<00:03:29.230> double<00:03:29.440> sided<00:03:29.650> for<00:03:29.890> now<00:03:30.660> okay

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
and double sided for now okay

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.110 
and double sided for now okay
modeling<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.530> more<00:03:32.799> or<00:03:32.920> less<00:03:32.950> done<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.640> know<00:03:33.910> it
