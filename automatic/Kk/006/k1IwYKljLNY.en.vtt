00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.170
 I have just completed a mission in 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.450
 France where I took part in the invitation 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.499
 of the french president since françois 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.789
 holland at the african franco forum for 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.610
 shared growth 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:20.570
 this forum which also saw the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.660
 participation of heads of state ali bongo 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.410
 of Gabon beyond the most Gabonese 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.140
 macky sall from senegal over 50 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.660
 ministers both over 500 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.240
 French and African companies 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.880
 marks the progress of the work of the 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.050
 French- African foundation chaired by 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.670
 the Franco-Beninese economist lionel 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.460
 zinsou 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.190
 this franco african foundation or 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 africa france aims to both strengthen 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.079
 partnership and to stimulate 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.840
 investments between africa and 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.360
 France to gather all energies 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.460
 it was therefore a question of taking stock of 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.610
 economic relations between France and 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.880
 africa africa and governed will be a 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.210
 growth of about 5% a year since 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.460
 almost two decades and presents 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 many investment opportunities 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.790
 so during this forum I had 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.030
 the opportunity to deliver a speech on 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.590
 public-private partnerships a concept 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.100
 important for development in 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.979
 Africa 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.030
 I indicated that the Ivory Coast soon 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.909
 1959 had therefore put in place a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.100
 public-private partnership with smoked 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.380
 sodeci with regard to 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.380
 the drinking water supply of the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.080
 city ​​of abidjan and afterwards of course 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.549
 we have other partnerships 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.700
 private public that I also mentioned 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:55.820
 so I indicated that in fact there are some 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.630
 important and growing designs of our 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.240
 populations 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.119
 while the states means are 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.369
 limited so we have to work 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.430
 with the private sector as part of 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.410
 this private public partnership to have 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.250
 more resources 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.620
 in the field of 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.750
 infrastructure 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.549
 investment needs are 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.290
 estimated for Africa to more than 100 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.019
 billions of dollars 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.379
 and while the public sector in our 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.959
 country and with the nerves of development 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.110
 can only give half so he 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.450
 we have 50 billion dollars left 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 sought high level so of the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.310
 private sector as part of the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.560
 private public partnership 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 I seized the opportunity of this forum 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.540
 to encourage companies in particular 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.599
 French companies to work 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 with the Ivorian private sector and 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.760
 respond to the calls for tender that we 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.340
 let's launch each time to be able to 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.180
 choose companies regarding this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.280
 project I also indicated that the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.140
 Ivorian firms had 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.629
 working to make sure 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.180
 participate with companies 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.549
 in the framework of its 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.819
 tenders to be lodged also 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.340
 urged the French private sector account 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.620
 given its expertise to become still 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.630
 more numerous in Côte d'Ivoire these 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.359
 companies to contribute to the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.120
 training and youth employment 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.879
 Iranians there I want to thank them 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.209
 obviously the French president 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.510
 holland for the album his invitation 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.549
 I also welcomed his commitment to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.280
 security issues in the under 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.609
 region in on the continent and in the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.609
 world 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:44.680
 because without security there can not be 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.660
 of development and I believe they 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.870
 give the example hours as to the 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.180
 need for more security for 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.650
 country that we are this forum and 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 brings together a large number of companies 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.250
 French Ivorian galbas and this 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.790
 strengthened contacts and 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.920
 partnership between companies 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.500
 French and Ivorian 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.340
 a win-win partnership she has 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.530
 obviously the state paris I followed the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.620
 qualification of our team 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.010

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.280
 of Africa from the nations of the can and I am 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.169
 I maintained at the end of the match 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.020

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
 pride 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.230
 I also asked him to congratulate 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.960
 the coach as well as in 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.490
 technical supervision and all those who 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.220
 went to support our team 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.710
 in particular the chairman of the meeting 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.780
 national that I had also for 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.180

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.479

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.710
 successively two cameroon bath 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.850
 Algeria is there the republic 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.610
 democratic of the congo 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.610
 it had to be done so it's the same 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.800
 an outstanding performance and this 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.910
 gives us a lot of hope and so 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.750
 like all Ivorians 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.210
