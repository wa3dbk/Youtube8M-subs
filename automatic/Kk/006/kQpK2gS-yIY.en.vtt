they<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.780> produced<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.290> long<00:01:37.530> line<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> solid

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
they have produced a long line of solid

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.740 
they have produced a long line of solid
Terrance<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.820> SKT<00:01:39.180> would<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.450> always

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Terrance and SKT would have always

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
Terrance and SKT would have always
produced<00:01:40.020> good<00:01:40.200> sharing<00:01:40.470> players<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.280> hope<00:01:41.520> he

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
produced good sharing players so hope he

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.460 
produced good sharing players so hope he
for<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> new<00:01:43.229> hope<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
for them is probably the new hope and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.749 
for them is probably the new hope and
and<00:01:43.649> shutter<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.220> actually<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and shutter is actually going for a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.219 
and shutter is actually going for a
double<00:01:44.909> bearing<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.479> shadow<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
double bearing so shadow is going for a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.420 
double bearing so shadow is going for a
rush<00:01:46.409> he's<00:01:46.680> actually<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> start<00:01:47.220> off<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
rush he's actually to start off the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
rush he's actually to start off the
second<00:01:47.759> barracks<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> that's<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.020> bold

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
second barracks and that's in a bold

contrast to a lot of other protesters
ever<00:03:19.850> seen<00:03:20.030> actually<00:03:20.390> bring<00:03:20.510> these<00:03:20.660> probes

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
ever seen actually bring these probes

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.120 
ever seen actually bring these probes
out<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.050> Brock<00:03:21.170> them<00:03:21.410> because<00:03:21.890> he<00:03:21.980> probably

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
out to Brock them because he probably

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.820 
out to Brock them because he probably
realizes<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.700> shutter<00:03:23.030> cannot<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:23.830> medics

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
realizes that shutter cannot have medics

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.949 
realizes that shutter cannot have medics
yet<00:03:24.980> he<00:03:25.070> cannot<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.459> stems<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.510> I<00:03:26.750> think

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
yet he cannot have stems and and I think

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.509 
yet he cannot have stems and and I think
without<00:03:27.140> stems<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.590> medics<00:03:28.010> it<00:03:28.130> greatly

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
without stems and medics it greatly

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.370 
without stems and medics it greatly
weakens<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.209> power<00:03:29.390> of<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:29.660> rush<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.260> it's

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
weakens the power of this rush but it's

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.720 
weakens the power of this rush but it's
gonna<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.890> shot<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> good<00:03:31.250> idea<00:03:31.580> and

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
gonna be just you shot a good idea and

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.430 
gonna be just you shot a good idea and
then<00:03:31.850> any<00:03:32.090> time<00:03:32.300> has<00:03:32.510> got<00:03:32.630> a<00:03:32.660> Zenith<00:03:33.200> out<00:03:33.320> as

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
then any time has got a Zenith out as

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.390 
then any time has got a Zenith out as
well<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.769> looks<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.040> me<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.160> don't<00:03:34.340> think

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
well so it looks to me I don't think

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.830 
well so it looks to me I don't think
this<00:03:34.640> rush<00:03:34.850> is<00:03:34.970> gonna<00:03:35.120> be<00:03:35.180> successful<00:03:35.600> I'm<00:03:35.690> not

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
sure if she was gonna be able to pull

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.350 
sure if she was gonna be able to pull
this<00:03:36.920> off<00:03:37.100> Cheryl<00:03:37.670> go<00:03:37.730> streaming<00:03:38.120> in<00:03:38.209> without

all those stds he does have a lot of SCV

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.770 
all those stds he does have a lot of SCV
then<00:03:40.100> he's<00:03:40.489> prob<00:03:40.640> E's<00:03:40.790> gonna<00:03:40.880> try<00:03:41.120> uses<00:03:41.390> SED<00:03:41.690> to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
then he's prob E's gonna try uses SED to

then he's prob E's gonna try uses SED to
fight<00:03:41.930> anytime<00:03:42.230> you<00:03:42.290> sure<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.440> put<00:03:42.530> up<00:03:42.620> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
fight anytime you sure to put up a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.110 
fight anytime you sure to put up a
second<00:03:42.920> gate<00:03:43.010> we<00:03:43.100> try<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.340> counter<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.760> he

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
second gate we try and counter this he

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.220 
second gate we try and counter this he
has<00:03:44.300> that<00:03:44.390> sunburn<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.840> corner<00:03:45.080> up<00:03:45.140> so

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
has that sunburn in this corner up so

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.360 
has that sunburn in this corner up so
he's<00:03:45.320> probably<00:03:45.410> using<00:03:45.769> some<00:03:45.830> units<00:03:46.130> from<00:03:46.190> this

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
he's probably using some units from this

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.770 
he's probably using some units from this
so<00:03:46.459> just<00:03:46.670> depends<00:03:46.910> if<00:03:47.209> shutter<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.570> protect

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
so just depends if shutter can protect

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.110 
so just depends if shutter can protect
his<00:03:47.930> marine<00:03:48.140> or<00:03:48.260> not<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.730> anytime<00:03:49.730> is<00:03:49.970> trying
