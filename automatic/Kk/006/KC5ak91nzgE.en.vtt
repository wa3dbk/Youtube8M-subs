00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
interesting to find out because for a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.700 
interesting to find out because for a
while<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> was<00:01:18.180> always<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.479> why<00:01:19.470> would

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
leads to question or you know like seven

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
leads to question or you know like seven
years<00:01:24.750> ago<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.140> were<00:01:25.229> teaching<00:01:25.470> humans

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
again so was this in preparation for

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.060 
again so was this in preparation for

all the people that taught you know when
me<00:01:34.500> guys<00:01:34.890> dealing<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.369> whatnot<00:01:35.640> did<00:01:35.850> they

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
me guys dealing and whatnot did they

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.539

for<00:01:38.579> another<00:01:38.939> war<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.200> maybe<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> Dragons

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
for another war so maybe the Dragons

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:41.719

maybe the Dragons were dealt with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
maybe the Dragons were dealt with
beforehand<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:43.860> they<00:01:44.130> don't<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.940 
beforehand because they don't want the
history<00:01:45.420> repeating<00:01:46.049> itself<00:01:46.140> whoever<00:01:46.680> did

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
history repeating itself whoever did

have<00:03:07.540> been<00:03:07.660> talking<00:03:07.780> about<00:03:07.930> humans<00:03:08.560> but

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
have been talking about humans but

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.560 
have been talking about humans but
either<00:03:09.400> way<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.730> still<00:03:09.850> was<00:03:10.120> interesting

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
either way it still was interesting

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.690 
either way it still was interesting
because<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:11.320> saw<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.770> forget<00:03:12.550> exactly

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
because we saw that I forget exactly

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.010 
because we saw that I forget exactly
what<00:03:12.970> chapter<00:03:13.300> was<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.750> it<00:03:13.840> was<00:03:13.930> like

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
what chapter was and it was like

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.300 
what chapter was and it was like
somebody<00:03:14.290> would<00:03:14.410> start<00:03:14.739> fighting<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.160> dragon

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
somebody would start fighting a dragon

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.729 
somebody would start fighting a dragon
on<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> tablet<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.959> tablet<00:03:17.320> like<00:03:17.410> an<00:03:17.560> ancient

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
on a tablet not a tablet like an ancient

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.060 
on a tablet not a tablet like an ancient
scripture<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:18.790> something<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:20.070> why

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
scripture or something like that and why

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.800 
scripture or something like that and why
didn't<00:03:21.430> he<00:03:21.549> recognize<00:03:21.730> not<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.360> immediately

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
didn't he recognize not so immediately

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.660 
didn't he recognize not so immediately
or<00:03:22.959> say<00:03:23.170> where<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.709> got<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.890> star<00:03:24.250> from<00:03:24.489> or

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
or say where you got that star from or

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.490 
or say where you got that star from or
anything<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.510> was<00:03:25.690> interesting<00:03:26.260> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
anything so that was interesting and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.229 
anything so that was interesting and
overall<00:03:27.310> this<00:03:27.400> chapter<00:03:27.730> was<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.030> really

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
overall this chapter was just really

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.580 
overall this chapter was just really
crazy<00:03:28.420> because<00:03:28.630> then<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.019> ends<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:29.470> that

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
crazy because then it ends up with that

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.930 
crazy because then it ends up with that
white<00:03:29.799> knight<00:03:30.040> guy<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.310> forget<00:03:30.549> his<00:03:30.760> name<00:03:30.790> but

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
he comes with Yukino and he's like um

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.820 
he comes with Yukino and he's like um
that's<00:03:34.120> impossible<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.989> he<00:03:35.530> says<00:03:35.799> uh

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
that's impossible and he says uh

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.610 
that's impossible and he says uh
although<00:03:36.519> some<00:03:37.209> of<00:03:37.239> the<00:03:37.390> most<00:03:38.019> of<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.290> facts

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.440 
although some of the most of the facts
that<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.920> dragon<00:03:39.310> sensor<00:03:39.670> Kony's<00:03:40.000> was

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.840 
that Sheriff turned them into what they
were<00:03:52.090> those<00:03:52.510> beasts<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.019> they<00:03:53.110> became<00:03:53.440> and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850

why<00:03:57.070> would<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.670> zirconias<00:03:58.299> ran<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.540> lie<00:03:58.840> unless

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
why would the zirconias ran a lie unless

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.470 
why would the zirconias ran a lie unless
does<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.310> Kony's<00:04:00.580> dragon<00:04:00.880> was<00:04:00.970> just<00:04:01.000> talking

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
does the Kony's dragon was just talking

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.570 
does the Kony's dragon was just talking
like<00:04:01.630> some<00:04:02.500> that<00:04:02.650> he<00:04:02.680> didn't<00:04:03.100> really

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
like some that he didn't really

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.280 
like some that he didn't really
quite<00:04:03.760> understand<00:04:04.299> correctly<00:04:04.600> but<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.959> think

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
quite understand correctly but I think

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.800 
quite understand correctly but I think
this<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:06.370> too<00:04:06.670> hard<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> trust<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.390> guy<00:04:07.600> he

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
this it's too hard to trust this guy he

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.530 
this it's too hard to trust this guy he
seems<00:04:08.079> to<00:04:08.769> evil<00:04:09.310> like<00:04:09.700> you<00:04:09.850> know<00:04:09.940> he<00:04:10.090> just<00:04:10.120> has

this<00:04:10.690> really<00:04:10.900> bad<00:04:11.140> vibe<00:04:11.410> about<00:04:11.500> him<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
this really bad vibe about him and the

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.729 
this really bad vibe about him and the
fact<00:04:12.730> that<00:04:12.790> Yuki<00:04:13.120> knows<00:04:13.299> with<00:04:13.480> him<00:04:13.660> I<00:04:13.959> still

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739

say<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:14.980> Yuki<00:04:15.340> knows<00:04:15.519> being<00:04:15.760> tricked<00:04:16.120> into

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
say that Yuki knows being tricked into

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.060 
say that Yuki knows being tricked into
thinking<00:04:16.750> whatever<00:04:17.380> he's<00:04:17.560> saying<00:04:17.799> oh<00:04:17.919> we're

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
because Sarah outside of when he

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.690 
because Sarah outside of when he
seemingly<00:04:22.660> awoke<00:04:23.169> towards<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.099> end<00:04:24.280> before

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
seemingly awoke towards the end before

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.870 
don't know for me personally I think
that<00:04:29.020> he<00:04:29.110> just<00:04:29.140> wants<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.650> deal<00:04:29.950> with<00:04:30.100> zero<00:04:30.370> so

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
that he just wants to deal with zero so

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.270 
that he just wants to deal with zero so
that<00:04:31.060> he<00:04:31.180> could<00:04:31.390> summon<00:04:31.600> whatever<00:04:32.050> or<00:04:32.380> start<00:04:33.130> a

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
question why did he not want to speak

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.430 
question why did he not want to speak
with<00:04:45.760> humans<00:04:46.240> if<00:04:46.510> he<00:04:46.720> was<00:04:46.870> once<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.170> him<00:04:47.290> maybe

with humans if he was once of him maybe

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.900 
with humans if he was once of him maybe
he<00:04:47.650> resents<00:04:48.040> him<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.340> not<00:04:48.460> because<00:04:48.700> he<00:04:48.790> kind

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
he resents him it's not because he kind

he resents him it's not because he kind
of<00:04:49.030> wishes<00:04:49.600> he<00:04:49.930> wasn't<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.320> dragon<00:04:50.500> because

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
of wishes he wasn't a dragon because

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.460 
of wishes he wasn't a dragon because
remember<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:51.520> was<00:04:51.670> like<00:04:51.990> he<00:04:52.990> understands

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
remember it was like he understands

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.890 
remember it was like he understands
humans<00:04:53.830> but<00:04:53.980> he<00:04:54.040> looks<00:04:54.820> down<00:04:55.030> upon<00:04:55.060> them<00:04:55.570> so

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
humans but he looks down upon them so

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.120 
humans but he looks down upon them so
that<00:04:56.050> was<00:04:56.140> interesting<00:04:56.560> as<00:04:56.650> well<00:04:56.800> you<00:04:56.980> think

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
that was interesting as well you think

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.520 
that was interesting as well you think
back<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:58.030> that<00:04:58.060> moment<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:58.690> also<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.320> fact

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
back to that moment and also the fact

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.990 
back to that moment and also the fact
that<00:04:59.590> act<00:04:59.830> melodia<00:05:00.280> when<00:05:00.400> he<00:05:00.460> comes<00:05:00.640> back<00:05:00.790> it's

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
that act melodia when he comes back it's

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.550 
that act melodia when he comes back it's
going<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.210> be<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.330> real<00:05:01.540> big<00:05:01.750> fight<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.080> if

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
going to be a real big fight because if

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.810 
going to be a real big fight because if
I'm<00:05:02.740> correct<00:05:02.890> he<00:05:03.070> wasn't<00:05:03.340> even<00:05:03.490> fighting<00:05:03.610> what

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
I'm correct he wasn't even fighting what

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.070 
I'm correct he wasn't even fighting what
it's<00:05:03.910> more<00:05:04.030> strength<00:05:04.360> against<00:05:04.660> any<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.960> them

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
it's more strength against any of them

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.840 
it's more strength against any of them
so<00:05:05.290> when<00:05:05.830> he<00:05:05.890> does<00:05:06.070> come<00:05:06.250> back<00:05:06.400> it's<00:05:06.580> going<00:05:06.760> to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
so when he does come back it's going to

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.460 
so when he does come back it's going to
be<00:05:06.910> freakin<00:05:07.210> amazing<00:05:07.270> I'm<00:05:07.750> really

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
be freakin amazing I'm really

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.170

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
to see him again because it was kind of

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.820 
to see him again because it was kind of
funny<00:05:30.700> and<00:05:30.910> if<00:05:31.540> somehow<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.930> dragons<00:05:32.470> do<00:05:32.650> get

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
revived or they get brought back from

revived or they get brought back from
wherever<00:05:35.230> they<00:05:35.470> are<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.770> ones<00:05:35.920> from<00:05:36.100> seven

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
wherever they are the ones from seven

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.520 
wherever they are the ones from seven
years<00:05:36.520> ago<00:05:36.640> like<00:05:36.940> igneel<00:05:37.390> and<00:05:37.840> whatnot<00:05:38.290> it's

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
years ago like igneel and whatnot it's

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.870 
years ago like igneel and whatnot it's
going<00:05:38.740> to<00:05:38.830> be<00:05:38.890> crazy<00:05:39.040> because<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.550> think<00:05:39.610> the

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
going to be crazy because I think the

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.270 
going to be crazy because I think the
acne<00:05:40.210> logia<00:05:40.570> is<00:05:40.630> probably<00:05:40.930> even<00:05:41.170> far<00:05:41.890> surpass

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
acne logia is probably even far surpass

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.910 
acne logia is probably even far surpass
them<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.730> strength<00:05:42.940> but<00:05:43.380> maybe<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.620> act<00:05:44.770> of

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
them and strength but maybe the act of

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.340 
them and strength but maybe the act of
logia<00:05:45.310> himself<00:05:46.150> was<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.750> one<00:05:46.900> that<00:05:47.020> got<00:05:47.140> rid

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
logia himself was the one that got rid

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.390 
logia himself was the one that got rid
of<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.500> dragons<00:05:47.920> because<00:05:48.070> they<00:05:48.340> were

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
of the dragons because they were

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.670 
of the dragons because they were
training<00:05:48.970> humans<00:05:49.510> and<00:05:49.690> whatnot

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
training humans and whatnot

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.930 
training humans and whatnot
let<00:05:51.040> me<00:05:51.100> know<00:05:51.190> what<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.370> think<00:05:51.460> about<00:05:51.640> that<00:05:51.790> do

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
let me know what you think about that do

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.610 
let me know what you think about that do
you<00:05:51.970> think<00:05:52.210> that<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.510> Dragons<00:05:53.050> knew<00:05:53.350> that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
you think that the Dragons knew that

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.170 
you think that the Dragons knew that
there<00:05:53.740> would<00:05:53.890> be<00:05:53.920> a<00:05:54.010> war<00:05:54.340> coming<00:05:54.640> soon<00:05:54.970> and

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
there would be a war coming soon and

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.220 
there would be a war coming soon and
that's<00:05:55.300> why<00:05:55.420> they<00:05:55.540> started<00:05:55.810> training<00:05:55.960> people

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
that's why they started training people

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.170 
that's why they started training people
like<00:05:56.470> Natsu<00:05:56.920> when<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.520> guys<00:05:57.730> deal<00:05:57.970> and

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
like Natsu when the guys deal and

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.120 
like Natsu when the guys deal and
whatnot<00:05:58.540> or<00:05:58.720> do<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.560> think<00:05:59.740> of<00:05:59.830> something

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
whatnot or do you think of something

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.380 
whatnot or do you think of something
else<00:06:00.280> and<00:06:00.520> what<00:06:00.580> are<00:06:00.670> your<00:06:00.730> hopes<00:06:00.910> on<00:06:01.270> this

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
else and what are your hopes on this

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.890 
else and what are your hopes on this
whole<00:06:01.570> thing<00:06:01.780> with<00:06:03.090> Sara<00:06:04.090> of<00:06:04.240> creating<00:06:04.750> and

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
solid like I would give it a 5 out of 5

solid like I would give it a 5 out of 5
if<00:06:27.670> I<00:06:27.760> had<00:06:27.910> to<00:06:28.000> give<00:06:28.120> it<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.270> rating<00:06:28.450> because<00:06:28.660> it
