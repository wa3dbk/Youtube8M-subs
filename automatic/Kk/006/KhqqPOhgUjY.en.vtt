00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.260
 hello everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.700
 teach how to delete emails 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 I basically know that some have 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.640
 problems that you can erase in your email 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.949
 from here and they really do not get deleted 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.650
 continue activating in your email already when 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.060
 they go to the internet and they see immense signs and 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.560
 for more than they put to erase then 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.500
 this is a way to solve that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.690
 way they are firstly linked within 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.640
 share and we are going to look for 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.160
 this from here not with sachs car anders 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900
 let's go into that inside here 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.360
 they can see their immense several and have 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.829
 one alone but one we're going to go to more common 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.970
 what would be harmmel 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.970
 and in here 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.480
 they have to go to trans go down 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.300
 advance 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.790
 and this is the important part many of 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.090
 you are going to have this little arrow here 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.220
 down which means that when they put that 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.930
 it deletes that something is deleted is going to go 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.269
 file or maybe it does not even have a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.310
 option of crime but that on chivas 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.840
 then they do not want to keep all your 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.759
 messages there are many messages 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.610
 treatments they want to erase they have 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.950
 to cover up here and that's how they make sure 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.950
 that is going to erase everything 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.950
 equally 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.870
 Down here 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.840
 where he says directly that his cousin and 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.600
 says never in fact that they have and the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.600
 I recommend changing to after one d 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.899
 if they have this, it has changed better 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.079
 down here also says 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.369
 a server that is also important what 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.130
 who says never have to change the same 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:58.229
 for example they can put every seven days 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.210
 that or know it when they put of it I 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.420
 I'm going to put this down here seriously 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.030
 because this is really going to take away 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.689
 all if not that I do not want my inbox 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.689
 so 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.989
 and has done those three things should 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.930
 work when they put elite in 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.090
 anything 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.640
 just to save these changes 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.159
 you just have to click here 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.829
 bump this part of here and thus saved 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.790
 all that they put we are going to put the 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.790
 they give up here 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.840
 and the same thing can be done with 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.599
 yahoo gmail or any other email that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:44.190
 have as icloud 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:47.069
 it's the easiest way to do it if it's 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.170
 that that still does not work for them there is another 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.900
 way but I suggest you do this 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.120
 First 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.319
 If it is not working for you, go to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.319
 your email here below 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.340
 instead of clicking on any of 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.010
 these go and for down counts 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.099
 and we're going to leave me one more time for 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.099
 example 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 they will click on after carrying some 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 things and to delete them to put edit 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.580
 and here below says you book 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.190
 but 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.500
 and this then this is another way 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.500
 delete your emails already when they have deleted 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.000
 pretty alone for this and it already has them 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.340
 a garbage and it should be erased 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.110
 totally from your garden 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.700
 but once again I have already made the changes 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.040
 that I taught them would not have to do 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 this but this is resolution if they continue 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.610
 having problems or have any 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.860
 ask about iphone ipad any 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.209
 product more and in fact any 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.069
 technology product can I 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.959
