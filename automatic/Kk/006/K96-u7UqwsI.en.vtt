00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.439
 ideas such as bait use to attract the wolf little ties until out of season 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.499
 but because it interests to kill so many wolves 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.409
 The recently approved management plan is based on a principle 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.300
 reduce conflict is to say kill only where there 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.439
 constant and significant attacks on livestock 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.349
 but in some areas that principle is broken 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.989
 in fountains carrionas the wolves caused damages in 2007 valued in 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:31.960
 just over two thousand euros are data from the board of Castilla y León 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.420
 However, in this area at least eleven copies were killed 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.900
 denunciation of ecologists and guardians 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.900
 we have the wolf in these areas as a hunting species 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.100
 say that even if the damage is the minimum in this area there in 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.110
 of the club of expectant margins calculated from rational use 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.950
 untie of the species as as cinegetic is to say that it is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.960
 perfectly legal law I insist that your model that what is this 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.120
 who has guaranteed today that the PCs to be extended to other areas do not 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.420
 The law of biodiversity allows to expand hunting quotas in situations 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.610
 exceptional 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.630
 of repeated attacks on cattle environmental groups denounce that this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.039
 legal argument serves to justify the killing of wolves 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.560
 in territories where this species is protected 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.930
 as to the south of the duero 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.520
 the shamelessness of this administration is that it has taken 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.400
 p an order in which 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.940
 that will establish some quotas directly from copies burned to kill 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.130
 To the south of the duero, he already assumes that he will be able to justify the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.280
 exceptionality 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280
 i'm not saying he's going to kill no matter what happens 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.539
 the controversy with the wolf never ends 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.070
 the breeders suffer it in the first person 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.840
 every year the predator causes damage to the cottages coded in about 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.510
 three hundred thousand euros 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.880
 from the application of the law of mad cow and then it has run out 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.670
 carrion 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.830
 and on each side to survive 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.840
 the owners complain that the compensations end festival 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.319
 Well, this is disappearing, but in the end, that part is not, because 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.440
 since we do not want pastor is weird has not meant either 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.369
 The problem we have is that our politicians 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.789
 the clearest philologist 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.789
 we say but they demanded the first 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.759
 all this has been 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:30.929
 not not pay with all ranchers as a prologue to chaos possible attacks 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.369
 and the hunters too 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.869
 rafa mora semester 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.699
 I always challenge 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.849
 specifically 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.849
 efe to be able to decalogue 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.790
 the new wolf management plan foresees new methods to accelerate the 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.169
 payment for damages caused by the wolf 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.709
 the purpose of the board reduce the processing time of a year or two 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.559
 to six months 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.559
 birds here here a small trail 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:04.839
 blasco of 'gray wolf' here 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.079
 they are quite difficult to learn from the dogs in this photo back the 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.629
 saw of the snake 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.760
 usually marks that an initiative that works has been launched 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.849
 other areas like the park quirós all in united states 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.989
 tourism around the wolf 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.499
 could be an alternative to hunting and also a possibility of development 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.499
 for a particularly depressed area 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.229
 in this year they are more for one hundred 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.649
 The city councils receive around 180 thousand euros 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.649
 down the sides auction of deer and say wolves 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.029
 but the potential that this has for the people who come does not kill I'm going to kill them 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.039
 heaven 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:43.039
 if not, it is infinitely superior 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.279
 In the sierra de la culebra, a center for the construction of 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.309
 interpretation of the Iberian wolf 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.019
 the mayor of puebla de sanabria has been the maximum promoter of this idea 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.109
 the town has renounced in several occasions to the money that corresponded 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.309
 for the hunting of the wolf because they have a very clear idea 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.539
 again worth more alive than dead 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:05.380
 since 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.999
 from 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.179
 this center in your visits 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.179
 we think they are not real 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.069
 it's a logical step that you do not see 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.069
 after summoning our armed men 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 who knows the wolf respects him 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.169
 It is the motto of this new tourism that is why these guided tours by biologists 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.169
 They teach us how their habitat are their customs and also the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.849
 traces that leaves and if luck ends the hair that everyone looks for 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.249
 berta a herd freedom 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.430
 what better than having them as we have them here 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.960
 Carlos Menem 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.320
 Stone shot of the sun is to be able to come 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.840
 the speaker and be able to enjoy the islands around midnight 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.309
 Tuesday 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.309
 It was wonderful 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.770
 Moses Rodriguez added to this the fact that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.170
 tourism could be an alternative for the wolf 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.919
 an opportunity to improve your image 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.969
 but before you start to question the 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.860
 There are many things to fix 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.689
 because while there are poachers while for the ranchers and an enemy while 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.300
 continue to kill more wolves than authorized this species will continue 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.610
 being on the tightrope and the wolf and man will continue to be a 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.910
 threatens one for the other
