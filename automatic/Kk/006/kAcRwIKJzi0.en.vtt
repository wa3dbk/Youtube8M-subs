00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 What the app love people again this year 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.359
 the tradition will be continued 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.300
 Get regular cool iOS and Android 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.219
 apps introduce five cool ones today 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 Android apps I use regularly 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 I hope you like it if so 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.350
 is then I'm just enormously high 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.510
 otherwise leave me in the comments 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.900
 Know which apps you still have in mind 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.800
 had 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.800
 Let's go 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.679
 The step I want to introduce you 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.390
 means shuttle and shuttle is the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.399
 most stylish music player of me so far 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.920
 In the android store he is 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.019
 has this horny android lollipop style 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.610
 that is so minimalist and me 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.100
 just like this design a lot 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.690
 It has many features and offers 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.329
 you the possibility that look too 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.710
 to adapt and many little things are 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.390
 the really this player especially 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.460
 For example, this is just what it is 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.870
 picture of the artist automatically 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.059
 the internet down because they are not yet 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.829
 picture has it gives a little short bio 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.420
 of every artist that is displayed on 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.729
 and much more really tried 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.640
 Simply from shuttle is the best plan b 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.890
 I've found number two so far 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 lazy swype who knows me knows that me 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.509
 a little faible for multitasking eps 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.890
 I can and call this one by 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.259
 Just get out of one before 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.570
 selected activation point in the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.040
 screen has wiped into three menus 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.170
 You can easily see the whole as you can see 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.210
 so wipe and not many 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.560
 attitudes but very convenient and 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.299
 a cool design if you ask me 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 you can also easily from any app 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.590
 out so easily bring in rage 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.180
 it also tries out notifications 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.710
 By the way, you will be shown 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.479
 everything they normally do in the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.940
 You can also edit bar 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.409
 see there 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.240
 continue with sunrise calendar of 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.130
 in my opinion best calendar app 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.049
 which is currently available she is beautiful 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.760
 The design is also so great 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.950
 minimalist fits in with this 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.930
 android lollipop thing connects 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.490
 automatically with facebook evernote and 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 other apps just to be all 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.090
 memories events and dates 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.619
 what a look really shows 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.540
 is practical if you somehow 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.250
 trying to organize your life like that 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.080
 how I do it then it is almost 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.080
 a must-have sunrise calendar 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.680
 into the ice is the next and how the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.810
 name says that until the instagram 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.760
 and pictures sizes and although she is 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.410
 instagram so that you can upload a picture 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 Always wants the whole thing only square 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.340
 is displayed and you often because of that 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.720
 something has to be cut away into the ice 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.190
 as a picture is simply up and down 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.470
 or left and right to a square 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 added and is very convenient because 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.150
 so you can upload the whole picture yes 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 also works with videos and has 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.610
 I also have other functions 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.350
 do not want to go for example 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.820
 I use pictures of collages 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.580
 personally never but can imagine 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.870
 that one or is happy about it 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.490
 that everything has fun with it 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.070
 if we are already in pictures come 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.110
 we go to the next corner called pictures and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.090
 pictures is a gallery app in one 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.800
 really nice minimalist design 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.710
 i, for example, have the samsung galaxy 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.030
 s 5 and is a super handy but the 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.860
 Gallery app is just not great 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.460
 and above all, she just lives a lot too 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.050
 slowly 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.400
 and here are the pictures really 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.770
 fast the images are loaded 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.720
 automatically sorted the whole is nice 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.280
 to watch and you have for example 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.440
 also the possibility the whole in 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.060
 to display a calendar function like this 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.489
 that the pictures are practically after date 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.230
 sorted to be displayed clearly 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.730
 my favorite gallery from the me 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.500
 could find so far looks gorgeous 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.590
 out 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.730
 pictures just try that out 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.120
 they were i hope there was something for everyone 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.010
 there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.630
