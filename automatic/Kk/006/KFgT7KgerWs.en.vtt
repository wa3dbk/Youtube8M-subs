picture completely it's rather amazing

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.010 
picture completely it's rather amazing
that<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.850> can<00:01:56.000> have<00:01:56.119> this<00:01:56.300> much<00:01:56.540> stuff<00:01:56.840> in

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
that you can have this much stuff in

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.830 
that you can have this much stuff in
between<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.380> five-eighth<00:01:58.180> system<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.690> it

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
between a five-eighth system and have it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.230 
between a five-eighth system and have it
still<00:02:00.080> work<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:01.280> would<00:02:01.520> say<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.000> sky

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
still work so I would say that the sky

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.440 
still work so I would say that the sky
Zone<00:02:02.270> is<00:02:02.780> vastly<00:02:03.320> superior<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:05.060> shark

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
Zone is vastly superior to that shark

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.100 
Zone is vastly superior to that shark
