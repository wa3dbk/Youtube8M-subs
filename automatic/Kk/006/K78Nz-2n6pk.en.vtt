00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.289
 In general, the purchase was no device 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.840
 nothing bad is even here 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.500
 a way to save money secondly 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.910
 This is a good option to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.679
 buy some unusual smartphone 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.320
 which is not sold in stores 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.850
 for example amazon fire the background is perfect 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.649
 a way to change your 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.620
 device is cooler but there is one 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.179
 such a small nuance so small 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.219
 tiny is a factor of the possible

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.159
 First, pay attention to availability. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 there is no original kit and box 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.150
 the boxes are already suspicious 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.280
 secondly, if you buy a smartphone on 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.360

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.070
