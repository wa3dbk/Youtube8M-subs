the<00:01:47.380> first<00:01:47.590> time<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.369> definitely<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> very<00:01:49.299> cool

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
the first time so definitely a very cool

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.469 
the first time so definitely a very cool
and<00:01:49.869> fun<00:01:50.110> LEvolution<00:01:50.530> events<00:01:51.100> now<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.119> last

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
and fun LEvolution events now the last

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.899 
and fun LEvolution events now the last

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.880 
map that offers LEvolution in the DLC is
called<00:01:55.150> bloom<00:01:55.330> fini<00:01:55.630> garden<00:01:56.079> now<00:01:56.350> in<00:01:56.530> my<00:01:56.680> last

video<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:57.490> talking<00:01:57.610> about<00:01:58.060> how<00:01:58.420> this<00:01:58.630> map

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
video I was talking about how this map

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.109 
video I was talking about how this map
looks<00:01:59.079> very<00:01:59.439> similar<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.220> garden<00:02:00.579> area<00:02:00.909> on

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
looks very similar to the garden area on

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.359 
looks very similar to the garden area on
flood<00:02:01.479> zone<00:02:01.750> so<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.530> am<00:02:02.799> proud<00:02:03.040> to<00:02:03.070> say<00:02:03.340> that

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
flood zone so I am proud to say that

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.920 
flood zone so I am proud to say that
this<00:02:03.670> map<00:02:03.850> does<00:02:04.090> play<00:02:04.329> out<00:02:04.450> like<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.869> you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
this map does play out like that you

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.480 
this map does play out like that you
have<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> overhead<00:02:05.680> train<00:02:06.009> track<00:02:06.280> going

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
have the overhead train track going

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.950 
have the overhead train track going
right<00:02:06.820> through<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.090> garden<00:02:07.420> much<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:07.810> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
right through the garden much like the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.900 
right through the garden much like the
highway<00:02:08.320> that<00:02:08.470> goes<00:02:08.530> right<00:02:08.920> through<00:02:08.950> or<00:02:09.489> next

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
highway that goes right through or next

to<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.209> garden<00:02:10.509> on<00:02:10.630> flood<00:02:10.959> zone<00:02:11.230> now<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
to you the garden on flood zone now the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.160 
to you the garden on flood zone now the
LEvolution<00:02:12.579> on<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.090> map<00:02:13.269> has<00:02:13.450> probably<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
LEvolution on this map has probably the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.870 
LEvolution on this map has probably the
most<00:02:14.380> destructive<00:02:14.739> I've<00:02:15.040> seen<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.700> game

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
most destructive I've seen in the game

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.449 
most destructive I've seen in the game
so<00:02:16.150> far<00:02:16.510> now<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.110> activate<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.799> landslide<00:02:18.250> you

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
so far now to activate the landslide you

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.890 
so far now to activate the landslide you
need<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.760> enable<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.299> water<00:02:19.570> pressure

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
need to enable the water pressure

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.050 
need to enable the water pressure
control<00:02:20.410> panel<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.890> both<00:02:21.130> sides<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.669> the<00:02:21.820> dam

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
control panel on both sides of the dam

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.370 
control panel on both sides of the dam
or<00:02:22.389> at<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> bottom<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.019> hill<00:02:23.200> by<00:02:23.350> the

or at the bottom of the hill by the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680 
or at the bottom of the hill by the
water<00:02:23.650> tower<00:02:23.769> so<00:02:24.639> you<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:24.970> need<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.299> activate

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
water tower so you do need to activate

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.610 
water tower so you do need to activate
both<00:02:25.930> panels<00:02:26.290> and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
both panels and

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.229 
both panels and
order<00:02:26.799> for<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.069> LEvolution<00:02:27.489> to<00:02:27.790> activate

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
order for this LEvolution to activate

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.030 
order for this LEvolution to activate
now<00:02:28.510> once<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> launch<00:02:29.019> it<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.379> about<00:02:29.590> 20

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
now once you launch it you have about 20

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.190 
now once you launch it you have about 20
to<00:02:30.069> 30<00:02:30.400> seconds<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.150> get<00:02:31.299> out<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.659> the<00:02:31.810> way<00:02:31.959> of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
to 30 seconds to get out of the way of

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.559 
to 30 seconds to get out of the way of
the<00:02:32.349> landslide<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.549> we<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.819> fun<00:02:34.030> activating

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
the landslide so we have fun activating

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.180 
the landslide so we have fun activating
this<00:02:34.659> LEvolution<00:02:35.080> it's<00:02:35.470> probably<00:02:36.010> my

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
this LEvolution it's probably my

00:02:36.190 --> 00:03:07.170 
this LEvolution it's probably my
favourite<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> game<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.299> far

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.400 

anyways<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:08.600> about<00:03:08.810> wraps<00:03:09.050> up<00:03:09.230> this

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410
