00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
might help transfer a little bit of the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.770 
might help transfer a little bit of the
heat<00:01:40.060> but<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:43.450> seems<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.930> be<00:01:45.509> seems<00:01:46.509> to<00:01:46.689> be

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
heat but this seems to be seems to be

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:59.910 
heat but this seems to be seems to be
working<00:01:47.200> quite<00:01:47.229> well<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:57.700> here<00:01:58.830> starting<00:01:59.830> to

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
working quite well see here starting to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.590 
working quite well see here starting to
thin<00:02:00.189> out<00:02:00.369> a<00:02:00.399> little<00:02:00.520> bit<00:02:00.970> so<00:02:01.299> we're<00:02:01.420> getting

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
thin out a little bit so we're getting

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:24.440 
thin out a little bit so we're getting
some<00:02:01.750> frog

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.710 

and<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.720> starting<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.049> look<00:02:26.140> really<00:02:26.530> good

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and it's starting to look really good

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.130 
and it's starting to look really good
I've<00:02:28.720> got<00:02:28.780> another<00:02:30.599> 3-piece<00:02:31.599> sheet<00:02:31.959> right

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
I've got another 3-piece sheet right

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.309 
I've got another 3-piece sheet right
here<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.590> I'll<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.890> kind<00:02:33.159> of<00:02:33.220> set<00:02:33.519> on<00:02:33.670> there

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
here that I'll just kind of set on there

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:41.430 
here that I'll just kind of set on there
to<00:02:35.319> absorb<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.799> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.159> more<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:40.409> we<00:02:41.409> can

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
to absorb a little bit more and we can

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:58.690 
to absorb a little bit more and we can
see<00:02:42.150> how<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.360> works

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.730 

and<00:03:00.080> let's<00:03:01.080> take<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.320> look<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:03.350> think<00:03:04.350> that<00:03:04.470> looks

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
and let's take a look I think that looks

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.160 
and let's take a look I think that looks
pretty<00:03:04.800> good<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.540> well<00:03:06.540> that's<00:03:06.780> about<00:03:06.930> what

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
pretty good so well that's about what

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
pretty good so well that's about what
three<00:03:07.470> minutes<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.010> got<00:03:09.000> an<00:03:09.150> all<00:03:09.270> cleaned<00:03:09.510> up

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
three minutes and got an all cleaned up

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.570 
three minutes and got an all cleaned up
supposed<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.410> scrape<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.800> away<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.100> damage<00:03:11.400> in

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
supposed to scrape it away and damage in

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.000 
supposed to scrape it away and damage in
your<00:03:12.500> furniture<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.490> there<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.850> go
