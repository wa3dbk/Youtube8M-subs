00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
shapely it is as you can see the fit is

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.340 
shapely it is as you can see the fit is
then<00:00:49.559> incredibly<00:00:50.309> tight<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.989> much<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
then incredibly tight and so much so

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.920 
then incredibly tight and so much so
that<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> need<00:00:52.890> some<00:00:53.789> Lube<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.329> slip<00:00:55.110> min<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
that you need some Lube to slip min and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.389 
that you need some Lube to slip min and
then<00:00:57.930> basically<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.800> incredible

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
then basically you have incredible

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.660 
then basically you have incredible
clarity<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.359> no<00:01:00.859> noise<00:01:01.859> seepage

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
clarity because there's no noise seepage

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
clarity because there's no noise seepage
escaping<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.570> your<00:01:03.930> ear<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.320> it's<00:01:04.439> all<00:01:04.559> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
escaping from your ear so it's all going

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.160 
escaping from your ear so it's all going
inside<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.540> only<00:01:06.689> downside<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
inside the only downside is that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
inside the only downside is that
obviously<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.590> can't<00:01:07.830> then<00:01:07.950> hear<00:01:08.159> anything

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
obviously you can't then hear anything

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
obviously you can't then hear anything
around<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.710> haven't

designed to offer exceptional noise
cancelling<00:01:14.689> capabilities<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.110> while<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
cancelling capabilities so while the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.520 
cancelling capabilities so while the
sound<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.119> produce<00:01:18.270> isn't<00:01:18.930> especially
