00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.439
 we come to the section that I like the most 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.059
 where they will learn practical tips and 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.760
 useful to make their homes the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 place we've always dreamed of if 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.809
 you have jars in your house or 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.789
 glass bottles which do not use the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.980
 that they have stored there and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.599
 powdery it 's time to take it out 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.419
 because today they will learn that 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.999
 make decorate with jars of 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.890
 colors before painting and this goes for 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.800
 any kind of bottle either 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.650
 glass or glass we should wash it very 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.080
 well inside and out if you have 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.910
 label we must remove it and remove everything 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.270
 that adhesive that remains there adhered 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.380
 then we proceed to paint 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 preferably we use paint 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.340
 I love them acrylic colors 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.190
 alive as you can see use the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.220
 yellow in orange or the color that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.530
 you wish already after having them 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.420
 let's give it the use that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.020
 we want we can use them 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 like vases candelabra pencil holders or 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.180
 where you want to place them 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.180
 they will see 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.690
 and Christmas we can decorate the jars 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.750
 with the pineapples that fall from the trees 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.650
 that are coffee quotes and we can paint them 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.140
 with spray either gold plated or 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.020
 these are introduced into 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.720
 We put a wide-mouth bottle 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.460
 inside it we put a string 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.700
 around a tape that you 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.160
 prefer to enter inside it 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.740
 a candle or whatever we want to place for 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.570
 decorate we can also use the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.740
 same idea but with decorative stones 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.690
 as we are going to see here there are these of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.000
 Various colors 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.170
 we put them inside the jar 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.080
 we introduce the candle 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.509
 and we put a string and that goes in the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.600
 tastes of each person we can also 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.990
 Snails do it with sand or petals 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.990
 pink
