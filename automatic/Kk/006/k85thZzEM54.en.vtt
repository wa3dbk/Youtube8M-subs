 let's make a cross in the mortar in milk 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:23.330
 curdled and then one of zag that moves 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.790
 both with the cross and vertical part 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.790

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.260
 wood 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:36.180
 10 of the small data were formed e 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:42.240
 we have to wait twenty minutes and why 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:59.280
 serum scan that we put or cubes of 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:04:01.670
 serum that we put or cubes of 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.670

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.310
 make ricotta the first salt 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:29.900
