00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.939
 and their players today I presented myself an indispensable accessory 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.879
 in certain situations 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.279
 a product and the police ages that I took a little heavy pleasure 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.279
 today created by cell of m 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 it's the fifth defeat 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.839
 so that's an aspect that's been around for a few days now 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.529
 several references today I present to you the creation of these 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.149
 students 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.149
 November 20, 2009 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.750
 so maybe at the level of the back 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.780
 for the game 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.720
 we will move forward together 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.140
 or how is it going 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 three elements for health 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 ample enough some censorship for this leader of equipped two teams 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 with other possible elements 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.460
 it is to have a minimum of elements 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.940
 and to use a minimal building precisely for maximum discretion 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.030
 when we are in the street and especially if we could see in some 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.290
 payment transactions 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.539
 he mingle with the crowd 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.750
 very discreet places 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 and it's over 2008 here is a good example 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660
 why the Muslim countries 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.800
 it is a product that marks extremely well especially on this model has its 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.340
 preferences were really the top 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 so here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.940
 passage 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.550
 for cello monti which censors about elastic with seams 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.980
 reinforced and all the elements for the health for master the chargers 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.030
 expenses 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.150
 are also reinforced and in elastic that will allow us to see 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.620
 where all types of fortune city 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.920
 north tensions we are here it's here 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.240
 so the language a weapon drives 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.860
 in addition to 126 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.670
 so the doctor if it's not a little envy it makes sense to imagine over a year 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.550
 or two or on a blog 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.300
 you talk about your company 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.300
 to surrender the wreckage matter what does it necessarily 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.200
 at the level of the answer is no 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.010
 it does not move that censorship is to refocus on the body and we 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.810
 observe them on the abdomen 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
 all over the planet 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 first intention the release is very fast and very flexible 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.619
 On the other hand 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.119
 like any kind of censorship 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.619
 you are of these deaths so he imagined for storage that is done 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.289
 automatically quickly it's much better with my romance husband in 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.809
 square 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.229
 of security 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 to reassure them 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.049
 so now at restraint then serge 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.449
 it's not necessarily always used 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.349
 also 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.440
 London 6 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.689
 for the places 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.979
 with mention 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.520
 he had 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.399
 and a combat system 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.569
 to hold them we go to ten 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.599
 so a very very very interesting censorship very easy at school 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.599
 aim for beautiful photos 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.669
 Once 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.989
 for the moment the belt does not move it is frightening it is relatively 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.989
 comfortable today also in detention 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.430
 the lesson given in this new environment 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.669
 cap the world and purse to toys 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.029
 in europe the action 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.449
 it does not move elsewhere and it is very variable in certain situations 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 according to the website of the uefa after the launch 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.659
 the mayor has made the biggest villain 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.839
 or anti text 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.839
 you will never have the invitation of m 56 s 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.799
 the district of 10 mg spearhead of the belt 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 So here is 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:48.139
 for the metro it's a treat 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.189
 compaore the president dussey 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.159
 here we have a little too much 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.349
 in detail the impurities 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.349
 elastic that adapts to any thales site 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.609
 once we had the first metro that already ensures us a support 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.569
 exceptional 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.949
 we have a second degree of security 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.789
 it did not necessarily 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.189
 healthy behavior 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.400
 the belt even more important 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.449
 we start to get tired very simple 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.449
 jousts of the dh 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.909
 you pass the belt 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.069
 beyond his wasp waist and the second secure element 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 you can hear it 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.249
 you made the belt 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.249
 talking about landmarks 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.370
 once it's done 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 the little dog drops it over 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.350
 and you are operational so it's really a very accessory 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.779
 interesting really not excessive 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.189
 the game but greece 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.189
 directly on the descriptive relationship of the video 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.089
 you wrote wwf 

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:12.089
 it was dreadful 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.069
 you call them you go directly fingers 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.050
 amendment 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.050
 a bestseller at the essential accessories level 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.549
 for the police scatters
