works for the first iPad obviously

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
works for the first iPad obviously
because<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.029> iPad<00:00:18.570> 2<00:00:18.779> isn't<00:00:19.170> jailbroken<00:00:19.650> yet

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

go inside of winterboard and then inside

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.359 
go inside of winterboard and then inside
of<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> winterboard<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> select

gestures<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.970> should<00:01:24.299> work<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
gestures and that should work for you so

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.980 
gestures and that should work for you so
then<00:01:26.400> after<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.790> basically<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.720> can<00:01:27.750> go

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
then after that basically you can go

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
then after that basically you can go
inside<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> Settings<00:01:28.829> app<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.759> will

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
inside of the Settings app and you will

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
inside of the Settings app and you will
be<00:01:30.060> able<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> enable<00:01:30.600> multitasking<00:01:31.560> gestures

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
be able to enable multitasking gestures

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.830 
be able to enable multitasking gestures
similar<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:32.729> mine<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
similar to what mine is right here and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
similar to what mine is right here and
then<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:34.950> simply<00:01:35.310> use<00:01:35.460> four<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:35.759> five

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
then you can simply use four or five

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
then you can simply use four or five
fingers<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.630> close<00:01:37.259> out<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.560> applications

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fingers to close out of applications

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.120 
fingers to close out of applications
open<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.320> multitasking<00:01:40.320> tray<00:01:40.619> down<00:01:40.890> there

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
open up the multitasking tray down there

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
open up the multitasking tray down there
and<00:01:41.369> actually<00:01:41.880> switch<00:01:42.329> between<00:01:42.409> open

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and actually switch between open

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.160 
and actually switch between open
