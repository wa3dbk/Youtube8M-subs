it<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.810> move<00:01:46.990> was<00:01:47.170> actually<00:01:47.530> called<00:01:47.770> hop<00:01:48.070> and

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
it the move was actually called hop and

it the move was actually called hop and
maybe<00:01:48.520> that<00:01:48.700> explains<00:01:48.850> why<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.479> physical

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869

I<00:02:15.590> guess<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:15.950> because<00:02:16.100> ditto<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:16.790> the
