00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.420 
tablet in place and it has the cutouts
as<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.240> saw<00:01:06.360> previously<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.770> case

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
as we saw previously with the other case

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.660 
as we saw previously with the other case
that<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.810> evaluated<00:01:10.590> from<00:01:10.710> Belkin<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.400> very

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
that we evaluated from Belkin so very

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
that we evaluated from Belkin so very
similar<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.780> makes<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.110> different

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
similar so what makes this different

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
similar so what makes this different
first<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.130> let's<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.310> ahead<00:01:14.430> open<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
first of all let's go ahead open the the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
first of all let's go ahead open the the
actual<00:01:15.689> tab<00:01:15.960> I'll<00:01:16.229> go<00:01:16.350> ahead<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
actual tab I'll go ahead and use the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.469 
actual tab I'll go ahead and use the
same<00:01:17.070> approach<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.640> did<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.330> previous

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
same approach as we did in the previous

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
same approach as we did in the previous
one<00:01:18.840> I'll<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.080> slide<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> bottoms<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> first

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
one I'll just slide the bottoms in first

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.490 
one I'll just slide the bottoms in first
and<00:01:20.939> once<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> bottoms<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.840> I'll<00:01:22.350> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and once I have the bottoms in I'll just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
and once I have the bottoms in I'll just
put<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.799> each<00:01:22.979> side<00:01:23.250> okay<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> holds<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
put in each side okay and that holds it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960 
put in each side okay and that holds it
nice<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.619> secure<00:01:28.979> you'll<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
nice and secure you'll see that on the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.230 
nice and secure you'll see that on the
sides<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:31.189> I'm<00:01:32.189> not<00:01:32.460> going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.759> able<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.119> do

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
sides and I'm not going to be able to do

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
sides and I'm not going to be able to do
one<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> these<00:01:33.570> things<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.229> notice<00:01:34.530> there's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
one of these things you notice there's

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.819 
one of these things you notice there's
no<00:01:34.860> support<00:01:35.840> because<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.020> trifold<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> was

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
no support because it's a trifold it was

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
no support because it's a trifold it was
very<00:01:38.040> similar<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> iPad<00:01:39.150> cases

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
very similar to some of the iPad cases

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.590 
very similar to some of the iPad cases
that<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.140> there<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> how

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
that you see out there and this is how

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.149 
that you see out there and this is how
you<00:01:42.600> would<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> specific<00:01:43.500> let's<00:01:44.070> say

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you would put it in a specific let's say

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.300 
you would put it in a specific let's say
typing<00:01:44.610> angle<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.119> example<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
typing angle for example or if you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
typing angle for example or if you
wanted<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.000> specific<00:01:48.149> viewing<00:01:48.750> angle

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wanted it in a specific viewing angle

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690 
wanted it in a specific viewing angle
you'd<00:01:49.229> do<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> same<00:01:49.530> thing<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you'd do the same thing like this and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.910 
you'd do the same thing like this and
this<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> how<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.119> didn't<00:01:51.390> use<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> case<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
this is how I didn't use the case the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.139 
this is how I didn't use the case the
case<00:01:53.720> if<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.930> wanted<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.460> close<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> make

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
case if I wanted to close it and make

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
case if I wanted to close it and make
sure<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> doesn't<00:01:57.600> open<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.890> use<00:01:59.100> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
sure it doesn't open I would use this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.450 
sure it doesn't open I would use this
strap<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> keeps<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> closed<00:02:01.799> you

a little to no bulk to the actual tablet
experience<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.629> for<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.650> price<00:02:30.239> there

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
experience and for the price there

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.339 
experience and for the price there
there's<00:02:31.540> probably<00:02:31.629> gonna<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:32.019> some<00:02:32.110> other

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
there's probably gonna be some other

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.619 
there's probably gonna be some other
cases<00:02:32.560> on<00:02:32.799> the<00:02:32.860> market<00:02:33.160> very<00:02:33.310> soon<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:34.420> if<00:02:34.540> you

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
cases on the market very soon but if you

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.630 
cases on the market very soon but if you
compare<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.110> two<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.500> $20<00:02:35.920> difference<00:02:36.220> I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
compare the two the $20 difference I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.569 
compare the two the $20 difference I
think<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.269> pretty<00:02:37.989> significant<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:39.220> may<00:02:39.370> want

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
think is pretty significant you may want

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.069 
think is pretty significant you may want
to<00:02:39.700> choose<00:02:39.910> this<00:02:40.150> case<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:40.720> something<00:02:40.870> that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
to choose this case or something that

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.710 
to choose this case or something that
you'd<00:02:41.200> use<00:02:41.380> especially<00:02:41.739> if<00:02:42.010> you're<00:02:42.160> not<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:43.540> it

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you'd use especially if you're not if it

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.180 
you'd use especially if you're not if it
isn't<00:02:44.049> important<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.530> you<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.829> view<00:02:45.010> your

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
isn't important to you to view your

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.400 
isn't important to you to view your
tablet<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.660> know<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.019> position<00:02:47.230> like

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
tablet and you know in a position like

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.020 
tablet and you know in a position like
the<00:02:47.709> other<00:02:47.890> case<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.640> was<00:02:48.760> something

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
the other case in that was something

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.930 
the other case in that was something
like<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:50.140> this<00:02:50.410> again<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.130> trifold
