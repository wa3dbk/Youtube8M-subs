00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
in about two or three this gun is just

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.359 
in about two or three this gun is just
really<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.740> very<00:00:25.740> great<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.250> any

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
really really good very great for any

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.160 
really really good very great for any
type<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.640> air<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.390> whatever<00:00:27.900> you're

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
doing out there with this thing

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.410 
doing out there with this thing
so<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.810> think<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.349> further<00:00:31.710> ado<00:00:32.180> let's<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so I think that further ado let's get to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
so I think that further ado let's get to
the<00:00:33.510> unboxing<00:00:33.600> interview<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.309> time<00:00:35.790> for

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
a but these really cool tool innovations

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.920 
a but these really cool tool innovations
they're<00:03:28.889> doing<00:03:29.180> last<00:03:30.180> thing<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.480> want<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.690> say

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930

is that there's this little hole a

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.110 
is that there's this little hole a
little<00:03:33.450> space<00:03:33.900> right<00:03:34.200> here<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.730> I've<00:03:35.910> noticed

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
little space right here and I've noticed

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.879 
little space right here and I've noticed
that<00:03:36.359> it's<00:03:36.510> perfect<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:36.989> putting<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> couple

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
that it's perfect for putting a couple

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.170 
that it's perfect for putting a couple
darts<00:03:38.220> through<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.639> want<00:03:38.819> to<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.030> some

darts through if you want to have some
extra<00:03:39.299> storage<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.829> doesn't

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
extra storage I know that it doesn't

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.530 
extra storage I know that it doesn't
come<00:03:41.250> with<00:03:41.430> an<00:03:41.519> extra<00:03:41.670> banana<00:03:42.030> clip<00:03:42.269> holder

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
come with an extra banana clip holder

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.150 
come with an extra banana clip holder
because<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:43.620> look<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.829> that<00:03:43.859> there's<00:03:44.100> a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
because well look at that there's a

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.860 
because well look at that there's a
missile<00:03:44.459> back<00:03:44.579> there<00:03:44.850> but<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.750> really

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
missile back there but if you really

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.240

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
want it you can put a couple darts in

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.309 
want it you can put a couple darts in
there<00:03:47.400> if<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.730> run<00:03:47.910> low<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.600> a<00:03:48.750> pocket<00:03:49.170> clip

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
there if you run low in a pocket clip

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.660 
there if you run low in a pocket clip
out<00:03:49.730> reload<00:03:50.730> two<00:03:50.910> more<00:03:51.060> shots<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.600> then<00:03:51.720> go

hands it's this better I'd say to have a
light<00:04:04.739> grip<00:04:05.040> on<00:04:05.280> this<00:04:05.790> sliding<00:04:06.209> part<00:04:06.859> just

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
light grip on this sliding part just

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.650 
light grip on this sliding part just
your<00:04:08.010> arm<00:04:08.160> doesn't<00:04:08.340> get<00:04:08.549> too<00:04:08.700> tired<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.329> you

going to be a timer on the screen to see

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.689 
going to be a timer on the screen to see
how<00:04:54.150> fast<00:04:54.389> it<00:04:54.629> takes<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:55.370> flywheels<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.490> speed
