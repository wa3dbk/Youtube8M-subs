00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550 
that's what I use I'm blend it all back
together<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.150> a<00:02:06.210> little<00:02:06.360> cup<00:02:06.660> put<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.440> my

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.639 
together in a little cup put it on my
hair<00:02:07.800> once<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.880> put<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.270> my<00:02:09.420> hair<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.080> tied<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
hair once I put it on my hair I tied a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.830 
hair once I put it on my hair I tied a
plastic<00:02:11.280> bag<00:02:11.460> on<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.450> ahead<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
plastic bag on it so I can go ahead and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
plastic bag on it so I can go ahead and
get<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.990> steam<00:02:13.380> treatment<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> same<00:02:14.310> time

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
get a steam treatment at the same time

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.199 
get a steam treatment at the same time
so<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.750> let<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.110> sit<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.560> 30<00:02:16.920> minutes<00:02:17.340> after<00:02:17.760> I

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
so I let that sit for 30 minutes after I

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
so I let that sit for 30 minutes after I
took<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:18.600> off<00:02:18.750> my<00:02:19.110> hair<00:02:19.709> was<00:02:19.920> totally

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
took it off my hair was totally

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
took it off my hair was totally
saturated<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.300> conditioner<00:02:21.840> and<00:02:22.050> it

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
saturated with the conditioner and it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.440 
saturated with the conditioner and it
felt<00:02:22.680> good<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.910> celebrate

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
felt good to celebrate

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.780 
felt good to celebrate
I<00:02:24.660> took<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.260> wide<00:02:25.500> tooth<00:02:25.890> comb<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.520> just<00:02:26.670> comb

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
I took a wide tooth comb and just comb

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
I took a wide tooth comb and just comb
through<00:02:27.300> my<00:02:27.330> hair<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.350> after<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> got<00:02:28.950> out

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
through my hair so that after I got out

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.040 
through my hair so that after I got out
the<00:02:29.190> shower<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.850> wouldn't<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.780> touch<00:02:31.020> it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the shower I wouldn't have to touch it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.190 
the shower I wouldn't have to touch it
and<00:02:31.440> therefore<00:02:31.950> less<00:02:32.520> likely<00:02:32.550> have<00:02:33.420> privies

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and therefore less likely have privies

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.410 
and therefore less likely have privies
so<00:02:35.239> what<00:02:36.239> else<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.660> combed<00:02:37.560> out<00:02:38.030> let<00:02:39.030> make<00:02:39.209> sure

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
so what else I combed out let make sure

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.630
