00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.930
 what is sanmiguel and today was my life 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:10.690
 It all started in July 1991 in San Diego 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.379
 when my mom gave birth to a prick 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.240
 very beautiful baby that would be me but at 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.460
 born I had some complications for 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.800
 start was a premature baby half my 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.560
 body was paralyzed one eye is 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.140
 completely closed and the doctor 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.480
 I had told my parents that I was not going to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.839
 be able to walk normal so all my 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.720
 family cried and worried but what 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:37.000
 that they did not know is that I was a good baby 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.840
 mop 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.850
 everything went well 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.400
 as soon as we went to live in 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.700
 tijuana with my grandma and if she left 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.500
 the only newborn that walks me 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.080
 agreement always being outside 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.180
 of a house of ablitas only had 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.030
 my glasses on that are almost identical 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.370
 to which they used 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.100
 and that's how I'll do my nickname of 'the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.199
 bald ' do not believe is not why when 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.089
 I started the first one we moved back 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.040
 san diego to live with half of my nana 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.680
 who are my grandparents from me 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.840
 dad rented him a room half is 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.820
 almost equal to what we do in 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.100
 prison and of memory half is 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.899
 having many animals and today my 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.299
 cousin we play to see who plays the goat 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.890
 first this game was not my favorite anymore 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.560
 that I almost screwed up every time 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.690
 we played at the age of 5 years it was 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.360
 introduced to the second love of my life 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.710
 football thanks to a new book that 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.750
 he always let me play even in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 colony systems and I remember that the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.850
 merit always enabled me to throw hair 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.500
 with these things of grandparents I must 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.630
 confess that football does not always me 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.520
 I liked I wanted to play American football 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.649
 since my dad always saw him in the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.440
 television and it was the sport that he with 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.360
 a frontal wave that manages prepa 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.009
 American football was family that was 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.319
 very skinny and not short and in 1998 he changed 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.899
 our family of three to four when 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.090
 my little sister was born, I remember 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.950
 looking after her many times and today 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.950
 I'm scared that it's growing so 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.560
 quick to see the little one and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.149
 preparing this step without seignors or me 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.290
 I want to imagine when you have your first 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.019
 boyfriend I tear my fingers the 2 mother or 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.640
 one day when I was about eight years 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.769
 they wanted to rob there in a colony of 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.750
 where my grandmother lives from that day until 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.090
 as 12 years old every time a 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.609
 I hid myself in the street and the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.700
 days without knowing because I'm afraid to 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.980
 that one day I told him to precise and we 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.140
 that that event had traumatized me 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.329
 but when I was little I did not notice 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.430
 because we're not going to jump a few years 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.709
 when I entered high school at that time 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.920
 he was well into football and he was 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.599
 invited by regionals here in usa 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.909
 we won and we were invited to the national 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.799
 those indicated were in Carolina del 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.109
 north and I was super happy to travel 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.909
 by plane for the first time since that 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.340
 then I knew what I wanted to be by 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.900
 the rest of my life playing soccer the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 Truth that could have brought me many 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.579
 things but one of them that I value a lot 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.010
 they are my friends from a high school it was nothing 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.590
 popular indeed friends I have very few 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.900
 I have more than two in the right hand that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.510
 true friends rather carnal as 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.489
 we tell them but I like it that way but all 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.230
 changed in the winter of 2008 when 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.090
 a girl came to my art class 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.140
 he made the most beautiful girl of all 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.210
 school 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.340
 and this is a nose that was nothing 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.620
 popular and the only thing that had the mind 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.390
 it was football I thought I never had 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.490
 a chance with her and then when she was 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.590
 around her she acted normal I did not 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.690
 I was nervous or I threw the wave 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.030
 because I knew I was never going to talk 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.090
 with her but it turned out that by acting 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.330
 normal liked my body and my smile 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.640
 from William Levy so why do not you 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.340
 like my personality and that April 24 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 I asked him and I were walking with me 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.690
 I knew he loved her and I did her even though she 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.290
 He does not tell me the fucking kiss duty 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.820
 trash and now she is my best friend 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.370
 I remember playing football in 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.890
 tijuana in the field rosemary a field of 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.080
 but it's where I learned my best 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.030
 football and had the good fortune to leave 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.400
 champion and be selected to be able 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.590
 where I came out in the newspaper and 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.860
 I remember cutting the photos and I do not know 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.750
 He has principal that they were good 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.220
 agreement to enter a pool room and 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.680
 see them on the wall 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.900
 and one day after a match I started 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.150
 vomit and vomit and I did not know what 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.520
 and spent a few days later while 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.430
 was my bed with pain I felt that I was 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.070

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.810

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.580
 by my side because I was already drugged and I 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.980
 I was falling apart and I give every crisis 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.980

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.470
 to pay for the classes I did the worst 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.270
