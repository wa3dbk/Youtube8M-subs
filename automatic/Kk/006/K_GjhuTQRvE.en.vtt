00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.010
 show the something parini of the world of 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.039
 Germany 74 as they see on the cover is 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.010
 pretty sober if you only have a background 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.470
 black with the classic attoli fit that is 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.369
 the logo of panini and here below 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.660
 we found the old panini logo 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.509
 this was 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.410
 1 if it was not the first was one of the 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.210
 first albums of the brand in the part 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.560
 from behind on the back cover what we 're going to 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.140
 find is going to be the program 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.050
 a complete program of the cup of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.740
 world and without more let's start 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.810
 review 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.630
 the inside of this album without the first 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:55.360
 part as we always have the index with 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.930
 all participating nations and in the 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 second sheet 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.040
 the chip of the fifa and the world cup 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 then we will have some history if the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.890
 74 was the first world cup then 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 disputed this trophy 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.250
 if before what was in dispute was 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.370
 this cup the rimet cup 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 and what panini does in this part is 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.450
 introduce us a little to the history of 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.550
 The World Cup continues with Uruguay 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:41.160
 1930 italy 34 yes and with different 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.160
 moments of each world cup 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.610
 we already have a little more of the history of 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.420
 the cup 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.550
 and let's move on to the stadiums part 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.950
 here we have the diagram of the venues 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.689
 and you get to appreciate 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.050
 and then each stadium separately 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.489
 some color without detail and the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.920
 president of the association for that 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.530
 moment 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.380
 if there are fewer players as you can see 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.739

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.890
