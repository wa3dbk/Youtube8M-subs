absolutely the number of script that
that<00:02:45.329> comes<00:02:45.569> my<00:02:45.719> way<00:02:45.750> now<00:02:46.019> has<00:02:46.169> been<00:02:46.349> really

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
that comes my way now has been really

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.459 
that comes my way now has been really
increased<00:02:46.980> I'm<00:02:47.250> I'm<00:02:48.060> getting<00:02:48.389> like<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.900> kinds

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
increased I'm I'm getting like all kinds

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.709 
increased I'm I'm getting like all kinds
of<00:02:49.560> roles<00:02:50.189> all<00:02:50.459> kinds<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.790> characters<00:02:50.939> and<00:02:51.419> and

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:51.719

all lead parts so I think that that is
in<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.299> way<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.629> it<00:02:54.810> has<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.109> the

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
in that way that it has to be in the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.170 
in that way that it has to be in the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.140 
raggedy okay we all do that a mighty - I
believe<00:03:51.629> that<00:03:51.659> romance<00:03:52.199> drives<00:03:53.150> absolutely

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
believe that romance drives absolutely

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.780 
believe that romance drives absolutely
your<00:03:54.540> mission<00:03:54.840> yes<00:03:55.169> without<00:03:56.009> romance<00:03:56.340> there's

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
your mission yes without romance there's

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.089 
your mission yes without romance there's
no<00:03:56.909> mission<00:03:57.060> yeah<00:03:57.479> yeah<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.199> his<00:03:58.650> romance<00:03:58.949> was

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
no mission yeah yeah so his romance was

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.689 
no mission yeah yeah so his romance was
essential<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.030> plot<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.719> I<00:04:01.259> think<00:04:02.069> the

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
essential to the plot and I think the

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.349 
essential to the plot and I think the
courtroom<00:04:03.060> drama<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:04.049> something<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:05.359> we

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
courtroom drama is something that we

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.849 
courtroom drama is something that we
have<00:04:06.449> never<00:04:06.569> seen<00:04:06.840> before<00:04:06.870> in<00:04:07.290> an<00:04:07.409> Indian<00:04:07.709> film
