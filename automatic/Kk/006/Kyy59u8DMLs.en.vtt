 finds himself today for a 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.759
 new presentation of our modes then 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.529
 once again there would be 2 and 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.270
 sono mode I actually call them 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.220
 the two chairs and named six little 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.869
 that's because it was really going really 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.510
 very well with those nomads you 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.730
 you can create a city a city 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.290
 with building in a click 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.580
 without messing around you'll see it's 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.140
 really impressive and with the 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.760
 second order we will be able to make a 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.320
 beautiful hotel 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.280
 so we could have said it wells total 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.750
 the tooth could see her in the city but 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.650
 no he is even prettier than there is 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.720
 in life finally you'll see it's 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.519
 really to our fashions that will please 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.750
 many people who love them 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.720
 the small towns in this building 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.089
 it's really great ted you'll take me 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.000
 Well, you 're not indignant at me because 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.010
 that he listens there his value very well they 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.950
 look at they are very fine one 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.540
 will need to start from two blocks 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.560
 of orders that I invite you to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.700
 look at a description to see 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.229
 how to get it with the command 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.210
 I could show them as 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.490
 the time now you know so we 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.799
 will go on the first link of the 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.750
 order it be for the hotel first 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.150
 place so we'll copy it and glue it and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.250
 we will go there a parent up there to learn how to 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.510
 put the woodstock block and we're going 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.820
 immediately prepare the second 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.770
 command that will allow us to have the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.180
 city ​​you know the famous city in one 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.110
 click who we are going to ask here 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.590
 attention up tac to the cow oh la 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.690
 sacred cow 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.180
 it screams it creates sacred and then and then and 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.620
 then and then and then and then sacred and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 then it creates then already for one so 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.990
 the first so the author poet does 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.400
 this is not nonsense it's done by 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.080
 paris never kraft is already dense 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.670
 possible do not know but it's not 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.800
 messi is not possible then says enough 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.020
 so that was done by Ia minecraft years 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.730
 here no nonsense listen so that's it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.990
 so that's the two machines so like 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.660
 david or this one has not at all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.490
 panel is still pretty ironic 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.440
 which has no signs and those below 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.120
 then we have not at all 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.740
 we are not here if we have confessed 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.510
 just with the machine history button 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.250
 that's where we have our two 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.690
 pokéball then both pokéball are 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.460
 for one order and for the other 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.200
 how are we going to do the first one that is 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.300
 this one who cry to his roses 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.670
 worried marked hotel guest for everything 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.780
 simply created the hotel one to create a 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.700
 hotel in question look for example 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.170
 see this beautiful village is bad 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.510
 we're going to do something even better at 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 side here we will create a hotel attention 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.020
 and then we will right click with 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.470
 the pokéball with mark cueto was the 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.030
 attentions 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.090
 it's gone so it takes time 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.470
 watch the time it takes the aces 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 it's really about watching these parts 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.370
 here is the construction of the hotel 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.770
 so to do nothing prevents you from 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.270
 watch terraforming a little bit 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.650
 because necessarily kept vasseur sas has 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.709
 flattened will soil it's weird 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.260
 but look what there is frankly 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.420
 it's super well done without messing around 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.550
 it is super well done 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.410
 it's small hotel win it's train 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.890
 to place small ones 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.450
 lights 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.709
 it's really great I prefer you 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.690
 leave that rather than make it go into 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.950
 ellipse it's still ultra mega 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.630
 julie look at you have the rooms 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.849
 of course so it's the same and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.140
 we are certain of such it is true but 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.500
 frankly it's impressive how 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.170
 that secret go us it's really great 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.360
 impressive to see again of course we have to 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.100
 the reception on the reception or on the reception 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.319
 we salagou them a little bit because 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.330
 it's creating something and it's 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.650
 not finished because look up I 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.390
 will not turn your head from any 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.800
 on time but look at the top is a 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.000
 translated the thing here it's good 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.890
 still its marks and packs finish 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.310
 it's like your hotel is over 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.380
 simply 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.730
 so here it lag a little bit but follow this 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.049
 lot or a little bit to beginners than that 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.850
 generates that's how you know how to look 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.769
 So here it is ending 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.660
 the grid when we get closer we see 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.459
 well a thousand dollars that's really when 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.360
 even super well done think of darwin a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.739
 little because I'm next to 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 machines and look there we see it very 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.220
 very well it is gigantic 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.720
 without messing it is gigantic 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.590
 look at the small rooms all the way 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.560
 it's really awesome 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.360
 you have the welcome of course it's great 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 cool that we want we have someone we a 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.269
 client apparently I think we have some 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.230
 stairs do we have stairs 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.040
 but where apart from the disks and the 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.630
 attentions 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.150
 ah yeah look you have even the sky 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.280
 to go after my hands use 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.720
 elevator elevator why not 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.489
 to make an elevator system 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.620
 it can be great so that's it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.750
 it was for the first order is 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.060
 really is so badass hotel business 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.110
 people and to the room is no longer 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.430
 plus it's like that it's the proof 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.080
 that this lag a little early but after he 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.360
 are the most of all of this is ied 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.470
 really great frankly look at it 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.350
 is something in the coffers of the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.610
 all so that was for the so 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.620
 the hotel thus legends the first 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.940
 order then croate city then 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.360
 how is it going so a little ball 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.070
 of snow 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.289
 where you go to buy it so everything 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.589
 simply it will create a city 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.939
 oh yes you're not dreaming it's going to slide 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.020
 completely credeville attention I 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:51.180
 will throw the snowball at this 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.939
 place there pretty much here a look of 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.099
 others and watch that attention people 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.969
 you are going to hallucinate frankly you 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:03.270
 go hallucinate attention look 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:07.110
 separation is there wow that's the 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.580
 construction was building built and 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.129
 were building it was building 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 so that's it you created a little 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.020
 city is great no because yes more 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.879
 with the hotel next door when it makes you feel 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.869
 your so the snowball and that his 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.800
 bottom left mark finish this is at 

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:21.059
 to say that it's over it's a little 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.770
 Same as the hotel 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:24.930
 look what's it 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.979
 look at it peter in milk in less than 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.869
 five minutes already look at what we have 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.209
 managed to do that honestly and for to 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:31.289
 our prince modes in forceless mode 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:32.839
 change nothing tears me even though 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.559
 after you have to think about putting changes 

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.479
 so do you have any species of 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:38.580
 building of different sizes 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.689
 it's really two small fashion and it's 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.159
 for that you assemble them what I 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.959
 find that they pay themselves that seemed good 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.080
 precisely and they are really great 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:47.129
 except that nothing prevents you from 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.360
 customize in addition to look at me 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.589
 it's really great under the shouts ndir 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.729
 he could in niche reached for a 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.499
 other because the view you have 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.249
 recovered the pokéball look at you 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:57.539
 buy it there if you're not 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.490
 Too far from other machines 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.439
 run smoothly and hop there 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.330
 know how it separated that's 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:05.669
 by more and more to watch and that secret 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.870
 well and that lag not at all I find that 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.809
 really has not looked all of these 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.589
 ultra fluid and no problem that I 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:12.029
 do not even know how it goes 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:14.249
 how they did not want that there 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:17.249
 like what mendes and 1 c that's 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.979
 really great and look only at the name 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:21.760
 from the village so it was 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.830
 exactly by between the same 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.820
 building was waiting how many the 4 5 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.820
 6 7 8 9 10 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.039
 no it's exactly the same enough 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.699
 exactly the same but I 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.710
 the impression that they are still 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.909
 distributed differently and keep the most 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.139
 big he's still right late 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.240
 alas he is not left so it's
