00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
near you first one we have here is the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.519 
near you first one we have here is the
nike<00:00:13.590> zoom<00:00:13.620> structure<00:00:14.429> 16<00:00:15.420> Andy<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.470> you

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
nike zoom structure 16 Andy what can you

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.109 
nike zoom structure 16 Andy what can you
tell<00:00:16.650> me<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.890> different<00:00:17.010> about<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.550> so

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
tell me it's different about this one so

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.939 
tell me it's different about this one so
huge<00:00:18.420> changes<00:00:18.869> we<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> engineered

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
huge changes we do have the engineered

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.679 
huge changes we do have the engineered
mesh<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:20.910> piece<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> mesh<00:00:21.449> that's

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
mesh so it is one piece of mesh that's

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.120 
mesh so it is one piece of mesh that's
gonna<00:00:21.810> give<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.350> stability<00:00:22.740> does

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
gonna give you a lot more stability does

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.769 
gonna give you a lot more stability does
make<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.430> lighter<00:00:23.609> weight<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.390> have<00:00:24.510> flex

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
make it lighter weight do have flex

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.210 
make it lighter weight do have flex
grooves<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> forefoot<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.099> more

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
grooves in the forefoot to make it more

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
grooves in the forefoot to make it more
flexible<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.539> dynamics<00:00:28.140> poor<00:00:28.410> so

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
flexible we do have dynamics poor so

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.560 
flexible we do have dynamics poor so
with<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.160> dynamic<00:00:29.550> support<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.210> gonna<00:00:30.420> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
with that dynamic support it is gonna be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999 
with that dynamic support it is gonna be
a<00:00:30.599> lot<00:00:30.779> smoother<00:00:31.199> ride<00:00:31.380> but<00:00:31.560> still<00:00:31.800> getting

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a lot smoother ride but still getting

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.290 
a lot smoother ride but still getting
the<00:00:32.070> same<00:00:32.130> stability<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.210> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the same stability that you have in the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
the same stability that you have in the
past<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.230> bonus<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:35.040> be

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
past but the bonus is it is gonna be

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.860 
past but the bonus is it is gonna be
about<00:00:35.370> an<00:00:35.489> ounce<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> half<00:00:35.820> lighter<00:00:36.120> so

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
about an ounce and a half lighter so

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.940 
about an ounce and a half lighter so
what<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> runner<00:00:37.440> would<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
what kind of runner would you like to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
what kind of runner would you like to
see<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.670> shoe<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> same

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
see in this shoe do you know the same

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
see in this shoe do you know the same
runner<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.230> we've<00:00:40.379> been<00:00:40.500> seeing<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.860> years

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
runner that we've been seeing for years

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069 
runner that we've been seeing for years
that<00:00:41.399> stability<00:00:41.850> person<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.989> know

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
that stability person but that you know

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.420 
that stability person but that you know
that<00:00:43.200> needs<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.500> stability<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.190> looking

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that needs the stability but is looking

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.619 
that needs the stability but is looking
still<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.030> nice<00:00:45.210> ride<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.600> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
still for a really nice ride in that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
still for a really nice ride in that
stability<00:00:45.930> shoe<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.500> been<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> stable<00:00:47.070> shoe

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
stability shoe it's been a stable shoe

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310 
stability shoe it's been a stable shoe
now<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.640> 15<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.090> 16<00:00:48.390> models<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> definitely

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
now for 15 or 16 models so I definitely

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
now for 15 or 16 models so I definitely
think<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> would<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> great<00:00:50.489> shoe<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:50.910> those

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
think it would be a great shoe for those

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.270 
think it would be a great shoe for those
individuals<00:00:51.449> who<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:51.989> pronating<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:52.920> need<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
individuals who are pronating or need a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.100 
individuals who are pronating or need a
little<00:00:53.610> extra<00:00:53.699> support<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.449> their<00:00:54.719> arches

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
little extra support for their arches

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.549 
little extra support for their arches
moving<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.329> lunar<00:00:57.719> glide<00:00:57.960> for

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
moving on we have the lunar glide for

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.380 
moving on we have the lunar glide for
now<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> really

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
now this is gonna be a really

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.970 
now this is gonna be a really
anticipated<00:01:00.390> model<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.780> Nike<00:01:01.050> their<00:01:01.710> old

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
anticipated model for Nike their old

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.680 
anticipated model for Nike their old
models<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.550> been<00:01:02.609> very<00:01:02.940> popular<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.510> their

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
models have been very popular with their

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
models have been very popular with their
new<00:01:03.780> lunar<00:01:04.080> foam<00:01:04.470> series<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
new lunar foam series what are you

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
new lunar foam series what are you
telling<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> lunarglide<00:01:06.420> 4<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.930> again

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
telling about the lunarglide 4 so again

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.840 
telling about the lunarglide 4 so again
huge<00:01:07.560> changes<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.280> are<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
huge changes there you are gonna see the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.060 
huge changes there you are gonna see the
engineered<00:01:09.299> mesh<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
engineered mesh so this is gonna be the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.440 
engineered mesh so this is gonna be the
Pegasus<00:01:11.490> will<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.030> launch<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
Pegasus will be the first launch the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
Pegasus will be the first launch the
engineered<00:01:12.810> mesh<00:01:13.020> then<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.590> glide

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
engineered mesh then we go into glide

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
engineered mesh then we go into glide
then<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.400> into<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> structure<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
then we go into the structure so that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
then we go into the structure so that
engineered<00:01:16.020> Michigan<00:01:16.470> gives<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.860> really

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
engineered Michigan gives it a really

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
engineered Michigan gives it a really
nice<00:01:17.250> fit<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.000> dynamic<00:01:18.390> flywire<00:01:18.600> here<00:01:19.229> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
nice fit the dynamic flywire here so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.990 
nice fit the dynamic flywire here so
it's<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.770> individual<00:01:20.549> pieces<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it's actually individual pieces of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330 
it's actually individual pieces of
flywire<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.350> lace<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.280> it
