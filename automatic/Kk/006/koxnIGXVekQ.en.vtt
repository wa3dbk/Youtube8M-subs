we would call the Bill of the Hat which

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.700 
we would call the Bill of the Hat which
again<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.159> black<00:01:41.729> piece<00:01:42.619> we're<00:01:43.619> gonna

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
again is just a black piece we're gonna

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.960 
again is just a black piece we're gonna
take<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> little<00:01:44.159> play-doh<00:01:44.490> knife<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:49.850> cut<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
take a little play-doh knife and cut it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.899 
take a little play-doh knife and cut it
out

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
out

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.819 
out
just<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.079> now<00:01:54.289> this<00:01:54.409> might<00:01:54.649> be<00:01:54.679> a

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
just like that now this might be a

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.999 
just like that now this might be a
little<00:01:55.069> too<00:01:55.490> thick<00:01:56.409> but<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.469> think<00:01:57.649> it'll<00:01:57.799> still

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
little too thick but I think it'll still

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.380 
little too thick but I think it'll still
work<00:01:58.069> so<00:01:58.429> we're<00:01:58.549> gonna<00:01:58.670> put<00:01:58.939> it<00:01:59.030> right<00:01:59.060> here<00:01:59.210> on

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
work so we're gonna put it right here on

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.389 
work so we're gonna put it right here on
Chili's<00:01:59.780> head<00:01:59.929> you<00:02:00.829> can<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.009> there's<00:02:01.250> little

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
Chili's head you can see there's little

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.580 
Chili's head you can see there's little
bit<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.819> toothpick<00:02:02.030> still<00:02:02.560> going<00:02:03.560> through

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
bit of a toothpick still going through

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.840 
bit of a toothpick still going through
and<00:02:03.920> then<00:02:04.039> now<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.250> top<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.700> his<00:02:04.789> hat<00:02:06.219> is<00:02:07.219> more

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
and then now the top of his hat is more

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.900 
and then now the top of his hat is more
like<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> ball<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.369> got<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.549> little<00:02:10.729> yellow

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
like a ball so I got a little yellow

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.759 
like a ball so I got a little yellow
play-doh<00:02:11.180> stuck<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.290> that's<00:02:12.530> probably

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
play-doh stuck here and that's probably

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.259 
play-doh stuck here and that's probably
too<00:02:13.010> much<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.489> we're<00:02:13.610> gonna<00:02:13.700> cut<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.090> half

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
too much so we're gonna cut it in half

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.930 
too much so we're gonna cut it in half
and<00:02:16.599> we're<00:02:17.599> gonna<00:02:17.750> take<00:02:17.989> it<00:02:18.610> we're<00:02:19.610> gonna<00:02:19.760> roll

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and we're gonna take it we're gonna roll

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.970 
and we're gonna take it we're gonna roll
it<00:02:19.970> nice<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.330> round<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:24.200> if<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.560> seen<00:02:24.860> a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
eyes to be about the same size we got a

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.050 
eyes to be about the same size we got a
little<00:03:04.910> bit<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.299> bigger<00:03:05.450> piece<00:03:05.750> left<00:03:07.060> I'm

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
little bit of a bigger piece left I'm

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.729 
little bit of a bigger piece left I'm
gonna<00:03:08.269> use<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:08.989> Chili's<00:03:10.180> health<00:03:11.739> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
I'll put it a little bit lower now chili

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.860 
I'll put it a little bit lower now chili
has<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> nose<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.530> his<00:03:21.769> nose<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.090> orange<00:03:23.090> just

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.089 
has a nose and his nose is orange just
kind<00:03:24.139> of<00:03:24.260> because<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.680> supposed<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:24.919> look<00:03:24.980> like

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
kind of because it supposed to look like

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.490 
kind of because it supposed to look like
a<00:03:25.220> carrot<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:26.150> we'll<00:03:26.329> skip<00:03:26.569> some<00:03:26.810> blue<00:03:26.989> orange

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
a carrot so we'll skip some blue orange

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.949 
a carrot so we'll skip some blue orange
play-doh<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:28.040> make<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.540> okay<00:03:29.540> I've<00:03:29.780> got<00:03:29.930> a

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
play-doh and make that okay I've got a

play-doh and make that okay I've got a
little<00:03:30.200> orange<00:03:30.410> play-doh<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.160> I've<00:03:31.250> got<00:03:31.400> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
little orange play-doh and I've got a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.580 
little orange play-doh and I've got a
toothpick<00:03:31.989> you<00:03:32.989> know<00:03:33.079> I'll<00:03:33.290> put<00:03:33.440> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
toothpick you know I'll put the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.050 
toothpick you know I'll put the
toothpick<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.489> a<00:03:34.549> little<00:03:34.819> piece<00:03:35.030> of

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
toothpick in just a little piece of

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.659 
toothpick in just a little piece of
toothpick<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.660> don't<00:03:35.870> know<00:03:35.959> not<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.260> whole<00:03:36.380> one

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
toothpick I don't know not a whole one

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.330 
toothpick I don't know not a whole one
so<00:03:37.669> we<00:03:37.730> don't<00:03:37.880> want<00:03:38.090> his<00:03:38.239> nose<00:03:38.419> to<00:03:38.569> be<00:03:38.690> too<00:03:39.049> big

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
so we don't want his nose to be too big

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.559 
so we don't want his nose to be too big
and<00:03:40.340> we're<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.669> gonna<00:03:40.760> roll<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.180> around<00:03:41.269> a

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
and we're just gonna roll it around a

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:50.289 
and we're just gonna roll it around a
little<00:03:41.660> bit<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:48.760> that's<00:03:49.760> probably<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.120> little

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
little bit and that's probably a little

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.289 
little bit and that's probably a little
too<00:03:50.540> big<00:03:50.720> for<00:03:50.750> Chili's<00:03:51.230> nose<00:03:51.470> but<00:03:52.060> we<00:03:53.060> can<00:03:53.209> make

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
too big for Chili's nose but we can make

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.430 
too big for Chili's nose but we can make
it<00:03:53.389> a<00:03:53.450> little<00:03:53.569> smaller<00:03:53.870> if<00:03:53.989> we<00:03:54.079> want<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.260> we

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
it a little smaller if we want to we

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.390 
it a little smaller if we want to we
just<00:03:54.470> pinch<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.950> little<00:03:55.069> off<00:03:56.349> and<00:03:57.349> then<00:03:58.129> do<00:03:58.280> the
