a back-to-back season were you like
psych<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> show<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.299> doing<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.350> was

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
psych the show is doing so well I was

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.850 
psych the show is doing so well I was
psyched<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.890> myself<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.670> um<00:01:21.299> i<00:01:22.140> was

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
psyched for myself because um i was

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.170 
psyched for myself because um i was
gonna<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> choreograph<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.119> a

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
gonna get to choreograph more and not a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.780 
gonna get to choreograph more and not a
year<00:01:24.390> later<00:01:24.600> however<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> bit

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
year later however it I think it's a bit

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.609 
year later however it I think it's a bit
better<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> summer<00:01:27.570> show<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> think<00:01:28.200> it's<00:01:28.470> up

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
better as a summer show I think it's up

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
better as a summer show I think it's up
against<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.040> much<00:01:29.250> competition<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.210> no

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
against so much competition and I no

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
against so much competition and I no
ratings<00:01:30.630> down<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:31.020> bit<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.619> there

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
ratings down a little bit because there

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.770 
ratings down a little bit because there
is<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.159> much<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.460> TV<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.939> when<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
is so much on TV but when you think of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
is so much on TV but when you think of
the<00:01:33.869> summer<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> dance's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the summer you think so you can dance's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.470 
the summer you think so you can dance's
on

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
on

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.450 
on
so<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.290> think<00:01:36.500> it's<00:01:36.740> actually<00:01:37.040> going<00:01:37.160> back<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.430> a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
so I think it's actually going back to a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.860 
so I think it's actually going back to a
summer<00:01:37.700> summer<00:01:38.240> show<00:01:38.390> I<00:01:38.420> don't<00:01:38.540> think<00:01:38.780> it's

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
summer summer show I don't think it's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.840 
summer summer show I don't think it's
going<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.020> continue<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.590> fall<00:01:39.770> but<00:01:40.490> that
