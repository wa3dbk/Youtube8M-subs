00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:11.119
 well we're here with a little problem 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:14.179
 what to do when there is the 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:18.439
 wardrobe wardrobe door 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.140
 industrial breaks and do not have a 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.710
 spare part 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.339
 trade does not sell spare parts 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.359
 for the industrialized wardrobe 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.019
 so what to do 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.019
 good 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:42.199
 comparing with the material we have 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:46.039
 I went to get my scrap 1 t of 34 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:51.559
 with reduction to 6 and if he gave me 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:57.289
 a great idea what was to remove the 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:04.129
 part the final part of the ring tz 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:05.180
 here to make the pulley I 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.620
 I did not find it 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:19.090
 Okay then I know I know this is not this homeland 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:23.630
 and this ring from t 34 to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.770
 subsequently make broken capaf 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:32.120
 or is this part here that broke this 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.270
 ring out is not good as it was 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.130
 did not extend it there. 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.000
 It was a lot of sacrifice and a lot of 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.220
 technique a lot of patience but the result 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.540
 end is what you see here 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:53.420
 here then this brown part is already the ring 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.760
 of the tube that has been sawed the ring of td 34 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.520
 so remembered here is the range of side to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.090
 Other, I'm not even going to make it soon 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.520
 this other hobby or adjust that other 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 then the other ring is already here 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.039
 robinho is already mounted has been tested 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.100
 there in the wardrobe did she work 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.100
 slid into the gutter within the gutter 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.680
 is to pay attention to this measure here 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.370
 it's just thick figurines here have to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.160
 be the same thickness as the old one so that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.500
 do not worry nakaya so here is the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.460
 old is so third this same 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 thickness 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.400
 I already did already tested and the part is already 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.080

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.670
