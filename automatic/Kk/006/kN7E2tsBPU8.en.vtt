00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079

towards<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> crease<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.840> next<00:02:12.989> you're<00:02:13.170> going

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
towards the crease so next you're going

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.000 
towards the crease so next you're going
to<00:02:13.410> need

going to use the black but the black is
a<00:03:35.489> little<00:03:35.760> bit<00:03:35.879> way<00:03:36.030> too<00:03:36.090> dramatic<00:03:36.419> and<00:03:37.019> for

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
a little bit way too dramatic and for

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.309 
a little bit way too dramatic and for
this<00:03:37.829> i<00:03:38.040> decided<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.579> use<00:03:38.699> this<00:03:38.989> fluffy<00:03:39.989> brush

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
this i decided to use this fluffy brush

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.569 
this i decided to use this fluffy brush
and<00:03:40.519> this<00:03:41.519> is<00:03:41.669> the<00:03:41.790> SS<00:03:42.150> 226<00:03:43.099> which<00:03:44.099> is<00:03:44.280> similar

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
and this is the SS 226 which is similar

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.949 
and this is the SS 226 which is similar
to<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.959> 224<00:03:46.650> but<00:03:46.919> it's<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.129> little<00:03:47.250> bit<00:03:47.959> more

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
to the 224 but it's a little bit more

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.289 
to the 224 but it's a little bit more
condensed<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.370> we're<00:03:50.549> just<00:03:50.579> going<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:51.060> Pat<00:03:51.269> it

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
condensed so we're just going to Pat it

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:57.439 
condensed so we're just going to Pat it
off<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.190> this<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.879> go<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:57.269> outer

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
off and this is going to go on the outer

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:02.940 
off and this is going to go on the outer
v

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.740 

just<00:04:03.610> like<00:04:03.790> that

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.950 

and<00:04:07.870> then<00:04:08.470> just<00:04:08.650> drag<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.310> little<00:04:09.550> bit<00:04:12.960> up

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
and then just drag it in a little bit up

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.099 
and then just drag it in a little bit up
to<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.350> crease<00:04:15.299> so<00:04:16.299> not<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.480> much<00:04:16.930> because

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
to the crease so not that much because

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
to the crease so not that much because
we<00:04:17.230> want<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.590> just<00:04:17.769> kind<00:04:18.190> of<00:04:18.250> like<00:04:18.400> fade<00:04:18.790> out

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
we want to just kind of like fade out

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.360 
we want to just kind of like fade out
into<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.450> crease<00:04:20.010> so<00:04:21.010> try<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.250> keep

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
into the crease so try to keep

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.200 
into the crease so try to keep
everything<00:04:21.730> within<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.480> eyelid<00:04:23.970> and<00:04:24.970> now<00:04:25.090> i'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
everything within the eyelid and now i'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.070 
everything within the eyelid and now i'm
