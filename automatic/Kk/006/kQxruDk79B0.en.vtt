00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.609
 I have been here for our stream 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.140
 eame buttonholes I promised 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.420
 Unfortunately, it did not make it sooner here 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.940
 So, if you are here, it is suitable 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.960
 Now that you just like us 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.949
 Split pigtails here have two 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.630
 incorporated buttonholes lengthwise 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.269
 So that we three thirds the mesh 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.699
 so to speak and you will be it is whole 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.349
 simply with the buttonholes I 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.240
 Do a little extra extra here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.800
 Tension the thread again 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 the finger just wrapped in the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 buttonholes that maybe the stitches 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.780
 are a bit firmer 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.710
 I knit eight stitches and walls here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 the work the eight stitches back and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.829
 a total of six purely about these eight 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 mesh in back and forth travel 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.610
 room walls after the eight stitches 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.610
 I 've made it faster now 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.220
 That means the first buttonhole is created 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.310
 after eight stitches from the edge and to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 I just knit over these eight stitches 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.420
 six rows like many rows of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 Of course, stricks are based on the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.020
 size of the button so here i have 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.500
 provided big buttons 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.240
 and it fits in there just when I fit 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.240
 Eight when I get sex pure 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:39.140
 in the height so stretch and after me 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.299
 yes before from right to left in the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.180
 knitted direction I controlled 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.479
 then only once the number of rows 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.280
 So I'm still knitting a row 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.009
 in the end the rich but in this 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:57.530
 Knitted direction before I knit 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.960
 Now a row outward around then 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.380
 I knit the second bridge for that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.830
 second buttonhole so once again 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:14.080
 to the edge 8 stitches 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.080
 I'll take an extra nose for it now 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.430
 otherwise I can get such a second rose 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.430
 do not stretch separately 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.270
 Unfortunately, I have to go now the thread 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.200
 There is no way to cut it off 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:39.520
 you have to sew a bit over 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:46.020
 at the buttonholes when you get the threads 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:49.450
 must cut off now stretch 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.290
 We started in this direction 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.100
 that means I stretch on the back 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.800
 again eight mesh back now to eight 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.410
 mesh in front of the edge so just over 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.580
 the next eight stitches six rows 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.580
 stretch back and forth 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.750
 and use again and she's eight 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.620
 stitch back again in total 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.620
 six in 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.290
 I turn it back faster 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.830
 So these are now button holes of the length 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.709
 after stretching there is on needle game 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.739
 also get a video show how wet 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.319
 but you are buttoning across here strictly 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.620
 in this longitudinally striped ribs 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.610
 had to be natural, so to speak 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.970
 better buttonholes knit longitudinally 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:58.319
 are like over eight stitches again 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:00.090
 six rows back and I end 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.989
 again in the same direction as the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.760
 first piece and must be here again 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.760
 to cut the thread 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.470
 I do the same with the 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.769
 remaining eight stitches i need this 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.420
 to raise an extreme nobility because I yes 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.420
 Start on the back 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:45.770
 and again, exactly the same thing happens 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:49.880
 new thread and six again 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:52.580
 and return over the eight stitches 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.410
 of course, always stretch the pattern 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.310
 according to which pattern 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.310
 knitted 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.759
 So here we do it if you make it 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.240
 a tubular scarf a knotted 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:24.340
 hose scarf make booty in English 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.930
 a foul then you could be great here 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.340
 put buttons on one side and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.800
 may need just the area on the 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:35.400
 other side as well as the faster 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.400
 put, of course 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.259
 so 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.239
 Now we have these three bridges you see 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.659
 So it became clear to ours 

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:06.559
 buttonholes arrive and now will 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:11.809
 just continue crocheting continue to knit 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:13.239
 Of course all mesh cross over it 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:18.050
 Now you will be like that again 

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:21.469
 knit these three webs none 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.319
 special feature is simply a series 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.089
 knit over it 

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:28.639
 you have a little loose mesh 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.979
 the edges where you the new paths 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.459
 You have to take then of course 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:37.459
 unfortunately later threads speak 

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:39.699
 Nobody helps us here and just here 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:42.019
 Continue knitting with the second piece 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.139
 and then the same with the 

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:47.439
 third piece so nothing difficult 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.439
 tuned 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:54.919
 So these are three bridges to the 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:58.129
 button holes merged again and 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.360
 I would rank six this year 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.439
 knit on it 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.209
 before I cut that off so strictly 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.729
 not too tight if you only have two rows 

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:08.990
 turn it on the city strange if the 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.360
 hanging out buttons 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.729
 so that's enough room for the buttons 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.999
 that means they only offer very big ones 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:19.249
 Buttons should have the edge around that 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:22.339
 get through the buttonhole a bit 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:24.469
 So I 'm gonna put in six that would 

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:27.139
 then make room for big ones too 

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:29.599
 buttons so you see here our finished 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.579
 buttonholes the threads must be yours 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.699
 Sewn if you can right up there 

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:37.309
 and slits at the bottom of the buttonhole 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:40.639
 with these when watching TV a bit 

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:46.929
 do not reinforce that 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:46.929
 unwanted out of which have fun with it and
