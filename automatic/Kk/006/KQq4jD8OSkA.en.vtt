00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.520 

for<00:00:10.430> this<00:00:10.520> technique<00:00:10.790> I'll<00:00:11.300> be<00:00:11.450> using<00:00:11.660> quite<00:00:12.410> a

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
for this technique I'll be using quite a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.530 
for this technique I'll be using quite a
large<00:00:12.799> needle<00:00:13.370> with<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:13.639> large<00:00:13.850> eye<00:00:14.120> but<00:00:14.450> I'll

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
large needle with a large eye but I'll

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.339 
large needle with a large eye but I'll
also<00:00:14.719> be<00:00:14.900> using<00:00:15.080> a<00:00:15.610> stranded<00:00:16.610> call<00:00:17.450> wall<00:00:18.050> which

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
also be using a stranded call wall which

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:21.130 
also be using a stranded call wall which
is<00:00:18.380> a<00:00:18.470> two<00:00:18.680> ply<00:00:18.950> wall<00:00:19.220> it<00:00:20.180> gives<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.540> vey<00:00:20.660> fine

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
is a two ply wall it gives a vey fine

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
is a two ply wall it gives a vey fine
tight<00:00:21.710> compact<00:00:22.220> stitch<00:00:22.790> when<00:00:23.390> work<00:00:23.630> together

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 

okay<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.960> important<00:00:43.410> thing<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> remember

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
okay the important thing to remember

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.090 
okay the important thing to remember
with<00:00:44.489> plush<00:00:44.940> work<00:00:45.269> is<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.440> must<00:00:46.739> work

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
with plush work is that you must work

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.959 
with plush work is that you must work
from<00:00:47.489> left<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:48.030> right<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:50.339> actual<00:00:50.670> stitch

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
from left to right and the actual stitch

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
from left to right and the actual stitch
is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> series<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.780> loops<00:00:52.070> which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> then

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
is a series of loops which is then

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.880 
is a series of loops which is then
created<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:54.269> an<00:00:54.390> anchoring<00:00:54.839> stitch<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.769> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
created with an anchoring stitch and the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
created with an anchoring stitch and the
anchoring<00:00:56.339> stitch<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.879> actually<00:00:57.210> hold<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
anchoring stitch will actually hold the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.020 
anchoring stitch will actually hold the
loop<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.110> place<00:00:58.290> and<00:00:59.040> once<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.549> series

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
loop in place and once we have a series

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.600 
loop in place and once we have a series
of<00:01:00.059> loops<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.600> sit<00:01:00.839> next<00:01:01.019> to<00:01:01.199> one<00:01:01.320> another<00:01:01.610> we

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
of loops that sit next to one another we

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.969 
of loops that sit next to one another we
will<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:02.909> create<00:01:03.360> a<00:01:03.690> bank<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.259> line<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
will then create a bank or a line of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.889 
will then create a bank or a line of
these<00:01:05.159> loops<00:01:05.489> which<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.180> then<00:01:06.330> cut<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
these loops which we can then cut and

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.700 
these loops which we can then cut and
trim<00:01:07.259> to<00:01:08.100> create<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.759> brushwork<00:01:09.360> hedging<00:01:09.810> now

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
trim to create the brushwork hedging now

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.270 
trim to create the brushwork hedging now
we<00:01:10.770> start<00:01:11.310> by<00:01:11.850> threading<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.229> needle<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
we start by threading the needle and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
we start by threading the needle and
then<00:01:14.460> plunging<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.119> needles<00:01:15.390> through<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
then plunging the needles through the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
then plunging the needles through the
canvas<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.800> I<00:01:17.069> then<00:01:17.190> end<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.940> small

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
canvas so I then end up with a small

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.410 
canvas so I then end up with a small
tail<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.179> be

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
tail like this and I'm then going to be

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
tail like this and I'm then going to be
bringing<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> needle<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.830> through<00:01:23.190> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
bringing the needle back up through the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.260 
bringing the needle back up through the
canvas<00:01:24.890> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.920> left<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> stitch<00:01:27.000> that's

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
canvas to the left of the stitch that's

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.240 
canvas to the left of the stitch that's
already<00:01:27.569> going<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.710> holding<00:01:28.920> onto

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
already going in and I'm holding onto

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.359 
already going in and I'm holding onto
the<00:01:29.490> thread<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.539> create<00:01:30.869> tension<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.190> then

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the thread to create tension and then

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.469 
the thread to create tension and then
plunging<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> needle<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.420> down<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:36.149> I'm

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
plunging the needle back down now I'm

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
plunging the needle back down now I'm
working<00:01:36.929> on<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.080> very<00:01:37.319> fine<00:01:37.560> 24<00:01:38.310> count<00:01:38.580> canvas

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
working on a very fine 24 count canvas

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.419 
working on a very fine 24 count canvas
now<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.350> demonstrate<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.159> stitch

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
now for me to demonstrate this stitch

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.279 
now for me to demonstrate this stitch
I'm<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:41.970> working<00:01:42.330> on<00:01:42.420> much<00:01:42.600> largest

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
I'm going to be working on much largest

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.230 
I'm going to be working on much largest
stitch<00:01:43.530> stitch<00:01:44.220> than<00:01:44.429> I<00:01:44.520> normally<00:01:44.580> would<00:01:44.909> do

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
stitch stitch than I normally would do

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.520 
stitch stitch than I normally would do
on<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> particular<00:01:46.560> project<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.530> created

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
on this particular project so created

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.529 
on this particular project so created
the<00:01:49.619> first<00:01:49.890> stitch<00:01:50.219> and<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.090> bring<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
the first stitch and I now bring the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.870 
the first stitch and I now bring the
needle<00:01:51.689> up<00:01:51.960> through<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:53.070> existing<00:01:53.369> stitch

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
needle up through the existing stitch

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.560 
needle up through the existing stitch
and<00:01:54.409> then<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.759> canvas<00:01:57.210> threads

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and then I work three canvas threads

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.010 
and then I work three canvas threads
over<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.350> my<00:01:58.469> right<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.210> carry<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.420> working

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
over to my right and carry on working

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.590 
over to my right and carry on working
all<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.590> along<00:02:01.950> until<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.119> series

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
all the way along until I have a series

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.190 
all the way along until I have a series
of<00:02:03.630> loops<00:02:04.079> now<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.329> creating<00:02:06.780> these

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of loops now I'm actually creating these

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800 
of loops now I'm actually creating these
loops<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.459> they're<00:02:08.609> quite<00:02:08.850> long<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.479> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
loops so that they're quite long so I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.280 
loops so that they're quite long so I
can<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.459> hold<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.609> loops<00:02:11.820> in<00:02:12.030> place<00:02:12.329> so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
can actually hold the loops in place so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.770 
can actually hold the loops in place so
I<00:02:13.320> can<00:02:13.530> actually<00:02:13.650> keep<00:02:14.010> my<00:02:14.250> pathway<00:02:14.910> clear<00:02:15.390> all

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I can actually keep my pathway clear all

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.410 
I can actually keep my pathway clear all
the<00:02:16.019> way<00:02:16.140> through<00:02:16.850> okay<00:02:17.850> as<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.120> said<00:02:18.269> before

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
the way through okay as I said before

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.180 
the way through okay as I said before
I'm<00:02:18.840> working<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.350> stitch<00:02:19.560> from<00:02:19.590> left<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
I'm working the stitch from left to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.250 
I'm working the stitch from left to
right<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.760> as<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.299> can<00:02:21.390> see<00:02:21.450> here<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> needle

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
right and as you can see here the needle

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.640 
right and as you can see here the needle
is<00:02:22.410> actually<00:02:22.530> coming<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.070> through<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.790> stitch

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
is actually coming up through the stitch

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.199 
is actually coming up through the stitch
and<00:02:25.650> I'm<00:02:25.769> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.010> be<00:02:26.160> forming<00:02:26.609> the<00:02:26.850> next

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and I'm going to be forming the next

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.569 
and I'm going to be forming the next
loop<00:02:27.450> which<00:02:27.930> I'll<00:02:28.109> hold<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.620> place<00:02:28.859> I<00:02:29.190> take<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
loop which I'll hold in place I take the

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.060 
loop which I'll hold in place I take the
needle<00:02:29.850> down<00:02:30.060> through<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.630> canvas<00:02:30.900> keep<00:02:31.769> hold

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
needle down through the canvas keep hold

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.759 
needle down through the canvas keep hold
of<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.340> tension<00:02:33.140> creating<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.320> loop<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
of that tension creating that loop and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.580 
of that tension creating that loop and
then<00:02:34.859> the<00:02:35.190> needle<00:02:35.430> comes<00:02:35.549> back<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.590> straight

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
then the needle comes back up straight

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.699 
then the needle comes back up straight
over<00:02:38.209> back<00:02:39.209> down<00:02:39.420> again<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.019> that's<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
over back down again and that's the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.620 
over back down again and that's the
anchoring<00:02:41.100> stitch<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.640> holds<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.420> plush

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
anchoring stitch that holds the plush

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.259 
anchoring stitch that holds the plush
work<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.079> place<00:02:43.670> okay<00:02:44.670> I've<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:44.910> finished

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
work in place okay I've just finished

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.630 
work in place okay I've just finished
this<00:02:45.840> small<00:02:46.470> hedge<00:02:46.709> here<00:02:47.010> I'm<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.489> going<00:02:47.609> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
this small hedge here I'm just going to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.520 
this small hedge here I'm just going to
cut<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.299> at<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.690> thread<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:51.229> you<00:02:52.229> can<00:02:52.350> see

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
cut you at the thread and you can see

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.280 
cut you at the thread and you can see
the<00:02:52.709> loops<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.669> which<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.090> about<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.359> cut

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the loops there which I'm about to cut

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.770 
the loops there which I'm about to cut
and<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:56.430> need<00:02:56.579> to<00:02:56.669> take<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.850> fine<00:02:57.180> pair<00:02:57.479> of

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and I need to take a fine pair of

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.129 
and I need to take a fine pair of
scissors<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.650> you<00:02:59.639> start<00:02:59.970> off<00:03:00.269> by<00:03:01.019> actually

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
scissors and you start off by actually

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.080 
scissors and you start off by actually
cutting<00:03:01.530> across<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> top<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:02.699> I'm<00:03:02.760> going<00:03:02.940> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
cutting across the top now I'm going to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.030 
cutting across the top now I'm going to
push<00:03:03.389> from<00:03:03.930> underneath<00:03:04.729> the<00:03:05.729> loops<00:03:05.970> up<00:03:06.329> and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
push from underneath the loops up and

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.160 
push from underneath the loops up and
just<00:03:08.040> trim

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.730 

you

so<00:03:17.740> I'm<00:03:17.800> just<00:03:17.950> cutting<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:19.360> top<00:03:20.220> okay<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.370> now

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
so I'm just cutting the top okay I now

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.550 
so I'm just cutting the top okay I now
need<00:03:21.910> to<00:03:21.940> remove<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:24.430> thread<00:03:24.730> away<00:03:25.380> okay<00:03:26.380> I'm

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
need to remove that thread away okay I'm

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.740 
need to remove that thread away okay I'm
going<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.800> trim<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.520> hedge<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.210> give<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.690> a

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
going to trim the hedge to give it a

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.430 
going to trim the hedge to give it a
nice<00:03:28.900> shape

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
nice shape

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.960 
nice shape
I'm<00:03:29.800> going<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.040> take<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.280> scissors<00:03:30.610> at<00:03:30.790> an

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
I'm going to take the scissors at an

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.330 
I'm going to take the scissors at an
angle<00:03:31.360> along<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.440> side<00:03:32.710> and<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.190> can<00:03:33.220> see

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
angle along the side and you can see

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.120 
angle along the side and you can see
there<00:03:33.790> that<00:03:33.970> I'm<00:03:34.090> almost<00:03:34.270> like<00:03:34.540> cutting<00:03:35.130> down

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
there that I'm almost like cutting down

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.340 
there that I'm almost like cutting down
into<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.390> hedge<00:03:38.760> okay<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.030> now<00:03:40.240> just<00:03:41.200> going

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
into the hedge okay and now just going

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.060 
into the hedge okay and now just going
to<00:03:41.440> tidy<00:03:41.770> up<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.310> air<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:44.110> work<00:03:44.380> into

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
to tidy up the air is and just work into

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.430 
to tidy up the air is and just work into
the<00:03:45.970> hedge<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.570> shaping<00:03:47.380> up<00:03:47.590> around<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
the hedge just shaping up around the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.400 
the hedge just shaping up around the
edge<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.450> because<00:03:52.450> I've<00:03:52.600> done<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.960> locking

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
edge and because I've done the locking

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.890 
edge and because I've done the locking
stitches<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:54.370> thread<00:03:54.730> will<00:03:55.030> not<00:03:55.240> fall<00:03:55.750> out

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
stitches the thread will not fall out

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.560 
stitches the thread will not fall out
and<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:59.170> can<00:03:59.410> trim<00:03:59.770> this<00:04:00.100> back<00:04:00.430> quite<00:04:01.210> a<00:04:01.240> long

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
and I can trim this back quite a long

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.260 
and I can trim this back quite a long
way<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.270> almost<00:04:04.480> looks<00:04:04.720> like<00:04:04.930> glass<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:06.270> so

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
way so it almost looks like glass and so

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.290 
way so it almost looks like glass and so
to<00:04:07.330> finish<00:04:08.200> off<00:04:08.410> we<00:04:08.890> would<00:04:09.040> actually<00:04:09.160> tidy<00:04:10.150> up

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
to finish off we would actually tidy up

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.870 
to finish off we would actually tidy up
around<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:11.260> area<00:04:11.710> and<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:12.010> can<00:04:12.190> actually<00:04:12.310> use

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
around the area and you can actually use

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.480 
around the area and you can actually use
something<00:04:13.270> like<00:04:13.570> just<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.290> small<00:04:14.710> brush<00:04:14.950> just

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
something like just a small brush just

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.979 
something like just a small brush just
to<00:04:15.670> remove<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.900> extra<00:04:17.400> threads<00:04:18.400> away<00:04:18.989> but

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
to remove the extra threads away but

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.080 
to remove the extra threads away but
normally<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.650> would<00:04:20.799> have<00:04:20.830> all<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.790> area

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
normally you would have all of this area

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.810 
normally you would have all of this area
all<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.510> way<00:04:22.690> along<00:04:22.990> here<00:04:23.340> stitched<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.640> you

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
all the way along here stitched and you

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.070 
all the way along here stitched and you
would<00:04:24.970> trim<00:04:25.210> your<00:04:25.390> hedge<00:04:25.800> all<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:27.160> one<00:04:27.340> go<00:04:28.080> here

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
would trim your hedge all in one go here

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.320 
would trim your hedge all in one go here
you<00:04:29.110> can<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.040> seasonal<00:04:30.640> knock<00:04:30.910> garden

different<00:05:33.380> counts<00:05:33.830> of<00:05:34.040> canvas<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:34.760> your

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
different counts of canvas so your

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.000 
different counts of canvas so your
