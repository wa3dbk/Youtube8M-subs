00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 yes 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.969
 all right 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.600
 the bmw 235 and is unique in its kind not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.810
 there is another car with this size four 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.610
 Rear traction seats and 326 horses 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.550
 the almost obsolete mercedes class c coupe 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.470
 350 approaches but it does not touch him and what of 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.710
 almost obsolete we can also say it 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.600
 the brand new 235 and because Look 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.340
 has traditional handbrake 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.500
 lovers of skids what 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.379
 you will appreciate but there is already technology 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.539
 superior another improvable thing is that no 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.789
 brings you closer to the belts what makes a 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.649
 little uncomfortable to put them on and that my 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.219
 legs allow me to go pretty far 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.219
 of the steering wheel 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.449
 continue with upgradable Details 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.640
 revolver has just marked the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.409
 red zone and you have to look good for 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.420
 change gear or be attentive to 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.420
 engine sound when we use the cams 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.110
 and since we are taking out the bad 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.750
 this button that modifies the modes of 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.210
 driving should be located first 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.010
 in the place where this is for playing 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.010
 it will arrive the easiest and fastest 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.700
 we already know what we do not like about the car 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.160
 and what will surely make you the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 life a little less comfortable on board we go 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.320
 to see the things that we like that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.320
 luck are more 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.550
 let's start with the engine 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.650
 mechanical jewel where there are six 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.500
 cylinders three liters of displacement that 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.580
 they are round numbers and I turbo this 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.980
 results in 326 passing horses 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.020
 to the rear wheels is an engine 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.120
 fabulous that delivers power from the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.510
 principle progressively but 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.000
 forceful although there is a version with 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.800
 four-wheel drive why why 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 not to say it would not hurt to ask 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.510
 for her if you like the car 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.250
 this time we are doing the test with 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.190
 the eight- speed automatic gearbox 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.870
 marches works great and in addition 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.870
 get fabulous consumptions 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
 we keep seeing good things in the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.880
 interior design is not a paragon of 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.610
 modernity and imagination but everything is 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.890
 on your site and the quality fit and feel 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.850
 of the materials tell us that we are 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.770
 in a bmw 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.450
 and the rear seats are for two 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.450
 not very corpulent people 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.590
 and the trunk has a capacity of 390 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.290
 liters which is a pretty good figure 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.709
 for its size and can also be folded 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.709
 the backups 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.500
 and we ended up praising how it could not be 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.600
 another way your driving using the mode 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.910
 Driving eco pro we recommend 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.760
 for day to day it seems that we carry a 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.490
 car with turbo and 150 horses the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.370
 accelerator is slow the direction is 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:29.370
 soft changes soon and the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.910
 softness is the dominant note but if 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.020
 we change to sport mode you have 235 and 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.020
 What did you expect 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 you have to step on the accelerator with the touch of 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.270
 surgeon the direction hardens the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:50.750
 engine is revolutionized and the softness continues 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.750
 being but at unspeakable speeds 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.230
 and eye with unleash your engine 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.519
 because this gossip runs a lot 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.519
 much much 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.849
 x 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.250
 and 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.270
 although there are things that should be improved on 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.040
 235 and it's a sports weapon take 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.720
 has the comfort of the rest of the range and 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.920
 sportsmanship enough to not 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.920
 think of a m version 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.870
 editor me that 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.870
 What else am I doing? 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.679
 mosquito 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.679
 the potato
