so<00:00:01.920> there<00:00:02.100> they<00:00:02.250> are<00:00:02.280> again<00:00:04.609> they're<00:00:05.609> going

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
so there they are again they're going

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.839 
so there they are again they're going
quite<00:00:06.120> fast<00:00:06.150> as<00:00:07.109> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.500> see<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.980> tower<00:00:08.639> is

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
quite fast as you can see the tower is

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.320 
quite fast as you can see the tower is
flexing<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.769> didn't<00:00:10.769> take<00:00:10.920> into<00:00:11.070> account<00:00:11.580> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
flexing I didn't take into account the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.519 
flexing I didn't take into account the
horizontal<00:00:13.910> load<00:00:14.929> these<00:00:15.929> things<00:00:16.199> we're<00:00:16.379> going

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
horizontal load these things we're going

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.220 
horizontal load these things we're going
to<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.800> any<00:00:17.210> one<00:00:18.210> generator<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.869> left

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
to have any one generator on the left

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
to have any one generator on the left
depends<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> wind<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> coming<00:00:21.090> one

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
depends on one of the wind is coming one

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.730 
depends on one of the wind is coming one
will<00:00:22.670> hide<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.699> wind<00:00:24.119> from<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> other<00:00:24.740> so

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
will hide the wind from the other so

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.939 
will hide the wind from the other so
next<00:00:26.699> weekend<00:00:27.500> we're<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> bring<00:00:28.830> that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
next weekend we're going to bring that

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.009 
next weekend we're going to bring that
tower<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.490> i'm<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> add<00:00:30.240> another<00:00:30.359> two

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
tower down i'm going to add another two

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290 
tower down i'm going to add another two
or<00:00:31.080> three<00:00:31.230> feet<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.130> those<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.850> get<00:00:33.059> out

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
or three feet to one of those to get out

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
or three feet to one of those to get out
of<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.540> airflow<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> turbulent<00:00:34.620> earful<00:00:34.920> from

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
of the airflow the turbulent earful from

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240 
of the airflow the turbulent earful from
the<00:00:35.309> other<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.690> and<00:00:36.690> i'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> get<00:00:37.380> steel

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the other one and i'm going to get steel

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.490 
the other one and i'm going to get steel
cables<00:00:39.110> to<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.140> elbows<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:41.100> those<00:00:41.730> spikes<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
cables to the elbows of those spikes and

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180 
cables to the elbows of those spikes and
time<00:00:43.500> down<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.579> corners<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.270> shed<00:00:46.190> to

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
time down to the corners of my shed to

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.520 
time down to the corners of my shed to
keep<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.610> power<00:00:47.820> from<00:00:48.030> flexing<00:00:48.480> anymore<00:00:48.840> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
keep that power from flexing anymore I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.470 
keep that power from flexing anymore I
just<00:00:50.100> don't<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
just don't I just don't like that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.110 
just don't I just don't like that
flexing<00:00:51.960> at<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.579> gonna<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.910> rid<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
flexing at all so I'm gonna get rid of

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.830 
flexing at all so I'm gonna get rid of
it<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.230> gonna<00:00:55.520> use<00:00:56.520> cables<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it and I'm just gonna use cables not to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
it and I'm just gonna use cables not to
do<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.109> with<00:01:00.230> going<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.649> fast<00:01:01.940> these

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
do that with going very very fast these

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.370 
do that with going very very fast these
are<00:01:03.180> wind<00:01:03.449> max<00:01:03.690> 1<00:01:04.199> kilowatt<00:01:04.559> turbines<00:01:05.430> are

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
are wind max 1 kilowatt turbines are

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
are wind max 1 kilowatt turbines are
pretty<00:01:07.380> awesome<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
pretty awesome but you can see that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty awesome but you can see that
flexing<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> towers<00:01:10.820> not<00:01:11.820> something<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
flexing in the towers not something that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.749 
flexing in the towers not something that
I<00:01:12.510> yeah<00:01:14.210> that's<00:01:15.210> hopeful<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> I'm

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I yeah that's hopeful that I like so I'm

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.690 
I yeah that's hopeful that I like so I'm
not<00:01:17.909> getting<00:01:18.150> eliminate<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.720> problem<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
not getting eliminate that problem and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
not getting eliminate that problem and
then<00:01:20.880> eventually<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.979> you

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
then eventually I'm going to put a you

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.700 
then eventually I'm going to put a you
know<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.250> month<00:01:23.659> since<00:01:24.659> i<00:01:24.750> find<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> gin

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
know but I month since i find the gin

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.340 
know but I month since i find the gin
pole<00:01:25.740> clamps<00:01:26.580> i<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:27.270> add<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> third<00:01:27.869> turbine

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
pole clamps i will add a third turbine

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.340 
pole clamps i will add a third turbine
but<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> smaller<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.350> PMA's

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but a smaller one on one of the PMA's

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.600 
but a smaller one on one of the PMA's
from<00:01:31.560> wind<00:01:31.770> blew<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.409> fast<00:01:34.409> blades<00:01:35.130> wrap

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
from wind blew with the fast blades wrap

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.149 
from wind blew with the fast blades wrap
their<00:01:35.820> blades<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.320> from<00:01:37.650> me<00:01:37.979> sorry

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
their blades you can get from me sorry

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
their blades you can get from me sorry
wind<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> solar<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.229> pretty

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
wind and solar and that that's a pretty

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.039 
wind and solar and that that's a pretty
good<00:01:43.439> setup<00:01:43.740> i<00:01:44.070> wish<00:01:44.280> i<00:01:44.850> had<00:01:45.450> won<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> Mystery

there's<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.710> ant<00:02:05.890> meter<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:09.039> keeps

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
there's the ant meter going just keeps

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.250 
there's the ant meter going just keeps
fluctuating<00:02:09.700> up<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.300> down<00:02:12.150> but<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.210> you'll<00:02:14.020> see

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
fluctuating up and down but I you'll see

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
channel 2 17 miles an hour so it's not

an hour so while telling you get that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.760 
an hour so while telling you get that
high<00:02:44.160> would<00:02:45.160> be<00:02:45.310> pulling<00:02:45.610> some<00:02:45.730> serious<00:02:46.030> amps

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
high would be pulling some serious amps

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.770 
high would be pulling some serious amps
already<00:02:47.770> have<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.220> eventually<00:02:48.520> change<00:02:49.480> this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
already have to eventually change this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.040 
already have to eventually change this
amp<00:02:50.110> meter<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:51.640> something<00:02:52.030> higher<00:02:52.209> than<00:02:52.270> 50

amps<00:02:53.350> when<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:53.560> get<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.770> 80<00:02:54.310> or<00:02:54.580> 100<00:02:55.000> amp<00:02:55.690> but<00:02:56.560> I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
amps when we get a 80 or 100 amp but I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.550 
amps when we get a 80 or 100 amp but I
like<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.800> granularity<00:02:57.430> of<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.690> one<00:02:58.959> as<00:02:59.290> far

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
like the granularity of this one as far

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.100 
like the granularity of this one as far
as<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> charmer<00:03:00.370> what's<00:03:00.550> going<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:04.110> it's

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
as a charmer what's going on and it's

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.600 
as a charmer what's going on and it's
not<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.440> often<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:05.860> get<00:03:05.950> those<00:03:06.130> high

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
not that often that we get those high

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.570 
not that often that we get those high
winds<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:07.299> anyway<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.980> this<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.340> more

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
winds in here anyway so this is more

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.240 
winds in here anyway so this is more
more<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.150> an<00:03:10.269> average<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:11.019> well<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.620> can<00:03:11.890> expect

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
more of an average of well I can expect

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.720 
more of an average of well I can expect
to<00:03:12.340> see<00:03:12.549> in<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.760> area<00:03:14.160> so<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.489> not<00:03:15.580> too

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
to see in this area so this is not too

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.370 
to see in this area so this is not too
bad<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:17.049> can<00:03:17.170> see<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:18.330> inverter<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.930> 201

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
bad you can see that inverter the 201

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.690 
bad you can see that inverter the 201
inverters<00:03:20.980> really<00:03:21.489> going<00:03:21.820> fast<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:24.489> really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
inverters really going fast it's really

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.000 
inverters really going fast it's really
cooking<00:03:25.090> along<00:03:25.360> pretty<00:03:25.540> well<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.890> other

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
cooking along pretty well and the other

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.400 
cooking along pretty well and the other
one<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.220> kind<00:03:27.580> of<00:03:27.640> stuck<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.209> there<00:03:28.390> going<00:03:28.720> on

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
one just kind of stuck in there going on

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.320 
one just kind of stuck in there going on
it's<00:03:29.560> very<00:03:29.799> wayward<00:03:30.070> going<00:03:30.519> very<00:03:30.670> slowly<00:03:31.030> and

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
it's very wayward going very slowly and

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.270 
it's very wayward going very slowly and
I'm<00:03:32.200> gonna<00:03:32.320> see<00:03:32.560> what<00:03:32.739> I<00:03:32.769> can<00:03:32.860> do<00:03:33.100> about<00:03:33.250> that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
I'm gonna see what I can do about that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.250 
I'm gonna see what I can do about that
so<00:03:36.280> let's<00:03:36.610> try<00:03:37.030> something<00:03:37.480> here<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:37.959> go

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so let's try something here I just go

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.750 
so let's try something here I just go
when<00:03:38.500> I<00:03:38.530> hit<00:03:38.709> on<00:03:38.769> unplug<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.700> power<00:03:40.500> from<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
when I hit on unplug the power from the

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.789 
when I hit on unplug the power from the
bottom<00:03:43.150> inverter<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.080> hooked<00:03:44.350> up<00:03:44.620> a

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
bottom inverter and I hooked up a

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.050 
bottom inverter and I hooked up a
kilowatt<00:03:45.400> meter<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.190> line<00:03:48.519> here<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:48.940> we

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
kilowatt meter to the line here and we

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.820 
kilowatt meter to the line here and we
can<00:03:49.180> see<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.480> top<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:49.900> which<00:03:50.290> is<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.680> only

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
can see the top one which is the only

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.070 
can see the top one which is the only
one<00:03:51.040> that's<00:03:51.190> connected<00:03:51.670> it's<00:03:52.360> only<00:03:52.570> putting

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
one that's connected it's only putting

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.370 
one that's connected it's only putting
out<00:03:53.670> 1817<00:03:54.670> wats<00:03:55.110> so<00:03:56.110> there's<00:03:56.290> definitely

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
out 1817 wats so there's definitely

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.090 
out 1817 wats so there's definitely
defective<00:03:57.040> unit<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.570> replace

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
defective unit that I have to replace

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400 
defective unit that I have to replace
i'll<00:04:00.100> definitely<00:04:00.459> be<00:04:00.489> ordering<00:04:00.579> one<00:04:01.090> today

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
i'll definitely be ordering one today

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.470 
i'll definitely be ordering one today
and<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.530> bottom<00:04:02.829> one<00:04:02.860> is<00:04:03.220> here<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:03.940> let's<00:04:04.390> go

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
and the bottom one is here and let's go

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.610 
and the bottom one is here and let's go
ahead<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.660> plug<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:05.019> in<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.320> see<00:04:05.410> what

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
ahead and plug it in and see what

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.160 
ahead and plug it in and see what
happens<00:04:06.269> when<00:04:07.269> this<00:04:07.420> thing<00:04:07.630> starts<00:04:07.930> cranking

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
happens when this thing starts cranking

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.809 
happens when this thing starts cranking
out<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.590> juice<00:04:08.829> so<00:04:09.640> i<00:04:09.940> plugged<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.540> in<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:12.700> can

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
out the juice so i plugged it in you can

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.470 
out the juice so i plugged it in you can
see<00:04:12.940> immediately<00:04:13.030> starts<00:04:13.720> moving<00:04:14.050> up

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
see immediately starts moving up

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.560 
see immediately starts moving up
speaks<00:04:15.080> of<00:04:15.200> 264<00:04:16.150> 76<00:04:17.150> 89<00:04:17.930> 10<00:04:18.590> 2<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:20.180> he<00:04:20.419> keeps

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
speaks of 264 76 89 10 2 and he keeps

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.570 
speaks of 264 76 89 10 2 and he keeps
climbing<00:04:22.389> and<00:04:23.389> he's<00:04:23.540> still<00:04:23.780> going<00:04:23.990> up<00:04:24.580> and

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
climbing and he's still going up and

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.030 
climbing and he's still going up and
hopefully<00:04:26.150> that<00:04:26.479> will<00:04:26.540> stabilize<00:04:26.810> about<00:04:27.350> 250

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
hopefully that will stabilize about 250

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:36.610 
hopefully that will stabilize about 250
watch<00:04:33.250> that's<00:04:34.250> about<00:04:34.520> yep<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.630> much<00:04:35.780> 150<00:04:36.290> watt

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
watch that's about yep so much 150 watt

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.550 
watch that's about yep so much 150 watt
so<00:04:36.800> that's<00:04:36.949> actually<00:04:37.220> working<00:04:37.580> pretty<00:04:37.610> good

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
so that's actually working pretty good

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.810 
so that's actually working pretty good
for<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.710> bottom<00:04:40.010> one<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.340> top<00:04:40.550> one<00:04:40.580> is

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
for the bottom one but that top one is

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.200 
for the bottom one but that top one is
defective<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:42.080> one's<00:04:42.320> bad<00:04:42.790> how<00:04:43.790> to<00:04:43.850> replace

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
defective that one's bad how to replace

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.400 
defective that one's bad how to replace
that<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.780> one's<00:04:44.930> good<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:48.020> meter<00:04:48.289> is

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
that that one's good and this meter is

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.840 
that that one's good and this meter is
still<00:04:48.470> going<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:49.100> pretty<00:04:49.430> high<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:51.639> here's<00:04:52.639> my

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
still going up pretty high and here's my

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
change especially to the tower and they

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.230 
change especially to the tower and they
get<00:05:24.620> one<00:05:24.830> on<00:05:24.950> top<00:05:25.160> of<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.370> other<00:05:25.490> one<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:25.760> will

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240

than<00:05:28.669> that<00:05:28.910> because<00:05:29.030> then<00:05:29.210> I'll<00:05:29.330> have<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
than that because then I'll have the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.089 
than that because then I'll have the
full<00:05:29.870> power<00:05:30.050> of<00:05:30.229> both<00:05:30.410> instead<00:05:31.010> of<00:05:31.099> just<00:05:31.250> one

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
full power of both instead of just one

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.830 
full power of both instead of just one
in<00:05:34.099> apps

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.630 

there<00:05:38.840> we<00:05:38.960> go<00:05:39.140> at<00:05:39.500> a<00:05:39.560> better<00:05:39.800> angle<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.400> there's

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
there we go at a better angle so there's

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:49.140 
there we go at a better angle so there's
no<00:05:40.820> so<00:05:40.970> much<00:05:41.120> glare<00:05:41.420> on<00:05:41.450> it

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.610 

and<00:05:49.660> let's<00:05:49.990> see<00:05:50.110> how<00:05:50.230> they're<00:05:50.350> doing<00:05:50.380> outside

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.360 

they<00:05:56.620> are<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:58.530> wind<00:05:59.530> this<00:05:59.710> kind<00:05:59.920> of<00:05:59.950> changing

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
they are the wind this kind of changing

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.470 
they are the wind this kind of changing
off<00:06:00.520> looks<00:06:01.030> like<00:06:01.240> in<00:06:01.780> a<00:06:01.990> little<00:06:02.260> turbulent<00:06:03.480> so

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
off looks like in a little turbulent so

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.210 
off looks like in a little turbulent so
that's<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:04.930> thanks<00:06:05.200> for<00:06:05.260> watching<00:06:05.350> appreciate

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
and she goes she goes he's been going up

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:33.010 
and she goes she goes he's been going up
to<00:06:27.500> 40<00:06:30.250> and<00:06:31.250> she's<00:06:31.460> been<00:06:31.610> averaging<00:06:32.210> I<00:06:32.570> guess

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
to 40 and she's been averaging I guess

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.460 
to 40 and she's been averaging I guess
15<00:06:33.530> 20<00:06:33.979> amps<00:06:34.610> or<00:06:34.699> so<00:06:34.910> so<00:06:35.300> anyway<00:06:35.930> it's<00:06:36.139> all<00:06:36.260> good

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
15 20 amps or so so anyway it's all good

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.120 
15 20 amps or so so anyway it's all good
thanks<00:06:36.949> a<00:06:37.010> lot<00:06:37.130> for<00:06:37.310> watching<00:06:37.430> take<00:06:38.060> care
