00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.129
 hello it's me who ends you 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.940
 today that you live with others 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.840
 lg optimus presentations which sense 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.840
 so this committee 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.889
 it's the meaning of the global trial wind 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.240
 just not especially the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.440
 so target the double sim version is 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.730
 a little bit special then 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.470
 firstly because she has two cards 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.550
 sim of course but also because she has 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.170
 a teddy is specifically dedicated 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.850
 for managing the possible costs that 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.500
 is done here at the bottom right 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.320
 auchan city that evokes a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.290
 possible operation and not four sites 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.660
 whose dual month passed yet secularism 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.660
 positive to see them maybe to full 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.200
 it's very good 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.030
 so it's good that tokyo luck 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.730
 to be here the version sold to the layer 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 physical in the middle launches she touches 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 classic we have research buttons 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.410
 physical support for the return adore 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.680
 so here we adopted the 5 2 dual so 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 which is equipped with a 4-inch screen 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 chocolate who is this so it costs 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.809
 to have a picture quality so that one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.690
 will see precisely during the test 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.160
 it's a phone waiting for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.620
 particularities 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.940
 you spent on two gigas hook by 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.190
 RAM and by training a 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.580
 turn not to avoid saying nonsense 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.250
 also m 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.930
 simply 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.350
 post-it down all in all we're in 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.100
 out of the lot a style she 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 we are 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.550
 we have a new style that is a lot 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.420
 more rounded 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.780
 any kind of party with a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.890
 explanation 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.890
 on the left side clement marot 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.820
 there the top each time points 5 with 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.030
 especially a second one actually 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.420
 pro elements to decrease the sound 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.580
 on the right side to nine for a bit 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.910
 tower entrusted by pretty photocopies 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.350
 below 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.300
 of course you see 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.540
 qpc the microusb connection for the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.100
 load and sync from then 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.830
 and back but on the way for a 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.310
 photo sensor is a 5 megapixel 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.259
 here 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.369
 no front camera step you 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.299
 you will have noticed 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.329
 actually with two sensors 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.640
 including brightness sensors 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.250
 so that's the famous adjective being 5 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 2 dual a phone on which is well 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.280
 you must also know that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.630
 a battery of 1608 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.490
 during all the cast very aptly 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.319
 which is at the back I could not 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.000
 not show you imagine everything 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.430
 simply mentioned in advance he specified 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.740
 it's really shocking on occasion 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.850
 a test 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.500
 otherwise what can I tell you 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.310
 very well we have an opinion of course its 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.520
 provision that is heroic for 1 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.080
 I'll come here now to 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.790
 states for 1.2 who people sing to me 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 succession in multi layered and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.040
 graphically that functionally if 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.110
 it's not 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 split from the famous function that 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.500
 the preview is already nice 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.450
 does it allow you to take 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.650
 notes on your 30 good this is 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.510
 great classic at sg but it's a 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.939
 function that is nice and that 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860
 pleasure to find on sleep 5 2 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.750
 dual here it was so the little video 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.080
 preview presentation of 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.720
 lg optimus it's simple duval ground 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.350
 in wss which saint-barth see you soon 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.350
