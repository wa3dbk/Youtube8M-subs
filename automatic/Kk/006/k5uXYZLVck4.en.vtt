up<00:00:28.800> again<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.400> lion<00:00:29.789> pic<00:00:30.179> man<00:00:30.710> doing<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
up again and this lion pic man doing a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
up again and this lion pic man doing a
lot<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.160> these<00:00:32.460> earth<00:00:32.610> spikes<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.210> problem

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
lot with these earth spikes the problem

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.459 
lot with these earth spikes the problem
and<00:00:33.899> probably<00:00:34.739> rightly<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.230> think<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.320> this

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and probably rightly so I think if this

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
and probably rightly so I think if this
goes<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.680> way<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.890> complexity<00:00:38.550> again<00:00:38.790> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
goes the way of complexity again it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
goes the way of complexity again it's
going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.230> rough<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.739> they're

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
going to be really rough and they're

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.090 
going to be really rough and they're
doing<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> wrap<00:00:41.250> around<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:43.100> who's

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
doing a wrap around here that's who's

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
doing a wrap around here that's who's
got<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> patience<00:00:44.760> though<00:00:45.079> no<00:00:46.079> doubt<00:00:46.110> his

creeper here and a career I'm actually
kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> surprised<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.299> they<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
kind of surprised that they have the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.850 
kind of surprised that they have the
career<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> trop

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
career there because they have the trop

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.350 
career there because they have the trop
and<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.670> courier<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.270> they

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and now they see the courier so they

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
and now they see the courier so they
might<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.600> kill<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.100> yeah<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.310> that's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
might just kill it yeah I think that's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.480 
might just kill it yeah I think that's
what<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> try<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> do<00:01:24.150> their<00:01:24.570> smoked<00:01:24.869> up<00:01:25.490> unless
