00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.549
 hello to all and all these questions 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.710
 now we meet again today 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.890
 on the service put on two chips for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.970
 a little pvp fight comes back so 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.550
 today I propose a small 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.600
 fight against 1 emirates to 200 know 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 that the future and that it's part of my 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.420
 life and I just wanted the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.100
 challenge because basically I'm always 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.899
 said I could not that I could 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.760
 not win the whole thing all because 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 they will like and its lands etc it's a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.260
 deny me I'm a hell of a hit 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.969
 wanted to try it i got myself who 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 is in quotation marks because I have 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.559
 still think a little bit 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.719
 surf and so is I left I'm 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.059
 gone like that so we play without 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.550
 shield years and it's a challenge so it's 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 we have neither of us left so 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 there I started simply I 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.410
 I said I was going rock 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 I balanced mastery even if it's okay 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 to be serving me and but this one here the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 big blow of the hammer that hurts a lot 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.960
 at first I'm an ice cream and that's 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.729
 rather badly gone 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.299
 even if at the level of dreams I am 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 rather a lot of time we are 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.430
 that it has rather bellrays on fire 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.500
 can see he needs them percent 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.150
 I test the elbow checks in 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 very effective wood I realize 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 that it's not worth a lot of shots 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.140
 to type with the bonnonnais then of that yes 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.900
 I wanted to play in soft spera mode more 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.570
 early but I 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.190
 so I played anyway what 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.600
 allows 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.000
 in fact I can not suddenly I can not 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.400
 to make two absent plus one cac I'm going 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.080
 to be forced to do other things 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.480
 a little less a little less effective 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.830
 finally where I'm going to play the 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.710
 flamiche and we can see the flamish 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.590
 you still see tutorial not 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.380
 well what at least 140 it's rather 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 as nice as flamiche really plays 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.480
 rare in the fire begins to create a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.220
 it is a mode that it is not that I like 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.740
 not that I do not know what I 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.840
 find that a lot of sand that I want 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 and I prefer to play other modes like 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.360
 upland mode mode is in this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.709
 moment I am rather rather late game of the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.450
 world is rinsed it's a mode that I 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.100
 find it really nice even if they 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.470
 come back and is less important than 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.880
 modes the other modes but the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.950
 great team all nice as not 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.720
 since then and there it is quite flexible in 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.030
 made as game modes the r mode allows 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.880
 of 6 and the hammer we all finally have I 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.320
 find it nice so the fire mode 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.440
 in the streets like the benefit of having 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.790
 their the same the same out in kit has not 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.610
 three bo is still huge 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.610
 in addition to that it does not look like the kawa 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.080
 is still pretty good 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.830
 seems to me that I miss care 120 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.010
 almost everywhere 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.510
 so it's pretty cool that is so I 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.030
 access to the flames hick flamish 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.959
 which are really not insignificant 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.660
 especially like classes that have 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.820
 tend to play a game in so there the 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.900
 care one can see curative care at 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.300
 all those who are not huge 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.310
 but I'm going 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.620
 to be quite surprised for the benefit of the fight 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.690
 by regen fashion care in me I 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.000
 did not expect to go either 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.930
 impressive that that's true 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.730
 long time ago that I have not done the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.540
 pecs the sacred and I lost a little 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.239
 the habit of simply playing 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.549
 against the various classes in dofus 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.250
 and in particular the niches you 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.950
 remember more than heal as much I 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.120
 to sneak badly something useful 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.850
 short so there a little way on the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.250
 carrot I throw my pussy is there so I 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.950
 let's go through his rather complicated letter because 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.720
 I will try to rush but not too much 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.310
 still because his hammer makes me 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.190
 very afraid of 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.330
 rock while being careful here I 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.750
 throws anyway but this one acted 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.150
 together to eventually tackle it 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.050
 but I will not change everything anyway 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.720
 I will not block it two against one 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.220
 wall it's not it's not very useful so 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.660
 I do not really understand what he did 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.430
 this round they try to push me 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.750
 but he moves forward to push me so 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.000
 it's not necessarily very useful 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.060
 sutout clash that i can advance for 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.150
 to have it pso there are these vampiric words 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.180
 even very badly in less than 400 the regional to 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.579
 half cs is nice enough there 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.940
 I hesitate the transpo I hesitate a long time 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.889
 anyway 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.919
 but I preferred to fuck an allowance 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.540
 possibly to annoy him a 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.979
 little bit one but that's because 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.750
 I should have done what I could have done 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.729
 better but his shares to schemes that 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.580
 start to get pretty smart enough 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.650
 can 450 sites already not bad 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.410
 interesting and we'll see that it's a 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.450
 practically doubled over the fight 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.060
 so the 3000 of life your magic 3700 I 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.260
 already lost practically militates to max 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.770
 for now I think I'm not 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.870
 favorite 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.150
 we will see how it will unfold on 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.860
 the outcome of the fight and saab are you 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.620
 begin to do anyway badly 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.690
 in less than 500 it seems to me that I have stretched 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.280
 when we saw so here I tried the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.000
 bdr 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.520
 yeah I typed 500c I'll wait I 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.770
 Expected better to admit but 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.380
 in the end it's still not bad in 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.669
 the meaning that I missed only 600 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.060
 litas so I'm not careful about blood 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.120
 but I typed 200 more than that 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.490
 stay pretty is ok 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.889
 we continue with the small flamiche 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.270
 seems like I even tried maybe a 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.500
 good brand something I know 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.280
 more see what I'm going to do everything 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.919
 just a carrot 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.130
 we continue on carrots here is the 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.020
 700 that really starts to hurt 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.340
 it's really the words of discomfort 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.000
 it's something that since they 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.350
 have spent percentage care and then in 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.490
 intelligence function it's 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.630
 really really a care to get excited 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.710
 we're hiding troll a little bit because 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.300
 I meanwhile made it to the puzzles 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.240
 a report that we tend to go 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.660
 to compare them a little to iob 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.069
 so I say whole to the eyes nantes 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.130
 and his director is neither easy 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.560
 it's a little bit so here it is where 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.120
 I was a little arachne and we 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.910
 continue to all absolutely be less 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.509
 hurt but good these care how that 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:15.759
 can also deal with their taf for 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.009
 the moment fight not played at all for 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.300
 neither of them but the hammer blows 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.580
 that fall pretty interesting so brief 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.509
 to talk a little bit about other things 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.030
 so as you can see I 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.400
 take a little bit of gentle 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.259
 fight the fight pvp rhythm years shouted 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.370
 I do from time to time pep and me 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.009
 complain if I find that enough 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.310
 interesting it changes a little bit in 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:44.590
 below it curls the hike is a 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:46.479
 little weary at the stroke of a stroke ggc 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:49.210
 of optics a little bit both actually 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.830
 the panda and optimal our elements for 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.599
 the moment I'm going to wait for the maj 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.680
 not sure at all , but he 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.900
 seems that they will not be long in removing 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.150
 and prerequisites the conditions on the 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.509
 steps rivas 3d that it will be done i'm going 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.669
 power 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:01.539
 it's a bit my panda better than that 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:03.370
 because I'm a bit too lazy to go 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.280
 to make teeth people miss or the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.330
 halls cross stitch and after 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.190
 possibly for loads and in 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.409
 time is not my priority for 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.219
 the moment I also have with a tutu a 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:17.050
 tutu 20 for the modest sum 70 mine 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:19.509
 because I had some problem this 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.729
 which made me no longer have culture and 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.969
 others 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:26.500
 So I had to buy one back 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:30.449
 to say that it's not too expensive even if it 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.860
 still a pretty big sum 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.370
 but given the prices of crops 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.229
 currently 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.540
 instead I made a good offer a 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.100
 good deal here is the absut 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.960
 ventile that they still do very badly 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.070
 currently but I really hesitate 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.699
 do not know because I left 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.380
 finish with his hammer and his costs of 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:50.330
 2 fate of the blow I prefer transpo va 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.770
 play safe there I think he would have 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.780
 maybe not have to do what he did 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.360
 my opinion it was not the best 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.190
 solution moving forward like that 

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.530
 simply allow me to finish 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.780
 So here it was a little fight pvp 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:05.060
 against an enemy of blood it was crucial 

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.180
 to magna on cervix nice we end up 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:11.080
 for two videos is good good day 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.080
 and good game has more
