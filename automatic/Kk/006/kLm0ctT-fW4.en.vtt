00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.290

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.659
 go to this museum named makar and this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.659
 macro frame museum . 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.030
 it's me no I'm for sure I'm not me 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.570
 ask a few questions and the one who 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.150
 will answer them correctly 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.180
 life title better girlfriend fight 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.640
 there is no easier task for me 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.580
 I personally have been Barbie since my early childhood 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.530
 her every day since early morning i'm calling 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.299
 Barbie so often that she has for me 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.299
 one phone listen to me 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.610
 the next question is what kind of work in Bori 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.439
 was at number thirty seven 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.789
 stewardess well, it seems modern 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.520
 the name of the stewardess 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.979
 you can't imagine how much the garden is under 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.710
 sandwiches we were preparing isnâ€™t the answer 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:02.110
 must be monosyllabic and point in favor 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:06.190
 midi if barbie could become ice cream 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:22.200
 whatever taste he had to sell 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:37.420
 Is pink it taste and paint on 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:40.900
 the rocks you go on equal more or less 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.080
 so the last question is to determine which of 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.060
 you better and girlfriend barbie you can 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.440
 win or lose the competition and 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.270
 pick the door number you are guilty and throw 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:00.000
 there is some cheap consolation prize 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.000
 we are here to defeat the decisive question 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.000
 Barbie 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.760
 they fight for the title of your best 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.590
 friends I was far from the best all of them 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.260
 but in any case we need to choose 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.610
 the winner was going 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.209
 each of them considers himself your best 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.840
 girlfriend 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.610
 but you are all my best friends I knew that 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.140
 the prize will not be so you will listen 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.600
 last question or not we are listening 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.680
 when our barbie first appeared 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:36.450
 navel and what it even even I myself 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.450
 I do not remember that I could play 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.040
 13 years ago you would know about it if you 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.660
 bother to get acquainted with the encyclopedia 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.200
 Barbie in 12 volumes 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.830
 extra edition with wonderful sharp 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.880
 there must be a mention of me somewhere 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.880
 really not even in footnotes
