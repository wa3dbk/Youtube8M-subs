 adjust your television 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.959
 what they are seeing now in theory has to be hard to see 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.470
 In this way, our job is to explore the objects 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.650
 everyday people around us and find out how they are made but let's start by leaving 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 something very clear 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.240
 the manufacture of glass is anything - simple 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.130
 percent 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.659
 mountain 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.659
 Turkey 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.590
 The use of glass is known since the times of the Egyptians 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.879
 four thousand years ago 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.959
 but it was not used in construction if not just to protect small objects 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.159
 later 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.100
 the Romans 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.030
 would be the masters in glass making and their methods would be used 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 until the 18th century 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.930
 but at the end of the 19th century, video ceased to be a luxury object for 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.670
 become a building material as common as steel and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.520
 the concrete 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.520
 one night 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.020
 the glass is made from several raw materials mixed with water these 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.280
 matters are 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.120
 illicit arenas 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.180
 sodium carbonate 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 dolomite 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.410
 limestone 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.550
 nef the inaes and issue 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.550
 and sodium sulfate 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.080
 The process begins by pouring fragments of recycled glass into a hopper with 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.920
 new raw material 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.490
 all this will melt 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 the mixture of materials leaves a continuous flow to a gas oven 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.400
 the temperature inside the oven is one thousand 500 degrees centigrade 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.420
 It has capacity for one thousand five hundred tons of molten glass 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.210
 500 tons are used every day 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.920
 in this regeneration chamber are provided and in cloth and combustion 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 amin thrown 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.600
 the materials of the mixture begin to melt and the glass must be removed 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.730
 molten 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.790
 the homogenizer mixes the glass to equalize the temperature in a few hours 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.790
 will make the spill 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.769
 in the glass industry this machine is known as top roller 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.539
 the glass is poured a liquid tin bath in which floats 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:29.609
 now it is a soft material that is molded forming a farm 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.290
 All tin bath equipment is cooled with water so it does not break 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.289
 with the heat 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.120
 when it comes out of the bathroom the video is at 600 degrees you have to cool it once 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.119
 more and it takes care of this machine 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.699
 This huge glass ribbon measures 3 to 3 meters wide 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.349
 the glass ribbon gently enters the rollers and gradually cools 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.799
 the glass is still talking 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.309
 the marks that we see are the traces left by the top roller 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.559
 the video should have a uniform thickness and this laser scanner measures it with a 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:28.559
 precision of hundredths of a millimeter 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.959
 the video is already very hard 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.349
 the next step is to cut it 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.859
 This roller ultra hard golf carbide ramihov peace and a notch 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.859
 longitudinal before cutting 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.650
 then the transversal notches are made according to the dimensions 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.869
 ordered by customers pre-cut glass separates easily 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.659
 the glass strips are separated and he continued his journey through the ribbon 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.659
 conveyor 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.159
 jobs 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.650
 this rolls cut the edges of the glass ribbon 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.189
 the leftover glass fall into a container 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.189
 subsequently it will be recycled 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.610
 this rubber-lined rollers guide the glass sheets towards the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.610
 inspection department 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.729
 when they arrive for inspection these immense sheets of glass are manipulated 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.729
 carefully and placed vertically 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.639
 the glass is inspected with fluorescent lamps in search of defects 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.279
 once inspected the sheets are moved one by one and stored in 

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.279
 vertical 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.229
 for the manufacture of glass it takes several days 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.229
 now it is ready for delivery 

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:22.959
 the heat has transformed solid ingredients into transparent glass
