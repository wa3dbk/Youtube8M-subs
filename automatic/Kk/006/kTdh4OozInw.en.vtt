00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.509
 The emerging number of uh ... military soldiers are overweight and as a result 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.679
 So they are getting out of the army now I'm looking at their meeting 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.980
 VIN numbers reported a number of obese soldiers inside the army 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.520
 Specifically, they are in fact very bleak 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.689
 The number of active military personnel is considered overweight or obese 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.119
 Tripled 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.270
 Um ... but in twenty or a fee 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.119
 Since 2086, the number of troops has reached 60 or 80 points 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.200
 Eight percent of the force received at least one clinical diagnosis 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.500
 Weight gain or obesity 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.250
 But stop there right because I 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.460
 It was a problem with these because 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.380
 Our soldiers have passed two different tests for the first test 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.709
 Meaning it's a stress test where they have to do push ups on sit ups 

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:52.950
 The usual stuff on the second test is where the double-body mass index 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.020
 and that is 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.640
 Let's keep the b_m_i_ real usually 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.059
 Time is mostly inaccurate 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 That's because you may be the right muscle muscles weigh more than fat 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.939
 You may be short and you may not succeed in testing tit b_m_i_ based on that 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:07.860
 Lots 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 Look after or all these will be the seat of Socialist fear Sir 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 Uh ... And if everyone is SERVI that is partly due 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.790
 We arm or piece of paper but also partly because 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.290
 The way they were measured we are fine like if you do not look great 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 writing and reading 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690
 Referring to some films directly 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.270
 Mediation that pass only one oh ... I do not care because of that request 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.849
 If it turns out that it can 

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:34.740
 Passenger holiday push ups sit-ups bearing 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.100
 Point spots are somehow that of women-like who want to be front-line 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.560
 Uh ... instead of 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.770
 Choose who can be on the front lines based on uh ... sex why not just you 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.150
 Find out if a woman can exceed a certain test in a rotation test 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.690
 And if it can then if you want to be in fighting combat sharpen it too 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.810
 similar 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 Um ... you know the kind of cases 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.360
 Or so ... but it would be naive to deny that 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.690
 Members of our armed forces get all aspects of my aggressive like 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.909
 The rest of us have it 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.649
 Uh ... at the side of the road just some other statistics that I found a bit 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.369
 Interesting during the first ten months of this year 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.349
 The army began from 1625 soldiers for being 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.140
 Out of shape 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.880
 About fifteen times the number of discharge for this reason in 2007 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.170
 The peak of war cycles until deployment is probably the 'cause we get' 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.800
 A little better but we knew that mainly for the sound of too many soldiers 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.929
 Seven thousand even loves her so lightly it's okay 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:31.329
 Financial program is a registered nurse who really love 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.979
 Well on the phone with you 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:36.809
 This has been the most violent behavior in the war here in Iraq and that is why they are 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.169
 Necessary to deploy as many as possible 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.559
 So uh ... this is not really working 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.769
 But look at it and the river problems reverse role like 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.849
 Uh ... writing for children in content development 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.029
 Try to dictate every part of our lives 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:59.219
 And then we have got pointed out that this film 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.620
 This is something that usually with a good job
