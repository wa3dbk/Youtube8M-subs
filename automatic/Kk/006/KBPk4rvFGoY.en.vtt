00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
see the switch we see it and they used

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
see the switch we see it and they used
with<00:00:53.340> super<00:00:54.000> 1<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> result<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
with super 1 and then the result of that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.270 
with super 1 and then the result of that
obnoxiousness<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> here's<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> switch<00:00:59.100> that

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
obnoxiousness so here's the switch that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.930 
obnoxiousness so here's the switch that
fell<00:00:59.460> over<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.730> just<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.879> the

switch so just pop this out of the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.639 
switch so just pop this out of the
driver<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:54.409> two<00:01:55.409> switches<00:01:55.680> side<00:01:56.070> by<00:01:56.310> side

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
driver here two switches side by side

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.720 
like the other one said rocket super
this<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.270> says<00:02:54.450> Dario<00:02:54.920> supe<00:02:55.920> super<00:02:56.160> comes

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
this one says Dario supe super comes

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:11.000 
this one says Dario supe super comes
from<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.510> let's<00:02:57.959> turn<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.410> on<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.920> we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
from up here so let's turn it on so we

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.500 
from up here so let's turn it on so we
hear<00:03:11.130> all<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.280> extra<00:03:11.550> noise<00:03:11.670> afterwards<00:03:12.330> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
hear all the extra noise afterwards that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.870 
hear all the extra noise afterwards that
comes<00:03:12.750> from<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> switch<00:03:13.680> itself<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.489> rest<00:03:14.700> is

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
comes from the switch itself the rest is

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.300 
comes from the switch itself the rest is
the<00:03:15.000> normal<00:03:15.330> drill<00:03:15.720> switch<00:03:16.140> there's<00:03:17.130> no

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the normal drill switch there's no

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:26.240 
the normal drill switch there's no
difference<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:24.830> reason<00:03:25.830> for<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.040> Ben

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
difference in a reason for that Ben

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.040 
difference in a reason for that Ben
there's<00:03:26.430> no<00:03:26.580> way<00:03:26.700> for<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.970> switch<00:03:27.360> itself<00:03:27.810> to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
there's no way for the switch itself to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.400 
there's no way for the switch itself to
know<00:03:28.230> when<00:03:28.530> element<00:03:28.890> brake<00:03:29.070> was<00:03:29.340> used<00:03:30.410> all

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
know when element brake was used all

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
know when element brake was used all
right<00:03:31.530> now<00:03:31.680> let's<00:03:31.980> see<00:03:35.030> what<00:03:36.030> happens

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.220 

so<00:03:54.430> now<00:03:54.580> we<00:03:54.640> have<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.210> super<00:03:55.630> rocket<00:03:55.990> switch

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
so now we have the super rocket switch

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.570 
so now we have the super rocket switch
and<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.680> super<00:03:57.040> drill<00:03:57.280> switch<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:59.100> go<00:04:00.100> Buster

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
and the super drill switch and go Buster

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
and the super drill switch and go Buster
oh<00:04:00.760> now<00:04:01.150> has<00:04:01.450> two<00:04:02.050> drills<00:04:02.860> for<00:04:03.160> arms<00:04:03.610> and<00:04:03.820> to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
oh now has two drills for arms and to

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.570 
oh now has two drills for arms and to
mean<00:04:05.020> two<00:04:05.290> rackets<00:04:05.680> for<00:04:05.740> arms<00:04:06.040> two<00:04:06.160> drills<00:04:06.430> for

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
mean two rackets for arms two drills for

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.380 
mean two rackets for arms two drills for
legs<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:07.350> it's<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.620> giant<00:04:09.310> cluster<00:04:09.940> we

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
legs and it's just a giant cluster we

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:20.970 
legs and it's just a giant cluster we
can<00:04:10.420> do<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:11.200> limit<00:04:11.530> break<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:20.230> that<00:04:20.380> fun<00:04:20.680> guys

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
can do a limit break and that fun guys

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
can do a limit break and that fun guys
yeah<00:04:26.040> there<00:04:27.040> we<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.490> then<00:04:27.610> when<00:04:27.700> we<00:04:27.760> pull

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
yeah there we go and then when we pull

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.030 
yeah there we go and then when we pull
the<00:04:28.120> switches<00:04:28.510> out<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:32.200> got<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.590> powering

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
the switches out you got that powering

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.490 
the switches out you got that powering
down<00:04:33.190> noise<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:37.420> they<00:04:37.540> both<00:04:37.720> have<00:04:38.020> something

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
down noise so they both have something

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.500 
down noise so they both have something
similar<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.550> let's<00:04:39.820> get<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.060> get<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.300> crap

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
similar and let's get to get this crap

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.850 
similar and let's get to get this crap
out<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.720> here<00:04:45.540> all<00:04:46.540> right<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.080> get<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.560> out<00:04:47.710> the

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
out of here all right so get you out the

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.240 
out of here all right so get you out the
way<00:04:47.950> as<00:04:48.040> well<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:49.290> here<00:04:50.290> we<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:50.560> the<00:04:50.740> super<00:04:51.040> 3

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
way as well so here we have the super 3

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.280 
way as well so here we have the super 3
switch<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.440> um<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.340> mean<00:04:54.970> it's<00:04:55.210> just<00:04:55.270> this<00:04:55.510> one

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
switch so um I mean it's just this one

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.950 
switch so um I mean it's just this one
lone<00:04:56.530> switch<00:04:56.919> just<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.400> super<00:04:57.940> one<00:04:58.120> was<00:04:58.419> or

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
lone switch just like super one was or

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.260 
lone switch just like super one was or
when<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.710> violate<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.430> cosmic<00:05:00.910> switch<00:05:01.120> or

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
when you violate the cosmic switch or

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.930 
when you violate the cosmic switch or
something's<00:05:01.630> up<00:05:01.780> here<00:05:02.490> this<00:05:03.490> isn't<00:05:03.700> one<00:05:03.910> of

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
something's up here this isn't one of

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.850 
something's up here this isn't one of
the<00:05:04.060> 40<00:05:04.419> it's<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.720> special<00:05:05.200> switch<00:05:05.380> that

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
the 40 it's a special switch that

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.250 
the 40 it's a special switch that
corresponds<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.669> movie<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.810> guess<00:05:08.020> if<00:05:08.169> you

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
corresponds to a movie so I guess if you

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.680 
corresponds to a movie so I guess if you
like<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:08.560> movie<00:05:08.890> or<00:05:09.160> if<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.330> super

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
like the movie or if you have the super

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.870 
like the movie or if you have the super
1<00:05:10.870> switch<00:05:11.290> then<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.130> may<00:05:12.460> as<00:05:12.550> well<00:05:12.610> get<00:05:12.850> that

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
1 switch then you may as well get that

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.640 
1 switch then you may as well get that
to<00:05:13.120> go<00:05:13.240> whether<00:05:13.419> they<00:05:13.630> do<00:05:13.690> kind<00:05:14.320> of<00:05:14.350> look<00:05:14.470> neat

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
to go whether they do kind of look neat

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.120 
to go whether they do kind of look neat
together<00:05:15.510> but<00:05:16.510> I<00:05:16.720> mean<00:05:16.780> other<00:05:17.110> than<00:05:17.169> that<00:05:17.380> you

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
together but I mean other than that you

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.230 
together but I mean other than that you
know<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.400> you're<00:05:18.610> just<00:05:18.640> trying<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.000> get<00:05:19.120> the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
know if you're just trying to get the

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.360 
know if you're just trying to get the
normal<00:05:19.480> 40s<00:05:19.840> which<00:05:20.050> there's<00:05:20.410> no<00:05:20.530> real<00:05:20.890> reason

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
normal 40s which there's no real reason

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.280 
normal 40s which there's no real reason
why<00:05:21.490> you'd<00:05:21.700> want<00:05:21.910> this

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
why you'd want this

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.310 
why you'd want this
I'm<00:05:24.220> not<00:05:24.820> sure<00:05:25.030> why<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.240> got<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:25.870> except<00:05:26.140> for<00:05:26.169> the

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
I'm not sure why I got it except for the

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.909 
I'm not sure why I got it except for the
fact<00:05:26.380> that<00:05:26.590> I<00:05:26.680> need<00:05:26.860> all<00:05:26.980> the<00:05:27.100> switches<00:05:27.310> so<00:05:28.919> you

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
fact that I need all the switches so you

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.920 
fact that I need all the switches so you
know<00:05:30.040> that's<00:05:30.390> that's<00:05:31.390> all<00:05:31.540> there<00:05:31.660> is<00:05:31.690> to<00:05:31.900> that

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
know that's that's all there is to that

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.380 
know that's that's all there is to that
so<00:05:32.410> um<00:05:32.680> what<00:05:33.430> they<00:05:33.520> mean<00:05:33.669> is<00:05:33.790> pretty<00:05:34.000> cool<00:05:34.150> has

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390
