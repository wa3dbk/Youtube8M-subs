gameplay so this is their new one it's
kind<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.100> reminiscent<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> World<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
kind of reminiscent of like a World of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
kind of reminiscent of like a World of
Warcraft<00:00:37.920> heroes<00:00:38.430> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.030> thing<00:00:39.270> or

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
Warcraft heroes kind of thing or

Warcraft heroes kind of thing or
Warcraft<00:00:39.930> heroes<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.579> sort<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
Warcraft heroes you could sort of like a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
Warcraft heroes you could sort of like a
it's<00:00:43.590> quite<00:00:43.770> difficult<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.190> explain<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it's quite difficult to explain but the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.490 
it's quite difficult to explain but the
idea<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.570> party<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.050> characters

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
idea is you have a party of characters

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
idea is you have a party of characters
each<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:46.950> CLABSIs<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:48.090> particular

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
each of those CLABSIs has a particular

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.350 
each of those CLABSIs has a particular
role<00:00:48.809> like<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> healer<00:00:49.350> or<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> tank<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.789> warrior

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
role like a healer or a tank a warrior

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.650 
role like a healer or a tank a warrior
or<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.590> know<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> range<00:00:52.980> camp<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.670> character

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
or you know a range camp a character

or you know a range camp a character
like<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.079> ranger<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> idea<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.360> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
like the ranger and the idea is to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.549 
like the ranger and the idea is to
complete<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.039> various<00:00:59.489> levels<00:01:00.559> winning

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
complete these various levels winning

load times are a little bit slow in
places<00:04:22.320> glue<00:04:23.320> maybe<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.830> patch<00:04:24.250> would<00:04:24.460> be<00:04:24.580> nice

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.230 
go back and that's that but in essence
it's<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.440> dungeon<00:05:26.919> crawler<00:05:26.949> but<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:27.789> very

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
it's a dungeon crawler but with a very

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.620 
it's a dungeon crawler but with a very
very<00:05:28.330> very<00:05:28.780> well<00:05:29.440> presented<00:05:30.240> game<00:05:31.240> going<00:05:31.570> on

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
very very well presented game going on

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.140 
very very well presented game going on
once<00:05:32.199> you<00:05:32.380> read<00:05:32.830> minds<00:05:33.159> every<00:05:33.729> time<00:05:33.909> you<00:05:34.000> come

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
once you read minds every time you come

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.339 
once you read minds every time you come
back<00:05:34.300> to<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.539> game<00:05:34.690> after<00:05:34.900> a<00:05:35.050> certain<00:05:35.229> number

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
back to the game after a certain number

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.439 
back to the game after a certain number
of<00:05:35.560> minutes<00:05:36.190> you<00:05:36.669> can<00:05:36.820> collect<00:05:37.090> more<00:05:37.270> in-game

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
of minutes you can collect more in-game

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.450 
of minutes you can collect more in-game
money<00:05:37.810> so<00:05:38.260> a<00:05:38.289> key<00:05:38.710> part<00:05:38.979> of<00:05:39.070> this<00:05:39.190> is<00:05:39.250> to

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
money so a key part of this is to

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.589 
money so a key part of this is to
obviously<00:05:39.669> make<00:05:39.760> sure<00:05:39.940> you<00:05:40.030> collect<00:05:40.210> up<00:05:40.449> all

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
obviously make sure you collect up all

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.029 
obviously make sure you collect up all
of<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:40.840> mines<00:05:41.080> around<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.500> map<00:05:41.650> as<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.889> go

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
of the mines around the map as you go

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.790 
of the mines around the map as you go
let's<00:05:42.669> pop<00:05:42.880> over<00:05:43.030> to<00:05:43.120> this<00:05:43.300> one<00:05:43.510> you<00:05:43.690> can<00:05:44.650> go

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
let's pop over to this one you can go

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.620 
let's pop over to this one you can go
back<00:05:45.010> and<00:05:45.159> replay<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.580> mission<00:05:45.909> based<00:05:46.389> on<00:05:46.510> its

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
back and replay a mission based on its

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.089 
back and replay a mission based on its
difficulty<00:05:47.110> so<00:05:47.289> once<00:05:47.680> you've<00:05:47.919> actually

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
difficulty so once you've actually

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.040 
difficulty so once you've actually
unlocked<00:05:48.849> it<00:05:49.120> by<00:05:49.240> completing<00:05:49.599> it<00:05:49.780> once<00:05:49.930> you

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
unlocked it by completing it once you

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.300 
unlocked it by completing it once you
can<00:05:50.169> go<00:05:50.289> back<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.530> play<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.740> again<00:05:50.800> again<00:05:51.280> and

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
can go back and play it again again and

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.159 
can go back and play it again again and
again<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:51.940> you<00:05:52.000> get<00:05:52.360> different<00:05:52.539> bonuses

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
again and you get different bonuses

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.719 
again and you get different bonuses
depending<00:05:53.320> on<00:05:53.770> obviously<00:05:53.979> the<00:05:54.280> difficulty

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
depending on obviously the difficulty

depending on obviously the difficulty

basically just ripped me in half so I

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.689 
basically just ripped me in half so I
would<00:06:16.360> not<00:06:16.659> waste<00:06:17.020> your<00:06:17.199> time<00:06:17.800> on<00:06:18.010> those<00:06:18.159> skip

another chest beat you see that the

another chest beat you see that the

reminiscent<00:06:24.379> of<00:06:24.910> Warcraft<00:06:25.910> I<00:06:26.060> would<00:06:26.240> say<00:06:26.440> that

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
reminiscent of Warcraft I would say that

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.890 
reminiscent of Warcraft I would say that
kind<00:06:27.770> of<00:06:27.889> cartoon<00:06:28.520> cell<00:06:29.270> shading<00:06:29.780> animation

kind of cartoon cell shading animation

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.990 
kind of cartoon cell shading animation
going<00:06:30.560> on<00:06:30.680> but<00:06:30.949> with<00:06:31.310> really<00:06:31.580> nice<00:06:31.699> lighting
