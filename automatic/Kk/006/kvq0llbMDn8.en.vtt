 mental and seeing you do not see I'm going 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.050
 very well today we end up 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.760
 for a new gameplay I'm going 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.519
 send to kuyt cf as well as planes 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.410
 active and I thank him for putting forward the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.360
 can also if ever she 's not on 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.890
 their channel invites you to go see my 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.589
 chain it makes me extremely happy and 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.479
 then nothing but seeing what I 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.280
 what am I proposing on my channel 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.440
 pleases me 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.890
 this is the gameplay I was 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.420
 proposed by a subscriber refugee blue 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.129
 it's a PC gameplay so it makes me 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.320
 extremely pleasure and more than that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.030
 pc since I am I am a gamer pc 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 so that's a little cool 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.259
 on my channel we will say so he in I 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.660
 sleep on malte years I think you 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.789
 have noticed it's going to be a nice little 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.190
 massacre I tell you no more then 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.200
 today as a subject I chose the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.090
 duty of memory since the day I 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.909
 you comment we are louis may and so 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.899
 it's the 1945 victory over 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.300
 German Japan and their allies 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.550
 so why the duty of memory all 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.710
 Just because 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.830
 we have a duty of memory in fact towards 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.410
 the old ones who died for 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.160
 finally way that are dead or simply 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.170
 for freedom for hitler's hand and I 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.000
 think especially of Jews at all 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.250
 Jews who died we are entitled 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.920
 finally a duty of memory towards them 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.710
 then to prevent it from happening again days 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.730
 massacres and especially that we do not 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 see no World War III 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.510
 that appear when if ever there is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.500
 a third world war people 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.790
 and bath for example hiroshima 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.070
 if we compare it to nuclear bombs 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
 current is the effect of a pebble 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.010
 you swing on the ground here it is not 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.650
 more stupid than that 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.700
 hiroshima not even a firecracker compared to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.470
 what we can do now 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.880
 and that's why it's absolutely necessary 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.770
 to avoid a third war 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.060
 world and it's remembering all 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.610
 who had during the second war 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.480
 world we will avoid this game a 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.520
 third world war 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.630
 especially if there is ever a 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.720
 third world war 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.430
 it will necessarily be done with the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.440
 presence of nuclear bombs 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.180
 and if there are nuclear bombs the man 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.959
 will self-destruct and that's going to be a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.830
 true a real world massacre that's going to be 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.739
 the end of the world 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.030
 it's just going to be that and we also 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.850
 a duty of memory since it is necessary 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.980
 must preserve the heritage finally yeah 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.910
 if we want it is a heritage does it 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.400
 that we had these wars we must remember 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.610
 to future generations what has had for 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.239
 that they do not fall into oblivion 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.709
 in fact to prevent them from creating a 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.100
 third world war 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.740
 so inadvertently or I do not know 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.900
 too much what's the reason 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.770
 I think that's all I say you 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.010
 invite to debate in the comments 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.620
 in fact to find out what you think 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.600
 the duty of memory towards the elders 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.610
 and all those who died during the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.430
 second world war this gameplay is 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.930
 finished here on 1 20 to 1 hoping 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.840
 that they will please you and that when it is 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.520
 did dead tv playboy took this is 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.700
 maxence and I tell you if online games 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.700
 not
