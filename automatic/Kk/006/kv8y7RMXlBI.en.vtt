hello again everyone that one back once
again<00:00:08.140> with<00:00:08.320> another<00:00:08.620> in<00:00:08.920> my<00:00:09.010> series<00:00:09.370> of<00:00:09.400> deck

reviews<00:00:10.030> and<00:00:10.330> what<00:00:11.170> I<00:00:11.200> have<00:00:11.410> today<00:00:11.590> is<00:00:11.950> a<00:00:11.980> deck

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:12.549 
reviews and what I have today is a deck

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.890

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.730 
bee stinger back deck from theory 11 and
I<00:00:22.600> guess<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:22.930> only<00:00:23.020> way<00:00:23.140> you<00:00:23.290> can<00:00:23.410> tell<00:00:23.560> it's

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
I guess the only way you can tell it's

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.320 
I guess the only way you can tell it's
theory<00:00:24.070> 11<00:00:24.430> is<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.670> fact<00:00:24.910> they<00:00:25.060> have<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
theory 11 is the fact they have the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.030 
theory 11 is the fact they have the
30-11<00:00:26.160> emblem<00:00:27.160> on<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.310> bottom<00:00:27.700> I<00:00:29.040> been

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
30-11 emblem on the bottom I been

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.280 
30-11 emblem on the bottom I been
messing<00:00:30.400> with<00:00:30.430> these<00:00:30.670> a<00:00:30.730> little<00:00:30.970> bit<00:00:31.270> and<00:00:31.480> I

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
messing with these a little bit and I

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.180 
messing with these a little bit and I
must<00:00:33.160> say<00:00:33.340> I'm<00:00:33.730> a<00:00:33.760> bit<00:00:34.120> disappointed<00:00:35.190> because

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
must say I'm a bit disappointed because

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.870 
must say I'm a bit disappointed because
I<00:00:36.670> compared<00:00:37.450> these<00:00:37.660> two<00:00:37.960> like<00:00:38.140> my<00:00:38.400> dearie<00:00:39.400> 11

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
I compared these two like my dearie 11

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.600 
I compared these two like my dearie 11
guardians<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:42.210> even<00:00:43.210> compare<00:00:44.170> them<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.350> other

deck<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.750> theory<00:01:17.170> 11<00:01:18.570> advertising

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
deck you have a theory 11 advertising

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.399 
deck you have a theory 11 advertising
card<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.650> also<00:01:20.830> get<00:01:21.280> a<00:01:21.780> double<00:01:22.780> backer<00:01:22.990> card

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
card you also get a double backer card

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.310 
card you also get a double backer card
and<00:01:23.680> then<00:01:24.549> you<00:01:24.700> have<00:01:24.909> basically<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.540> standard

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and then you have basically a standard

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.990 
and then you have basically a standard
deck<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:27.729> two<00:01:28.240> jokers<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.220> two<00:01:30.369> jokers<00:01:30.670> are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
deck with two jokers the two jokers are

deck with two jokers the two jokers are
the<00:01:31.119> B<00:01:31.320> jokers<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.939> rest<00:01:34.299> of<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.630> deck<00:01:34.869> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the B jokers the rest of the deck is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.630 
the B jokers the rest of the deck is
just<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.820> step<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.439> typical<00:01:38.439> bicycle<00:01:39.400> deck

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
just a step a typical bicycle deck

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.250 
just a step a typical bicycle deck
that's<00:01:39.909> what<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.210> feels<00:01:40.479> like<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.750> me<00:01:40.930> it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
that's what it feels like to me it

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.500 
that's what it feels like to me it
doesn't<00:01:41.619> have<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:42.580> weight<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
doesn't have the weight and the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
doesn't have the weight and the
cardstock<00:01:44.229> thickness<00:01:45.010> like<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:46.200> normal<00:01:47.200> theory

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
cardstock thickness like a normal theory

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.789 
cardstock thickness like a normal theory
11<00:01:47.950> deck<00:01:48.130> would<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.869> mean<00:01:50.290> they<00:01:50.409> spread

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
11 deck would have I mean they spread

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.410 
11 deck would have I mean they spread
very<00:01:50.979> nice<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.520> they<00:01:51.610> also<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:52.060> know<00:01:52.270> they

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
very nice and they also you know they

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.380 
very nice and they also you know they
fan<00:01:52.659> pretty<00:01:52.930> nice<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.380> stuff<00:01:53.530> out<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.860> box

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fan pretty nice and stuff out of the box

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.060 
fan pretty nice and stuff out of the box
I'm<00:01:55.390> assuming<00:01:55.930> that<00:01:56.110> these<00:01:56.259> are<00:01:56.470> probably<00:01:56.860> an

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
I'm assuming that these are probably an

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.580 
I'm assuming that these are probably an
air<00:01:57.280> cushion<00:01:57.520> finish<00:01:58.060> i'm<00:01:58.630> not<00:01:58.810> sure<00:01:59.080> but

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.870 

nothing<00:02:02.590> really<00:02:02.829> special<00:02:03.100> about<00:02:03.340> these<00:02:03.670> it

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
nothing really special about these it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.120 
nothing really special about these it
just<00:02:04.060> feels<00:02:04.240> like<00:02:04.479> maybe<00:02:04.659> just<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.470> normal<00:02:05.860> bike

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
just feels like maybe just a normal bike

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.309 
just feels like maybe just a normal bike
deck<00:02:06.430> would<00:02:06.640> feel<00:02:06.850> that's<00:02:07.600> your<00:02:07.750> standard<00:02:07.960> ace

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
deck would feel that's your standard ace

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.580 
deck would feel that's your standard ace

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
that is pretty much the extent of this

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140 
that is pretty much the extent of this
deck<00:02:47.319> there's<00:02:47.590> really<00:02:47.739> nothing<00:02:48.190> super

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
deck there's really nothing super

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.500 
deck there's really nothing super
spectacular<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:50.049> it<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:51.209> appears<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.390> be

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
spectacular to it it just appears to be

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.289 
spectacular to it it just appears to be
just<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.870> normal<00:02:53.140> standard<00:02:54.090> bicycle<00:02:55.090> deck

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
just a normal standard bicycle deck

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.979 
just a normal standard bicycle deck
really<00:02:55.870> with<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.230> theory<00:02:56.650> 11<00:02:57.069> label<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.989> like

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
really with a theory 11 label on it like

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.809 
really with a theory 11 label on it like
I<00:02:59.140> said<00:02:59.350> before<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.920> finish<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.549> listed

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
I said before the finish is not listed

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.400 
I said before the finish is not listed
on<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.540> don't<00:03:01.750> know<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.110> finish

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
on there so I don't know what the finish

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.180 
on there so I don't know what the finish
is<00:03:02.590> but<00:03:03.519> it<00:03:03.760> feels<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.599> a<00:03:05.110> normal<00:03:05.590> bike<00:03:05.830> deck

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
is but it feels like a normal bike deck

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.460 
is but it feels like a normal bike deck
the<00:03:06.670> but<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.330> card<00:03:07.569> stock<00:03:07.750> feels<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.319> little

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
the but the card stock feels a little

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.630 
the but the card stock feels a little
bit<00:03:08.709> thinner<00:03:09.010> then<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.840> normal<00:03:11.830> theory<00:03:12.130> 11<00:03:12.489> deck

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
bit thinner then a normal theory 11 deck

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.449 
bit thinner then a normal theory 11 deck
would<00:03:12.819> feel<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.650> that's<00:03:14.650> kind<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.099> I<00:03:15.370> don't

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
would feel so that's kind of I don't

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.370 
would feel so that's kind of I don't
know<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.880> guess<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.630> jury<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:17.019> kind<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.290> out

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
know I guess the the jury is kind of out

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.740 
know I guess the the jury is kind of out
on<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.739> one<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.950> don't<00:03:18.040> understand<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.910> the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
on that one I don't understand the the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.170 
on that one I don't understand the the
big<00:03:19.959> draw<00:03:20.260> for<00:03:20.590> these<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.850> big

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
big draw for these if there is a big

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.810 
big draw for these if there is a big
draw<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.810> got<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> deck<00:03:23.470> from<00:03:23.799> a<00:03:24.040> skein<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:24.790> I

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
draw I got the deck from a skein so I

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.390 
draw I got the deck from a skein so I
figured<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.480> would<00:03:25.690> do<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.140> review<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.040> so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
figured I would do a review on it so

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.240 
figured I would do a review on it so
that<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> bee<00:03:29.109> stinger<00:03:29.680> back<00:03:29.890> club

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
specials by theory 11 it's it's an okay

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.349 
specials by theory 11 it's it's an okay
