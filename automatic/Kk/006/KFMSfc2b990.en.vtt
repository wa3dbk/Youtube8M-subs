00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello and welcome to animusx one 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.260
 a little different time from the new and 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.810
 two instance as you can see 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.640
 we spread ourselves in the room there are three 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.440
 different species of magpie too 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.539
 this little robot we will see her next to her 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.400
 can see and then the left and on 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.839
 the right and the middle 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.150
 behind me 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:25.429
 next to the boss a little bigger but in 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.650
 In the middle you see a ball and as soon as 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.009
 he shoots this bullet how is it going 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.310
 fight and that ball has 100 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.380
 energy and this 100 energy is shared 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.570
 on the small apps too and that is 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 something very elementary in the fight and 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.990
 Although there is here 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.910
 which are activated and which are not 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.370
 So these are activated from this 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.250
 These flashes are not the apps 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.680
 activated that means you are at it 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.960
 do not take part in the fight originally 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.300
 So you do not have to attack 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.400
 Do not the others could even 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.619
 kill it all over and as soon as it comes 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:10.609
 increased energy jumps this 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.619
 satin the next active or inactive one 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.079
 depending on what I more him 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.200
 reach is so again 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.899
 in principle to the expiration of the fight her 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.049
 try the small net at the beginning 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.850
 come alongside the big kill so 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.700
 next to these middle we can see 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.590
 collect - redings these there and when 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.030
 you give one of the little kills 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.920
 this four energy 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.439
 because the little ones have a lot of energy 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.810
 the middle from now are 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.079
 always 100 energy in circulation and this 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.569
 always share the ore on thus 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.299
 it would have to be practical and so try that 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.609
 first small targeted kills these in the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.889
 mean energy transferred and the 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.630
 then kill next to the big ones 

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:56.209
 into the energy in the bigger ones too 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.889
 Transform and do a little read 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.529
 left over because he needed to post 

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.649
 enable disables the boss easily 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:04.810
 by putting the little something in front of him 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.909
 stands 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.899
 kills then exercises these four energy in the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.150
 bus into it 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 That's why the boss does it here 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.530
 also an energy bar up on 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.239
 A maximum of 100 can go but more 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.579
 energy the boss has all the more 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.409
 he gets skills and so on 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.810
 The fight is very difficult 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:25.189
 That's why we just do it that way 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.069
 will be allowed first the small ones 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.019
 enable the middle of the middle 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.420
 enable the big hits and 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.700
 then we have the boss and two at the end 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 big ore and then one of the tanks thinks 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.090
 The boss, among other things, is the second 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:46.190
 We certainly have something for the beginning 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.099
 is very important and indeed as seen 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.040
 We have to make every player 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.030
 So in the 25s, all are effective and the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.430
 10 12 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.799
 and we leave the tanks on the left 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.230
 and right side just two each it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.689
 think because the more together around so 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 then they will get more powerful 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.920
 a 1000 short insert may and then from 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.480
 In the back she partly made a plan what it 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 there's still everyone getting straight 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.269
 random player of with an eye 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.010
 marked and already a kind of fire 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.660
 Followed for 20 seconds and this one 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.910
 then simply need to have to do is run 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.980
 but watch out that we ten I could 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.290
 I just got the brook that early enough 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.060
 starts to cry because that's always going to happen 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.440
 faster what haunts you and probably 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.650
 through sometime then 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.299
 and he should not do that through yours 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.949
 Group colleague pulls on the otherwise 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.949
 get massive damage from it 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.030
 as soon as the middle net 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.250
 are activated have just the 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.670
 ability of this fire according to what 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.349
 player followed and then when the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.209
 greater proximity to activate if left 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.220
 and then right next to the bus stand 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.650
 a new ability comes into play 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.239
 and then will be a player 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.670
 marked with a dear and if he 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.800
 they prefer is this the money 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.690
 player to another position too 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.799
 another player offered that 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.799
 get both hurt 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:25.910
 The entire battle requires something 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:30.510
 Coordination therefore always targeted 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.000
 you have to kill and these are not indiscriminate 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.760
 energies other things or stop in 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.820
 Others might need to initiate 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.070
 always watch which he warns kills 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.400
 and the easiest way is from the beginning 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.290
 if any effect from the players and 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.600
 the tanks each two and thinks 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.180
 then the doctors mock games to themselves 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.290
 and the players just have to pay attention 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.810
 that they are not too close 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.470
 so they converge 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.470
 strengthen 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.130
 why we do it all and not 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.020
 immediately activate with the funds 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.200
 ten small apps had very simple ones 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.560
 ground when the fund is active said of 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.470
 all still living in the room and 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.330
 activated energy and we knew 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.100
 not exactly how often that happens 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.660
 but every time that gets canceled 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.040
 he naturally becomes energy for it 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.560
 getting stronger and stronger 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.150
 an alternative tactic but it would be us 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.010
 do not know if it works then on live on 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.170
 would work if you all 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.140
 you can cool the sloane 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.120
 and if you lead them, it would be 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.270
 perhaps this was only the boss 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.250
 with a little activate and then 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.750
 simply with the skills he has 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.030
 gets to deal 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.860
 but that's just how safe you are 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.620
 side you think it must be synonymous s.am 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.360
 at the end of the live to play because he still 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.130
 you can ask these in the 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.320
 make comments and there are also in 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.330
 the description of a link to the 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.920
 written guide will be with 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.790
 to it again exactly graphically 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.790
 presented and explained
