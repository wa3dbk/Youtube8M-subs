00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.550 

can<00:00:00.480> we<00:00:00.539> talk<00:00:00.750> about<00:00:00.870> the<00:00:01.110> blood-brain

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
can we talk about the blood-brain

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.140 
can we talk about the blood-brain
barrier<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.120> it<00:00:03.240> breaks<00:00:03.449> down<00:00:03.600> like

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
barrier and and how it breaks down like

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.970 
barrier and and how it breaks down like
the<00:00:06.150> hypoglycemia<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.049> can<00:00:07.170> be<00:00:07.290> an<00:00:07.379> example<00:00:07.500> of

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the hypoglycemia it can be an example of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.320 
the hypoglycemia it can be an example of
that<00:00:08.130> and<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.630> how<00:00:10.400> etc<00:00:11.400> toxins<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.059> pass

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that and and how etc toxins can pass

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.390 
that and and how etc toxins can pass
through<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.559> occasion

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
through that on occasion

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
through that on occasion
yeah<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> blood-brain<00:00:15.480> barrier<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.410> of

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
yeah the blood-brain barrier is one of

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.290 
yeah the blood-brain barrier is one of
the<00:00:16.590> big<00:00:16.800> defenses<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> industry

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the big defenses that the industry

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.599 
the big defenses that the industry
always<00:00:18.480> gives<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.650> say<00:00:19.890> well<00:00:20.100> these<00:00:20.310> things

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
always gives they say well these things

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.890 
always gives they say well these things
can't<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.150> through<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> blood-brain

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
can't get through the blood-brain

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.970 
can't get through the blood-brain
barrier<00:00:22.519> I<00:00:23.519> did<00:00:24.359> rather<00:00:24.900> extensive<00:00:25.560> research

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
barrier I did rather extensive research

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.820 
barrier I did rather extensive research
in<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> area<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> discovered<00:00:28.230> was

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
in this area and what I discovered was

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.580 
in this area and what I discovered was
that<00:00:29.250> there<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:29.820> numerous<00:00:30.349> conditions<00:00:31.349> that

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that there are numerous conditions that

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.920 
that there are numerous conditions that
were<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.920> subjected<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.420> caused<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
were all subjected to that caused the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
were all subjected to that caused the
breakdown<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> normal<00:00:35.130> blood<00:00:35.399> brain

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
breakdown of the normal blood brain

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.470 
breakdown of the normal blood brain
barrier<00:00:36.320> number<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.620> aging<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:39.270> age

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
barrier number one is aging as we age

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
barrier number one is aging as we age
our<00:00:39.840> blood-brain<00:00:40.290> barrier

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
our blood-brain barrier

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760 
our blood-brain barrier
begins<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> deteriorate<00:00:42.110> it<00:00:43.110> becomes<00:00:43.410> porous

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
begins to deteriorate it becomes porous

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.979 
begins to deteriorate it becomes porous
so<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> anything<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.090> eat<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.629> pass<00:00:45.809> through

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so the anything we eat will pass through

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
so the anything we eat will pass through
the<00:00:46.140> blood<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> brain<00:00:47.180> Alzheimer's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
blood-brain barrier strokes even silent
strokes<00:00:55.530> produce<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.309> breakdown<00:00:56.670> the

thing that we discovered was that even
