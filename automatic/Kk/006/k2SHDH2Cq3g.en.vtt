advice because I've seen that firsthand

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.720 
advice because I've seen that firsthand
the<00:00:36.150> way<00:00:36.239> my<00:00:36.420> dad<00:00:36.600> had<00:00:36.690> built<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.989> businesses

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
the way my dad had built up businesses

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.770 
the way my dad had built up businesses
so<00:00:38.730> I've<00:00:38.790> seen<00:00:39.000> what<00:00:39.150> work<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.570> I've<00:00:39.629> seen

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so I've seen what work and I've seen

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.890 
so I've seen what work and I've seen
what's<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.470> what<00:00:40.590> doesn't

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
what's and what doesn't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.960 
what's and what doesn't
but<00:00:42.900> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:43.160> in<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> roundabout<00:00:44.550> some<00:00:44.820> way

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
but I think in a roundabout some way

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.479 
but I think in a roundabout some way
that's<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> always<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.020> control<00:00:46.489> always

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
that's it always be in control always

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.960 
that's it always be in control always
being<00:00:48.239> control<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.960> your<00:00:49.949> money<00:00:50.190> your

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
being control of your money your

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.430 
being control of your money your
investments<00:00:51.540> don't<00:00:51.750> other<00:00:51.989> people<00:00:52.019> do<00:00:52.410> it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
investments don't other people do it

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.799 
investments don't other people do it
always<00:00:53.100> sort<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.670> cut<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.000> last<00:00:54.239> saying<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
always sort of cut that last saying I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
always sort of cut that last saying I
think<00:00:55.019> I've<00:00:55.170> taken<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.340> everything<00:00:56.730> I

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
think I've taken that into everything I

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
think I've taken that into everything I
do

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.520 

I<00:01:01.129> suppose<00:01:02.129> my<00:01:02.280> dad<00:01:02.460> he's<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.719> optimist<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I suppose my dad he's an optimist you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.660 
I suppose my dad he's an optimist you
can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.940> good<00:01:06.119> in<00:01:06.180> any<00:01:06.390> situation<00:01:07.110> even

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
can see the good in any situation even

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.880 
can see the good in any situation even
if<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> bad<00:01:08.970> situation<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
if it's a bad situation you can you can

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
if it's a bad situation you can you can
see<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> upside<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:12.060> think<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.630> try<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
see the upside of it I think I try and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
see the upside of it I think I try and
do<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.229> well<00:01:13.500> people<00:01:13.799> waited<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.009> tell<00:01:14.100> me

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
do this well people waited to tell me

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.359 
do this well people waited to tell me
things<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.240> impossible<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> can't<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
things are impossible you can't do it I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.460 
things are impossible you can't do it I
make<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> knives<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.270> dad<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.659> he's<00:01:19.110> never

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
make the knives my dad is he's never

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.710 
make the knives my dad is he's never
said<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.009> me<00:01:20.070> once<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.149> possible<00:01:21.509> can't

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
said to me once it's not possible can't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.780 
said to me once it's not possible can't
be<00:01:21.780> done<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.009> think<00:01:23.070> he's<00:01:23.280> always<00:01:23.399> believed

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
be done and I think he's always believed

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.430 
be done and I think he's always believed
but<00:01:23.940> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> put<00:01:24.930> your<00:01:25.020> mind<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.320> anything

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
but if you put your mind to anything

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.230 
but if you put your mind to anything
what<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> can't<00:01:26.040> enough<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> will<00:01:27.060> get

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
what I can't enough that you will get

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.620 
what I can't enough that you will get
that

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.170 

I<00:01:32.070> think<00:01:33.070> some<00:01:33.250> socks<00:01:33.520> would<00:01:33.670> be<00:01:33.790> a<00:01:33.820> good<00:01:33.970> would

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
I think some socks would be a good would

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.109 
I think some socks would be a good would
be<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.360> good<00:01:34.570> idea<00:01:34.689> and<00:01:35.490> he's<00:01:36.490> already<00:01:36.640> he's

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
be a good idea and he's already he's

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.370 
be a good idea and he's already he's
already<00:01:37.180> got<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.479> number<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.780> pairs<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.080> her

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
already got a number of pairs of her

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.810 
already got a number of pairs of her
he's<00:01:38.950> already<00:01:39.100> got<00:01:39.310> I<00:01:39.340> think<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.640> full

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
he's already got I think the full

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.320 
he's already got I think the full
collection<00:01:40.090> but<00:01:41.460> maybe<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.580> new<00:01:42.700> maybe<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.119> new

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
collection but maybe the new maybe a new

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.350 
collection but maybe the new maybe a new
the<00:01:43.750> new<00:01:43.869> herringbone<00:01:44.380> ones<00:01:44.619> or<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.909> cashmere

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the new herringbone ones or the cashmere

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.680 
the new herringbone ones or the cashmere
socks<00:01:46.570> might<00:01:46.840> work<00:01:47.049> might<00:01:47.380> be<00:01:47.409> nice
