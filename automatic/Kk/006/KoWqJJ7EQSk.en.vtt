 amount damage to the rival is not necessary 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.070
 say it's one of the big ones 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.080
 initiators of the game and it's more joke 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.910
 even when he has the righteous glory to 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.680
 starting from the me late game is the most 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.940
 annoying the world the worst is that neither 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.989
 You can even ignore it because 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.000
 it hurts enough now the weak if 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.860
 you want to press the line or farmar below 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.990
 of the tower spends a lot of mana that then does not 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000
 will have to fight until level 6 is 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.229
 a fairly easy target to kill like this 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.520
 that if we concentrate on winning the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.860
 principle will lose part of its 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.630
 effectiveness makes great on gates yes 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.180
 but then if the thing goes wrong you can not 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.500
 to leave although sometimes he does not care 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.150
 solo games can be very 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.530
 effective but it is the team in accompanies 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.159
 can not define the game to the single 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.229
 finally the tips 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.670
 as we have already commented before the only 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.469
 moment of departure in the burning ok is 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.179
 weak is at the beginning we will make him gans 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.640
 before 6, thus putting that 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.020
 Be a little behind one of the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.819
 ways to reduce the effectiveness of mÃ¡Ã³ 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.649
 kai is to leave him without mana we can press 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.390
 the line to put it under tower and that 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.090
 it's been a week to be able to form 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.700
 will not have to fight from 6 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.259
 magician who is almost invincible almost but 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.420
 yes its definitive does not last for 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.799
 always if we have patience and we hope 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.640
 to finish it to do the boost not 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.200
 will have tools to escape 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.060
 while it is important to play the 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.890
 departure is equally important to know that 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600
 Champions choose in the case of the line 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.220
 we will take champions that are comfortable 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.080

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.920
 karim there are also certain cars that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 they go better with plot ok since in the end 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.130
 of the game hits a lot and not you 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.280
 can stand such as tristana 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.610
