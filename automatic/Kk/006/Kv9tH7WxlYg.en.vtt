to<00:01:00.429> do<00:01:00.549> that<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:02.679> still<00:01:03.489> think<00:01:03.729> i<00:01:03.940> get

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to do that because I still think i get

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.360

i'm<00:01:04.720> given<00:01:04.960> some<00:01:05.080> people<00:01:05.320> still<00:01:06.010> a<00:01:06.070> chance

wheel feet but they didn't give him the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.180 
wheel feet but they didn't give him the
same<00:02:14.000> type<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.450> wheel<00:02:14.780> feet<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.800> they<00:02:15.980> did<00:02:16.160> in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
same type of wheel feet like they did in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.630 
same type of wheel feet like they did in
the<00:02:16.460> movie<00:02:17.350> they<00:02:18.350> gave<00:02:18.560> him<00:02:19.060> uh<00:02:20.440> this<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:22.370> this

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the movie they gave him uh this in this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.250 
the movie they gave him uh this in this
for<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:26.600> get<00:02:26.720> understand<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.140> little

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
for the to get understand a little

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.790 
for the to get understand a little
better<00:02:27.410> say<00:02:27.710> sorry<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.580> can<00:02:28.730> actually<00:02:28.970> stand

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
better say sorry I can actually stand

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.710 
better say sorry I can actually stand
articulation<00:02:30.800> wise<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.700> can<00:02:31.880> kind<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
articulation wise you can kind of a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
articulation wise you can kind of a
little<00:02:33.020> bit<00:02:33.290> pivot<00:02:33.650> not<00:02:34.160> i<00:02:34.190> mean<00:02:34.280> just<00:02:34.490> kind<00:02:34.700> of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
little bit pivot not i mean just kind of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.700 
little bit pivot not i mean just kind of
doing<00:02:35.350> there<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:37.120> chest<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.600> can<00:02:38.960> rotate<00:02:39.200> 360

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
doing there the chest you can rotate 360

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.699 
doing there the chest you can rotate 360
of<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:39.950> arm<00:02:40.100> go<00:02:40.310> through<00:02:40.459> 60<00:02:40.820> at<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.030> elbow<00:02:41.709> go

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
of the arm go through 60 at the elbow go

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.320 
of the arm go through 60 at the elbow go
forward<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:43.220> back<00:02:43.370> because<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.030> isn't<00:02:44.300> a

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
forward and back because this isn't a

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.240 
forward and back because this isn't a
ball<00:02:44.480> joint<00:02:44.660> go<00:02:45.440> forward<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.860> back<00:02:45.950> at<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
ball joint go forward and back at the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.270 
ball joint go forward and back at the
elbow<00:02:46.990> head<00:02:47.990> can<00:02:48.230> rotate<00:02:48.320> 360<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.160> on<00:02:49.250> a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
elbow head can rotate 360 it's on a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.770 
elbow head can rotate 360 it's on a
ball-joint<00:02:51.370> boys<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.820> rotate<00:02:53.060> 360<00:02:53.480> s<00:02:53.660> on<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
ball-joint boys can rotate 360 s on a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.250 
ball-joint boys can rotate 360 s on a
ball<00:02:53.959> joint<00:02:53.990> as<00:02:54.290> well<00:02:55.660> legs<00:02:56.660> can<00:02:56.930> rotate

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
ball joint as well legs can rotate

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.970 
ball joint as well legs can rotate
forward<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.830> back<00:02:57.980> side<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.700> side<00:02:59.739> bend<00:03:00.739> at

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
forward and back side to side bend at

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.970 
forward and back side to side bend at
the<00:03:01.010> knee<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:01.489> then<00:03:01.610> bend<00:03:02.180> at<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.830> bit<00:03:03.830> here

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
the knee and then bend at the bit here

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.270 
the knee and then bend at the bit here
so<00:03:04.010> he<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.400> actually<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:05.770> he<00:03:06.770> can<00:03:06.920> be<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.070> lot

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
so he can actually have he can be a lot

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.620 
so he can actually have he can be a lot
shorter<00:03:07.310> if<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:08.000> wanted<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:10.300> so<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.360> can<00:03:11.540> make

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
shorter if you wanted to so you can make

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.009 
shorter if you wanted to so you can make
him<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:11.989> shorter<00:03:12.260> if<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:14.420> felt<00:03:14.840> like<00:03:14.930> it

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
him a lot shorter if you felt like it

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.400 
him a lot shorter if you felt like it
but<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.130> to<00:03:16.190> extend<00:03:17.090> him<00:03:17.510> out<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:17.989> he<00:03:18.019> still

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
but I like to extend him out so he still

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.160 
but I like to extend him out so he still
has<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.620> chicken<00:03:18.950> legs<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.430> not<00:03:19.640> as<00:03:19.790> much<00:03:20.170> so

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
has the chicken legs just not as much so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.840 
has the chicken legs just not as much so
he<00:03:21.350> can<00:03:21.500> still<00:03:21.739> stand<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.280> all<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:22.550> it's<00:03:22.700> just

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
he can still stand and all but it's just

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.120 
he can still stand and all but it's just
not<00:03:22.880> his<00:03:23.060> bad<00:03:23.239> chick<00:03:23.269> enlighten<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.200> was<00:03:24.920> taller

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:34.180 

so<00:03:28.130> size<00:03:28.340> on<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.610> figure<00:03:28.880> varies<00:03:32.920> very<00:03:33.920> cool

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
so size on this figure varies very cool

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.100 
so size on this figure varies very cool
for<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.489> size<00:03:34.940> comparison<00:03:35.260> I<00:03:36.260> have<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.160> Fallen

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
for a size comparison I have the Fallen

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.789 
for a size comparison I have the Fallen
which<00:03:39.130> raises<00:03:40.130> up<00:03:40.400> just<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.640> tad<00:03:41.650> ski<00:03:42.650> them

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
which raises up just a tad ski them

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.190 
which raises up just a tad ski them
fallen<00:03:43.250> it's<00:03:43.970> about<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.570> same<00:03:44.750> size<00:03:44.810> maybe

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
fallen it's about the same size maybe

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.949 
fallen it's about the same size maybe
the<00:03:45.380> tip<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.560> his<00:03:45.769> crown<00:03:46.250> here<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:47.480> little

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
the tip of his crown here is a little

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.130 
the tip of his crown here is a little
shorten<00:03:48.380> sideswipe<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:50.209> what<00:03:50.330> make<00:03:50.480> makes<00:03:51.019> him

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
shorten sideswipe it what make makes him

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.560 
shorten sideswipe it what make makes him
about<00:03:51.320> half<00:03:52.010> an<00:03:52.160> inch<00:03:52.250> taller<00:03:52.580> even<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.540> a

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
about half an inch taller even like a

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.730 
about half an inch taller even like a
few<00:03:53.810> centimeters

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.300 

so<00:03:58.490> they<00:03:58.700> owe<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.290> guns<00:04:00.560> were<00:04:00.890> accurate

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
so they owe the guns were accurate

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:09.970 
so they owe the guns were accurate
because<00:04:01.700> I'll<00:04:02.570> explain<00:04:02.990> that<00:04:03.050> later<00:04:08.980> they're

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
because I'll explain that later they're

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.730 
because I'll explain that later they're
you<00:04:11.440> guns<00:04:12.440> are<00:04:12.590> accurate<00:04:12.980> everything<00:04:13.340> is<00:04:14.740> very

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
you guns are accurate everything is very

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.460 
you guns are accurate everything is very
cool<00:04:16.390> he<00:04:17.390> doesn't<00:04:17.660> transform<00:04:18.020> because<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.350> in

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
cool he doesn't transform because you in

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.229 
cool he doesn't transform because you in
robot<00:04:18.680> replica<00:04:19.040> but<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.370> far<00:04:19.610> out<00:04:19.910> of<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
robot replica but so far out of the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.790 
robot replica but so far out of the
three<00:04:20.480> waves<00:04:20.690> of<00:04:20.900> our<00:04:21.050> because<00:04:21.590> that<00:04:21.709> have

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
three waves of our because that have

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.560 
three waves of our because that have
been<00:04:21.890> revealed<00:04:22.280> just<00:04:22.820> wave<00:04:23.000> three<00:04:23.270> of<00:04:23.360> course

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
been revealed just wave three of course

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.160 
been revealed just wave three of course
this<00:04:24.380> is<00:04:24.500> probably<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.770> weakest<00:04:25.040> wave

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
this is probably the weakest wave

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.290 
this is probably the weakest wave
because<00:04:27.170> there's<00:04:27.350> only<00:04:27.410> two<00:04:27.620> figures<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
because there's only two figures and the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.440 
because there's only two figures and the
fact<00:04:29.570> it's<00:04:30.470> fallen<00:04:30.890> and<00:04:31.010> sideswipe<00:04:31.450> they

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
fact it's fallen and sideswipe they

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.760 
fact it's fallen and sideswipe they
could<00:04:32.600> have<00:04:32.660> done<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.900> Fallen<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.380> lot<00:04:33.560> better

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
could have done the Fallen a lot better

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.650 
could have done the Fallen a lot better
but<00:04:33.950> you<00:04:34.070> should<00:04:34.250> still<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.670> it<00:04:34.820> still<00:04:35.510> pick

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
but you should still get it still pick

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.030 
but you should still get it still pick
it<00:04:35.750> up<00:04:35.840> because<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.260> fallen<00:04:36.560> at<00:04:36.650> all<00:04:36.800> and

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040

sideways<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:19.810> can<00:05:20.810> also<00:05:20.990> when<00:05:21.320> they<00:05:21.410> said

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590

think they because they showed RC then
the<00:05:27.050> twins<00:05:27.350> so<00:05:27.800> they<00:05:27.920> said<00:05:28.130> RC<00:05:28.670> twins<00:05:29.660> like<00:05:30.200> RC

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650
