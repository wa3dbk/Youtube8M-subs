00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.750

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.920
 I love Christmas I love Christmas crap 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.389
 lost its past not in the sense that 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.660
 I like Christmas 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.150
 i like panettone and pandoro i stay 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 gifts with the family 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.950
 like a lot of gifts 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.590
 I like a lot to ask 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.290
 and then to those who don't like gifts anyway a 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.290
 native of the same Christmas holidays and 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.240
 Christmas holidays so contaminated 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.520
 stress because Christmas holidays the same 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.620
 continue christmas and if none of the tasks 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.310
 Christmas maybe to repeat an exam for later 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.660
 Christmas 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.160
 and if you don't have to prepare an exam for 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.640
 where such, however, by post must 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.500
 to work 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.270
 remains that fact during these micro 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.010
 vacation you have to do a lot of things like 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.480
 buy gifts like organizing 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.190
 Christmas holidays then call 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.960
 book abroad for the last one is not there 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.850
 place then call back the snow one 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.320
 cool but usually it snows when you 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.240
 you have to go and make the fortnightly gifts 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.950
 blackmail to arrive in the store that must 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.320
 put snow tires and then it is 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.730
 always a bit messy because of that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.950
 as for me, Christmas 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.590
 I have been 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.120
 then actually not just natal own 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.470
 all winter as if I were hibernating 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.090
 with Christmas lights lit ha 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.320
 wrapped the smoke is hotter with pulses 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.820
 the belly full of hot chocolate that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.290
 while you sleep mccarthy to understand and if 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.670
 I really should wake up not like 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.340
 that the things that I want you to me reality 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.579
 solar 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.020
 she talks about a hot tea like that for one 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.670
 fucking cups of hot tea I wouldn't have 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.020
 had to get out of bed go to the kitchen 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.609
 turn on the stove without counting 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.920
 which I probably would have used many 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:29.299
 But gavino on fire twice then after 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.649
 I should have cooled my hands that 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.299
 I could finally pour tea 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.740
 in the cup maybe burning me again 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.110
 then I would have sworn the tea I would be back in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.069
 in short, room to drink all that challenges 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.600
 my laziness in drinking it not 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.829
 would never face a crazy life in 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 background the facts of materialization 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:45.670
 in the east of everything I want to do to him 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.659
 side is much more comfortable 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.069
 especially considering that 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.599
 in the winter every day we must already 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.890
 having to deal with the attacks in the morning 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:52.880
 with the darkness outside the window and the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.979
 Elba tablets because they are 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 constantly frozen at the end 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.259
 only things to do for which I would be 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.549
 prepared by tar mi from the winter bed 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.899
 always admitted that clothes come to me 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.709
 they would stick by themselves would be take 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.909
 the car go downtown a 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.590
 walk around to see the lights in the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.939
 Christmas decorations in the shops even if then 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.500
 It is never a beautiful holy ideal like TV 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.729
 imagined because when you imagine him 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.329
 not all the people running to do 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.329
 gifts to the udc 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.930
 ebook and relaxing so it becomes itself 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.220
 another thing I would be willing to 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.480
 getting out of bed in winter always 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.340
 admitted that clothes get me from 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.690
 just shopping 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.980
 then enter a shop to see each other 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.630
 catapult a salesman onto you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.980
 will ask or can I help you explain them 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.120
 who returned with intentions takes a 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.680
 little thought for a friend at the head of a 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.300
 think well you see how I do you 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.890
 see something and find yourself leaving 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.410
 with an empty wallet is a dozen 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.280
 pages fall into the hands even though in 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.960
 reality from the entrance empty hands 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.370
 at the exit with the empty wallet below 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.930
 Christmas generally pass quietly 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.220
 of the major because they are all like you 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.810
 messed up and don't fall for a kick 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.730
 and at the end between Christmas lights and cups 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.140
 of the butter that considers us Christmas 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.520
 then summarizes in three things chocolate 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.320

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:59.600

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.380
 passing these days between sleep under 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.989
 the duvet hoping that nobody will 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.040
 wrong and that they are disco scores 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.450
 in which I will remain in line in the cold 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.790
 hoping some pr will do me 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.340
 skip the line I am dying ear 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.190

 in front make the pre row of true cold

 that you are not Santa Claus 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:04.840
 such a fucking thing that ranks me 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.069
 wait another December past like 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.780
 seems to get cold outside 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.790
 nightclubs taking the shops 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.709
 crowded studying little and eating 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.209
 too much in cuts in photos of Santa Claus 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.150
 muscled or natal mom in thong 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.590
 on facebook and Christmas dinners with 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.060
 relatives who give me gifts 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.139
 light weight never sweaters that loses 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.949
 before finding an excuse for not 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.510
 put trying with me have it 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.190
 find some time to make two 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.020
 steps and sunset time in 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.550
 hill behind my house because in 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.949
 I give you the greatest gift we can 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.580
 to receive for Christmas is to find tracks 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.580
 of cannes discussed 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.330
 d 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.350
 oh well in such a ready dance even if every 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.240
 half of it snows on facebook 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.950
 some people write snow and the other half 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.660
 from writes look a little at the window and 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.850
 then they all fight among themselves and not 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.040
 we must mitigate christmas the only thing is 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.380
 that personally I think it would be more 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.530
 useful to spend more time giving the lawyers 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.180
 what to lose in finding that then 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.670
 let's face it we all want one Christmas 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.110
 person and do not use and now I go to 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.180
 look for gifts at the last if you have 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.310
 some idea of ​​a cool gift maybe 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.410
 says order on the internet or some 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.460
 gift experience you have made that 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.840
 it worked 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.150
 maybe he writes like this below 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.230
 at the end I will find something superior 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.880
 bang here to do a lot of 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.280
 presents 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.750
 I end up doing the gel by saying something 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.440
 so actually I made this video 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.410

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.840
