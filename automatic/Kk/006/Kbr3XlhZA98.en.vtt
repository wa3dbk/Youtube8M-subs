around<00:00:00.630> paths<00:00:00.840> of<00:00:01.050> glory<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.770> just<00:00:02.370> finished<00:00:02.700> up

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
around paths of glory I just finished up

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.950 
around paths of glory I just finished up
the<00:00:03.149> winter<00:00:06.830> 1916<00:00:07.830> turn<00:00:08.540> going<00:00:09.540> into<00:00:09.840> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the winter 1916 turn going into the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.230 
the winter 1916 turn going into the
spring<00:00:10.910> where<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.300> um<00:00:15.049> alright<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
spring where are we um alright so the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.099 
spring where are we um alright so the
west<00:00:18.449> front<00:00:18.830> started<00:00:19.830> getting<00:00:20.039> bloodier<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
west front started getting bloodier and

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.480 
west front started getting bloodier and
I'm<00:00:22.109> finding<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> game<00:00:22.680> does<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> pretty<00:00:23.369> good

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
I'm finding the game does a pretty good

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.470 
I'm finding the game does a pretty good
job<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:24.350> recreating<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.830> feel<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.480> you

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
job of recreating the feel for it you

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.740 
job of recreating the feel for it you
make<00:00:27.630> an<00:00:27.750> assault<00:00:28.760> both<00:00:29.760> sides<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.330> hammered

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
make an assault both sides get hammered

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
make an assault both sides get hammered
even<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> defender<00:00:32.219> loses<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> trenches

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
even if the defender loses the trenches

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
even if the defender loses the trenches
let<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.480> stay<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.809> they<00:00:36.809> pump<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.260> troops

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
let them stay so they pump more troops

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.459 
let them stay so they pump more troops
into<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> fund<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.450> even<00:00:39.719> though<00:00:39.750> maybe<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
into the fund so even though maybe the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.959 
into the fund so even though maybe the
stacks<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.100> weaker<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> attackers

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
stacks a little weaker the attackers

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.670 
stacks a little weaker the attackers
probably<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.510> weaker<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.079> would<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.500> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
probably a lot weaker and would have to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490 
probably a lot weaker and would have to
completely<00:00:44.430> reorganize<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.660> give<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.289> yet

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
completely reorganize and give you yet

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
completely reorganize and give you yet
another<00:00:46.620> turn<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.219> fill<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:48.410> defenses<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
another turn to fill your defenses I

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
another turn to fill your defenses I
think<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.489> possible<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.120> eventually<00:00:51.719> break

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
think it's possible to eventually break

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
think it's possible to eventually break
the<00:00:52.110> line<00:00:52.320> but<00:00:53.129> it's<00:00:53.640> definitely<00:00:54.090> giving<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the line but it's definitely giving me a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
the line but it's definitely giving me a
good<00:00:54.899> trench<00:00:55.170> feel<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:56.239> over<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
good trench feel on that over on the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360 
good trench feel on that over on the
Italian<00:00:57.840> front<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.530> much<00:00:58.739> happened<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
Italian front not much happened the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
Italian front not much happened the
mandated<00:00:59.699> offensive<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> from<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.289> French

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
mandated offensive was from the French

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.979 
mandated offensive was from the French
and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.039> Italians<00:01:02.489> chose<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.539> attack<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and the Italians chose not to attack in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.270 
and the Italians chose not to attack in
the<00:01:04.049> mountains<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> winter<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.040> they

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the mountains in the winter because they

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.940 
the mountains in the winter because they
actually<00:01:05.610> knew<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> bad<00:01:06.630> weather<00:01:06.990> card

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
actually knew that the bad weather card

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.719 
actually knew that the bad weather card
was<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.150> Central<00:01:09.930> Powers<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.530> from<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> spy

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
was in the Central Powers and from a spy

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.560 
was in the Central Powers and from a spy
the<00:01:12.299> turn<00:01:12.510> earlier<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:14.970> much<00:01:15.119> changed<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the turn earlier so not much changed on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330 
the turn earlier so not much changed on
the<00:01:15.659> Italian<00:01:15.990> front<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.650> Balkans<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.189> been

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the Italian front the Balkans has been

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.870 
the Italian front the Balkans has been
kind<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> fluid<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:19.130> we<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> Austrians

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
kind of fluid here we got the Austrians

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840 
kind of fluid here we got the Austrians
marching<00:01:21.720> in<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> slowly<00:01:22.380> crushing<00:01:23.310> Romania

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
marching in and slowly crushing Romania

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
marching in and slowly crushing Romania
the<00:01:24.330> rest<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.750> pretty<00:01:25.530> simple<00:01:25.830> pretty

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the rest of it's pretty simple pretty

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.960 
the rest of it's pretty simple pretty
pretty<00:01:27.210> much<00:01:27.360> stayed<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> same<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.970> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
pretty much stayed the same but the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.569 
pretty much stayed the same but the
Bulgarians<00:01:30.600> helped<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.740> Austrians<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> little

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
Bulgarians helped the Austrians a little

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
Bulgarians helped the Austrians a little
bit<00:01:33.110> biggie<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:35.329> before<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.630> blockade<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.500> was

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bit biggie and before the blockade I was

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.480 
bit biggie and before the blockade I was
up<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.520> 18<00:01:38.970> victory<00:01:39.390> points<00:01:40.340> could<00:01:41.340> have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
up to 18 victory points could have

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
up to 18 victory points could have
possibly<00:01:41.729> pushed<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.570> 20<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.229> act<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
possibly pushed to 20 with it act with a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.160 
possibly pushed to 20 with it act with a
last<00:01:44.430> round<00:01:45.299> options<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:46.619> operations<00:01:47.430> phase

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
last round options up operations phase

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.120 
last round options up operations phase
but<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> wouldn't<00:01:49.530> help<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
but that wouldn't help because the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.950 
but that wouldn't help because the
blockade<00:01:50.520> was<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.820> place<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.869> have

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
blockade was in place it would have

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.749 
blockade was in place it would have
dropped<00:01:52.079> back<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.680> 19<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.369> it's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
dropped back down to 19 but it's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.480 
dropped back down to 19 but it's
definitely<00:01:54.060> close<00:01:54.479> how<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> panic<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
definitely close how to panic so I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
definitely close how to panic so I
thought<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.759> victory<00:01:57.030> points<00:01:57.299> were<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.540> wrong

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
thought my victory points were all wrong

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.560 
thought my victory points were all wrong
I<00:01:58.280> had<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.579> through<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.939> recount<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.450> all

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
I had to go through and recount them all

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.980 
I had to go through and recount them all
and<00:02:01.909> much<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.180> surprise<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.930> were

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and much to my surprise they were

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.020 
and much to my surprise they were
actually<00:02:04.469> right<00:02:04.680> even<00:02:05.009> though<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.880> took

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
actually right even though it took

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.169 
actually right even though it took
several<00:02:06.299> recounting<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.590> make<00:02:07.770> sure

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
several recounting to make sure

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.520 
several recounting to make sure
that<00:02:09.609> all<00:02:10.609> right<00:02:10.930> over<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.049> the<00:02:12.140> Russian<00:02:12.500> front

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
that all right over on the Russian front

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.259 
that all right over on the Russian front
though<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.459> doesn't<00:02:13.819> look<00:02:14.090> good<00:02:14.150> for<00:02:14.359> Russia

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
though this doesn't look good for Russia

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.259 
though this doesn't look good for Russia
get<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.540> Germans<00:02:18.109> besieging<00:02:18.620> rigga<00:02:19.269> they've

got one small unit defending their
supply<00:02:23.930> line<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.650> which<00:02:25.250> may<00:02:25.760> be<00:02:25.790> an

supply line there which may be an

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.979 
supply line there which may be an
opportunity<00:02:26.620> but<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:28.180> looks<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.420> risky<00:02:29.840> for

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
opportunity but it looks so risky for

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.660 
opportunity but it looks so risky for
the<00:02:30.019> Russians<00:02:30.439> to<00:02:30.530> try<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:30.889> take<00:02:31.219> advantage<00:02:31.370> of

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
the Russians to try to take advantage of

the Russians to try to take advantage of

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
that and this is all that's left of the

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.709 
that and this is all that's left of the

northern Russians the Austrians have

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.409 
northern Russians the Austrians have
marched<00:02:36.260> forward<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:37.280> taking<00:02:37.519> Kiev<00:02:37.909> and

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.009 

Odessa<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:42.500> Russians<00:02:42.859> are<00:02:42.980> Russian

reinforcements<00:02:45.579> for<00:02:46.579> that<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:47.689> had<00:02:48.560> actually

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
reinforcements for that I had actually

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.839 
reinforcements for that I had actually
made<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.159> choice<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.930> attack<00:02:51.280> Kiev<00:02:52.280> instead

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
made the choice to attack Kiev instead

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.959 
made the choice to attack Kiev instead
of<00:02:52.969> Odessa<00:02:54.310> because<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.400> didn't<00:02:55.669> think<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:55.969 
of Odessa because I didn't think the

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:57.759 
of Odessa because I didn't think the
Russians<00:02:56.120> would<00:02:56.689> be<00:02:57.139> able<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.409> get<00:02:57.560> troops

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
Russians would be able to get troops

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.129 
Russians would be able to get troops
towed<00:02:58.040> us<00:02:58.250> up<00:02:58.489> but<00:02:58.609> I<00:02:58.669> forgot<00:02:59.000> yeah<00:02:59.719> they<00:02:59.900> can

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
towed us up but I forgot yeah they can

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.959 
towed us up but I forgot yeah they can
get<00:03:00.409> reinforcements<00:03:01.159> off<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.609> replacement

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 
get reinforcements off you replacement

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.949 
get reinforcements off you replacement
able<00:03:02.450> okay<00:03:03.340> over<00:03:04.340> in<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.459> Turkish<00:03:04.849> side<00:03:04.959> the

able okay over in the Turkish side the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.390 
able okay over in the Turkish side the
Russians<00:03:06.290> are<00:03:06.379> continuing<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:06.889> push<00:03:07.099> forward

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
Russians are continuing to push forward

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.869 
Russians are continuing to push forward
trying<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.480> look<00:03:08.659> at<00:03:08.840> how<00:03:09.829> exactly<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.489> I<00:03:10.549> cut

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
trying to look at how exactly can I cut

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.490 
trying to look at how exactly can I cut
off<00:03:11.090> supply<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.799> vast<00:03:13.010> majority<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:14.500> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
off supply to the vast majority of of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.890 
off supply to the vast majority of of
the<00:03:15.949> Turks<00:03:16.190> without<00:03:16.579> risking<00:03:17.299> my<00:03:17.479> own<00:03:17.510> too

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the Turks without risking my own too

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.530 
the Turks without risking my own too
much<00:03:18.139> it's<00:03:18.799> an<00:03:18.859> expensive<00:03:19.310> process<00:03:19.879> in<00:03:20.359> terms

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
much it's an expensive process in terms

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.189 
much it's an expensive process in terms
of<00:03:20.780> moving<00:03:21.019> units<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:25.810> frankly<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.930> Allies

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
of moving units and frankly the Allies

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.179 
of moving units and frankly the Allies
have<00:03:27.409> better<00:03:27.590> things<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.129> do<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> think<00:03:30.159> but<00:03:31.159> no

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
have better things to do I think but no

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.149 
have better things to do I think but no
and<00:03:31.549> then<00:03:31.639> an<00:03:31.790> extra<00:03:32.120> point<00:03:32.359> comes<00:03:32.629> up<00:03:33.129> so<00:03:34.129> I

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
and then an extra point comes up so I

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.800 
and then an extra point comes up so I
try<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.489> take<00:03:34.760> advantage<00:03:34.879> of<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.389> somewhere

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
try to take advantage of that somewhere

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.369 
try to take advantage of that somewhere
I<00:03:36.169> think<00:03:36.949> that's<00:03:37.099> actually<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.939> right<00:03:38.379> factor

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
I think that's actually the right factor

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.240 
I think that's actually the right factor
about<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.840> about<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.900> backwaters<00:03:42.409> is<00:03:42.709> that

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
about the about the backwaters is that

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.469 
about the about the backwaters is that
you<00:03:43.340> don't<00:03:43.699> see<00:03:44.000> these<00:03:44.150> major

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
you don't see these major

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.360 
you don't see these major
across-the-board<00:03:45.229> pushes<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:48.280> don't<00:03:49.280> know

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
across-the-board pushes so I don't know

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.030 
across-the-board pushes so I don't know
I<00:03:49.489> there's<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:50.509> factories<00:03:51.109> about<00:03:51.379> about<00:03:51.859> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
I there's just factories about about the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.949 
I there's just factories about about the
system<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.819> I<00:03:52.849> think<00:03:53.180> work<00:03:53.419> really<00:03:53.629> really

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
system that I think work really really

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.740 
system that I think work really really
well<00:03:54.849> but<00:03:55.849> then<00:03:56.060> there's<00:03:56.239> these<00:03:56.689> little

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
well but then there's these little

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.249 
well but then there's these little
glitches<00:03:57.669> then<00:03:58.669> I<00:03:58.790> say<00:03:58.970> ah<00:03:59.150> but<00:03:59.959> a<00:03:59.989> hex

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:00.259 
glitches then I say ah but a hex

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:02.069 
glitches then I say ah but a hex
encounter<00:04:00.650> game<00:04:00.799> handles<00:04:01.129> that<00:04:01.250> better<00:04:01.459> so

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
encounter game handles that better so

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.869 
encounter game handles that better so
but<00:04:03.079> that's<00:04:03.259> just<00:04:03.409> not<00:04:03.500> fair<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.069> mean<00:04:04.400> it

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
but that's just not fair I mean it

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.170 
but that's just not fair I mean it
really<00:04:04.909> isn't<00:04:05.540> because<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:07.669> handling

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
really isn't because this is handling

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.050 
really isn't because this is handling
some<00:04:08.479> stuff<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:11.139> your<00:04:12.139> standard<00:04:12.590> war<00:04:12.799> game

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
some stuff that your standard war game

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.879 
some stuff that your standard war game
wouldn't<00:04:14.060> handle<00:04:14.629> and<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.409> I've<00:04:15.500> got<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.769> look

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
wouldn't handle and so I've got to look

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.209 
wouldn't handle and so I've got to look
at<00:04:16.070> what<00:04:16.430> those<00:04:17.090> don't<00:04:17.389> handle<00:04:17.779> as<00:04:17.989> flaws<00:04:18.919> as

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.219 
at what those don't handle as flaws as

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.300 
at what those don't handle as flaws as
well<00:04:19.400> bet

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
well bet

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.190 
well bet
you<00:04:21.299> know<00:04:21.389> it's<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.600> matter<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.840> a<00:04:22.019> balance<00:04:22.470> so

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
you know it's a matter of a balance so

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.330 
you know it's a matter of a balance so

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
get that in and was planning on it but

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.060 
get that in and was planning on it but
there<00:05:30.720> was<00:05:30.840> an<00:05:30.930> emergency<00:05:31.110> situation<00:05:31.650> they

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
there was an emergency situation they

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.409 
there was an emergency situation they
cropped<00:05:32.310> up<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.729> needed<00:05:33.000> to<00:05:33.090> do<00:05:33.210> an<00:05:33.300> SR<00:05:33.660> and

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
cropped up and I needed to do an SR and

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.890 
cropped up and I needed to do an SR and
strategic<00:05:36.419> redeployment<00:05:36.840> and<00:05:37.140> uh<00:05:38.900> I'm

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
strategic redeployment and uh I'm

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.810 
strategic redeployment and uh I'm
finding<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:40.440> harder<00:05:41.010> and<00:05:41.039> harder<00:05:41.220> to<00:05:41.640> play

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
finding it harder and harder to play

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:50.390 
finding it harder and harder to play
events<00:05:42.300> or<00:05:46.340> most<00:05:47.340> of<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.580> other<00:05:49.400> little

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
events or most of the other little

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.980 
events or most of the other little
things<00:05:50.700> certainly<00:05:51.090> a<00:05:51.150> piece<00:05:51.389> term<00:05:51.630> seems

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
things certainly a piece term seems

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.090 
things certainly a piece term seems
weird<00:05:52.229> all<00:05:52.950> right<00:05:53.130> i'll<00:05:53.340> let<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.669> go<00:05:53.760> here
