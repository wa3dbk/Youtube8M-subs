00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.540
 so hello everyone to a new video 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.450
 this time a little shorter though 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 the following explanations to this namely 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.390
 Thursdays is always the day on which 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 it can be that again a new one 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.300
 snapshot comes out so I'm 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.930
 always nice in search sniffs as 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 a bit around and actually in front of that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.130
 whole long time ago I already have 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 three times on good found nothing in it 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 you can refresh the page and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 Suddenly it's all over 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 now here's the minecraft 1 point 7.6 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.879
 trier release version 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.530
 come out 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.120
 there is a little new thing that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 it has been inflicted 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 not the features in it for you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.750
 minecraft version 1.8 see the stands 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.370
 since already showed a playlist 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.629
 this may not be fully inserted 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 just noticed on the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.250
 go to playlist on channel 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.230
 then minecraft 1.8 go there is namely 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.640
 all snapshots once presented the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.199
 new features are added 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 they are not trained for this yet 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.979
 But there is something else with it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.470
 This celeb is a small one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.689
 The foundation stone in relation to the new name 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.549
 system with which minecraft will work 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.049
 that it has already been inserted here 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.670
 can not change his name yet 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.280
 but I 'll be very brief what it's about 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.070
 from now or what is now in 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 future should look like that everyone 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.610
 minecraft account no longer about his 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.610
 name is identified but over 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.950
 an id gets this account to words 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.140
 so it should be possible that you yourself 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.259
 his name can theoretically change 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.810
 So if you are with easter bunnies you 1 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.850
 2 3 4 5 6 7 not satisfied you can 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.960
 later change the name 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.189
 that does not change the the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.479
 plate the same mittmann yours 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.310
 account can identify 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.229
 but you can theoretically into what 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.430
 Rename another if you then 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.560
 the opinion page one is not so 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.060
 smart to call you that 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 the thing is you can not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 in names that already exist 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.570
 you can not park in the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.850
 physically ill in you can you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.329
 do not call this unplayed otherwise 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.579
 Not 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.000
 you have to take the name garments 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.130
 not yet occupied are names such as 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.170
 example that has now been occupied 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.120
 they will be released as soon as they are 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.220
 this player in turn renames differently 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.240
 so do not see that we are the only one 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:25.530
 fit in the sense because so important who 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.790
 otherwise the cover system of 1.7 6 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.200
 will work a bit differently too 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.020
 it will not be compatible 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.330
 with the 1.75 us next version because 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.130
 this id system is already here 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.320
 that means if you are on one 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.640
 want to go pissed off someone else has 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.900
 not saved then you can in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.570
 this version is not why you have to 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.670
 maybe with 1.7 on the 115th 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.220
 stay that way then works as well 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.480
 also gently on it or the one 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.030
 you have to make sense of it slowly 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
 used to work with it and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.420
 essentially it was like that already 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.050
 that we are to the next level 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.490
 Unfortunately, this time only a little update 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.960
 that we are the newest in terms 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.340
 relatively quickly there I have you 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.070
 Of course, do not leave in the dark therefore 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 the hint of a pure test or 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.280
 which means it can not be much of Hesse 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.710
 tune when the server tests off 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 otherwise so much for the hint I want 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.950
 to look and then we'll see each other too 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.950
 already a next video 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.650
 there
