built<00:00:41.320> for<00:00:41.470> controllers<00:00:41.920> because<00:00:42.220> everything

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
built for controllers because everything

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.130 
built for controllers because everything
is<00:00:42.790> mirrored<00:00:43.090> and<00:00:43.300> you'll<00:00:43.810> find<00:00:44.050> that

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
is mirrored and you'll find that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.050 
is mirrored and you'll find that
everything<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.710> do<00:00:44.800> on<00:00:44.950> one<00:00:45.130> side<00:00:45.310> is<00:00:45.579> just

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
everything you do on one side is just

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.850 
everything you do on one side is just
exactly<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.930> same<00:00:47.079> on<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.290> other<00:00:47.350> side<00:00:47.470> makes

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
exactly the same on the other side makes

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.200 
exactly the same on the other side makes
it<00:00:47.980> really<00:00:48.160> easy<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.640> figure<00:00:48.790> out<00:00:48.910> how<00:00:49.060> this

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
it really easy to figure out how this

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.880 
it really easy to figure out how this
thing<00:00:49.420> works

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
thing works

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.319 
thing works

of resistance on it to help with your

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.690 
of resistance on it to help with your
mixing<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.860> you<00:01:00.309> actually<00:01:00.430> have<00:01:00.640> these

you<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.079> load<00:01:02.290> up<00:01:02.440> tracks<00:01:02.800> once<00:01:03.610> you've

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
you to load up tracks once you've

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.450 
you to load up tracks once you've
selected<00:01:03.910> them<00:01:04.269> with<00:01:04.449> this<00:01:04.570> rotary<00:01:04.869> encoder

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
selected them with this rotary encoder

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.100 
selected them with this rotary encoder
quickly<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.579> each<00:01:06.700> deck<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.570> above<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.810> we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
quickly to each deck just above that we

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.320 
quickly to each deck just above that we
have<00:01:08.140> our<00:01:08.350> headphone<00:01:08.710> cues<00:01:09.100> then<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.120> have<00:01:10.240> our

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
have our headphone cues then we have our

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.660 
have our headphone cues then we have our
filter<00:01:10.690> knob<00:01:10.840> lows<00:01:11.560> mids<00:01:12.010> and<00:01:12.130> highs<00:01:12.220> and

filter knob lows mids and highs and
these<00:01:12.850> all<00:01:13.030> actually<00:01:13.479> act<00:01:13.659> as<00:01:13.810> kills<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.440> if

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
these all actually act as kills so if

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.780 
these all actually act as kills so if
you<00:01:14.650> really<00:01:14.830> want<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.130> dial<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.400> mix<00:01:15.610> in<00:01:15.760> it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
you really want to dial that mix in it

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.580 
you really want to dial that mix in it
makes<00:01:15.970> it<00:01:16.090> really<00:01:16.270> easy<00:01:16.390> and<00:01:17.140> we<00:01:17.200> have<00:01:17.380> gain

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
out exactly like the software we've got

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.480 
out exactly like the software we've got
our<00:02:35.490> pitch<00:02:35.750> Bend<00:02:36.750> off<00:02:37.020> here<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.010> right<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
our pitch Bend off here to the right and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.980 
our pitch Bend off here to the right and
left<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.390> has<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> little<00:02:39.810> light

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
left and it actually has a little light

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.660 
left and it actually has a little light
that<00:02:40.200> locks<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.650> right<00:02:40.890> when<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.460> on

that locks in right when you get that on

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.580 
that locks in right when you get that on
the<00:02:41.850> dot<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> know<00:02:42.600> exactly<00:02:43.080> where<00:02:43.440> you're

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
the dot so you know exactly where you're

high performance definitely pro quality
but<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.450> laid<00:03:39.750> out<00:03:39.780> simply<00:03:40.440> enough<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.830> that

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
but it's laid out simply enough so that

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.199 
but it's laid out simply enough so that
the<00:03:41.220> beginners<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.730> guys<00:03:41.850> are<00:03:41.940> going<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.120> love

price<00:03:43.950> point<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.580> couple<00:03:45.060> things<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.390> note

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
price point a couple things to note

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.910 
price point a couple things to note
though<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.230> software<00:03:46.590> comes<00:03:46.830> with

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
though is that the software comes with

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.340 
though is that the software comes with
Serato<00:03:47.250> DJ<00:03:47.370> intro<00:03:47.970> only<00:03:48.300> supports<00:03:48.900> two<00:03:49.110> decks

Serato DJ intro only supports two decks

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.960 
Serato DJ intro only supports two decks

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
so you really have to get a better

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.949 
so you really have to get a better
version<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.420> sarado
