00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:27.919 
single arm motion the preparation you

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.310 
single arm motion the preparation you
took<00:00:28.189> everything<00:00:28.610> together<00:00:28.970> before<00:00:29.900> you<00:00:30.020> add

took everything together before you add
more<00:00:30.680> difficult<00:00:31.130> jumps<00:00:31.509> so<00:00:32.509> when<00:00:33.320> you're

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
thinking of jumping there's so many

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.510 
thinking of jumping there's so many
different<00:00:35.420> things<00:00:35.630> that<00:00:36.530> will<00:00:37.100> make<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:37.460> a

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
different things that will make it a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.260 
different things that will make it a
good<00:00:37.670> jump

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
good jump

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.840 
good jump
it's<00:00:38.510> not<00:00:38.870> just<00:00:39.290> about<00:00:39.470> height<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.610> so

learned from your are motions remember
to<00:01:47.179> use<00:01:47.329> them<00:01:47.569> in<00:01:47.840> your<00:01:47.869> dresses<00:01:48.350> above<00:01:48.560> your

punching your
decision<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> your<00:01:51.360> pathway<00:01:51.840> etc<00:01:52.410> they're

decision and your pathway etc they're

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.400 
decision and your pathway etc they're
all<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.520> important<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.900> let's<00:01:55.230> just

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
all very very important now let's just

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.870 
all very very important now let's just
look<00:01:55.560> at<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> couple<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.190> mistakes<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.730> people

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
look at a couple of mistakes that people

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
look at a couple of mistakes that people
usually<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.510> or<00:01:57.630> don't

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
usually do or don't

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
usually do or don't
so<00:01:58.980> if<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.190> trip<00:01:59.370> to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> slide<00:02:00.410> Wow<00:02:01.970> make<00:02:02.970> sure

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so if I trip to the slide Wow make sure

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.440 
so if I trip to the slide Wow make sure
again<00:02:03.510> you<00:02:03.870> punch<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:04.590> air<00:02:04.710> punch<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.270> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
again you punch the air punch that is

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.730 
again you punch the air punch that is
very<00:02:06.810> easy<00:02:07.230> for<00:02:07.470> people<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.070> do<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:09.740> but

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
very easy for people to do this but

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.260 
very easy for people to do this but
manner<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:12.000> depth<00:02:12.210> okay<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.670> much<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.880> air<00:02:15.030> in

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
manner in depth okay so much the air in

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.690 
manner in depth okay so much the air in
front<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.780> remember<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> position<00:02:17.030> up<00:02:18.560> but

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
front to be remember the position up but

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.450 
front to be remember the position up but
when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> go<00:02:20.940> down<00:02:21.800> try<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> keep<00:02:23.070> your<00:02:23.220> back

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
when you go down try to keep your back

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.000 
when you go down try to keep your back
straight<00:02:24.290> not<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.620> don't<00:02:25.740> work

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
straight not that they don't work

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.310 
straight not that they don't work
because<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:26.640> you're<00:02:26.790> many<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.140> if

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
because when you're many think of it if

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.880 
because when you're many think of it if
you<00:02:28.440> have<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> spring<00:02:29.300> going<00:02:30.300> straight<00:02:30.870> go<00:02:31.590> high

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
you have a spring going straight go high

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.450 
you have a spring going straight go high
