00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:49.220
 I was well on top of the stop I do not know about 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.099
 anything 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.590

00:03:52.099 --> 00:04:00.140
 up the same guy who jumped who did not 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.340
 I think I got stuck when 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.340
 the civil construction 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.450

 I'll try to make it right now, Antonio 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.150
 leaders now surround them 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.139
 interesting to go from racing to 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 ramps 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.620

 side of the stop was not pick up pick up handle 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.030
 a dwarf I believe the pelÃ© also in a 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.940
 I just got very close to this in brinks 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.970
 walks but if our goal I passed 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:40.150
 raspanete of new branch of the aim neither 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:42.700
 loss of power but it is very 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.500
 crazy human now went the other way 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.320
 Our I think I'll do it right and 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:54.940
 if you 're perfect, old jack, this is it 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:58.210
 that my car and I went quite a lot too 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:01.240
 in this race in the motherfucker in my car 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:12.010
 caught and flew and when it entered the ramp 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:16.660
 I thought I half conca trained I almost got 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:20.560
 stay on top also to win win and 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:24.400
 not our car looks like a hurricane to 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:28.630
 defeating the product doing well does not fall in 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:32.470
 building in a 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:39.040
 construction fell into the account i fell right 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:42.810
 A good ending to the car is worth it. 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:45.730
 the pity I'm making 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.470
 he needed to be upright because of the 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.910
 terminal and even because I am the error and 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.850
 mann 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.680
 but there has been very good morning here O 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:59.710
 How did I get into this race one year ago? 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.080
 eight seconds is coming 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.660
 brother but I was lucky because the law at the time 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.060
 the ramp was totally the right foot, right? 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.290
 but I spent a sliver of the building it will 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.330
 my goodness 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:18.730

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.430
 do not expect me to monitor it was 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.580

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.700
