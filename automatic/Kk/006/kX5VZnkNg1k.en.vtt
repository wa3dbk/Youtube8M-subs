with<00:00:38.180> I<00:00:38.980> don't<00:00:39.980> know<00:00:40.039> you<00:00:40.190> could<00:00:40.340> probably<00:00:40.489> do

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
with I don't know you could probably do

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.119 
with I don't know you could probably do
with<00:00:40.699> as<00:00:41.059> low<00:00:41.359> as<00:00:41.510> 12<00:00:41.840> blocks<00:00:42.140> but<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:42.649> always

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
with as low as 12 blocks but it's always

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.639 
with as low as 12 blocks but it's always
better<00:00:43.460> if<00:00:43.609> you<00:00:43.699> start<00:00:43.969> off<00:00:44.149> with<00:00:44.390> more<00:00:44.690> I<00:00:44.960> did

to start off with and depending on how
quick<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:15.530> am<00:01:15.680> we'll<00:01:16.100> see<00:01:16.310> how<00:01:16.460> long<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:17.150> takes

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
quick I am we'll see how long it takes

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.470 
quick I am we'll see how long it takes
me<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.720> actually<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.650> duplicate

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
me to actually get it to duplicate

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.380 
me to actually get it to duplicate
alright<00:01:20.480> but<00:01:21.110> basically<00:01:21.530> yeah<00:01:22.390> this

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
alright but basically yeah this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.800 
alright but basically yeah this
duplication<00:01:23.990> glitch<00:01:24.200> all<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.800> need<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.100> do<00:01:25.280> is

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
duplication glitch all you need to do is

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.760 
duplication glitch all you need to do is
keep<00:01:26.810> switching<00:01:27.440> from<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:30.230> left<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.650> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
keep switching from the left to the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.560 
keep switching from the left to the
right<00:01:30.860> when<00:01:31.370> you're<00:01:31.520> doing<00:01:31.880> cold<00:01:32.150> when<00:01:32.420> you're

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
right when you're doing cold when you're

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.540 
right when you're doing cold when you're
doing<00:01:32.870> diamonds<00:01:33.320> or<00:01:33.410> whatever<00:01:33.500> there's<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:34.010> few

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
doing diamonds or whatever there's a few

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.520 
doing diamonds or whatever there's a few
more<00:01:34.700> button<00:01:35.150> pushes<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:35.750> fault<00:01:36.020> but<00:01:36.380> you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
more button pushes and fault but you

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.110 
more button pushes and fault but you
need<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.770> be<00:01:36.800> fairly<00:01:37.130> quick<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.700> break<00:01:37.940> it

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
need to be fairly quick you break it

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.840 
need to be fairly quick you break it
down<00:01:38.240> into<00:01:38.690> the<00:01:39.320> ingots<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:39.920> then<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.610> switch

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
down into the ingots and then you switch

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.290 
down into the ingots and then you switch
back<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.150> breaking<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.960> or<00:01:42.320> making<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.340> the

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
back to breaking it or making a the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.470 
back to breaking it or making a the
blocks<00:01:44.950> alright<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.070> you<00:01:46.100> can<00:01:46.430> see<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.640> got<00:01:46.880> 17

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
blocks alright as you can see I got 17

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.000 
blocks alright as you can see I got 17
let's<00:01:47.690> see<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.020> actually<00:01:48.350> get<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.860> this

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
let's see if I can actually get it this

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:58.440 
let's see if I can actually get it this
time<00:01:54.040> there's<00:01:55.040> 18<00:01:55.670> as<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.120> can<00:01:56.240> see<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.630> worked

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
time there's 18 as you can see it worked

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.090 
time there's 18 as you can see it worked
and<00:01:59.450> again<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.960> works<00:02:00.140> with<00:02:00.440> anything<00:02:00.890> that

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
and again it works with anything that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.800 
and again it works with anything that
can<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:01.280> broken<00:02:01.700> down<00:02:03.640> worked<00:02:04.640> again<00:02:05.030> takes<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
can be broken down worked again takes a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.580 
can be broken down worked again takes a
few<00:02:05.990> times<00:02:06.290> I<00:02:07.629> wanted<00:02:08.629> to<00:02:08.899> show<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.470> you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
few times I wanted to show it to you

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.360 
few times I wanted to show it to you
with<00:02:09.940> gold<00:02:10.940> because<00:02:11.629> gold<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.980> easiest

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
with gold because gold is the easiest

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.780 
with gold because gold is the easiest
one<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.030> as<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.770> least<00:02:15.950> amount<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.400> button

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
one it as the least amount of button

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.490 
one it as the least amount of button
pushes<00:02:17.240> involved

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
pushes involved

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.170 
pushes involved
but<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:21.170> does<00:02:21.440> work<00:02:21.470> with<00:02:21.980> diamonds<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.820> you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
but it does work with diamonds and you

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.840 
but it does work with diamonds and you
just<00:02:23.360> got<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.570> be<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.920> little<00:02:24.920> bit<00:02:25.130> quicker<00:02:25.550> with

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
just got to be a little bit quicker with

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.740 
just got to be a little bit quicker with
diamonds<00:02:27.190> hair<00:02:28.190> out<00:02:28.430> I'll<00:02:28.790> start<00:02:29.060> off<00:02:29.180> with<00:02:29.420> 12

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
diamonds hair out I'll start off with 12

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.780 
diamonds hair out I'll start off with 12
diamonds<00:02:30.500> we'll<00:02:30.890> see<00:02:31.070> if<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.610> to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
diamonds we'll see if I can get it to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.260 
diamonds we'll see if I can get it to
work<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.180> 12<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:34.400> more<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.880> start

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
work with 12 the more you have to start

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.780 
work with 12 the more you have to start
off<00:02:35.480> with<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.780> better<00:02:36.140> but<00:02:36.470> again<00:02:36.920> i'm<00:02:37.580> pretty

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
off with the better but again i'm pretty

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.260 
off with the better but again i'm pretty
sure<00:02:37.970> i<00:02:38.030> got<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.330> torque<00:02:38.690> with<00:02:39.020> as<00:02:39.260> little<00:02:39.709> as<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
sure i got a torque with as little as a

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.310 
sure i got a torque with as little as a
11<00:02:41.270> blocks<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.959> said<00:02:45.170> with

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
11 blocks but as like I said with

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.260 
11 blocks but as like I said with
diamonds<00:02:45.830> there's<00:02:46.010> more<00:02:46.340> button<00:02:46.730> pushes<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
diamonds there's more button pushes and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.790 
diamonds there's more button pushes and
falls<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.959> got<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.290> be<00:02:48.380> a<00:02:48.410> little<00:02:48.620> bit

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
falls so you got to be a little bit

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.979 
falls so you got to be a little bit
quicker<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.490> here<00:02:50.090> let's<00:02:50.300> see<00:02:50.450> if<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.690> how<00:02:50.959> long

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
quicker but here let's see if I how long

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.150 
quicker but here let's see if I how long

and<00:03:57.200> then<00:03:58.190> you<00:03:58.340> want<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:59.450> blocks<00:03:59.690> that

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and then you want the the blocks that

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.810 
and then you want the the blocks that
you<00:03:59.989> want<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.230> duplicate<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.890> be<00:04:01.040> in<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.400> the

you want to duplicate to be in the the
two<00:04:02.030> left's<00:04:02.390> plot<00:04:02.630> spots<00:04:03.200> when<00:04:03.530> they<00:04:03.680> get

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
two left's plot spots when they get

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.870 
two left's plot spots when they get
broke<00:04:04.640> down<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.150> made<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:05.870> blocks<00:04:06.880> all

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
broke down and made in the blocks all

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:30.150 
broke down and made in the blocks all
right<00:04:08.090> here<00:04:08.269> we<00:04:08.329> go<00:04:08.540> try<00:04:08.870> one<00:04:09.170> more<00:04:09.410> time

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.499 

actually<00:04:31.160> think<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.580> was<00:04:31.759> thought<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> was<00:04:32.360> going

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
actually think I was thought I was going

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:50.559 
actually think I was thought I was going
to<00:04:32.630> get<00:04:32.720> at<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:32.900> time<00:04:48.639> we<00:04:49.639> go<00:04:49.849> grab<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.210> few

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
to get at that time we go grab a few

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.950 
to get at that time we go grab a few
more<00:04:50.630> blocks<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.650> know<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.639> need<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> i'm<00:04:53.660> pretty

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
more blocks I know you need a i'm pretty

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.830 
more blocks I know you need a i'm pretty
sure<00:04:54.199> it's<00:04:54.380> like<00:04:54.620> two<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:55.759> a<00:04:55.849> half<00:04:56.060> stacks<00:04:56.509> of

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
sure it's like two and a half stacks of

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.560 
sure it's like two and a half stacks of
the<00:04:56.870> ingots<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.740> actually<00:04:58.160> get<00:04:58.340> it<00:04:58.570> duplicate

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
the ingots to actually get it duplicate

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.930 
the ingots to actually get it duplicate
and<00:04:59.840> again<00:05:00.139> you<00:05:00.289> did<00:05:00.500> just<00:05:00.919> the<00:05:01.099> less<00:05:01.520> you<00:05:01.729> have

and again you did just the less you have
the<00:05:02.020> quicker<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.289> gotta<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:04.330> again<00:05:05.330> i'll

start off with the 16 and i guarantee
i'll<00:05:08.599> just<00:05:08.840> about<00:05:09.020> get<00:05:09.229> it<00:05:09.349> on<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.560> first<00:05:09.740> time

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
i'll just about get it on the first time
