00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello let's explain how the 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.410
 whatsapp andy tool of law 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.570
 protection you first thing before 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.660
 install it is verify that it connects 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.940
 correctly with itunes 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.710
 for this the mobile phone had to be 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.810
 previously used in that same 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.770
 computer or it would be necessary to introduce 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.770
 the unlock code 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.980
 let's do a test with this 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.980
 phone that has never been connected 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.329
 no no no 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.329
 when plugging it in for the first time 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.870
 There is a being that will open, he will ask us 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.300
 that we enter the code of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.790
 unlocking 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.730
 without this code it will be impossible to perform 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.300
 the communication and the tool does not 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.300
 it will work 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.180
 once introduced 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 produces the pairing and how 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.680
 you can see the top right 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.750
 there is communication 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.760
 if the phone was synchronized 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.230
 previously with that computer this 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.230
 process is not necessary 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.240
 once it has been verified because the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.600
 mobile phone is able to connect 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 correctly with itunes we are going to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.869
 proceed to download 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.020
 anti law protection for this we are going to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.120
 the tab 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.590
 of the utility 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 within the global 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.150
 once downloaded 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.150
 we run the installer 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.970
 so that guasave delay protection tool 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.459
 work properly is necessary 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.330
 have the dot net framework 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.330
 installed 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.170
 once sixth and installed one will appear 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.730
 in the post no 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.730
 within all the programs 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.530
 as you can see you do not get 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.880
 no message for anti law app 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.180
 protection tool work properly 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.840
 It is necessary to acquire a license to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.840
 each terminal 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.940
 to buy a license 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.100
 you have to go to the licensing tab of 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.100
 the recovery sets website dotcom 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.150
 a button appears at the bottom of the page 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.150
 to acquire it 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.140
 once the form is completed 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.819
 We will receive an email with the 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.140
 serial number to be entered 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.140
 in the utility 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.890
 this number 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.310
 you have to add it inside the section 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.310
 licenses 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.440
 once we have it, you just have to 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.210
 press on the protect button 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.280
 the first time the button is pressed 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.430
 protect and a new one has been added 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.270
 This license will be associated to the email of the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.270
 mobile phone 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.989
 a window will appear informing that the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.550
 process has been successfully completed and 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.670
 from this moment they will be able 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.690
 visualize all messages 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.690
 on the mobile 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.929
 the protection has already been applied 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:39.529
 therefore from this moment 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:43.069
 Any message removed from the mobile 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:47.490
 can be recovered 100% of the 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:50.759
 messages will be recovered 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.970
 he has installed the protection and before 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:58.130
 that it can be applied is necessary 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.130
 turn the phone off and on 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.830
 or not 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.810
 once the mobile has restarted 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.080
 the protection will be enabled 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.229
 let's try to eliminate some messages from 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.229
 test 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.340
 the messages have been deleted 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:16.290
 normally the mobile phone does not 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.290
 show any kind of notice 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.080
 ah 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.080
 if we reconnect the mobile phone 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.270
 to the application 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.610
 we can see how in the tab 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:40.000
 deleted messages appear the new ones 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.640
 deleted messages 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.530
 in this tab you can see the date in 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.650
 which has received the message and the 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.520
 date on which the message was deleted 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.520
 in addition to its content 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.740
