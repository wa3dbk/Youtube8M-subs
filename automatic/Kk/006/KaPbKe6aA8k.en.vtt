00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.629
 today we are going to talk about how to choose 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.860
 running shoes and for that we 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.590
 we have come to one of the stores 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.690
 historical to bikila in this case watches 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.080
 de las rozas so it's a paradise for 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.080
 the runners 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.000
 good we are with brown ricardo that 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.250
 besides being responsible for this 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.900
 bikila shop in the rozas and a 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.849
 spectacular athletic record has been 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
 champion of marathon spain twice 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.170
 among other things the 15 so a 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.510
 little slippers truly a 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.040
 little good I always defended that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.629
 the shoes are the most 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.309
 important of an athlete's kit 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.030
 agrees completely in agreement 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.010
 the shoe is the essential tool 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.620
 of the choice of the shoes is 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.600
 fundamental 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.820
 with a good sneaker and sometimes because 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.469
 Running is an impact sport 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.989
 we already have risk to injure them 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.449
 answer imagine if the shoe does not 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.630
 the percentage of risk is adequate 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.860
 increases considerably but if 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.060
 someone comes to buy some sneakers 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.729
 which is the first thing that has to be 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.350
 fix the most important thing is the kind of 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.600
 support that the broker has the type of 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.600
 tread yes and what types of pixar are there 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.700
 you know we are established 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.430
 there is a graduation that way option 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 of degrees kelvin which is the one that indicates the 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.090
 production level of the corridor for 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.740
 then depending on the type of degree 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.110
 of programming because you can 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.090
 recommend a sneaker or other 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.210
 the types of shoes are basically 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.930
 three other 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.940
 but they really are two funds that 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.830
 brands commercially called sneaker 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.490
 neutral which is what is called training 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.150
 natural 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 and then for there types of testers and 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.479
 more important 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.909
 because sneakers for your viewers do not 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.270
 they are made because there are between 1 and 2% of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.710
 the population and it's not profitable 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.439
 games for this type of runners 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.869
 very well and the runner who comes here does not 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.250
 know if he is a taker his neutral opinion 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.710
 what does 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.800
 we have a program a machine 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.920
 what does 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.840
 d 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.050
 and what basically does this mean that 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.209
 consists of first what we do with 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.250
 a scanner scan the foot to see how 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.900
 weights are distributed the support on the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.650
 on foot and then another after another 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.600
 option what is calculated calculating the 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.850
 pronation angle in ice cream people 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.660
 do and I guess that depending on the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.660
 result that tve 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.930
 recommend a type of serradilla because 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.459
 all right 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.290
 so let's talk now about the second 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.909
 condition when looking for sneakers 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.250
 is the weight of the runner very I was the weight 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.870
 when choosing a sneaker 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.190
 to see the weight of the runner influences 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.980
 enough for 222 aspects 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.720
 the first by him 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.060
 the kind of cushioning you need 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.530
 with putting together a runner it's heavier what 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.430
 what you need is much much greater 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.859
 absorption of impact 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.109
 then to greater greater weight 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.420
 cushioning and also more money than 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.579
 you have to spend but what's important 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.950
 it's important and then later also 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.069
 because the weight also influences a lot in 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 the behavior of the foot and it is also 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.709
 important you have told us before 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.269
 how much are we going to wear the shoes 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.239
 effectively how does that affect then look 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.549
 the needs that it has are not the same 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.299
 a casual runner who with once a 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.280
 week 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.359
 what he does as an active back is a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.860
 complement to other activities 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.930
 sports as well as the gym 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.329
 the sport you make 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.099
 the runner who is a habitual runner 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.819
 and train every day of the 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.790
 week 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:50.160
 because there his the needs of 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.620
 cushioning are also different 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.060
 and the million dollar question how long they last 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.940
 some shoes to see 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.630
 we make average estimates of 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 the experience that we carry in this one 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.780
 Sneaker usually last around about 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.780
 1000 kilometers 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.359
 and Run 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.639
 the athlete what is clear is that what 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.709
 we do not recommend shoes from this one 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.709
 but be united we kneel of two 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.930
 years of agreement because although he runs to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.190
 Little did I start to relax in a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.720
 documentation that hit all the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.570
 world is that the shoe in the closet 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.910
 it spoils 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.580
 in a lot of brands that are reliable and 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.440
 that we can recommend to our 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.600
 users obviously we have 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.390
 we work the most important brands 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.360
 sabinas nike and mizuno asics 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.220
 saucony brooks say many brands and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.370
 All brands have shoes 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.530
 great quality what happens then 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.450
 we look at the needs 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.880
 having each rider and always 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.260
 We offer four or five models for 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.580
 that the client tries them and then they 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.170
 take the model with the one that is more 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.830
 comfortable 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.830
 perfect many 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.440
 the shoes is the most 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.140
 important of the equipment of a runner 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.960
 they have to be good and also have to 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.980
 be appropriate to our way of running 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.410
 remember the advice to Saturday Ricardo 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.930
 we have to take into account how 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.730
 we step on how much we think and the use that 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.290
 let's make the shoes and then a 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.090
 person like him can help us 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.090
 choose the most appropriate shoes
