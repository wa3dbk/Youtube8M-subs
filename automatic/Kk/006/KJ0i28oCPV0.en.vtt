polygon<00:02:15.980> issue<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:17.300> little<00:02:17.870> bit<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.350> as<00:02:18.500> much

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
polygon issue a little bit not as much

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.950 
polygon issue a little bit not as much
as<00:02:18.830> you<00:02:18.950> think<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.550> look<00:02:20.060> on<00:02:20.240> this<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.600> g-guard

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
as you think you look on this in g-guard

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.090 
as you think you look on this in g-guard
it's<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.350> freaking<00:02:21.860> out<00:02:21.950> over<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.460> I<00:02:24.100> can

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
it's like freaking out over here I can

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.030 
it's like freaking out over here I can
see<00:02:25.280> that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.059 

it's<00:02:32.040> not<00:02:32.280> something<00:02:32.900> common<00:02:33.900> well<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> mean<00:02:34.769> I

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
it's not something common well I mean I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.250 
it's not something common well I mean I
won<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.790> was<00:02:35.879> causing<00:02:36.150> it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
won and it was causing it

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.570 
won and it was causing it
I<00:02:40.050> noticed<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.110> 720p<00:02:41.920> does<00:02:42.129> play<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.430> lot

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
I noticed that 720p does play a lot

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.070 
I noticed that 720p does play a lot
smoother<00:02:42.909> so<00:02:43.209> if<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.480> want<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.690> dumb<00:02:43.870> those

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
smoother so if you want to dumb those

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.490 
smoother so if you want to dumb those
graphics<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.980> 720p<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.870> still<00:02:47.260> plays

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
graphics down to 720p it still plays

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.619 
graphics down to 720p it still plays
perfect<00:02:48.040> I'm<00:02:48.519> going<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.940> show<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.180> guys<00:02:49.330> here

perfect I'm going to show you guys here
in<00:02:49.750> just<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.049> second<00:02:51.569> no<00:02:52.569> issues<00:02:53.379> I've<00:02:53.530> tried

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
in just a second no issues I've tried

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.210 
in just a second no issues I've tried
lowering<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:55.319> graphics<00:02:56.319> down<00:02:56.590> I've<00:02:56.920> tried

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
lowering the graphics down I've tried

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.430 
lowering the graphics down I've tried
pretty<00:02:58.120> much<00:02:58.209> everything<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.930> try<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> get

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
pretty much everything to try to get

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
pretty much everything to try to get
those<00:02:59.560> issues<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.489> away<00:03:00.610> but<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.030> haven't

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
those issues to go away but I haven't

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.949 
those issues to go away but I haven't
really<00:03:01.569> found<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.959> good<00:03:02.410> fix<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.780> putting<00:03:04.780> it

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
really found a good fix so putting it

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.640 
really found a good fix so putting it
down<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.170> 720p<00:03:07.500> let's<00:03:08.500> see<00:03:08.680> here<00:03:10.650> tried

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
down to 720p let's see here tried

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.020 
down to 720p let's see here tried
lowering<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.099> level<00:03:12.370> of<00:03:12.459> detail<00:03:12.819> down

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
lowering the level of detail down

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.500 
lowering the level of detail down
doesn't<00:03:13.870> really<00:03:14.430> do<00:03:15.430> anything<00:03:15.670> extra<00:03:16.239> you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
doesn't really do anything extra you

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.869 
doesn't really do anything extra you
still<00:03:17.109> see<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> glitching<00:03:17.859> you<00:03:18.459> still<00:03:18.700> see

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879

that's my review I'll make another one

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.560 
that's my review I'll make another one
of<00:04:13.370> these<00:04:13.430> reviews<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.180> looks<00:04:14.330> like<00:04:14.450> it'd

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
of these reviews so it looks like it'd

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.979 
of these reviews so it looks like it'd
be<00:04:14.750> 256<00:04:15.530> gigabyte<00:04:15.950> model<00:04:16.600> also<00:04:17.600> I'm<00:04:17.780> going<00:04:17.930> to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
be 256 gigabyte model also I'm going to

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.870
