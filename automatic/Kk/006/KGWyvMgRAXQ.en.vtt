see there in that jar and it's ready to

see there in that jar and it's ready to
use

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

here<00:01:02.260> I'm<00:01:02.379> using<00:01:02.590> it<00:01:02.800> on<00:01:02.920> ingrain<00:01:03.519> and<00:01:03.789> I<00:01:04.089> know

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
here I'm using it on ingrain and I know

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.359 
here I'm using it on ingrain and I know
ingrain<00:01:04.720> doesn't<00:01:05.080> hold<00:01:05.379> flu<00:01:05.890> well<00:01:06.070> but<00:01:06.250> this

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
ingrain doesn't hold flu well but this

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.980 
ingrain doesn't hold flu well but this
was<00:01:06.520> just<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.820> test<00:01:07.060> I've<00:01:07.300> never<00:01:07.539> used<00:01:07.750> height

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
was just a test I've never used height

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.960 
was just a test I've never used height
glue<00:01:08.259> on<00:01:08.530> ingrain<00:01:09.100> before<00:01:09.429> I<00:01:09.460> wanted<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.820> see

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
glue on ingrain before I wanted to see

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.139 
glue on ingrain before I wanted to see
how<00:01:10.090> well<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.390> would<00:01:10.450> work<00:01:10.660> and<00:01:11.940> pretty<00:01:12.940> much

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
how well it would work and pretty much

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.670 
how well it would work and pretty much
just<00:01:13.210> like<00:01:13.600> any<00:01:13.810> other<00:01:13.960> glue<00:01:14.289> it<00:01:14.590> just<00:01:14.979> doesn't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just like any other glue it just doesn't

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.840 
just like any other glue it just doesn't
ingrain<00:01:17.680> just<00:01:17.920> soaks<00:01:18.159> in<00:01:18.340> too<00:01:18.490> much<00:01:18.640> it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
ingrain just soaks in too much it

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.460 
ingrain just soaks in too much it
doesn't<00:01:19.150> have<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> good<00:01:19.960> bond<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.110> here<00:01:23.320> I've

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
doesn't have a good bond so here I've

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.940 
doesn't have a good bond so here I've
got<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:23.680> pretty<00:01:24.040> well<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.490> all<00:01:24.610> tacked<00:01:25.030> up

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
got it pretty well it's all tacked up

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
got it pretty well it's all tacked up
hide<00:01:26.950> glue<00:01:27.159> sets<00:01:27.880> really<00:01:28.240> quick<00:01:28.570> you'll<00:01:28.750> have

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
hide glue sets really quick you'll have

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.840 
hide glue sets really quick you'll have
a<00:01:28.960> minute<00:01:29.290> or<00:01:29.380> two<00:01:29.530> to<00:01:29.560> get<00:01:30.310> your<00:01:30.490> joints

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
a minute or two to get your joints

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.899 
a minute or two to get your joints
together<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.439> it's<00:01:32.680> kind<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.130> nerve-wracking

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
together so it's kind of nerve-wracking

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
together so it's kind of nerve-wracking
to<00:01:34.030> do<00:01:34.180> it<00:01:34.390> on<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:35.079> say<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.070> dovetail<00:01:36.490> case<00:01:36.970> or

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to do it on a say a dovetail case or

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.390 
to do it on a say a dovetail case or
something<00:01:38.409> of<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.560> nature<00:01:38.680> where<00:01:39.159> you<00:01:39.250> have

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
something of that nature where you have

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.899 
something of that nature where you have
a<00:01:40.619> little<00:01:41.619> bit<00:01:41.799> longer<00:01:42.070> time<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.759> need

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
a little bit longer time that you need

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.039 
a little bit longer time that you need
to<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.649> joint<00:01:44.950> set<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:46.630> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.869> see

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
to get the joint set there you can see

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.600 
to get the joint set there you can see
the<00:01:47.170> joint<00:01:47.409> just<00:01:47.590> fell<00:01:47.860> apart<00:01:47.950> was<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:48.490> some

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
the joint just fell apart was just some

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.639 
the joint just fell apart was just some
shaking<00:01:49.030> now<00:01:49.720> I'm<00:01:49.810> going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> try<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.290> edge<00:01:50.439> to

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
shaking now I'm going to try and edge to

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.039 
shaking now I'm going to try and edge to
edge<00:01:50.799> with<00:01:51.520> joint<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.390> what<00:01:52.509> I'm<00:01:52.600> doing<00:01:52.899> here

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
edge with joint and what I'm doing here

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.630 
edge with joint and what I'm doing here
is<00:01:53.110> just<00:01:53.229> heating<00:01:53.530> up<00:01:53.680> one<00:01:53.890> surface<00:01:54.189> this<00:01:54.490> will

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
is just heating up one surface this will

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.160 
is just heating up one surface this will
give<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.939> little<00:01:55.149> bit<00:01:55.299> longer<00:01:55.509> open<00:01:55.930> time

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
give you a little bit longer open time

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.719 
give you a little bit longer open time
it<00:01:56.619> may<00:01:56.740> give<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.159> an<00:01:57.280> extra<00:01:57.670> minute<00:01:57.820> or<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.299> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it may give you an extra minute or so of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.480 
it may give you an extra minute or so of
initial<00:02:00.729> tack<00:02:00.939> time<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.630> hide<00:02:01.810> glue<00:02:04.350> just

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
initial tack time of the hide glue just

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.980 
initial tack time of the hide glue just
consistently<00:02:06.490> try<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.909> keep<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.420> light<00:02:07.780> blue

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
consistently try to keep the light blue

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.009 
consistently try to keep the light blue
stirred<00:02:08.320> up<00:02:08.560> so<00:02:08.920> that<00:02:09.100> it's<00:02:09.220> all<00:02:09.489> nice<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
stirred up so that it's all nice and

stirred up so that it's all nice and
smooth<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.200> creamy<00:02:12.209> then<00:02:13.209> you<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.570> wipe<00:02:13.810> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
smooth and creamy then you just wipe it

smooth and creamy then you just wipe it
on<00:02:14.049> I'm<00:02:14.260> using<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.680> an<00:02:14.829> old<00:02:15.100> toothbrush<00:02:15.700> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
on I'm using just an old toothbrush it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.349 
on I'm using just an old toothbrush it
works<00:02:16.299> pretty<00:02:16.510> good<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.180> here

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
works pretty good for this and here

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.789 
works pretty good for this and here
which<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.630> finger<00:02:19.900> pressure<00:02:20.139> you<00:02:20.380> can<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.650> I'm

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
which is finger pressure you can see I'm

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.530 
which is finger pressure you can see I'm
just<00:02:20.829> holding<00:02:21.639> it<00:02:21.699> together<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.120> squeezing

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
just holding it together and squeezing

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.290 
just holding it together and squeezing
it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
it

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.110 
it
doing<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.200> just<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.620> couple<00:02:24.890> minutes

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
doing this just for a couple minutes

doing this just for a couple minutes
this<00:02:26.120> glue<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.080> much<00:02:27.230> different<00:02:27.590> than

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
this glue is so much different than

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.090 
this glue is so much different than
yellow<00:02:27.890> glue<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:29.170> mean<00:02:30.170> yellow<00:02:30.440> glue<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:30.950> have

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
yellow glue I mean yellow glue you have

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.970 
yellow glue I mean yellow glue you have
to<00:02:31.250> put<00:02:31.490> a<00:02:31.730> ton<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.390> pressure<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.650> make<00:02:33.830> sure

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
to put a ton of pressure on to make sure

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.640 
to put a ton of pressure on to make sure
the<00:02:34.310> glue<00:02:34.750> squeezes<00:02:35.750> into<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.140> fibers<00:02:36.500> of<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the glue squeezes into the fibers of the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.970 
the glue squeezes into the fibers of the
wood<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.220> sets<00:02:37.780> where<00:02:38.780> hide<00:02:39.080> glue<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.710> just

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
now we're going to see how well it held

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.210 
now we're going to see how well it held
pretty<00:03:11.990> good<00:03:12.200> slam<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.650> down<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.920> workbench

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
pretty good slam it down the workbench

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
isn't doing it forcing the pressure and

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.200 
isn't doing it forcing the pressure and
the<00:03:17.390> center<00:03:17.810> isn't<00:03:18.080> doing<00:03:18.290> it<00:03:19.150> pounded<00:03:20.150> on

the center isn't doing it pounded on
it's<00:03:20.420> not<00:03:20.570> doing<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.020> I'd<00:03:21.920> say<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.730> five

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
it's not doing it I'd say in five

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.000 
it's not doing it I'd say in five
minutes<00:03:23.450> set<00:03:23.810> time<00:03:24.050> which<00:03:24.500> is<00:03:24.680> finger

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
minutes set time which is finger

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.479 
minutes set time which is finger
pressure<00:03:25.220> that's<00:03:26.090> pretty<00:03:26.360> good<00:03:27.250> now<00:03:28.250> one<00:03:28.459> of

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
pressure that's pretty good now one of

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.900 
pressure that's pretty good now one of
the<00:03:28.610> main<00:03:29.090> benefits<00:03:29.330> of<00:03:29.840> hide<00:03:30.080> glue<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.910> it's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the main benefits of hide glue is it's

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.140 
the main benefits of hide glue is it's
repairable<00:03:32.450> meaning<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.760> heat<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
repairable meaning you can heat the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.930 
repairable meaning you can heat the
joint<00:03:35.590> with<00:03:36.590> either<00:03:36.800> steam<00:03:37.190> or<00:03:37.580> like<00:03:37.790> I'm

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
joint with either steam or like I'm

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.120 
joint with either steam or like I'm
showing<00:03:38.239> here<00:03:38.570> just<00:03:38.989> with<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.170> heat<00:03:39.380> gun<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.890> it

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
showing here just with a heat gun and it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.680 
showing here just with a heat gun and it
will<00:03:40.280> release<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.760> glue<00:03:40.940> it'll<00:03:41.270> melt<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
will release the glue it'll melt the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.050 
will release the glue it'll melt the
glue<00:03:41.900> basically<00:03:42.380> back<00:03:42.590> down<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:43.880> it's

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
glue basically back down so that it's

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.540 
glue basically back down so that it's
pliable<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.810> you<00:03:45.620> can<00:03:45.800> force<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.310> joint

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
pliable and you can force the joint

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.729 
pliable and you can force the joint
apart<00:03:49.360> now<00:03:50.360> after<00:03:50.600> just<00:03:50.720> five<00:03:50.989> or<00:03:51.020> six<00:03:51.410> minutes

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
apart now after just five or six minutes

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.610 
apart now after just five or six minutes
of<00:03:51.860> setting<00:03:52.190> in<00:03:52.280> here<00:03:53.050> that's<00:03:54.050> got<00:03:54.320> a<00:03:54.350> pretty

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
of setting in here that's got a pretty

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.280 
of setting in here that's got a pretty
good<00:03:54.739> strong<00:03:55.100> tact<00:03:55.400> imagine<00:03:56.330> 20<00:03:56.660> or<00:03:56.810> 30<00:03:56.989> years

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
good strong tact imagine 20 or 30 years

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.260 
good strong tact imagine 20 or 30 years
from<00:03:57.440> now<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.890> going<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.580> even<00:03:58.790> be<00:03:58.910> harder

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
from now it's going to even be harder

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.640 
from now it's going to even be harder
and<00:03:59.450> better<00:04:00.350> joint<00:04:01.690> that's<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.930> main<00:04:03.140> benefit

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
and better joint that's the main benefit

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.949 
and better joint that's the main benefit
of<00:04:03.800> hide<00:04:04.430> glue<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.790> my<00:04:04.820> opinion<00:04:05.330> now<00:04:05.630> with<00:04:05.780> just

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
of hide glue in my opinion now with just

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.479 
of hide glue in my opinion now with just
some<00:04:06.080> finger<00:04:06.320> pressure<00:04:06.590> here<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:06.890> can<00:04:07.160> pop<00:04:07.340> the

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
some finger pressure here I can pop the

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.199 
some finger pressure here I can pop the
joint<00:04:07.700> loose<00:04:09.430> repair<00:04:10.430> what<00:04:10.670> do<00:04:10.850> whatever<00:04:11.000> I

in my opinion hide glue is repairable
and<00:04:59.070> fixable<00:05:00.070> versus<00:05:00.940> yellow<00:05:01.210> glues<00:05:01.540> where

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
and fixable versus yellow glues where

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.010 
and fixable versus yellow glues where
you<00:05:02.320> destroy<00:05:02.920> a<00:05:02.950> joint<00:05:03.430> or<00:05:03.700> break<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:04.780> part

out and it and you can fix it that is a

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.540 
out and it and you can fix it that is a
credible<00:05:19.690> thing<00:05:20.020> for<00:05:20.350> you<00:05:21.070> know<00:05:21.190> future

generations my choice from now on will
probably<00:05:25.060> be<00:05:25.150> hide<00:05:25.480> glue<00:05:25.720> for<00:05:26.080> just<00:05:26.230> about

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
probably be hide glue for just about

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.650 
probably be hide glue for just about
everything
