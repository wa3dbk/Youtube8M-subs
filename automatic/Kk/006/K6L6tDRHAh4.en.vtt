hey<00:00:21.199> guys<00:00:21.470> um<00:00:21.800> I<00:00:22.400> just<00:00:22.670> wanted<00:00:22.849> to<00:00:22.939> make

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
hey guys um I just wanted to make

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.029 
hey guys um I just wanted to make
another<00:00:23.210> video<00:00:23.630> to<00:00:23.750> show<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.470> processing

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
another video to show the processing

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.100 
another video to show the processing
power<00:00:25.250> of<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.580> AMD<00:00:26.359> phenom<00:00:26.689> ii<00:00:26.930> x4<00:00:27.460> 940

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
power of the AMD phenom ii x4 940

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.330 
power of the AMD phenom ii x4 940
somebody<00:00:30.110> posted<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.500> comment<00:00:30.710> on<00:00:30.949> my<00:00:31.070> video

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
somebody posted a comment on my video

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.010 
somebody posted a comment on my video
and<00:00:31.369> wanted<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.730> see<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.480> processing

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
and wanted to see the processing

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.080 
and wanted to see the processing
potential<00:00:33.500> of<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.710> processor<00:00:34.309> pushed<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.059> its

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
potential of the processor pushed to its

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.850 
potential of the processor pushed to its
max<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:35.780> i'm<00:00:36.020> just<00:00:36.080> gonna<00:00:36.230> run<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.470> few<00:00:36.680> programs

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
max so i'm just gonna run a few programs

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.369 
max so i'm just gonna run a few programs
here<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.670> show<00:00:37.850> that<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.750> first<00:00:38.930> program<00:00:39.110> that

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
here to show that the first program that

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:40.960 
here to show that the first program that
I'm<00:00:39.470> gonna<00:00:39.559> run<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:39.980> called<00:00:40.190> folding<00:00:40.640> at<00:00:40.760> home

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
I'm gonna run is called folding at home

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.590 
I'm gonna run is called folding at home
and<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.720> simulates<00:00:42.650> protein<00:00:43.339> folding<00:00:43.790> so<00:00:44.449> it

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
and it simulates protein folding so it

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.899 
and it simulates protein folding so it
pushes<00:00:44.809> all<00:00:45.199> the<00:00:45.440> cores<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> processor<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.879> a

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
pushes all the cores on a processor to a

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.840 
pushes all the cores on a processor to a
hundred<00:00:47.390> percent<00:00:47.480> utilization<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.850> that's

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
hundred percent utilization and that's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.979 
hundred percent utilization and that's
the<00:00:49.940> first<00:00:50.150> program<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:50.449> I'm<00:00:50.570> going<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.750> run

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
the first program that I'm going to run

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.229 
the first program that I'm going to run
so<00:00:51.140> before<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:51.739> run<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.070> I'm<00:00:52.790> just<00:00:52.940> gonna<00:00:53.030> run

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
so before I run that I'm just gonna run

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.570 
so before I run that I'm just gonna run
task<00:00:53.449> manager<00:00:53.780> here<00:00:54.070> to<00:00:55.070> show<00:00:55.250> the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
task manager here to show the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.789 
task manager here to show the
utilization<00:00:55.940> right<00:00:56.269> now<00:00:56.390> on<00:00:56.510> idle<00:00:56.839> it's<00:00:57.409> it's

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
utilization right now on idle it's it's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.429 
utilization right now on idle it's it's
reading<00:00:58.580> one<00:00:58.790> four<00:00:59.210> percent<00:00:59.629> around<00:00:59.960> there<00:01:00.140> so

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:00.439 
reading one four percent around there so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.590 
reading one four percent around there so
you're<00:01:00.949> getting<00:01:01.189> no<00:01:01.309> utilization<00:01:02.089> because

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
you're getting no utilization because

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.700 
you're getting no utilization because
I'm<00:01:02.689> not<00:01:02.780> doing<00:01:02.900> anything<00:01:03.199> right<00:01:03.350> now

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
I'm not doing anything right now

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.789 
I'm not doing anything right now
so<00:01:04.189> I'm<00:01:04.280> gonna<00:01:04.430> run<00:01:04.580> folding<00:01:04.970> at<00:01:05.030> home<00:01:05.239> and<00:01:05.799> you

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
so I'm gonna run folding at home and you

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.880 
so I'm gonna run folding at home and you
can<00:01:06.920> see<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.280> processing<00:01:08.200> jump<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.409> a<00:01:09.439> hundred

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
can see the processing jump to a hundred

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.480 
can see the processing jump to a hundred
percent<00:01:10.010> on<00:01:10.460> each<00:01:10.880> core<00:01:11.860> that's<00:01:12.860> unfolding<00:01:13.250> at

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
percent on each core that's unfolding at

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.310 
percent on each core that's unfolding at
home<00:01:13.640> starts<00:01:14.000> up<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.080> it's<00:01:15.290> starting<00:01:15.650> up<00:01:15.740> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
home starts up so it's starting up and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.020 
home starts up so it's starting up and
after<00:01:18.320> this<00:01:18.470> starts<00:01:19.340> off<00:01:19.460> I'm<00:01:19.640> gonna<00:01:19.790> run<00:01:20.000> a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
after this starts off I'm gonna run a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.020 
after this starts off I'm gonna run a
few<00:01:20.299> other<00:01:20.450> programs<00:01:20.659> to<00:01:21.320> show<00:01:21.549> that<00:01:22.549> even<00:01:22.820> at

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
few other programs to show that even at

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.819 
few other programs to show that even at
100<00:01:23.390> percent<00:01:23.450> utilization<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.350> processor

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
100 percent utilization the processor

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.310 
100 percent utilization the processor
can<00:01:24.979> still<00:01:25.219> run<00:01:25.399> many<00:01:25.939> other<00:01:26.210> programs<00:01:26.659> so

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
can still run many other programs so

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.989 
can still run many other programs so
here<00:01:27.740> we<00:01:27.829> go<00:01:27.950> falling<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.399> home<00:01:28.549> started

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:28.999 
here we go falling at home started

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.889 
here we go falling at home started
processing<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.820> well<00:01:31.820> immediately<00:01:32.329> the

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
processing and well immediately the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.419 
processing and well immediately the
processors<00:01:33.560> shoot<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.100> hundred<00:01:34.340> percent

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
processors shoot up to a hundred percent

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.980 
processors shoot up to a hundred percent
so<00:01:34.789> everything<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.270> running<00:01:35.479> at<00:01:35.659> peak<00:01:35.810> power

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
so everything is running at peak power

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.069 
so everything is running at peak power
right<00:01:36.229> now<00:01:36.259> 100<00:01:37.159> percent<00:01:37.460> my<00:01:38.329> fan<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.929> even

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
right now 100 percent my fan I can even

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.149 
right now 100 percent my fan I can even
hear<00:01:39.200> my<00:01:39.319> friend<00:01:39.590> getting<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:40.009> bit

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
hear my friend getting a little bit

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:40.510 
hear my friend getting a little bit
louder

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
louder

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.149 
louder
but<00:01:41.329> um<00:01:41.569> yes<00:01:41.929> folding<00:01:42.439> at<00:01:42.499> home<00:01:42.649> is<00:01:42.770> started

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
but um yes folding at home is started

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.739 
but um yes folding at home is started
and<00:01:43.340> everything<00:01:43.819> is<00:01:44.030> running<00:01:44.210> at<00:01:44.509> peak

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
and everything is running at peak

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.929 
and everything is running at peak
processing<00:01:45.289> power<00:01:45.499> so<00:01:45.770> right<00:01:46.609> now<00:01:46.759> I'm<00:01:46.850> just

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
processing power so right now I'm just

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.529 
processing power so right now I'm just
gonna<00:01:47.090> run<00:01:47.299> some<00:01:47.450> other<00:01:47.600> programs<00:01:49.359> start<00:01:50.359> off

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
gonna run some other programs start off

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.179 
gonna run some other programs start off
real<00:01:50.960> quick<00:01:51.200> I'm<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:51.469> gonna<00:01:51.619> run<00:01:51.740> Photoshop

off<00:05:04.560> these<00:05:04.740> videos<00:05:05.270> so<00:05:06.620> as<00:05:07.640> you<00:05:08.640> can<00:05:08.730> see<00:05:08.790> with

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
off these videos so as you can see with

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.330 
off these videos so as you can see with
running<00:05:09.480> folding<00:05:09.810> at<00:05:09.870> home<00:05:10.190> which<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.220> a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
running folding at home which is a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.910 
running folding at home which is a
folding<00:05:12.090> program<00:05:12.780> for<00:05:13.020> folding<00:05:13.410> protein

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
folding program for folding protein

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.830 
folding program for folding protein
signaling<00:05:14.400> proteins<00:05:14.790> in<00:05:15.180> fact<00:05:15.390> I'm<00:05:15.480> gonna<00:05:15.660> run

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
signaling proteins in fact I'm gonna run

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.690 
signaling proteins in fact I'm gonna run
another<00:05:16.020> one<00:05:16.170> there's<00:05:17.070> something<00:05:17.550> called

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
another one there's something called

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.820 
another one there's something called
folding<00:05:18.120> at<00:05:18.210> home<00:05:18.360> for<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.630> GPU<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.590> I'm<00:05:19.710> gonna

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
folding at home for the GPU so I'm gonna

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.980 
folding at home for the GPU so I'm gonna
run<00:05:20.040> that<00:05:20.190> one<00:05:20.430> and<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.150> one<00:05:21.330> is<00:05:21.780> going<00:05:21.840> to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
run that one and that one is going to

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.810 
run that one and that one is going to
run<00:05:22.140> on<00:05:22.260> my<00:05:22.350> graphics<00:05:22.740> card<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:23.160> I'll<00:05:23.370> run<00:05:23.550> both

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
run on my graphics card so I'll run both

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.200 
run on my graphics card so I'll run both
of<00:05:24.060> them<00:05:24.240> at<00:05:24.840> once<00:05:24.870> and<00:05:25.910> that's<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.150> to

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
of them at once and that's going to

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.420 
of them at once and that's going to
really<00:05:27.420> take<00:05:27.660> a<00:05:27.720> lot<00:05:27.930> of<00:05:28.080> CPU<00:05:28.530> usage<00:05:28.560> because

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
really take a lot of CPU usage because

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.410 
really take a lot of CPU usage because
they're<00:05:30.330> folding<00:05:30.690> at<00:05:30.780> home<00:05:30.900> GPU<00:05:31.290> client<00:05:31.650> also

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:32.420 
they're folding at home GPU client also

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.020 
they're folding at home GPU client also
requires<00:05:33.420> a<00:05:33.570> CPU<00:05:34.230> processing<00:05:34.770> power<00:05:35.100> let<00:05:35.940> me

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
requires a CPU processing power let me

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.730 
requires a CPU processing power let me
see<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.420> don't<00:05:36.510> know<00:05:36.660> if<00:05:36.720> it<00:05:36.840> started<00:05:37.260> yet<00:05:39.740> okay

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
see I don't know if it started yet okay

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.250 
see I don't know if it started yet okay
there<00:05:40.890> we<00:05:40.980> go<00:05:41.010> so<00:05:41.340> I'm<00:05:41.790> folding<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.600> protein<00:05:43.140> on

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
there we go so I'm folding a protein on

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.570 
there we go so I'm folding a protein on
my<00:05:43.470> GPU<00:05:44.010> right<00:05:44.400> now<00:05:44.550> as<00:05:44.880> well<00:05:45.300> as<00:05:45.480> the<00:05:45.630> CPU<00:05:46.140> and

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
my GPU right now as well as the CPU and

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.090 
my GPU right now as well as the CPU and
this<00:05:47.580> takes<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:48.000> lot<00:05:48.240> of<00:05:48.300> processing<00:05:48.660> power<00:05:49.100> but

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
this takes a lot of processing power but

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.270 
this takes a lot of processing power but
the<00:05:50.610> Phenom<00:05:51.090> 2<00:05:51.480> handles<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.230> just<00:05:52.260> fine<00:05:52.710> in

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
the Phenom 2 handles it just fine in

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.070 
the Phenom 2 handles it just fine in
fact<00:05:53.490> when<00:05:53.640> we<00:05:53.670> try<00:05:53.850> to<00:05:53.880> play<00:05:54.180> a<00:05:54.210> high

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
going on as you can see this one runs

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.770 
going on as you can see this one runs
fine<00:06:09.180> as<00:06:09.330> well<00:06:09.510> so<00:06:10.260> I'm<00:06:10.770> running<00:06:11.510> you<00:06:12.510> can<00:06:12.660> run

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
fine as well so I'm running you can run

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.180 
fine as well so I'm running you can run
a<00:06:12.810> lot<00:06:13.020> of<00:06:13.170> things<00:06:13.350> with<00:06:13.530> this<00:06:13.680> processor<00:06:14.160> I

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
a lot of things with this processor I

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.330 
a lot of things with this processor I
don't<00:06:14.400> have<00:06:14.550> no<00:06:14.730> trouble<00:06:15.060> with<00:06:15.390> any<00:06:15.570> of<00:06:15.690> it

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
don't have no trouble with any of it

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.760 
don't have no trouble with any of it
mostly<00:06:17.340> because<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:18.630> processor<00:06:19.170> is<00:06:19.470> quad

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
mostly because the processor is quad

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.010 
mostly because the processor is quad
core<00:06:20.070> so<00:06:20.490> it's<00:06:20.850> used<00:06:21.150> to<00:06:21.300> multi<00:06:21.600> processing

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
core so it's used to multi processing

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.330 
core so it's used to multi processing
applications<00:06:23.870> I'm<00:06:24.870> a<00:06:25.170> GPU<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.950> fan<00:06:26.130> and

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
applications I'm a GPU the fan and

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.890 
applications I'm a GPU the fan and
everything<00:06:26.550> was<00:06:26.880> kind<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.270> getting<00:06:27.420> wild<00:06:27.780> now

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
everything was kind of getting wild now

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.500 
everything was kind of getting wild now
since<00:06:28.350> CPU<00:06:29.250> is<00:06:29.310> heating<00:06:29.520> up<00:06:29.610> as<00:06:30.240> well<00:06:30.420> as

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
since CPU is heating up as well as

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.200 
since CPU is heating up as well as
temperatures<00:06:30.930> I'm<00:06:31.080> running<00:06:31.350> at<00:06:31.790> 53<00:06:32.790> degrees

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
temperatures I'm running at 53 degrees

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.230 
temperatures I'm running at 53 degrees
Celsius<00:06:33.870> right<00:06:33.990> now<00:06:34.580> let's<00:06:35.580> see<00:06:35.790> what<00:06:35.970> is<00:06:36.090> that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
Celsius right now let's see what is that

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.240 
Celsius right now let's see what is that
there<00:06:36.390> are<00:06:36.570> 53<00:06:36.960> degrees<00:06:37.380> Celsius<00:06:37.770> normally

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
there are 53 degrees Celsius normally

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.630 
there are 53 degrees Celsius normally
I'll<00:06:38.400> run<00:06:38.640> it<00:06:38.790> like<00:06:38.940> idle<00:06:39.600> 40<00:06:40.550> especially<00:06:41.550> in

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
I'll run it like idle 40 especially in

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.560 
I'll run it like idle 40 especially in
the<00:06:41.700> summertime<00:06:41.940> it<00:06:42.150> gets<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.300> little<00:06:42.420> bit

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
the summertime it gets a little bit

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.710 
the summertime it gets a little bit
harder<00:06:42.840> but<00:06:43.110> you<00:06:43.320> can<00:06:44.310> see<00:06:44.460> there<00:06:44.670> 100%<00:06:45.390> on<00:06:45.510> all

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
harder but you can see there 100% on all

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.680 
harder but you can see there 100% on all
four<00:06:46.140> cores<00:06:46.470> and<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:48.030> know<00:06:48.120> it's<00:06:48.330> still<00:06:48.570> not

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
four cores and you know it's still not

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.130 
four cores and you know it's still not
that<00:06:48.750> hot<00:06:49.200> I<00:06:49.320> mean<00:06:49.470> 50s<00:06:49.890> it's<00:06:50.400> max<00:06:50.840> 60<00:06:51.840> is<00:06:51.960> where

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
that hot I mean 50s it's max 60 is where

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.480 
that hot I mean 50s it's max 60 is where
it<00:06:52.230> gets<00:06:52.350> dangerous<00:06:52.590> but<00:06:53.010> you<00:06:53.130> know<00:06:53.220> still

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
it gets dangerous but you know still

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.470 
it gets dangerous but you know still
running<00:06:53.700> great<00:06:53.940> so<00:06:54.630> yeah<00:06:55.350> so<00:06:56.040> the<00:06:56.790> AMD<00:06:57.120> phenom

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:57.480 
running great so yeah so the AMD phenom

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.510 
running great so yeah so the AMD phenom
ii<00:06:57.660> x4<00:06:57.690> can<00:06:58.320> do<00:06:58.470> a<00:06:58.500> lot<00:06:58.710> of<00:06:58.740> processing<00:06:58.950> and<00:06:59.400> i'm
