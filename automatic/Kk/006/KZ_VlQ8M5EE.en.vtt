00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.640
Jesus climbed the hill

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.860
to the garden still

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.320
His steps were heavy and slow

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720
Love and a prayer

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.140
Took Him there

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.680
to the place only He could go

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.580
Gethsemane

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.300
Jesus loves me

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.440
So He went willingly

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.320
to Gethsemane

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.440
He felt all that was sad

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.620
Wicked or bad

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.420
all the pain we would ever know

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
while His friends were asleep

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.200
He fought to keep

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.820
His promise made long ago

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.680
Gethsemane

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.940
Jesus loves me

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560
So he went willingly

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.000
to Gethsemane

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.940
The hardest thing that ever was done

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.140
The greatest pain that ever was known

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.500
The biggest battle that ever was won

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.460
This was done by Jesus

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.400
The fight was won by Jesus

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.620
Gethsemane

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.860
Jesus loves me

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
So He gave His gift to me

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.940
in Gethsemane

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.920
Gethsemane

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.560
Jesus loves me

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.880
so He gives this gift to me

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.200
from Gethsemane
