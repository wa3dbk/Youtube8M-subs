 friends glad to welcome you all to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.719
 long-awaited underwater hunt 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 again yenisei its surroundings and 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.480
 it's like i said author's video 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.880
 these are the videos that are us 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.830
 our users send users 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.689
 but also to all guests who everyone who ever 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:38.969
 with us 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:40.260
 This video has been sent by one of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.149
 novice authors 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 name is Anton but he got to the Yenisei 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 the weather was sunny once again remind you 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.789
 submerged earth diving a little 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.010
 I met such a small bribe check 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.800
 whom he captured 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 with my own hands here mocked asking 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.020
 uncle underwater hunter let me go 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:19.530
 Antonov held 1st small not 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:23.420
 offend this author was happy to learn 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.420
 continues on its way 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.480
 At first glance, this day was even 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 sunny but nothing he actually 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.970
 I did not foretell anything interesting 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.060
 there is a moment here friends i 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.730
 I ask to pay your attention to such 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.790
 let's say very rare moments which 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:02:00.740
 almost never meet 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:04.470
 lift up video comes up bored 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.890
 I just can not understand why a 2 not 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.160
 began to shoot he was watching him bar 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.080
 perhaps, too, they were cast down, and some 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.820
 way probably then realized that you 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.820
 need to shoot rushed him 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.000
 and here guys 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.000
 a whole feast I think the author of such 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 moments and did not expect to see you 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.810
 just look 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 they stood here to rest 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.760
 You did not suspect Antosha chose himself 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.760
 large 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.640
 and that was 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.460
 it is already possible 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.460
 and what the hunt took place 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:09.850
 Well, then how can 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:09.850
 im placing trophy on kukan 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.980
 short such charging procedure 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.310
 reload rewind well and actually 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:25.300
 research further to be honest here 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.300
 already do not expect that you can see 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:34.960
 but by no means the author actually we 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.710
 see meets another representative 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:46.010
 we see that the author makes a decision quickly 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:50.570
 and one can not disagree right again 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.970
 same shot posting on a kukan charge 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.370
 shotguns 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.380
 security is all right 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.710
 all in the water 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.710
 research further 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.690
 as you can see this time the day was very 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:16.440
 auspicious is actually the same 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:19.530
 picture of another one standing burbot 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.530
 maybe it's the same 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.530
 relax 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.320
 honestly for me this is the picture i 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:37.030
 already doubt whether she looks 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.180
 Appetizing here we see here the author did not 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.240
 greedy just somehow went 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.720
 landing as a boeing scared the old 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.030
 sleeping fish here they ran different 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.590
 parties well naturally 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:58.930
 interesting to watch after that 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:04.750
 is there anyone else but how can we see a fish 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.590
 on this day absolutely everywhere here 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.060
 author well done 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.430
 Showed show us the frame and already especially 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:18.520
 not much greedy because yes 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:24.180
 really need to convince the fish from 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.180
 such here it is ours and Yenisei burb 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.100
 it seemed to me at some point that 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.390
 today was some kind of holiday 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.240
 defense day of some exams that fish 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.310
 all povylazilo here actually itself 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.480
 even swim here according to the rules of some kind 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.440
 your traffic 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:57.430
 this is when one fish swims 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.430
 pauses skips another 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:08.870
 by the shade of water we see that the author went to 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:13.310
 depth sees another sees another 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:17.690
 individual from this category 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.949
 from this family we see that the author 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.729
 chooses 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:25.430
 good and yes indeed it 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:29.620
 serious enough copy so 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.620
 I would say about 5 kilograms 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.020
 and the depths of exploration continue 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:42.600
 this twidium that the underwater hunter even 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:48.500
 already and does not pay attention looked 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.500
 aimed and let lives blow further 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:56.439
 Well, now on the way to the shade we see that 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.379
 already depth 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:04.180
 so decent and at depth we too 

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:07.300
 see some instances but here already 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.490
 the author is likely to swim 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.389
 just to satisfy 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.389
 some kind of curiosity 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.100
 and here the spearfishing is over 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:23.910
 Thank you for your attention on the following 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.910
 underwater hunting
