paste<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:32.770> back<00:02:33.010> into<00:02:33.400> into<00:02:33.820> place<00:02:34.060> and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
paste that one back into into place and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.610 
paste that one back into into place and
it's<00:02:34.360> put<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.630> down<00:02:34.780> there<00:02:35.020> out<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.470> way

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
it's put it down there out of the way

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.040 
it's put it down there out of the way
now<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.610> notice<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.870> I've

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
now you notice on this that I've

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.530 
now you notice on this that I've
actually<00:02:38.260> used<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:39.190> separate<00:02:39.900> title<00:02:40.900> block<00:02:41.460> now

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
actually used a separate title block now

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.060 
actually used a separate title block now
for<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> long<00:02:43.750> time<00:02:43.990> I've<00:02:44.230> been<00:02:44.260> using<00:02:44.680> my<00:02:44.920> own

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
for a long time I've been using my own

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.130 
for a long time I've been using my own
title<00:02:45.550> block<00:02:45.730> just<00:02:46.090> because<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.420> drew<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.810> out<00:02:47.080> a

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
title block just because I drew it out a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.800 
title block just because I drew it out a
long<00:02:47.560> time<00:02:47.620> ago<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.490> continue<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.030> use<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.600> I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
long time ago and continue to use it I

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.050 
long time ago and continue to use it I
think<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> same<00:02:50.710> system<00:02:51.130> works<00:02:51.400> if<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.850> use

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
think the same system works if you use

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.450 
think the same system works if you use
it<00:02:52.270> with<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.930> nemecheck<00:02:53.620> one<00:02:54.010> if<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.310> use

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
it with the nemecheck one if you use

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.180 
it with the nemecheck one if you use
this<00:02:54.670> one<00:02:54.910> I'm<00:02:55.240> from<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.770> mat<00:02:56.770> all<00:02:56.920> set<00:02:57.160> over

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
this one I'm from the mat all set over

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.630 
this one I'm from the mat all set over
here<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.470> we<00:02:59.590> also<00:02:59.740> need<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.130> do<00:03:00.370> now<00:03:00.610> is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
here so what we also need to do now is

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.140 
here so what we also need to do now is
to<00:03:00.910> go<00:03:01.030> into<00:03:01.210> file<00:03:01.570> page<00:03:02.440> setup<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.760> let's

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
to go into file page setup and let's

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.880 
to go into file page setup and let's
just<00:03:04.240> reset<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.050> widths<00:03:05.440> and<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.680> heights

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
just reset the widths and the heights

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.850 
just reset the widths and the heights
here<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.940> width<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.480> want<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.350> want<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
here so the width I want and I want to a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.690 
here so the width I want and I want to a
three<00:03:09.850> pages<00:03:10.420> side<00:03:10.750> by<00:03:10.780> side<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:12.370> that's<00:03:12.550> going

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
three pages side by side so that's going

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.640 
three pages side by side so that's going
to<00:03:12.760> have<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:13.030> be<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.360> train<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.930> 840<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
to have to be a train to 840 and the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.430 
to have to be a train to 840 and the
width<00:03:18.030> 297<00:03:23.340> there<00:03:24.340> now<00:03:25.210> if<00:03:25.510> we<00:03:25.720> look<00:03:25.750> down<00:03:26.140> here

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
width 297 there now if we look down here

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.650 
width 297 there now if we look down here
you'll<00:03:26.650> see<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.370> actual<00:03:27.520> page<00:03:27.970> has

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
you'll see that the actual page has

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.140 
you'll see that the actual page has
moved<00:03:29.020> to<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.770> correct<00:03:30.190> size<00:03:30.460> for<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.880> role

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
moved to the correct size for the role

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.610 
moved to the correct size for the role
so<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:31.990> put<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.440> one<00:03:32.890> there<00:03:34.200> nicely<00:03:35.200> put<00:03:35.350> into

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
so we put that one there nicely put into

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.580 
so we put that one there nicely put into
place<00:03:35.830> just<00:03:36.840> shove<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.870> over<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.260> little<00:03:38.350> bit

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
place just shove it over a little bit

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.070 
place just shove it over a little bit
now<00:03:39.280> let's<00:03:39.520> go<00:03:39.670> on<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:41.010> unto<00:03:42.010> thee<00:03:43.080> which

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
now let's go on to the unto thee which

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.590 
now let's go on to the unto thee which
one<00:03:44.290> should<00:03:44.470> we<00:03:44.530> have<00:03:44.890> proposed<00:03:45.760> proposed

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
one should we have proposed proposed

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.130 
one should we have proposed proposed
ground<00:03:46.990> floor<00:03:47.320> let's<00:03:47.920> have<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.160> one<00:03:49.080> now<00:03:50.080> we

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
ground floor let's have that one now we

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.850 
ground floor let's have that one now we
connect<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.010> whole<00:03:51.310> thing<00:03:51.550> like<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:51.820> and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
connect the whole thing like that and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.560 
connect the whole thing like that and
then<00:03:53.860> go<00:03:54.100> back<00:03:54.340> up<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.450> new<00:03:55.960> double<00:03:56.500> sheet

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
then go back up to this new double sheet

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.720 
then go back up to this new double sheet
click<00:03:58.570> somewhere<00:03:58.870> where<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.200> wanted<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.560> go<00:03:59.730> and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
then just shove it into position like

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.680 
then just shove it into position like
that<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:05.590> will<00:04:06.490> allow<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.210> print
