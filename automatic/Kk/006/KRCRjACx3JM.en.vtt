up those all up and roast them and then

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.240 
up those all up and roast them and then
we'll<00:02:38.750> separate<00:02:39.080> them<00:02:39.260> out<00:02:39.350> into<00:02:39.560> Ziploc<00:02:39.920> bags

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
we'll separate them out into Ziploc bags

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.300 
we'll separate them out into Ziploc bags
and<00:02:40.610> then<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.900> fourth<00:02:42.530> building<00:02:42.739> block<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.280> a

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and then the fourth building block is a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.070 
and then the fourth building block is a
pulled<00:02:43.670> chicken<00:02:43.730> again<00:02:44.660> we're<00:02:44.900> going<00:02:44.989> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
pulled chicken again we're going to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.180 
season it very basic with salt pepper
thyme<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.660> lemon<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.500> recipe<00:02:48.680> calls<00:02:49.010> for

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
thyme and lemon the recipe calls for

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.520 
thyme and lemon the recipe calls for
four<00:02:49.550> bone-in<00:02:49.940> skin-on<00:02:50.390> chicken<00:02:50.750> breasts<00:02:51.440> and

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
four bone-in skin-on chicken breasts and

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.830 
four bone-in skin-on chicken breasts and
for<00:02:51.860> bone-in<00:02:52.100> skin-on<00:02:52.340> chicken<00:02:52.579> thighs<00:02:53.060> we're

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
for bone-in skin-on chicken thighs we're

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.300 
for bone-in skin-on chicken thighs we're
not<00:02:54.019> big<00:02:54.200> fans<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.620> thigh<00:02:54.799> meat<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:55.190> this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
not big fans of thigh meat in this

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.039 
not big fans of thigh meat in this
family<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.209> we're<00:02:56.420> going<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.630> go<00:02:56.720> with<00:02:56.840> eight

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
family so we're going to go with eight

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.810 
family so we're going to go with eight
chicken<00:02:57.829> breasts<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.220> don't<00:02:58.459> think<00:02:58.610> it's<00:02:58.730> going

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
chicken breasts I don't think it's going

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.550 
chicken breasts I don't think it's going
to<00:02:58.910> change<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.209> recipe<00:02:59.360> any<00:02:59.750> certainly<00:03:00.440> will

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
to change the recipe any certainly will

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.250 
to change the recipe any certainly will
let<00:03:00.709> you<00:03:00.829> know<00:03:00.940> but<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.780> reason<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.140> do

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
let you know but the reason we do

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.810 
let you know but the reason we do
bone-in<00:03:03.470> skin-on<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:04.190> because<00:03:04.370> it<00:03:04.459> just<00:03:04.579> gives

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
bone-in skin-on is because it just gives

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.190 
bone-in skin-on is because it just gives
it<00:03:04.880> a<00:03:04.970> little<00:03:05.120> more<00:03:05.360> flavor<00:03:05.690> when<00:03:06.079> it's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
it a little more flavor when it's

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.100 
it a little more flavor when it's
roasting<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.640> bone<00:03:07.850> will<00:03:08.120> keep<00:03:08.329> it<00:03:08.540> from

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
roasting and the bone will keep it from

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.890 
roasting and the bone will keep it from
getting<00:03:09.260> dried<00:03:09.650> out<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.519> well<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.480> great<00:03:11.690> part

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
getting dried out so well the great part

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.270 
getting dried out so well the great part
about<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.170> is<00:03:12.350> then<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.829> use<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.100> bones

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
about that is then you can use the bones

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.340 
about that is then you can use the bones
to<00:03:13.760> make<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.940> stock<00:03:14.329> afterwards<00:03:14.870> which<00:03:14.989> I<00:03:15.110> plan

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
to make a stock afterwards which I plan

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.810 
to make a stock afterwards which I plan
to<00:03:15.380> do<00:03:15.590> it's<00:03:15.769> not<00:03:15.890> one<00:03:16.100> of<00:03:16.130> the<00:03:16.310> five<00:03:16.459> building

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
to do it's not one of the five building

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.520 
to do it's not one of the five building
blocks<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:17.540> I've<00:03:17.660> got<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:17.989> bones<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.320> minds

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
blocks but I've got the bones and minds

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.569 
blocks but I've got the bones and minds
will<00:03:18.709> do<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:19.970> have<00:03:20.299> my<00:03:20.570> my<00:03:21.579> celery

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
will do it so I have my my celery

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.819 
will do it so I have my my celery
