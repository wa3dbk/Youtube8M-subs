00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 all beaver dear friends with you windows and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.440
 today we'll talk about springtrap a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.820
 also about the fact that he is 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.349
 talking to us in the game don't forget 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.230
 please like and also 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 tell your friends and go to the video in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 general recently scott released 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.449
 update 1.31 in which our dwarf 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.150
 like animatronic learn to publish 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.630
 sounds namely the sounds of walking and what more 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 the main thing is he will learn to speak if you 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.090
 right now go into the game then you 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:38.219
 hear a sound like this very 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.110
 similar to some unsightly sounds 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.760
 as if he's there paper let's 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.300
 the fan is very noisy but it doesn't matter 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 specifically this section 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.320
 it seems to me personally pretty understandable 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.600
 the word help which he cannot 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.670
 utter more understandable a little later we 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.989
 sensitively process this entry to the words 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 were more distinct 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 first talk about the bunnies mean 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.960
 remember that springtrap is animatronic 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.810
 in which man is purple 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.090
 the guy he got there after his 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 children forced to climb costumes after 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 because of his frets his suit was closed 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.549
 slammed dragging him in this mascot te 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 his fnaf 3 we can already see him as 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 the robot in which there is a man but 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 if you listen to what sounds he 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.689
 publishes in the game you can understand that he is on 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.299
 actually trying to contact 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 we are trying to tell us something let's 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 let's hear it again a little more 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.310
 good quality 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.750
 [music] 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.700
 here we are getting to something 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.120
 hear how he makes a sound on 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.340
 really like a seal 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.740
 hear that the voice is a man and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.770
 man if we hear the voice of men 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.380
 does that mean the purple guy died 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.870
 he is inside the king and tries with 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 contact us and it is clear from the notes that 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.660
 he tries to say the same word 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.760
 repeating it however it is not at all clear that 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.920
 behind the word to speak but it would be extremely 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.600
 surprisingly if he could actually 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.210
 speak like an ordinary person after all 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.700
 think his vocal cords just 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.500
 fragmented because of this costume and by the way 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.720
 one more interesting thing is possible that he 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.900
 to balun fight and voice and childish which 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.000
 we create goes not because he wants 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.360
 kill the child or because the voice 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.180
 attracts animatronics and in order to 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.910
 to ask him for help, and finally 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.670
 it is possible that he is not coming to us 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.160
 to kill and to ask for help from 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.200
 now determining that he is there 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.370
 says and for this we will listen to the recording 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.740
 but again 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.760
 processing it so that the voice was heard 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.150
 more 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.150
 OK 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.720
 [music] 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.970
 I don't know about you guys, but here I am 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.530
 the words are quite clearly heard 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.410
 similar to l. so he tries 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.420
 contact us and ask for help 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.640
 then it may explain why he 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.100
 appearing in our office does not kill us 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.700
 not showing how we die he just 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.500
 coming up to us and as we said before 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.160
 surprised and then when fits yet 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.950
 nearer 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.500
 it is clear that he is happy of course 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.580
 that he is glad that he finally caught 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.250
 its prey 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.980
 but maybe he is glad that he found 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.650
 a man who can pull him out 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.930
 suit whatever this record 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.769
 you can quite clearly hear the voice 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.959
 springtrap 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.989
 and the springtrap voice leads to the fact that 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.720
 I have a purple guy inside me 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.640
 because if he died then these sounds 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.069
 there would be no animatronic itself 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.440
 such sounds do not emit because 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.239
 otherwise if he made such sounds in 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.220
 its normal format ie when 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.989
 he was still running next to the children then to me 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.420
 it seems from him the children in the padike would 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.880
 scatter too scary sounds 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.500
 publishes from this it follows that all these 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.120
 here is not creating a mumbling robot 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.500
 man internally 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.530
 purple guy who is still 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.170
 survived and now he is looking for someone 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.790
 who can help him on this all dear 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.620
 friends I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.750
 subscribe to the new video leaves 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.750
 Good bye for now
