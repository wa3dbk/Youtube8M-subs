00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
casinos you can get to the fairies and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.949 
casinos you can get to the fairies and
obviously<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.609> have<00:01:32.639> to<00:01:32.789> put<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> all<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.869> the

obviously you have to put the all of the

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.620 
obviously you have to put the all of the
modules<00:01:34.169> very<00:01:34.889> close<00:01:35.219> to<00:01:35.459> the<00:01:35.549> casino<00:01:35.999> so<00:01:36.270> that

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
modules very close to the casino so that

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.929 
modules very close to the casino so that
decreases<00:01:37.259> how<00:01:37.649> many<00:01:37.889> casinos<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.729> get

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
decreases how many casinos you can get

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
decreases how many casinos you can get
closer<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.389> the<00:01:39.810> fairies<00:01:40.169> and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.469> need<00:01:40.649> them

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
said this opens up all kinds of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.190 
said this opens up all kinds of
possibilities<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:53.130> new<00:01:53.880> designs<00:01:54.419> for<00:01:54.719> casino

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
possibilities for new designs for casino

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.709 
possibilities for new designs for casino
cities<00:01:55.709> so<00:01:56.429> let's<00:01:57.029> have<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.179> look<00:01:57.359> at<00:01:57.450> how<00:01:57.539> this

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
cities so let's have a look at how this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.049 
cities so let's have a look at how this
works<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.590> I've<00:01:58.829> got<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.039> rose<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.609> like<00:01:59.759> way

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:00.059 
works so I've got a rose that's like way

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:02.899 
works so I've got a rose that's like way
over<00:02:00.509> there<00:02:00.719> now<00:02:01.259> normally<00:02:01.919> when<00:02:02.819> you're

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
over there now normally when you're

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
over there now normally when you're
placed<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.270> roulette<00:02:03.509> houses<00:02:03.959> they<00:02:04.499> they<00:02:04.739> kind

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
placed in roulette houses they they kind

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.159 
placed in roulette houses they they kind
of<00:02:05.099> literally<00:02:05.639> have<00:02:05.819> to<00:02:05.999> be<00:02:06.179> like<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.840> mean<00:02:07.049> you

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:07.169 
of literally have to be like I mean you

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.859 
of literally have to be like I mean you
could<00:02:07.289> probably<00:02:07.499> get<00:02:07.829> two<00:02:08.209> side<00:02:09.209> by<00:02:09.390> side<00:02:09.420> next

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
could probably get two side by side next

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.679 
could probably get two side by side next
to<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.439> elegant<00:02:10.979> casino<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:12.209> any<00:02:12.450> further

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
to a and elegant casino but any further

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
than that and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.230 
than that and
you'll<00:02:13.580> get<00:02:13.790> module<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.810> too<00:02:14.990> far<00:02:15.230> away<00:02:16.240> but

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
you'll get module is too far away but

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.830

bang them in wherever we want awesome

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.820 
bang them in wherever we want awesome
and<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:29.480> first<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:30.050> thought<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.590> was

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and at first I thought that this was

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.210 
and at first I thought that this was
maybe<00:02:31.100> limited<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.220> roulette

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
maybe limited to just the roulette

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.130 
maybe limited to just the roulette
houses<00:02:34.840> but<00:02:35.840> oh<00:02:36.050> no<00:02:37.270> let's<00:02:38.270> delete<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.690> couple

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
houses but oh no let's delete a couple

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.890 
houses but oh no let's delete a couple
of<00:02:39.260> those<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.860> let's<00:02:40.520> try<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> exclusive

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
of those and let's try the exclusive

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.070 
of those and let's try the exclusive
club<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.880> bingo<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.360> put<00:02:44.540> those<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.930> as

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
club and bingo we can put those in as

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.930 
club and bingo we can put those in as
well<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.800> thought<00:02:46.070> well<00:02:46.280> maybe<00:02:46.340> this

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
well so then I thought well maybe this

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.630 
well so then I thought well maybe this
is<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.120> limited<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.160> elegant<00:02:49.160> casino

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.040 
is just limited to the elegant casino

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
I'm guessing he's only done the one

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.660 
I'm guessing he's only done the one
