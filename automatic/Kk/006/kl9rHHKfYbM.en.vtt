00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.770 

but<00:00:59.050> aside<00:00:59.350> from<00:00:59.620> all<00:00:59.800> those<00:01:00.039> sort<00:01:00.429> of

shortcomings<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.920> car<00:01:03.219> drives<00:01:03.460> really

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
shortcomings this car drives really

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.550 
shortcomings this car drives really
really<00:01:04.420> well<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.899> it<00:01:05.049> drives<00:01:05.290> so<00:01:05.530> well

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
really well and it drives so well

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.010 
really well and it drives so well
because<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.729> chassis<00:01:07.119> settings<00:01:07.479> it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
because of the the chassis settings it's

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.749 
because of the the chassis settings it's
got<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.170> very<00:01:08.530> very<00:01:08.649> high<00:01:09.009> spring<00:01:09.369> rate<00:01:09.580> which

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
got a very very high spring rate which

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.700 
got a very very high spring rate which
makes<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.060> car<00:01:10.210> very<00:01:10.479> planted<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:11.229> mean<00:01:11.619> it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
makes the car very planted I mean it

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.580 
makes the car very planted I mean it
sucks<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.369> road<00:01:12.580> and<00:01:13.049> I'm<00:01:14.049> not<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.530> to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
sucks to the road and I'm not going to

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.700 
sucks to the road and I'm not going to
compare<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.399> directly<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.450> GTR<00:01:16.899> but

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
compare it directly in to the GTR but

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.350 
compare it directly in to the GTR but
since<00:01:18.039> they're<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.549> the<00:01:18.580> same<00:01:18.729> kind<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.210> design

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
since they're of the same kind of design

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.999 
since they're of the same kind of design
language<00:01:19.869> if<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:19.990> look<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.320> outside<00:01:20.740> you

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
language if you look at the outside you

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.520 
language if you look at the outside you
have<00:01:21.039> a<00:01:21.189> very<00:01:21.490> similar<00:01:21.880> roofline

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
have a very similar roofline

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.219 
have a very similar roofline
it<00:01:23.950> reminds<00:01:24.549> me<00:01:24.700> somewhat<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> GTR<00:01:25.810> and

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
it reminds me somewhat of the GTR and

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.350 
it reminds me somewhat of the GTR and
part<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.189> is<00:01:27.310> also<00:01:27.429> the<00:01:27.640> noise<00:01:27.909> in<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
part of that is also the noise in the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.020 
part of that is also the noise in the
cabin<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.770> you<00:01:29.890> get<00:01:30.069> which<00:01:30.250> is<00:01:30.280> particularly

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
cabin that you get which is particularly

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.180 
cabin that you get which is particularly
loud<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.690> what<00:01:32.289> I'm<00:01:32.380> trying<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.679> say<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:32.950> car

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
loud so what I'm trying to say this car

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.010 
loud so what I'm trying to say this car
is<00:01:33.340> anything<00:01:33.670> but<00:01:33.850> comfort<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
is anything but comfort it is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.570 
is anything but comfort it is
performance<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.069> performance

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
performance and it is a performance

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.580 
performance and it is a performance
vehicle<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.450> under<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.780> hood<00:01:37.959> is<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.110> v6

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
vehicle and under the hood is a v6

engine 3.7 liter that produces 350

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.800 
engine 3.7 liter that produces 350
horsepower<00:01:42.490> it's<00:01:42.850> a<00:01:42.880> little<00:01:43.330> bit<00:01:43.450> more<00:01:43.659> than

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
horsepower it's a little bit more than

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.999 
horsepower it's a little bit more than
the<00:01:43.899> regular<00:01:44.229> 370z

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
the regular 370z

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.309 
the regular 370z
and<00:01:45.190> they've<00:01:45.700> done<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:45.970> largely<00:01:46.780> through

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
and they've done that largely through

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.510 
and they've done that largely through
the<00:01:47.740> exhaust<00:01:48.130> tuning<00:01:48.459> and<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:50.310> result<00:01:51.310> is<00:01:51.459> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
the exhaust tuning and the result is a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.539 
the exhaust tuning and the result is a
very<00:01:52.030> very<00:01:52.299> linear<00:01:52.750> delivery<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.619> power<00:01:53.950> you

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
very very linear delivery of power you

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:55.889 
very very linear delivery of power you
don't<00:01:54.729> get<00:01:54.789> that<00:01:54.939> sudden<00:01:55.390> burst<00:01:55.630> that

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
don't get that sudden burst that

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.749 
don't get that sudden burst that
uncontrollable<00:01:56.649> unmanageable<00:01:57.310> burst<00:01:57.549> of

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
uncontrollable unmanageable burst of

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.880 
uncontrollable unmanageable burst of
power<00:01:57.939> which<00:01:58.689> is<00:01:58.810> really<00:01:59.020> nice

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
power which is really nice

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.680 
power which is really nice
it<00:02:00.190> kind<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.399> adds<00:02:00.610> again<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.269> sort<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.569> all

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
it kind of adds again to sort of all

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.150 
it kind of adds again to sort of all
that<00:02:01.869> control<00:02:02.319> that<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.649> kind<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:02.920> want<00:02:03.099> to

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
that control that you kind of want to

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.559 
that control that you kind of want to
have<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.550> know<00:02:03.640> if<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.819> car<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.090> doing<00:02:04.420> and

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
have you know if the car is doing and

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.300 
have you know if the car is doing and
that's<00:02:05.140> kind<00:02:05.379> of<00:02:05.410> further<00:02:05.590> exemplified<00:02:05.950> by

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
that's kind of further exemplified by

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.130 
that's kind of further exemplified by
the<00:02:06.519> steering<00:02:06.879> which<00:02:07.119> is<00:02:07.239> hydraulic<00:02:07.810> so<00:02:07.989> any

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
the steering which is hydraulic so any

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.509 
the steering which is hydraulic so any
kind<00:02:08.379> of<00:02:08.440> little<00:02:08.649> divots<00:02:08.979> on<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.190> road<00:02:09.340> you're

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
kind of little divots on the road you're

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.699 
kind of little divots on the road you're
going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.700> feel<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.929> could<00:02:11.050> probably<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.560> me

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
going to feel you could probably see me

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.290 
going to feel you could probably see me
kind<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.950> rattling<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.550> bouncing<00:02:12.879> around<00:02:12.940> in

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
kind of rattling and bouncing around in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.990 
kind of rattling and bouncing around in
here<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.250> because<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.879> way

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
here and that is because of the way

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.760 
here and that is because of the way
they've<00:02:16.209> set<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.629> vehicle<00:02:17.050> up

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.780 

but<00:02:22.770> let's<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.100> take<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.430> through<00:02:23.580> some<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
but let's just take it through some of

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
but let's just take it through some of
these<00:02:23.850> corners<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.480> sort<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.930> how<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
these corners you can sort of see how it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.530 
these corners you can sort of see how it
sticks<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.460> got<00:02:26.670> traction<00:02:27.000> control

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
sticks now it's got traction control

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
sticks now it's got traction control
which<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.780> most<00:02:28.260> certainly<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.770> me<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
which is most certainly to me a

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
which is most certainly to me a
necessity<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.640> these<00:02:29.790> kind<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.120> roads

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
necessity on these kind of roads

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.090 
necessity on these kind of roads
especially<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:30.960> you've<00:02:31.080> got<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> lot<00:02:31.470> of<00:02:31.500> you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
especially when you've got a lot of you

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.440 
especially when you've got a lot of you
know<00:02:32.130> switchbacks<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.970> why<00:02:33.120> these<00:02:33.180> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
know switchbacks and why these and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.480 
know switchbacks and why these and
corners<00:02:33.780> I've<00:02:34.590> turned<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.010> off<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.430> I've

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
corners I've turned it off and I've

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.400 
corners I've turned it off and I've
driven<00:02:35.670> with<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.060> with<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.420> off<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.380> can

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
driven with that with it off and you can

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.350 
driven with that with it off and you can
you<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:37.920> easily<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.820> corner<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.270> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you can easily get the corner of the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.670 
you can easily get the corner of the
back<00:02:39.510> sorry<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:39.990> can<00:02:40.110> easily<00:02:40.230> get<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.500> back

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
back sorry you can easily get the back

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.890 
back sorry you can easily get the back
end<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.070> on<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:42.000> so<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.330> not<00:02:42.450> daring

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
end out on it and so I'm not daring

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.850 
end out on it and so I'm not daring
enough<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.200> drive<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.250> as<00:02:44.340> such<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> traction

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
enough to drive it as such the traction

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.490 
enough to drive it as such the traction
control<00:02:47.150> does<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> really<00:02:48.780> good<00:02:48.960> job<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.440> think

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
control does a really good job I think

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.730 
control does a really good job I think
of<00:02:49.800> balancing<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.460> all<00:02:50.550> out<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.110> assisting

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
of balancing it all out and assisting

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.830 
of balancing it all out and assisting
with<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> brakes<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.240> brakes<00:02:54.270> are

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
with that is the brakes the brakes are

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.470 
with that is the brakes the brakes are
absolutely<00:02:55.620> phenomenal<00:02:55.860> they're<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.060> point

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
absolutely phenomenal they're on point

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.340 
absolutely phenomenal they're on point
easy<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.470> modulate<00:02:58.950> light<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.580> foot<00:02:59.850> and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
easy to modulate light on the foot and

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.960 
easy to modulate light on the foot and
really<00:03:01.350> really<00:03:01.680> reactive<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:02.700> don't

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
really really reactive and you don't

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.400 
really really reactive and you don't
need<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.450> power<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.050> feel<00:03:04.290> like

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
need a lot of power I don't feel like

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.840 
need a lot of power I don't feel like
I'm<00:03:04.500> wearing<00:03:04.680> down<00:03:05.010> these<00:03:05.220> brakes<00:03:05.550> when<00:03:05.760> I'm

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
I'm wearing down these brakes when I'm

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.030 
I'm wearing down these brakes when I'm
driving<00:03:06.270> on<00:03:06.330> these<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.750> roads<00:03:07.040> whereas

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
driving on these kind of roads whereas

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.290 
driving on these kind of roads whereas
when<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.250> was<00:03:08.370> driving<00:03:08.550> something<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
when I was driving something like the

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.870 
when I was driving something like the
rs7<00:03:09.780> which<00:03:10.110> by<00:03:10.380> all<00:03:10.410> accounts<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:11.040> no

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
rs7 which by all accounts is no

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.480 
rs7 which by all accounts is no
comparison<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.980> felt<00:03:13.980> like<00:03:14.130> those<00:03:14.310> were

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
comparison I felt like those were

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.980 
comparison I felt like those were
starting<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:15.090> wear<00:03:15.270> down<00:03:15.480> especially

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
starting to really wear down especially

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.560 
starting to really wear down especially
towards<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.350> end<00:03:16.580> here<00:03:17.580> I'm<00:03:17.820> barely<00:03:18.390> hitting

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
towards the end here I'm barely hitting

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.330 
towards the end here I'm barely hitting
them<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.930> some<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.680> also<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.310> be

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
them and some of that is also can be

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.560 
them and some of that is also can be
attributed<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.000> fact<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.330> it's<00:03:21.510> a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
attributed to the fact that it's a

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.780 
attributed to the fact that it's a
6-speed<00:03:22.020> manual<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:23.250> they've<00:03:23.460> got<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
6-speed manual and they've got the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.850 
6-speed manual and they've got the
syncro<00:03:24.150> rev-matching<00:03:24.630> tech<00:03:24.990> that<00:03:25.620> when<00:03:25.770> you

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
syncro rev-matching tech that when you

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.830 
syncro rev-matching tech that when you
downshift<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.730> will<00:03:26.850> match<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.300> rev<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
downshift it will match the rev so you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.650 
downshift it will match the rev so you
don't<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.050> that<00:03:28.170> sudden<00:03:28.560> lunge<00:03:29.390> but<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.570> know

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
don't get that sudden lunge but you know

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
don't get that sudden lunge but you know
that<00:03:30.840> allows<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.410> really<00:03:31.590> modulate<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that allows you to really modulate the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.610 
that allows you to really modulate the
car's<00:03:32.580> speed<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.000> lot<00:03:33.239> better<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.600> believe<00:03:33.750> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
car's speed a lot better I believe you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.900 
car's speed a lot better I believe you
know<00:03:34.709> where<00:03:34.860> is<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:34.980> an<00:03:35.130> automatic<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.790> will

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
know where is it an automatic it will

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.449 
know where is it an automatic it will
run<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.150> little<00:03:36.360> bit<00:03:36.510> more<00:03:36.570> open<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.459> obviously

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
run a little bit more open and obviously

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.680 
run a little bit more open and obviously
that's<00:03:38.580> going<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.850> vary<00:03:39.000> from<00:03:39.270> vehicle<00:03:39.450> to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
driving this car and it's gotten a lot

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.850 
driving this car and it's gotten a lot
easier<00:04:10.120> a<00:04:10.390> lot<00:04:10.690> easier<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.230> drive<00:04:11.470> just

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
easier a lot easier to drive just

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.350 
easier a lot easier to drive just
because<00:04:12.130> you're<00:04:12.310> getting<00:04:12.430> or<00:04:12.910> I'm<00:04:13.120> getting

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
because you're getting or I'm getting

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.540 
because you're getting or I'm getting
used<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:13.990> sort<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.740> how<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.920> vehicle<00:04:15.340> moves

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
used to sort of how the vehicle moves

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.510 
used to sort of how the vehicle moves
and<00:04:15.940> sort<00:04:16.299> of<00:04:16.390> where<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.690> shift<00:04:16.930> points<00:04:17.020> are

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
and sort of where the shift points are

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.310 
and sort of where the shift points are
but<00:04:18.520> having<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.060> central<00:04:19.450> Rev<00:04:19.600> also<00:04:20.049> helps

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
but having that central Rev also helps

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.320 
but having that central Rev also helps
on<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.560> up<00:04:20.739> but<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.430> really<00:04:21.850> helps<00:04:22.120> in<00:04:22.240> the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
on the up but it really helps in the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.120 
on the up but it really helps in the
down<00:04:22.570> now<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:22.870> don't<00:04:23.080> know<00:04:23.170> if<00:04:23.290> a<00:04:23.380> purist<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:23.950> one

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
down now I don't know if a purist is one

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.370 
down now I don't know if a purist is one
I'm<00:04:24.220> going<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.400> want<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.580> use<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.970> but<00:04:25.630> driving

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
I'm going to want to use it but driving

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.810 
I'm going to want to use it but driving
around<00:04:26.560> town<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.040> you<00:04:27.070> got<00:04:27.280> somebody<00:04:27.610> sitting

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
around town if you got somebody sitting

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.760 
around town if you got somebody sitting
next<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.600> they're<00:04:29.320> having<00:04:29.440> a<00:04:29.620> hard

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
next to you and they're having a hard

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.650 
next to you and they're having a hard
enough<00:04:29.830> time<00:04:30.010> tolerating<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:31.030> ride<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.480> rough

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
enough time tolerating the ride is rough

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:44.910 
enough time tolerating the ride is rough
as<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.310> good<00:04:33.490> thing<00:04:33.730> trusting<00:04:43.890> so<00:04:44.890> I

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
as it is it's a good thing trusting so I

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.260 
as it is it's a good thing trusting so I
can't<00:04:45.280> unfortunately<00:04:45.670> really<00:04:46.030> do<00:04:46.240> a

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
can't unfortunately really do a

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.210 
can't unfortunately really do a
comparison<00:04:46.780> because<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.200> haven't<00:04:47.470> driven<00:04:48.040> a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
comparison because I haven't driven a

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.650 
comparison because I haven't driven a
car<00:04:48.420> that's<00:04:49.420> like<00:04:49.810> quite<00:04:50.530> like<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.660> when

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
car that's like quite like this and when

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.720 
car that's like quite like this and when
I<00:04:52.690> say<00:04:52.840> like<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.260> this<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.740> $46,000

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
I say like this this is a $46,000

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.700 
I say like this this is a $46,000
vehicle<00:04:55.210> it's<00:04:55.840> got<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> pretty<00:04:56.200> significant

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
vehicle it's got a pretty significant

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.730 
vehicle it's got a pretty significant
premium<00:04:57.520> over<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.970> regular<00:04:58.630> 370z<00:04:59.760> but

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
premium over the regular 370z but

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.180 
premium over the regular 370z but
performance<00:05:02.740> wise<00:05:03.480> it's<00:05:04.480> good<00:05:04.690> bang<00:05:04.870> for<00:05:05.110> buck

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
performance wise it's good bang for buck

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:18.410 
performance wise it's good bang for buck
there's<00:05:06.400> no<00:05:06.550> question<00:05:07.000> about<00:05:07.030> that

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.060 

so<00:05:18.990> when<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.170> hit<00:05:19.260> these<00:05:19.410> corners<00:05:19.770> there<00:05:19.950> is

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
so when you hit these corners there is

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.610 
so when you hit these corners there is
pretty<00:05:20.520> much<00:05:20.640> no<00:05:20.940> body<00:05:21.180> roll<00:05:21.480> I<00:05:21.690> mean<00:05:22.140> gosh

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
pretty much no body roll I mean gosh

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.340 
pretty much no body roll I mean gosh
there<00:05:22.890> is<00:05:22.980> ZERO<00:05:23.370> body<00:05:23.670> roll<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.990> result

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
there is ZERO body roll and the result

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.630 
there is ZERO body roll and the result
is<00:05:25.560> you're<00:05:25.740> not<00:05:25.860> waiting<00:05:26.040> for<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:26.400> car<00:05:26.610> to

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
is you're not waiting for the car to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.640 
is you're not waiting for the car to
catch<00:05:26.880> up<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:30.120> it<00:05:30.750> kind<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:31.020> comes<00:05:31.140> back<00:05:31.470> to

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
catch up and it kind of comes back to

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.400 
catch up and it kind of comes back to
that<00:05:31.790> connected<00:05:32.790> feeling<00:05:33.230> you<00:05:34.230> know<00:05:34.350> you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
that connected feeling you know you

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.990 
that connected feeling you know you
really<00:05:34.680> do<00:05:34.920> feel<00:05:35.100> like<00:05:35.190> part<00:05:35.550> of<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.670> car<00:05:35.850> you

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
really do feel like part of the car you

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.910 
really do feel like part of the car you
turn<00:05:36.360> it<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.840> goes<00:05:37.050> where<00:05:37.350> you<00:05:37.380> want<00:05:37.500> it<00:05:37.830> to

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:37.920 
turn it and it goes where you want it to

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.860 
turn it and it goes where you want it to
go

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.269 

it's<00:05:42.870> funny<00:05:43.170> because

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
it's funny because

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.369 
it's funny because
if<00:05:45.639> you're<00:05:45.969> on<00:05:46.119> a<00:05:46.149> surface<00:05:46.689> street<00:05:47.019> just

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379 
if you're on a surface street just

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.249 
if you're on a surface street just
driving<00:05:47.859> casually<00:05:48.479> you<00:05:49.479> could<00:05:49.659> be<00:05:49.839> you<00:05:50.229> could

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
driving casually you could be you could

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.179 
driving casually you could be you could
argue<00:05:50.619> that<00:05:50.799> this<00:05:51.099> car<00:05:51.399> is<00:05:51.539> horrible<00:05:53.039> but<00:05:54.039> then

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.189 
argue that this car is horrible but then
