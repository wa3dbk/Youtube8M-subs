Millie about the two different shades on

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.140 
Millie about the two different shades on
you<00:03:22.080> see<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> alternating<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.760> on<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> gamma

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you see the alternating in on the gamma

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150 
you see the alternating in on the gamma
gap<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.020> live<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.290> college<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.710> everyone's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
gap and I live in college so everyone's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.470 
gap and I live in college so everyone's
all<00:03:26.310> call<00:03:26.550> confirm<00:03:26.910> cause<00:03:27.060> everyone's

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
all call confirm cause everyone's

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.410 
all call confirm cause everyone's
overcome<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.170> we've<00:03:28.380> got<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.990 

now<00:03:34.990> there's<00:03:35.440> two<00:03:35.560> ways<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.770> doing<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.190> you<00:03:36.819> can

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
now there's two ways of doing it you can

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.770 
now there's two ways of doing it you can
actually<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.980> can<00:03:39.099> actually<00:03:39.510> wait<00:03:40.510> for<00:03:40.690> you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
actually you can actually wait for you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.150 
actually you can actually wait for you
dry<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> little<00:03:41.110> bit<00:03:41.319> or<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.530> can<00:03:41.709> even<00:03:41.830> add<00:03:42.040> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
dry a little bit or you can even add the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.380 
dry a little bit or you can even add the
other<00:03:42.250> party<00:03:42.580> according<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.940> top<00:03:43.090> each<00:03:43.209> other

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
other party according on top each other

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.880 
other party according on top each other
like<00:03:43.660> building<00:03:44.020> blocks<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.349> all<00:03:44.470> billets<00:03:44.800> are

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
like building blocks the all billets are

00:03:44.890 --> 00:04:20.210 
like building blocks the all billets are
feature<00:03:45.190> let<00:03:45.730> me<00:03:45.790> add<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.000> next<00:03:46.150> voting

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.770 

so<00:04:20.730> what<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:20.970> basically<00:04:21.090> do<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.540> you're

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
so what you basically do is you're

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.180 
so what you basically do is you're
sprinting<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.200> up<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.320> little<00:04:22.500> bit<00:04:22.650> there<00:04:22.830> and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
sprinting it up a little bit there and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.010 
sprinting it up a little bit there and
you<00:04:23.580> don't<00:04:23.760> want<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.000> be<00:04:24.120> fine<00:04:24.390> quality

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you don't want it to be fine quality

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.200 
you don't want it to be fine quality
