voice that sometimes don't hear I think

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.370 
voice that sometimes don't hear I think
because<00:01:18.340> of<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.549> remoteness<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:20.140> camp

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
because of the remoteness of the camp

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.469 
because of the remoteness of the camp
and<00:01:20.619> how<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.430> just<00:01:21.670> separates<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.180> from<00:01:22.210> all

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:23.670 
and how it just separates you from all
the<00:01:22.570> other<00:01:22.600> things<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> different

the other things it's a different
element<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.280> think<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.759> just<00:01:25.270> creates<00:01:25.540> an

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
element I think it just creates an

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
element I think it just creates an
atmosphere<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.380> guys<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.710> working<00:01:26.890> on
