actually went really well my theory is
you<00:07:09.900> know<00:07:10.139> just<00:07:10.470> because<00:07:10.710> it's<00:07:10.889> disposable

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
you know just because it's disposable

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.490 
you know just because it's disposable
doesn't<00:07:12.030> have<00:07:12.120> to<00:07:12.210> be<00:07:12.330> ugly<00:07:12.449> should<00:07:13.139> be<00:07:13.260> pretty

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
doesn't have to be ugly should be pretty

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.070 
doesn't have to be ugly should be pretty
so<00:07:14.490> we<00:07:14.520> did<00:07:14.729> met<00:07:14.910> an<00:07:15.000> interesting<00:07:15.600> girl<00:07:15.780> in<00:07:15.990> the
