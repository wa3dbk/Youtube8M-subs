00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.940
 joining the fashion wonders about who 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940
 dick 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.109
 hello to all guys here ex ex ex ex 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:53.350
 I'm in the company of the speed rx pad 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.280
 medium and mouse xornet both of the 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.289
 cm storm brand of the master cooler 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.769
 let's see if the mat e 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.500
 let's start from the outside a beautiful one 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.600
 box where we read the features 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.759
 more important than the pad such as 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.250
 may be the type of surface 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.509
 they were made in hard clough 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.799
 dimensions or 320 x 60 x 5 mm lo 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.429
 thickness is very important in this 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.429
 mat 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.670
 the base is a hundred percent in rubber 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.060
 natural and some features for 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:36.220
 example that guarantee this 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.220
 optical mouse pad while 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.340
 for laser mice , please contact anyway 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.619
 a home.asp ad cooler mat 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.850
 master, however, is a bit advanced in the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.610
 you will have to spend a little more 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
 here is the mat that you present 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.470
 still a black coloration and at the bottom a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 right we find the logo of the cm storm 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.050
 cooler master filer master cap is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.830
 coated in duraclass and allows one 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.810
 perfect and sliding mouse 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.650
 being so often it allows those who don't 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 use the palm rest to find anyway 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.500
 some feeling with the mouse some 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.890
 features of the ford mouse are that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.590
 it is absolutely at a great grip on the 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.500
 desk so there is no one 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.690
 unwanted slipping during 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.230
 game sessions now let's see 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.790
 the mouse then with the characters with lo 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.540
 features click more 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.159
 important what can be the micro 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.290
 switches omicron of piano on the fly 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:51.490
 like preseason optical sense e 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.120
 rubber coatings on the 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.520
 let's say companies support it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.210
 most important feature is the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.970
 diplay on the fly that allows you to go 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.930
 to peek between three profiles of lippi ai 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.030
 pre set or between 500 1000 and 2000 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.080
 dpi 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.370
 this thing is very important in the game 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.230
 especially in fps 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.610
 when you have to go through a situation 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:27.850
 of motorhome to a situation of 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.500
 rajab cascia they play so now let's go 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.040
 to see that the mouse itself 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.150
 it is absolutely fantastic indeed a 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.420
 applaud the master cooler because really 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.180
 this mouse is from the price one 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.760
 would think doing this is one of those 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.800
 of po of the logitech that uses three 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.130
 days and break a show moss instead 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.250
 it's really high end don't get it 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.540
 deceive by the price of around 20 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.850
 euro on the internet long in stores and 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.700
 because this mouse has all the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.040
 characteristics to become moved by 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.070
 professional gamer 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.520
 obviously they lack a bit of dpi because 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.890
 however the complaints and to 2000 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.560
 let's say that's enough for the players in 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.540
 less demanding, however, however the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.540
 characteristics lead him to be a 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.910
 new up perfect for those players who 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:28.540
 however they ask for something more than the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.660
 own hardware the most features 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.240
 important let's say mouse are type 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.680
 already ring finger we say where there was written 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.560
 xornet the side buttons on the thumb that 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.200
 allow you to go back and forth 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.100
 in web pages or who can 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.890
 the two keys must be set in the games 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.700
 that allow you to go and change i 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.380
 dpi 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:59.220
 so it depends on fly and the wheel 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:03.120
 sensitive to the right point and two rates 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.120
 guaranteed for a million clicks 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:13.160
 top five now let's see 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:18.560
 the mouse in operation and we notice that the 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.740
 sensor is a little more powerful than 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.770
 those you find on your 3 mice 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.669
 EUR 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.580
 and this is a very important thing 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.790
 because on the mat little if this 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.830
 mat here never loses the signal is 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.130
 always fluid there is never a 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.199
 interruption and especially also at low 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.199
 and limbs of those you have never lose the 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.699
 sufficiency this is still much more 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.770
 important in gaming sessions 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:51.650
 long where maybe mouse or for any 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.840
 June starts to lose we are shots and 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.710
 instead this is absolutely here 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.160
 perfect at all times with this is 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.340
 all 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.789
 we leave you with this review of 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:10.330
 mouse and speed rx and mat 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:10.330
 xon the next guys hello everyone 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:47.999
 grows but without wi fi
