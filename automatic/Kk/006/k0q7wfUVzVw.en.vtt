 aesthetic but above all for one 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.619

 then we grind the black pepper on the chicken 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.760

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.760

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:31.150
 once finished we dip our legs 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:33.700
 in the sauce and put them on the grill 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.660
