of business and also being a woman and I
am<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.480> woman<00:03:14.630> obviously<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.590> work<00:03:15.830> in<00:03:16.100> a

business environment so I think this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.860 
business environment so I think this
could<00:03:17.690> be<00:03:17.720> interesting<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.820> I<00:03:19.820> don't<00:03:20.660> know<00:03:20.750> what

could be interesting I I don't know what
I'm<00:03:20.989> going<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.170> agree<00:03:21.320> with<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.650> or<00:03:21.830> what<00:03:22.100> I'm

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
going to take away from it but I think

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.210 
going to take away from it but I think

was just like a little baby Brooke and I

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.370 
was just like a little baby Brooke and I
didn't<00:04:08.150> realize<00:04:08.360> it's<00:04:08.510> actually<00:04:08.989> based<00:04:09.140> on

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
didn't realize it's actually based on

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.539 
didn't realize it's actually based on
the<00:04:09.440> speech<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.769> she<00:04:09.920> did<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.130> the<00:04:10.190> same<00:04:10.370> name

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
the speech that she did it the same name

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.460 
the speech that she did it the same name
I<00:04:10.760> thought<00:04:10.940> this<00:04:11.090> was<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.510> new<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.870> related<00:04:12.320> but

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
I thought this was a new is related but

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.080 
I thought this was a new is related but
I<00:04:12.530> realized<00:04:12.829> it<00:04:12.920> was<00:04:12.980> pretty<00:04:13.459> much<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.670> speech

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
I realized it was pretty much the speech

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.939 
I realized it was pretty much the speech
so<00:04:14.690> that's<00:04:14.930> gonna<00:04:15.110> be<00:04:15.200> really<00:04:15.260> interesting<00:04:15.769> I
