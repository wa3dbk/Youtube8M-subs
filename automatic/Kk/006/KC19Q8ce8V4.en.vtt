00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.460 

and<00:01:57.159> Don<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:58.180> may<00:01:58.360> not<00:01:58.630> stir<00:01:58.930> it<00:01:59.140> too<00:01:59.259> much

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
and then we have difficulties to pipe it

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.649 
and then we have difficulties to pipe it
as<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.860> see<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> beautiful<00:02:06.640> texture<00:02:07.450> now
