00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.150 
Stanley Hulk you know he is pretty much
like<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:32.080> key<00:03:32.260> character<00:03:32.739> for<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:32.980> game

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
like the the key character for the game

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.640 
like the the key character for the game
which<00:03:34.060> is<00:03:34.090> why<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.450> can't<00:03:34.900> unlock<00:03:35.110> him<00:03:35.380> until

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
which is why you can't unlock him until

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.979 
which is why you can't unlock him until
quite<00:03:35.830> late<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.250> obviously<00:03:36.600> yeah<00:03:37.600> it's<00:03:37.780> sort

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
quite late on obviously yeah it's sort

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.620 
quite late on obviously yeah it's sort
of<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.140> game<00:03:38.470> breaking<00:03:38.830> character<00:03:39.630> potentially

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
of a game breaking character potentially

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.570 
of a game breaking character potentially
but<00:03:40.810> yeah<00:03:40.870> thankfully<00:03:41.350> not<00:03:41.680> yeah<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.340> we<00:03:42.459> had

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
but yeah thankfully not yeah so we had

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.670 
but yeah thankfully not yeah so we had
to<00:03:42.670> be<00:03:42.730> very<00:03:42.760> careful<00:03:43.239> how<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.360> unlock<00:03:43.690> him<00:03:43.840> but

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
to be very careful how we unlock him but

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.310 
to be very careful how we unlock him but
apart<00:03:45.370> from<00:03:45.459> all<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.730> sort<00:03:46.000> of<00:03:46.060> fan-favorite

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
apart from all the sort of fan-favorite

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.720 
apart from all the sort of fan-favorite
seems<00:03:47.320> like<00:03:47.590> it<00:03:47.709> will<00:03:47.800> also<00:03:47.890> dug<00:03:48.220> out<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.400> couple

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
seems like it will also dug out a couple

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.270 
seems like it will also dug out a couple
of<00:03:48.880> things<00:03:49.209> characters<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.080> perhaps<00:03:50.770> no<00:03:51.250> one

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
of things characters that perhaps no one

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.520 
of things characters that perhaps no one
would<00:03:51.640> ever<00:03:51.760> think<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:53.110> that<00:03:53.140> will<00:03:53.470> be

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
would ever think of that will be

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.259 
would ever think of that will be
included<00:03:53.650> in<00:03:54.190> it<00:03:54.310> in<00:03:54.430> a<00:03:54.519> game<00:03:54.700> like<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.910> could

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
included in it in a game like this could

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.390 
included in it in a game like this could
give<00:03:55.450> any<00:03:55.750> examples<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.380> that<00:03:56.530> yeah<00:03:57.130> well

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
