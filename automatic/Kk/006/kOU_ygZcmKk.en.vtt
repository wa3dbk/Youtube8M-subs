00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.170
 hello good to all physically people 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.369
 before you see this video that is 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.289
 very important for the history of call 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.029
 of duty zombies I want you to know that 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.029
 I'm going to start making a series 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.250
 kind of series that will go on the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.150
 relationship of the sister ex of the maps 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.670
 with the story but not the interest itself 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.309
 but what hides the story behind 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.589
 of that interest because that's what I'm going to 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.420
 do and I want you to see it and I'm going to 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.570
 start doing it in these coming days 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.760
 I've already started doing it and doing the 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.890
 easter ex from shangrilÃ¡ I discovered 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.129
 a series of things but the most 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.920
 important of all is this that I'm going to 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.739
 teach today 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.929
 soon I will begin with those 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 stories from 63 and I want to 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.290
 that you are attentive but pay attention to this 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.930
 here started everything with this hand plastada 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.259
 here on the wall in this wall over 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.110
 a totem here the hand already had the hand 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.360
 of the brand of the grim reaper like the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.950
 has the words that I put here of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.539
 gelp good this hand already here was 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 meaning something but we did not give us 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.450
 account still here on the watercress wall 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.940
 is what I call the prophecy here 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.720
 in the middle is just the hand and with the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.450
 same brand of good parka only 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.190
 the hand the right hand is worth only 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.679
 the right hand was missing the hand 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.690
 important left this is worth 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.610
 well, there were other maps that 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.459
 they were both hands marked and they had 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.409
 another of which nothing but there was one 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.360
 so by this we deduce that the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.330
 maps that were both hands together 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.310
 it was because they had not cut him yet 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.229
 that person's arm had not been 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 cut off the hand then why 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.340
 we thought I could 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.119
 Peter McKay, although we do not have that clear 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.149
 but it could also be that being that comes out 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.640
 in black and white who but numan 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.910
 but we'll talk about that more 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.420
 forward that there were who shangri-la so 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.090
 important that there was so important here 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 Look for when we finished the stress 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.670
 what was in the tombstone territory 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.550
 the two hands marked high above 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.700
 of the tombstone the two hands marked 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 which means that that person that being 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.550
 He was here also and the importance of 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:45.840
 these two hands there are no textures there 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.930
 realities and here once again you see the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.120
 reality of those two hands still remains 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.810
 much to discover but little by little 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.630
 we will all get the truth from 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.520
 this incredible story to like 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.520
 subscribed and until the next video
