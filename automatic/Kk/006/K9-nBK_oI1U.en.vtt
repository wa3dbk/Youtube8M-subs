no way to make a spear out of this knife
I<00:03:26.660> think<00:03:27.530> that's<00:03:27.680> a<00:03:27.799> very<00:03:27.949> intelligent<00:03:28.340> move

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079

here<00:03:30.079> are<00:03:30.169> some<00:03:30.319> aspects<00:03:30.799> I<00:03:30.980> don't<00:03:31.250> like<00:03:31.459> as

here are some aspects I don't like as
much<00:03:31.699> I<00:03:32.150> like<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.079> ferrocerium<00:03:33.560> Robert<00:03:34.010> I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.039 
much I like the ferrocerium Robert I
don't<00:03:34.250> like<00:03:34.760> where<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.090> placed<00:03:35.480> it's<00:03:35.780> right

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
don't like where it's placed it's right

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.539 
don't like where it's placed it's right
in<00:03:36.169> the<00:03:36.290> way<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.980> would<00:03:37.129> be<00:03:37.220> better<00:03:37.430> right

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
in the way it would be better right

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.240 
in the way it would be better right
there<00:03:38.030> or<00:03:38.239> right<00:03:38.629> there<00:03:38.900> as<00:03:39.109> it<00:03:39.829> stands<00:03:40.099> right

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
there or right there as it stands right

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.909 
there or right there as it stands right
now<00:03:40.579> it's<00:03:40.819> kind<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.389> hard<00:03:41.449> to<00:03:41.720> pull<00:03:41.930> out<00:03:42.139> but

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
now it's kind of hard to pull out but

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.490 
now it's kind of hard to pull out but
I'm<00:03:43.069> assuming<00:03:43.639> that's<00:03:44.269> because<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.019> new<00:03:45.230> if

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500

I'm assuming that's because it's new if
you've<00:03:46.370> noticed<00:03:46.579> I've<00:03:46.879> done<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.180> little

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
you've noticed I've done a little

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.670 
you've noticed I've done a little
scraping<00:03:47.840> there<00:03:47.959> just<00:03:48.199> to<00:03:48.260> get<00:03:48.410> rid<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.620> the

scraping there just to get rid of the
