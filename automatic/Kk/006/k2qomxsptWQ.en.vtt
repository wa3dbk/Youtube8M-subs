00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.230
 very good welcome to another analysis 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.720
 of Microsoft inside air in this case not 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.790
 tell us about umÃ­a 630 that although 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.340
 we did the first analysis in this 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.599
 case already touches us because we did it in 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.040
 this case let's talk about this 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.410
 portable charger that came with the 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.820
 phone that I bought the other day and good 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.250
 let's do what is both the 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 unboxing like a little see how it works 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.920
 we proceed first to remove it from here 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 we have to say that unboxing is not going to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.140
 be easy because it resists a bit already 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.580
 I have done other tests because in doing so 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.480
 the first attempt at am boxing is 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.480
 difficult but good 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.360
 something had to be left less for a 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.050
 side 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.490
 and we let it look good we have a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.560
 good amount of manuals 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.600
 more instructions than those that come with 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.339
 own number 630 and with others 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.469
 phones 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.829
 it remains true it is surprising because it is 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.450
 a laptop charger does not require 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.810
 much knowledge of this I do not know nor by 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.750
 what they have not done without or have not 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 thrown away but good comes with us 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 a very simple cable that allows us 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 load the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.280
 in our portable charger so 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.360
 pretty simple 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.220
 and it does not focus well and on the other hand 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.850
 we have what is the charger itself 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.189
 laptop 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.409
 the charger is very simple comes with the 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.090
 north logo from behind and with this 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.460
 band indicating the level of charge for 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.470
 the other side 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 we proceed to open it to see if this time 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.630
 he does not resist 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 It must be said that this charger attracts 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.390
 fingerprints in a way 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 pretty impressive we have this and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.230
 this as we have commented and on the one hand 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.090
 we have to remove the cable connect it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.040
 to the phone and the other side is charged 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.680
 by micro usb using the cable that we have 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.500
 seen before 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.259
 if we remove the cable it will light up and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.180
 it will indicate the state and then the method 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.890
 of operation is as simple as 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.770
 we see now 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.770
 we connect it with the lumen 925 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 it is automatically loading 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.580
 in this retractable cable we can put it 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.470
 inside and it will stay charging without 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.510
 that give any kind of problem so 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.040
 that we have a portable charger connected 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.370
 to our mobile phone 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.650
 perfectly 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.659
 well this has been all the truth is that 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.569
 as I said it was going to be an analysis 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.180
 very very short and denier for much more 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.620
 but I hope you liked it and we 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.450
 we see in following analyzes of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.110
 microsoft insights 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.110
 see you later
