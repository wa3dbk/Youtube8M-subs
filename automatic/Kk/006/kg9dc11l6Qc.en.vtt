00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello how about youtube friends and in time 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.200
 that I did not make videos but I already came back and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.360
 I came back with a creepy pasta the creepy 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.840
 pasta this animal crossing 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.820
 well let's start with the believe pipes is 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.820
 I still remember that day when I bought 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.880
 that game fuck what bigger trauma 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.550
 well this is my story I wish someone 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 I managed to believe what happened to me one day 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.930
 I was in my house lying on my bed 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 boring as usual I did not know 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 what do all the games that I have in 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.770
 my 3ds had already finished them all 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.500
 even the games that I had on my pc 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 after a while I got the idea 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.600
 to go to a place where they sold things 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.090
 old to see what I was after 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.610
 I took the keys at home I fed him 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 my pets I left my house I closed the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 door with insurance and I went to wait for the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.750
 truck to go where they sold things 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.000
 old after like 20 minutes spent 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 the truck I got on him I sat on a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.150
 seat next to me there was an old man 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 the old man with a very hoarse voice told me 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.880
 And where are you going, young man? 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.250
 I answered and said I'm going to a place in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.180
 where they sell old things to see me 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.840
 I find out there 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 the old man told me I'll just tell you one thing 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 young man be careful what you buy 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.270
 you may be surprised afterwards 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.310
 that he told me that the truck had already 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 reached the last stop I got off the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
 truck when I looked back from me 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.420
 the old man was not there anymore I did not take him 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.000
 importance and I went walking a stretch 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.610
 to get to my destination since already 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.340
 I was there I began to walk watching the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 things that I had then I called the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 attention a place where there was a guy 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.530
 selling used games I approached 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.750
 look and I looked I could not believe it was a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 game was to encourage crossing julie 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.650
 but something was wrong 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.080
 the game box was all battered 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.510
 I opened the box was the cartridge of my 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.670
 frame without nuclear was torn from the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.350
 label what surprised me was that 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.340
 I had a blood stain on the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.800
 game tag 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.330
 I heard a strange voice behind me and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:16.319
 He told me, wait, do not look at me, just listen 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.840
 that game you have in your hands 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.730
 belonged to my son who died recently 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.459
 I want you to take it I was a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.370
 little scared for what he told me I went 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.190
 from there and I took the game after I called 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.250
 I told a friend that if he came for me 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.739
 he said yes after a while 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.380
 he arrived I got into his car and told him what 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.049
 what had happened to me he did not believe what 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.420
 I had told him later we reached my 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.030
 I got out of his car and I entered my home 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.120
 house there was no one was completely 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.790
 Only my pets were there after 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.700
 to be inside my house I took my 3ds and 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.129
 place the game in my 3ds the game is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.319
 had put there was something weird there had not been 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.720
 put the title screen only 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.400
 a character appeared outside a house 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.920
 the name of the mouse character 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.140
 look at the profile the character had all 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.049
 the badges where the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.129
 picture there were some strange marks I did not know 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.680
 what was it about 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:18.079
 then I proceeded to explore the town not 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.629
 there were houses or trees the ground instead 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.879
 of the pasture were paths of blood I 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:25.069
 I scared a little to see that they had also 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.349
 dead characters were all 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.659
 quartered and crushed with the 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.810
 guts and organs coming out they looked very 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.209
 big after the screen went black 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.760
 about 10 seconds and one appeared 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.430
 My picture was dead with arms and feet 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.409
 cut me to see that photo I got scared 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.769
 a lot and a message appeared on the 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.650
 screen that said why are you here not 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.200
 bother me after the screen started 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.750
 to emit static I felt that someone 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.939
 was behind me after I heard a 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.970
 scream in my backyard I went to 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:02.360
 investigate I could not believe it 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.850
 it was a mother was dead I was 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.640
 tied to the neck had the organs 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.910
 hanging from the stomach I cried out in fear 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.860
 I was desperate I did not know what to do 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.500
 then I called the police they arrived 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.709
 After a while they found my 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.480
 dead mother interrogated me I could not 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.790
 talk about the fear and trauma I had 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.220
 then they took me to a psychiatric 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.220
 to recover from the trauma but not 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.320
 I can overcome it and here I am telling you 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.810
