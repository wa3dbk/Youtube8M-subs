00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
definitely GTA IV was a good game but

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
if you played the campaign Kent Paul do

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.749 
if you played the campaign Kent Paul do
is<00:04:55.669> a<00:04:55.759> royal<00:04:56.000> back<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.659> San<00:04:57.050> Andres<00:04:57.500> so<00:04:58.250> it

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
is a royal back to San Andres so it

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.490 
is a royal back to San Andres so it
kinda<00:04:59.150> does<00:04:59.300> kept<00:04:59.449> me<00:04:59.569> thinking<00:04:59.599> whether<00:05:00.169> if

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
kinda does kept me thinking whether if

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.559 
kinda does kept me thinking whether if
there<00:05:00.830> will<00:05:01.009> be<00:05:01.250> past<00:05:01.490> characters<00:05:02.030> coming

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
there will be past characters coming

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.879 
there will be past characters coming
back<00:05:02.719> to<00:05:03.139> the<00:05:03.800> next<00:05:04.009> GTA<00:05:04.370> so<00:05:05.000> for<00:05:05.210> example<00:05:05.889> when

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
back to the next GTA so for example when

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.399 
back to the next GTA so for example when
GTA<00:05:07.219> 6<00:05:07.550> hits<00:05:07.759> the<00:05:07.940> stores<00:05:08.180> or<00:05:08.389> whatever<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:09.080> I

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
GTA 6 hits the stores or whatever and I

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.080 
GTA 6 hits the stores or whatever and I
wonder<00:05:09.949> if<00:05:10.099> there<00:05:10.310> will<00:05:10.400> be<00:05:10.460> possible

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
wonder if there will be possible

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.809 
wonder if there will be possible
characters<00:05:11.509> from<00:05:11.659> the<00:05:11.900> previous<00:05:11.930> GTA<00:05:12.819> like
