you can't eat a strawberry Costas this
one<00:04:45.660> didn't<00:04:45.900> have<00:04:46.050> much<00:04:46.229> strawberry<00:04:46.500> but

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
one didn't have much strawberry but

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.620 
one didn't have much strawberry but
overall<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.310> little<00:04:50.640> bit<00:04:50.760> we<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.240> not

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
overall it's a little bit we of not

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.159 
overall it's a little bit we of not
going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> try<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.229> strawberry<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.190> 11-1

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
going to try the strawberry and 11-1

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.580 
going to try the strawberry and 11-1
okay<00:04:55.169> this<00:04:55.320> time<00:04:55.470> we're<00:04:55.620> gonna<00:04:55.740> take<00:04:55.890> this<00:04:56.039> one

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
okay this time we're gonna take this one

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.779 
okay this time we're gonna take this one
okay<00:04:58.590> so<00:04:58.650> i<00:04:58.830> think<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.250> strawberry<00:04:59.669> one

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
okay so i think the strawberry one

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.150 
okay so i think the strawberry one
tastes<00:05:00.090> better<00:05:00.260> because<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.410> lemon<00:05:01.680> tastes

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
tastes better because the lemon tastes

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.110 
tastes better because the lemon tastes
really<00:05:02.370> um<00:05:03.110> weird<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.590> I<00:05:04.860> don't<00:05:05.760> know<00:05:05.940> it

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
really um weird like I don't know it

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.900 
really um weird like I don't know it
doesn't<00:05:06.390> really<00:05:06.510> taste<00:05:06.630> like<00:05:07.160> lemon<00:05:08.160> because

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
doesn't really taste like lemon because

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.610 
doesn't really taste like lemon because
I<00:05:09.120> guess<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:09.840> because<00:05:09.930> it's<00:05:10.229> not<00:05:10.320> sour

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
I guess it's because it's not sour

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.680 
I guess it's because it's not sour
because<00:05:11.520> you<00:05:11.760> don't<00:05:11.940> pucker<00:05:12.090> or<00:05:12.330> anything

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
because you don't pucker or anything

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.990 
because you don't pucker or anything
it's<00:05:12.900> just<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:14.190> know<00:05:14.220> it's<00:05:14.340> lemon<00:05:14.760> but<00:05:14.910> it

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
it's just you know it's lemon but it

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.930 
it's just you know it's lemon but it
doesn't<00:05:15.300> really<00:05:15.510> taste<00:05:15.930> like<00:05:16.289> lemon<00:05:16.530> so<00:05:16.940> the

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
doesn't really taste like lemon so the

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.400 
doesn't really taste like lemon so the
strawberry<00:05:18.300> one<00:05:18.419> tastes<00:05:18.690> better<00:05:18.810> definitely

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
strawberry one tastes better definitely

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.860 
strawberry one tastes better definitely
but<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.400> think<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:21.060> kid<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.300> actually<00:05:21.720> really

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
but I think this kid is actually really

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.779 
but I think this kid is actually really
really<00:05:21.990> cute<00:05:22.410> and<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.950> really<00:05:23.280> enjoyed<00:05:23.580> making

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
really cute and I really enjoyed making

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.740 
really cute and I really enjoyed making
this<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.780> um<00:05:25.229> it<00:05:25.620> wasn't<00:05:25.830> as<00:05:26.039> bad<00:05:26.280> as<00:05:26.750> because

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
this so um it wasn't as bad as because

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.920 
this so um it wasn't as bad as because
you<00:05:28.289> might<00:05:28.470> know<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.680> crazy<00:05:29.130> actually<00:05:29.930> sold

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
you might know that crazy actually sold

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.380 
you might know that crazy actually sold
another<00:05:31.350> kid<00:05:31.650> last<00:05:31.830> time<00:05:32.070> where<00:05:32.340> you<00:05:32.580> they

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
another kid last time where you they

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.300 
another kid last time where you they
gave<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:33.960> little<00:05:34.229> different<00:05:34.590> colors<00:05:35.070> in

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
gave you little different colors in

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.010 
gave you little different colors in
light<00:05:35.520> tubes<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.210> then<00:05:36.300> you<00:05:36.419> can<00:05:36.600> mold<00:05:36.810> them

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
light tubes and then you can mold them

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.590 
light tubes and then you can mold them
into<00:05:37.050> anything<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:38.060> really<00:05:39.060> didn't<00:05:39.360> like<00:05:39.419> that

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
into anything I really didn't like that

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.409 
into anything I really didn't like that
kid<00:05:39.840> because<00:05:40.169> it<00:05:40.470> was<00:05:40.680> very<00:05:41.039> sticky<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.330> it

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
kid because it was very sticky that it

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.779 
kid because it was very sticky that it
was<00:05:42.539> way<00:05:42.750> too<00:05:42.780> sticky<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.650> too<00:05:44.190> hard<00:05:44.220> to<00:05:44.520> mold

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
was way too sticky and too hard to mold

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.940 
was way too sticky and too hard to mold
with<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.180> this<00:05:45.330> one<00:05:45.479> was<00:05:45.659> okay

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
with but this one was okay

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.890 
with but this one was okay
stay<00:05:47.160> at<00:05:47.370> least<00:05:47.580> gave<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:47.880> mode<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.540> also

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
stay at least gave you mode and also

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.250 
stay at least gave you mode and also
there's<00:05:49.830> also<00:05:50.010> some<00:05:50.220> leftovers<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.870> I<00:05:51.900> didn't

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
there's also some leftovers so I didn't

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.790 
there's also some leftovers so I didn't
use<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.410> all<00:05:52.740> of<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.250> gummy<00:05:54.650> so<00:05:55.650> yeah

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
use that all of the gummy so yeah

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.380 
use that all of the gummy so yeah
overall<00:05:56.220> I<00:05:56.280> think<00:05:56.340> this<00:05:56.580> is<00:05:56.640> pretty<00:05:56.970> good<00:05:57.210> and

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
overall I think this is pretty good and

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.820 
overall I think this is pretty good and
I<00:05:58.350> do<00:05:58.680> suggest<00:05:59.040> that<00:05:59.460> if<00:05:59.760> you<00:05:59.940> would<00:06:00.120> like<00:06:00.240> to
