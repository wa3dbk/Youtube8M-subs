00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 hello we are in friesland 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 I'm going through the bait with you today 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.570
 a little different between the two 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.390
 it then correct such 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.910
 and then you make two really hard 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.050
 we should not pay attention 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:26.700
 just go nice cooper you watch it 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.140
 water is our house tonight and it is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.869
 my little floortje 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.560
 but the pike knows that the search 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.010
 are too large by the shoe could weather 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.640
 hearts are flowing in that direction 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.380
 well at perfect you there and a good one too 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.770
 always that way 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.110
 well it is actually quite special 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.990
 making you fish and doing the tahiti lip 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.440
 you actually score transparent for an hour 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.259
 tim there is also a you fear that is for 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.130
 the depth because if you leave like that 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.550
 surface then the believers do not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.550
 must fish that sink pretty deep as one 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.150
 kinda chic so it gives one 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.320
 very nice action in it cool is of the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.320
 brand sleep expert 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.250
 light code works as follows you help the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.250
 pin out 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:35.240
 don't lose porridge to fish 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.590
 you do him in your day just means that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.770
 you the tank that I everyone 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.770
 look 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.680
 bit difficult always aim 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.780
 oh so comes home 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:33.150
 yes if not so difficult come tomorrow 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:39.510
 you're in a lot of the elevator 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:43.020
 suitcases is that they got me dead on them 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.970
 it just seems or 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.710
 you need a Frisian band with a shift 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.310
 with lures 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:54.720
 because it is actually just winning in 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.650
 throwing in the edges is sweet 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.650
 give a little tap 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.490
 this fish stinks very much in our 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.750
 fridge and that's why it takes a long time 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.110
 odor trace 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.350
 by the water that is the beauty of death 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.350
 bait 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.710
 the bottle with the details with you 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.830
 god is less active 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.790
 I think it's every thing 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.790
 yes less fun 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.740

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:41.310
 yes found a nice pike and 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.650
 tomorrow together they look or you 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.180
 can click out another pike 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:51.390
 but first we go to sleep 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.050
 nice dream about the sweets and all 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.050
 fish
