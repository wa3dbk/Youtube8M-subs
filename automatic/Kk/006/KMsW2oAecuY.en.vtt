up<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.950> g3<00:00:11.670> color<00:00:11.910> scheme<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.509> thought<00:00:13.019> it'd

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
up in a g3 color scheme I thought it'd

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.330 
up in a g3 color scheme I thought it'd
make<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.259> quick<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.740> video<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.250> give

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340

I'm working on as you can see here I
have<00:00:18.570> done<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.109> hexagon<00:00:20.100> pattern<00:00:20.130> across<00:00:20.850> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
have done a hexagon pattern across the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.200 
have done a hexagon pattern across the
shield<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> laid<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.340> base<00:00:23.910> coat

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
shield here so I laid down the base coat

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
shield here so I laid down the base coat
which<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.080> custom<00:00:25.800> gray<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.430> I'm<00:00:26.490> getting

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
which is this custom gray so I'm getting

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.089 
which is this custom gray so I'm getting
ready<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> spray<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> next<00:00:28.289> color<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> did

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
ready to spray the next color what I did

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
ready to spray the next color what I did
was<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.400> laid<00:00:29.910> out<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.240> entire<00:00:30.510> pattern

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
was I just laid out the entire pattern

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.479 
was I just laid out the entire pattern
and<00:00:31.380> what<00:00:31.470> I'm<00:00:31.529> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.830> now<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.189> actually

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
and what I'm going to do now is actually

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
and what I'm going to do now is actually
just<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.730> through<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> carefully<00:00:33.719> remove<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
just go through and carefully remove a

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
just go through and carefully remove a
few<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.890> these<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> next<00:00:36.120> layer<00:00:36.300> I'll

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
few of these because the next layer I'll

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.350 
few of these because the next layer I'll
just<00:00:36.780> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.559> those<00:00:37.680> pieces<00:00:37.890> back<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
just kind of put those pieces back and I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.580 
just kind of put those pieces back and I
just<00:00:39.390> laid<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.840> whole<00:00:39.960> thing<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just laid out the whole thing so that I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.069 
just laid out the whole thing so that I
can<00:00:40.829> get<00:00:41.190> all<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> spacing<00:00:42.180> correct<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.840> was

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
can get all the spacing correct I was

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.139 
can get all the spacing correct I was
going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.590> pretty<00:00:44.309> much<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.610> entire<00:00:44.820> kit

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
going to do pretty much the entire kit

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.660 
going to do pretty much the entire kit
with<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> fractal<00:00:46.200> hexagon<00:00:46.710> pattern<00:00:47.100> but

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with the fractal hexagon pattern but

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150 
with the fractal hexagon pattern but
unfortunately<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.660> screwed<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> used

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
unfortunately I screwed up and I used

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
unfortunately I screwed up and I used
the<00:00:50.399> wrong<00:00:50.550> color<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> chest<00:00:52.410> Parts

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the wrong color on like the chest Parts

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
the wrong color on like the chest Parts
I<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.190> spent<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:54.030> testing<00:00:54.629> on

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I had spent a lot of time testing on

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
I had spent a lot of time testing on
different<00:00:55.050> color<00:00:55.230> schemes<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.949> everything

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
different color schemes and everything

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
different color schemes and everything
and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.969> decided<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> liked<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and I decided on what I liked and then I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.130 
and I decided on what I liked and then I
went<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.250> sprayed<00:00:59.609> these<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.600> used<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
went and sprayed these and I used the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.869 
went and sprayed these and I used the
wrong<00:01:01.320> color<00:01:01.680> yeah<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
wrong color yeah and then I kind of

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.030 
wrong color yeah and then I kind of
decided<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.600> liked<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.110> color<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.619> used

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
decided I really liked the color I used

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.520 
decided I really liked the color I used
so<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> happy<00:01:06.600> accident<00:01:06.630> as<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
so it was a happy accident as you can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.039 
so it was a happy accident as you can
see<00:01:07.619> I've<00:01:07.710> painted<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> armor<00:01:08.520> parts<00:01:09.049> now

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
see I've painted all the armor parts now

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.929 
see I've painted all the armor parts now
I'm<00:01:10.140> working<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.619> frame<00:01:11.220> got<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.790> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
I'm working on the frame got to get that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
I'm working on the frame got to get that
cleaned<00:01:12.240> up<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.930> spent<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> couple<00:01:13.740> days

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
cleaned up and spent a couple days

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.330 
cleaned up and spent a couple days
cleaning<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.830> quickly<00:01:17.009> paint

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
cleaning that up and just quickly paint

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.340 
cleaning that up and just quickly paint
through<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:18.299> probably<00:01:18.570> gonna<00:01:18.750> skip<00:01:19.049> some

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
through it I'm probably gonna skip some

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.100 
through it I'm probably gonna skip some
of<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> parts<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.509> visible<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of the parts that are not visible and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
of the parts that are not visible and
just<00:01:22.320> focus<00:01:22.740> mostly<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> joints

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
just focus mostly on like the joints

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.730 
just focus mostly on like the joints
that<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.119> visible<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.560> worry

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
that are visible and just not worry

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
that are visible and just not worry
about<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.040> rest<00:01:26.390> reason<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.420> did<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> was

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
about the rest reason I did this was

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.249 
about the rest reason I did this was
because<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.259> kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.799> redesigned<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:30.259> hexagon

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
because I kind of redesigned the hexagon

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.679 
because I kind of redesigned the hexagon
pieces<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> sheet<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> just

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
pieces so this is a sheet of just

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.859 
pieces so this is a sheet of just
hexagon<00:01:34.650> shapes<00:01:35.329> pull<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.450> off<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:38.869> you

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
hexagon shapes pull one off here so you

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.620 
hexagon shapes pull one off here so you
can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.610> same<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
can see the same as what you see on the
