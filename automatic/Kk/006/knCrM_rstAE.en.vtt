if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.720> crochet<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.380> do<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.829> you'll

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
if you crochet like I do then you'll

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.319 
if you crochet like I do then you'll
know<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> very<00:01:32.909> simple

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
know that this is a very simple

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240 
know that this is a very simple
technique<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.259> only<00:01:34.439> difference<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.009> you're

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
technique the only difference is you're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
technique the only difference is you're
adding<00:01:35.579> more<00:01:35.610> hair<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.540> almost<00:01:36.750> like

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
adding more hair in so it's almost like
