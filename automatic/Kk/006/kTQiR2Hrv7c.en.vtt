so it's look like this these are going

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.110 
so it's look like this these are going
to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.140> arms<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:57.200> movable<00:01:59.360> no<00:02:01.520> take<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.850> ball

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
to be arms a movable no take the ball

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.120 
to be arms a movable no take the ball
and<00:02:03.420> detect<00:02:04.350> B<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:06.290> when<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.800> miss<00:02:08.330> no<00:02:10.010> put<00:02:11.010> it

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
and detect B and when I miss no put it

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.460 
and detect B and when I miss no put it
on<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> bottom<00:02:11.940> it's<00:02:12.570> going<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:12.990> like<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
on the bottom it's going to be like a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.250 
on the bottom it's going to be like a
wheel<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:14.670> doesn't<00:02:15.090> roll<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.690> have<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.050> do

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
wheel it doesn't roll so you have to do
