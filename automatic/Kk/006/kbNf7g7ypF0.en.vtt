00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
it and then we have three branches which

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
it and then we have three branches which
include<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> text<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> color<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> font

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
so if i open up the text here you can go

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.940 
so if i open up the text here you can go
