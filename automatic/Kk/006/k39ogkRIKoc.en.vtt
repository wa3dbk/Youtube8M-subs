00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 and 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello to everyone, game pilot of the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.299
 show and games remind reviews of games for 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.140
 mobile devices but the microphone like 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.720
 normal shock went yes today with us 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.880
 game from the series Prince of Persia which is not 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 needs to be presented but 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.170
 submission needs our hero 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.860
 release prince of persia the shadow and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.170
 the flame 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.119
 and if you are sufficiently oldfag 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.489
 you probably already pricked up your ears and 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.160
 correctly made the author the series is 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.170
 gentleman named jordan monkey who 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.790
 engaged in the game we divide even from the time when 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.350
 people hunted mammoths 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.270
 in 1989 he released 1 prince who 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.880
 at that time, was smooth and 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.280
 realistic animation because 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.570
 the model was used by brother jordan 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.460
 captured on video well, and in 1993 came the second 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.320
 a game called prince of persia 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.360
 the shadow and the flame 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.269
 she was distinguished by the presence of some 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.000
 plot and cooler study but here 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.909
 it is what we talk about today rather well 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.100
 her and a remake which is your Alan Yubisoft 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.820
 graphics as you see with this here 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.549
 a little better than it was in 1993 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.350
 turned out bright but not too juicy 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.270
 not so much that the eyes are watering 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 and flowed out after a few minutes of play 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.290
 character animation me too basically 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.330
 liked I don't know whether 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.880
 and this time used brother Jordan 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.010
 but it turned out pretty well besides 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.810
 plot which incidentally differs from 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.909
 original but not too level 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.229
 They offer us achivki which to 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.020
 unfortunately only three 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.759
 and they are unchanged find it improved q 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.619
 health pass the level as possible 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.110
 faster we open all one hundred percent 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.780
 level which is not so easy considering 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.380
 hidden rooms traps and closing 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.659
 the doors 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.600
 but generally it would be sad 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.030
 come up and more and then bohik also 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.340
 It became a little more varied at the prince now 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.590
 There are several companies as well as the possibility 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.659
 put blocks at the same time stunning the enemy 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.850
 but better of course to use stealth 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.640
 killing coming up behind you and putting 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.590
 just one death blow is better 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.569
 because because of the curved control 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.980
 fight without loss of health is bad 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.970
 it turns out yes 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.300
 control 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.920
 the weak side of the game is two options 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.290
 control in gesture mode and interface 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.660
 on and control gesture mode immediately 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.150
 I say the wildest crap any wrong 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.580
 movement and the prince starts doing something 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.380
 what not to do well and the interface 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.570
 even though you yourself can 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.090
 set icons still need 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.240
 accuracy almost inaccessible to man 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.280
 still in the game there is a donut possible without it 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.770
 but somehow difficult potion treatment 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.810
 quickly run out of gun inflicts a little 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.240
 want a cool sword full of damage 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.180
 health pay pockets summarize 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.260
 a game of solid four of 6 points 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.480
 why from 6 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.850
 yes the devil knows it in short 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.340
 you can get pleasure from it but 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.830
 orgasm does not bring it today 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
 if you like the video tell everything 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.220
 Nikolay Podgursky was with you with the world 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 and Fedor about fashion 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700
 but
