00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
is how he interacts with his teammates I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
have a lot of room to improve and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.959 
have a lot of room to improve and
various<00:02:14.709> like<00:02:14.889> the<00:02:15.040> most<00:02:15.249> experienced<00:02:15.760> player

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
various like the most experienced player

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.910

definitely a confident player he came in

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.000 
definitely a confident player he came in
at<00:02:41.920> 15<00:02:42.430> years<00:02:42.459> old<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.350> somehow<00:02:44.350> managed<00:02:44.890> to

win the biggest prize pool outside of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.979 
win the biggest prize pool outside of
the<00:02:47.860> International<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:49.300> lot<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.840> had

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
the International and a lot of that had

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.570 
the International and a lot of that had
to<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.260> his<00:02:50.500> confidence<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.100> himself<00:02:51.250> if

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
to do with his confidence in himself if

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.820 
to do with his confidence in himself if
he<00:02:51.730> didn't<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.620> under<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.800> that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
he didn't have that under all that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.860 
he didn't have that under all that
pressure<00:02:54.280> i<00:02:54.519> think<00:02:54.850> most<00:02:55.180> players<00:02:55.480> would<00:02:55.750> have

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
pressure i think most players would have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350 
pressure i think most players would have
