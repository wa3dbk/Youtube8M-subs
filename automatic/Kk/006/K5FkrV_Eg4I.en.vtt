00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:13.309
 new video today for you or unboxing 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:16.820
 the risk of 360 4gb version part 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 there is a story since he is with money 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.199
 for which I have already done unboxing 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.320
 yesterday but this was not the case 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.260
 it worked guys then they have it 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.170
 replaced and now we are boxing 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.610
 because yes because I like it 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 then we see that the pop singer and the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.780
 xbox 360 slim for six went 4 gigabytes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.129
 but we can see the live box functions 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.510
 that's all hdmi facebook twitter the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:56.570
 social part then another bit of 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:01.910
 presentation here we have in advertising 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:04.329
 and what acts of a good sangio sack 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.329
 Canary 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.320
 let's start immediately by removing the sticker 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.140
 without perhaps destroying them because they do 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:25.090
 let's never see if I can try it 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.090
 since they are right then here it is 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.600
 we have some mit 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.310
 we open consulates on the text they have 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.710
 already Chinese sauna let's say or is given 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.159
 that now seems to have come to microsoft 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.210
 stew 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:03.829
 because French is necessary 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.229
 ok let's go immediately to open and find 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.160
 now that it is not for the part that is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.160
 I show the contents 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:22.040
 the giant transformer guys 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:30.519
 with a friend and cristian is huge 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.519
 we can then find the component socket 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.970
 then we can find the laskhar gah 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:46.420
 in the torres prison 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:51.190
 and then we find the various differences 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:55.000
 manuals freedom they both freedom 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.380
 I understood how to turn on a 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.040
 controller 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:04.900
 in case you did n't see the check 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:08.850
 happy helmet turn on the need not even one 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:18.090
 buchetto we also have what appears 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:18.090
 the black check of the rim have suffered 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:33.280
 immediately we find the control I was 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:39.959
 very nice classic of yours that you 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:44.980
 aim with included or streets 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.540
 automatic duracell anomaly you are 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.830
 in the spinning there were no for this 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.830
 I think a car garage is needed 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:04:01.000
 and then the inter think a little first console 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.950
 currently the console has never disappeared 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.500
 usually nobody cares much 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.099
 even if those things weren't very cool 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.170
 this is good we do fast as well 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:16.230
 on the other hand we raise and begin the 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:25.250
 fed 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:25.250
 in this rome we start in April we are 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.030
 we are the other side too guys 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:44.570
 we are practically here 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.680
 my little one and here we read it 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.689
 the xbox 360 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.430
 this here and the xbox 360 slim guys 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:00.479
 beautiful I have to say fantastic color 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.629
 matt black 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.969
 here the compartment is switched on by itself 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:11.719
 nistico to the postman for face also 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:14.309
 this for the disk compartment and I know it though 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:18.439
 behind we can find various attacks 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:22.020
 including three usb boys three usb because 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:26.330
 12 were not enough we can find the 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 HDMI attacks on the various HDMI scarts 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:36.689
 ethernet and for the power supply ok 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.020
 these were the reason accounts now we do 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:45.149
 a quick review of the contents 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 we have a fantastic xbox 360 slim the 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:52.439
 his beautiful controller too 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:55.139
 bless they think boxing because one 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:06:01.740
 boxing not unboxing if you do n't know honor box 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:04.860
 of boxing day boxing is that the batteries the 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.070
 morosa, I don't think you will like it 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.600
 this video 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.600

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:21.380
 Venus, let's not vote no, there is 96 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:24.030
 let's make another point some 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.800
 track 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.440
 we open the feeder frying because 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.630
 they absolutely see them size 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.940
 been the console because it really is 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.660
 signal guys but I do n't really see 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.660
 great 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.590
 of course 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.780
 excuse the next one 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:53.870
 here turns run guys look 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:07:01.449
 the size compared to the console is 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:04.280
 really a big one we can then the 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:08.060
 power supply call to be connected 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.590
 to the transformer and consecutively to the 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:22.360
 current 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:27.639
 obviously then we find the cable for 

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.639
 we are also this component 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:41.150
 the release I think is really necessary 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.150
 to reject it 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:50.640
 and the various channels that I am certainly not 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:54.330
 I put the boys to read well the idea that 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:59.280
 this was the content 

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:04.590
 the xbox against cables lie everything 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:08.880
 the academy is not included and manual seas 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:15.360
 and everything in the boys this area the xbox 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:19.130
