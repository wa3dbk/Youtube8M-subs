 inappropriate advertising and I apologize 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.210

 they allow us to try the program this 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.369
 would be 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.509
 to copy and paste it once it 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.640
 performs the installation and we provide 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.930

 the installation of the office 2016 this 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.409
 It takes a few minutes we'll have to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.060
 wait for the necessary time once 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.770

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.539
 downloading directly from the from 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.310
 the site and the download was already a bit 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.530
 advanced I'm going to process the video and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.700
 then when it's over we're going to continue 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 you will have to wait for the time 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.539
 necessary that will depend a lot on the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.860
 speed they have in their plan 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.110
 internet as you can see here the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.000
 discharge carries by 74 percent and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.530
 advancing well once the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.539
 installation we will have this 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.709
 animated presentation here about what 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.970
 what is the office and where are we going to 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.430
 find the icons in the event that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.410
 let's have windows 8 windows 10 and those 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.510
 things and here the button close and well 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.870
 let's go here to start as you will see 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.400
 let's find here word 2016 to see 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 probably you appear here 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.530
 yes they have windows 10 and not on the menu 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.050
 subway 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.610
 and as you will see also I have word 2013 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.500
 that means we can 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.300
 quietly try the programs of 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.880
 office 2016 without losing our 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.180
 previous installation of the office 2003 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.050
 let's open the word 2016 I'm going to close 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.209
 this and to start a blank document 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.470
 we click here to accept well as 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.150
 you will see here in this yellow band of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.620
 information tells us that this is a 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.060
 evaluation version as you know the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.800
 program just comes out and there is no 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.180
 no crack activator so 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.170
 we can simply prove it during 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.060
 150 days or so in about 4 or 5 months 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.000
 more or less what to try this 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.890
 new 2016 that finds we will notice 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.170
 which tells us that we are in a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.120
 evaluation period we do not have the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650
 Complete product if you want it 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.019
 buy simply describe who 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.880
 will convert complete and you should continue 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.500
 the steps so you can install the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.660
 full program here we will be able to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.540
 change the subject we have here up 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.190
 I'm going to leave it as it is but what 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.870
 What I'm going to do is leave it totally 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.120
 in black color because in friends I hope 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.380
 that this tutorial has been useful for you 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.970
 We can close the yellow band to 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.709
 that do not bother us, do not be a hindrance 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.690
 while we are working they will be able to open 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.880
 the other excel programs may 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.620
 open power point or any other the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.209
 parts of the programs that they need and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.890
 You will see that everyone will show us the 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.959
 same yellow band that tells us what 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.790
 we have for 150 days in the event that 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.350
 come out an activator that leaves us the 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.310
 totally stable program I will be
