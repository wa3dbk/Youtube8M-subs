00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.340

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
now this is a really old slow phone so

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.569 
now this is a really old slow phone so
it's<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> be<00:00:55.920> as<00:00:56.010> smooth<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it's not going to be as smooth as it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.330 
it's not going to be as smooth as it
goes<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.270> dual<00:00:57.600> core<00:00:58.020> or<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
goes on like a dual core or even a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
goes on like a dual core or even a
single<00:01:00.120> core<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.719> epic<00:01:01.109> 4g<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.829> something<00:01:03.890> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
single core like epic 4g or something so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
single core like epic 4g or something so
that's<00:01:05.309> pretty<00:01:05.640> neat<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:09.650> get
