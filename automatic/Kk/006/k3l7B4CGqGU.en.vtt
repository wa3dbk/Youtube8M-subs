00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
just go all the way over here and say i

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.200 
just go all the way over here and say i
just<00:01:57.229> want<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.740> about<00:01:58.159> here<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.760> i<00:01:58.790> just<00:01:58.820> tap<00:01:59.120> on

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
just want it about here so i just tap on

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.680 
just want it about here so i just tap on
the<00:01:59.330> ground<00:01:59.740> we<00:02:00.740> set<00:02:01.010> our<00:02:01.190> second<00:02:01.670> position<00:02:02.060> so

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
the ground we set our second position so

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.990 
the ground we set our second position so
what<00:02:03.140> we<00:02:03.260> can<00:02:03.409> do<00:02:03.590> is<00:02:03.920> we<00:02:04.220> can<00:02:04.250> change<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
what we can do is we can change the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.780 
what we can do is we can change the
whole<00:02:05.210> area<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:05.900> like<00:02:06.080> wood<00:02:06.740> or<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.190> can<00:02:07.370> make<00:02:07.549> a

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
whole area to like wood or we can make a

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.059 
whole area to like wood or we can make a
cut<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.479> ground<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:09.440> make<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.709> cut<00:02:09.979> in

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
cut in the ground so to make a cut in

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.260 
cut in the ground so to make a cut in
the<00:02:10.099> ground<00:02:10.340> all<00:02:10.519> we<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.819> do<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:10.970> this

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the ground all we have to do is this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.170 
the ground all we have to do is this
type<00:02:11.480> in<00:02:11.660> slash<00:02:11.990> slash<00:02:12.560> cut<00:02:13.040> which<00:02:13.730> is<00:02:13.910> very

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
type in slash slash cut which is very

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.690 
type in slash slash cut which is very
very<00:02:14.690> simple<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.319> then<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.130> hit

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
very simple and then you just hit

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.190 
very simple and then you just hit
enter<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.360> then<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.810> going<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:17.989> work

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
enter and then it's going to work

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.170 
enter and then it's going to work
sometimes<00:02:18.950> might<00:02:19.190> freeze<00:02:19.459> for<00:02:19.760> like<00:02:19.879> a<00:02:19.910> few

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
sometimes might freeze for like a few

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660 
sometimes might freeze for like a few
seconds<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:20.810> something<00:02:21.080> like<00:02:21.200> that<00:02:21.670> depending

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
seconds or something like that depending

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.400 
seconds or something like that depending
how<00:02:22.790> big<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.239> made<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.690> but<00:02:23.989> as<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.260> see

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
how big you made this but as you can see

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.400 
how big you made this but as you can see
it<00:02:24.650> is<00:02:24.800> pretty<00:02:25.069> big<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:26.120> pretty<00:02:26.450> big<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.140> now

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
it is pretty big it is pretty big so now

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.199 
it is pretty big it is pretty big so now
if<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.800> want<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.099> cover<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.580> back<00:02:28.790> up<00:02:29.000> all

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
if you want to cover that back up all

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.270 
if you want to cover that back up all
you<00:02:29.300> have<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.900> just<00:02:29.930> type<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.800> actually

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you have to do is just type in actually

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.309 
you have to do is just type in actually
there's<00:02:31.730> two<00:02:31.819> ways<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:32.629> you<00:02:32.930> can

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
there's two ways you can do this you can

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.030 
there's two ways you can do this you can
do<00:02:34.010> /<00:02:34.550> /<00:02:35.090> undo<00:02:35.810> which<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.230> this<00:02:36.380> going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.560> undo

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
do / / undo which is this going to undo

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160 
do / / undo which is this going to undo
what<00:02:37.220> we<00:02:37.340> just<00:02:37.489> did<00:02:37.730> or<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.420> can<00:02:38.569> set<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.900> back

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
what we just did or you can set it back

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.040 
what we just did or you can set it back
to<00:02:39.590> how<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.670> do<00:02:40.790> set<00:02:41.180> and<00:02:41.450> then

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
to how it was so you can do set and then

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.020 
to how it was so you can do set and then
the<00:02:42.440> block<00:02:42.799> ID<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.610> can<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:43.819> whatever

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
the block ID so you can do whatever

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.479 
the block ID so you can do whatever
block<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:44.630> say<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.870> wanted<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.620> TNT<00:02:46.280> I

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
block so say I wanted it to be TNT I

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.780 
block so say I wanted it to be TNT I
just<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.209> 46<00:02:47.989> which<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:48.500> block<00:02:48.739> ID<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.400> TNT

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
just do 46 which is the block ID for TNT

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.880 
just do 46 which is the block ID for TNT
so<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.030> can<00:02:50.180> just<00:02:50.209> press<00:02:50.480> next<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:50.959> as<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.799> can

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
so I can just press next and as you can

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.520 
so I can just press next and as you can
see<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.340> just<00:02:52.549> change<00:02:52.819> all<00:02:53.090> into<00:02:53.720> TNT<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
see that just change all into TNT so

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
that's that's really cool so if you a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.680 
that's that's really cool so if you a
builder<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.530> can't<00:02:57.799> really<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:58.160> stuffed

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
builder and you can't really be stuffed

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.660 
builder and you can't really be stuffed
just<00:02:59.690> you<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.870> put<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.860> one<00:03:01.099> by<00:03:01.280> one<00:03:01.489> by

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
just you know put in this one by one by

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.729 
just you know put in this one by one by
one<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.390> can<00:03:02.599> just<00:03:02.720> do<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.019> in<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.470> few

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
one you can just do this in a few

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.650 
one you can just do this in a few
seconds<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.519> very<00:03:04.549> useful<00:03:05.060> mod<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
seconds so it's a very useful mod and

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.930 
seconds so it's a very useful mod and
it's<00:03:06.200> working<00:03:06.440> on<00:03:06.680> 0<00:03:06.980> Portland<00:03:07.459> pronto<00:03:07.700> which

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
it's working on 0 Portland pronto which

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.080 
it's working on 0 Portland pronto which
is<00:03:08.090> amazing<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.220> what<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.310> can<00:03:10.430> do<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.849> actually

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
is amazing so what we can do is actually

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.270 
is amazing so what we can do is actually
just<00:03:11.420> undo<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.829> to<00:03:12.920> show<00:03:13.099> you<00:03:13.130> guys

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
just undo that just to show you guys

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.979 
just undo that just to show you guys
that<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.579> works<00:03:13.790> as<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.540> can<00:03:14.599> see<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.870> just

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
that it works as you can see it just

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.630 
that it works as you can see it just
goes<00:03:15.140> like<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:15.709> we<00:03:15.799> can<00:03:15.920> set<00:03:16.130> up<00:03:16.160> back<00:03:16.459> to

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
goes like that so we can set up back to

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.930 
goes like that so we can set up back to
grasp<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.569> guys<00:03:17.720> set<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:19.130> then<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.670> block

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
grasp so the guys set and then the block

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.930 
grasp so the guys set and then the block
ID<00:03:20.150> for<00:03:20.540> grass<00:03:20.810> is<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.260> believe<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.160> too<00:03:22.549> so<00:03:22.880> if

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
ID for grass is I believe it's too so if

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.289 
ID for grass is I believe it's too so if
I<00:03:23.090> type<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.480> two<00:03:24.010> there<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:25.100> go<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.730> back<00:03:26.030> to

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
I type in two there we go it's back to

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.270 
I type in two there we go it's back to

press ENTER and it's going to show you
guys<00:03:36.650> how<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.280> set<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:37.910> out<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.450> you<00:03:38.510> add<00:03:38.810> the

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
guys how to set this out so you add the

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.170 
guys how to set this out so you add the
Sofia<00:03:39.440> you<00:03:39.920> add<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.310> BOK<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.700> want<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.150> then

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
Sofia you add the BOK you want and then

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.349 
Sofia you add the BOK you want and then
the<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.410> radius<00:03:42.859> so<00:03:43.489> what<00:03:43.880> we're<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.180> do

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
the the radius so what we're going to do

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.740 
the the radius so what we're going to do
is<00:03:44.540> do<00:03:44.810> Sofia<00:03:45.350> um<00:03:45.880> what<00:03:46.880> block<00:03:47.120> should<00:03:47.359> we<00:03:47.510> make

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
is do Sofia um what block should we make

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.470 
is do Sofia um what block should we make
it<00:03:47.900> let's<00:03:48.049> make<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.440> go<00:03:48.739> book<00:03:49.069> which<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.480> 41

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
it let's make it a go book which is 41

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.610 
it let's make it a go book which is 41
and<00:03:50.720> then<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.019> radius<00:03:51.230> let's<00:03:51.950> say<00:03:52.989> 15<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.470> it's

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
and then the radius let's say 15 so it's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.050 
and then the radius let's say 15 so it's
going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> freeze<00:03:54.920> for<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> few<00:03:55.459> seconds<00:03:55.880> when<00:03:56.030> i

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
going to freeze for a few seconds when i

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.479 
going to freeze for a few seconds when i
press<00:03:56.299> enter<00:03:56.739> but<00:03:57.739> then<00:03:57.889> it's<00:03:58.040> going<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.220> work

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
press enter but then it's going to work

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.660 
press enter but then it's going to work
eventually<00:03:59.389> so<00:03:59.599> it's<00:03:59.930> really<00:04:00.200> cool<00:04:00.470> all<00:04:01.459> right

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
eventually so it's really cool all right

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.390 
eventually so it's really cool all right
so<00:04:01.910> there<00:04:02.120> we<00:04:02.239> go<00:04:02.269> it<00:04:02.660> just<00:04:03.019> turned<00:04:03.380> in<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
so there we go it just turned in to a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.280 
so there we go it just turned in to a
Sofia<00:04:05.090> but<00:04:05.269> we<00:04:05.359> actually<00:04:05.480> trapped<00:04:06.019> in<00:04:06.170> here

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
Sofia but we actually trapped in here

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.860 
Sofia but we actually trapped in here
because<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:06.769> not<00:04:06.950> Hollow<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.639> we<00:04:08.150> do<00:04:08.450> have<00:04:08.480> to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
because it's not Hollow so we do have to

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.110 
because it's not Hollow so we do have to
break<00:04:09.170> our<00:04:09.440> self<00:04:09.889> out<00:04:10.069> of<00:04:10.370> here<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:10.819> let's<00:04:10.970> just

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
break our self out of here so let's just

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.330 
break our self out of here so let's just
quickly<00:04:11.290> just<00:04:12.290> break<00:04:12.620> all<00:04:12.889> the<00:04:13.010> way<00:04:13.099> up<00:04:13.280> here

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
quickly just break all the way up here

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.339 
quickly just break all the way up here
and<00:04:13.700> see<00:04:14.450> what<00:04:14.480> it<00:04:14.720> looks<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:15.049> in<00:04:15.230> the

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
and see what it looks like in the

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.460 
and see what it looks like in the
outside<00:04:15.799> so<00:04:16.280> there<00:04:16.849> we<00:04:17.060> go<00:04:17.090> we<00:04:17.510> have<00:04:17.750> this

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
outside so there we go we have this

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.360 
outside so there we go we have this
massive<00:04:19.269> sofia<00:04:20.269> block<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.959> gold<00:04:21.349> just<00:04:21.799> next<00:04:22.250> to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
massive sofia block of gold just next to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.210 
massive sofia block of gold just next to
our<00:04:22.520> little<00:04:22.760> um<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.300> little<00:04:24.080> mod<00:04:24.380> lab<00:04:24.650> dad<00:04:24.950> but

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
our little um a little mod lab dad but

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.130 
our little um a little mod lab dad but
that<00:04:25.700> was<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:26.210> looks<00:04:26.360> pretty<00:04:26.570> cool<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:26.960> now

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
that was that looks pretty cool so now

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.320 
that was that looks pretty cool so now
we<00:04:27.200> can<00:04:27.349> actually<00:04:27.470> make<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.979> hollow<00:04:28.580> version<00:04:29.120> of

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
we can actually make a hollow version of

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.100 
we can actually make a hollow version of
this<00:04:29.570> so

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
this so

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.770 
this so
see<00:04:30.530> um<00:04:31.070> let's<00:04:31.850> just<00:04:32.000> go<00:04:32.150> over<00:04:32.240> here<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.690> you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
see um let's just go over here so you

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.750 
see um let's just go over here so you
can<00:04:32.930> see<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.260> it's<00:04:33.500> filled<00:04:34.010> all<00:04:34.280> the<00:04:34.310> way<00:04:34.520> in

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
can see it's it's filled all the way in

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.550 
can see it's it's filled all the way in
the<00:04:34.940> middle<00:04:35.330> but<00:04:35.780> if<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:35.990> make<00:04:36.170> a<00:04:36.200> Holy<00:04:36.470> One

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
the middle but if we make a Holy One

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.380 
the middle but if we make a Holy One
obviously<00:04:36.920> it's<00:04:37.550> not<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:37.880> be<00:04:37.940> filled<00:04:38.240> in

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
obviously it's not going to be filled in

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.110 
obviously it's not going to be filled in
the<00:04:38.540> middle<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.350> what<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.890> what<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.250> can<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.670> is<00:04:40.850> do

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
the middle so what I what I can do is do

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.950 
the middle so what I what I can do is do
H<00:04:41.710> Sofia<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.850> then<00:04:44.210> we're<00:04:44.390> going<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.570> make<00:04:44.660> it

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
H Sofia and then we're going to make it

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.100 
H Sofia and then we're going to make it
the<00:04:45.410> same<00:04:45.800> block<00:04:46.100> which<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.370> 41<00:04:47.060> let's<00:04:47.690> do<00:04:47.900> the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
the same block which is 41 let's do the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.080 
the same block which is 41 let's do the
same<00:04:48.290> radius<00:04:48.770> as<00:04:48.950> well<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.430> see<00:04:49.640> how<00:04:49.850> that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
same radius as well and see how that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.390 
same radius as well and see how that
goes<00:04:50.120> so<00:04:50.990> let's<00:04:51.140> just<00:04:51.260> press<00:04:51.440> ENTER<00:04:51.890> and<00:04:52.100> that

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
goes so let's just press ENTER and that

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.540 
goes so let's just press ENTER and that
did<00:04:52.580> not<00:04:52.610> even<00:04:52.940> work<00:04:53.270> what<00:04:53.720> did<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:53.930> do<00:04:53.990> wrong

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
did not even work what did I do wrong

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
something wrong alright so let's do H um

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.390 
something wrong alright so let's do H um
Sofia<00:05:02.050> let's<00:05:03.050> actually<00:05:03.260> do<00:05:03.590> to<00:05:03.620> block<00:05:03.980> let's

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
Sofia let's actually do to block let's

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.090 
Sofia let's actually do to block let's
do<00:05:04.550> 20<00:05:05.120> which<00:05:05.540> is<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.620> no<00:05:06.770> idea<00:05:06.800> i<00:05:07.040> think

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
do 20 which is I have no idea i think

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.000 
do 20 which is I have no idea i think
it's<00:05:07.340> glass<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:08.660> then<00:05:08.810> a<00:05:08.840> radius<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.440> speed<00:05:09.680> 10

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
it's glass and then a radius to speed 10

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.130 
it's glass and then a radius to speed 10
there<00:05:10.790> we<00:05:10.910> go<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.210> work<00:05:11.390> this<00:05:11.540> time<00:05:11.720> I<00:05:11.750> have<00:05:11.960> no

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
there we go and work this time I have no

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.140 
there we go and work this time I have no
idea<00:05:12.260> what<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.560> did<00:05:12.770> before<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.700> as<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.060> can

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.050 
idea what I did before but as you can
see<00:05:14.420> it<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:14.780> hollow<00:05:15.050> in<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.620> inside<00:05:16.550> so<00:05:17.030> I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
see it is hollow in the inside so I

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.850 
see it is hollow in the inside so I
don't<00:05:17.300> actually<00:05:17.450> have<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.780> break<00:05:18.170> myself<00:05:18.410> out

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
don't actually have to break myself out

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.010 
don't actually have to break myself out
like<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.100> did<00:05:19.250> there<00:05:19.670> we're<00:05:20.180> just<00:05:20.330> trapped<00:05:20.720> in

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
like I did there we're just trapped in

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.380 
like I did there we're just trapped in
the<00:05:21.380> middle<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.130> we<00:05:22.160> can<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.610> we<00:05:23.120> can<00:05:23.270> just

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
the middle so we can just we can just

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.750 
the middle so we can just we can just
break<00:05:23.540> one<00:05:23.840> block<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:24.290> we<00:05:24.710> are<00:05:24.830> out<00:05:25.010> just<00:05:25.640> like

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
break one block and we are out just like

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.900 
break one block and we are out just like
that<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.180> as<00:05:26.270> you<00:05:26.360> can<00:05:26.450> see<00:05:26.480> we<00:05:27.200> built<00:05:27.560> a<00:05:27.910> to

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
that and as you can see we built a to

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.580 
that and as you can see we built a to
sophia's<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.660> that's<00:05:29.870> Hollow<00:05:30.080> and<00:05:30.350> one

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
sophia's one that's Hollow and one

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.880 
sophia's one that's Hollow and one
that's<00:05:30.830> not<00:05:31.130> so<00:05:31.820> that<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:32.450> really<00:05:33.380> awesome<00:05:33.560> so

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
that's not so that is really awesome so

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.440 
that's not so that is really awesome so
that<00:05:34.130> there's<00:05:34.430> also<00:05:34.550> another<00:05:34.880> one<00:05:35.240> which<00:05:35.420> is

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
that there's also another one which is

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.690 
that there's also another one which is
cylinder<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:36.140> have<00:05:36.320> no<00:05:36.560> idea<00:05:36.650> to<00:05:37.070> come<00:05:37.250> what<00:05:37.550> the

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
cylinder I have no idea to come what the

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.110 
cylinder I have no idea to come what the
command<00:05:38.120> is<00:05:38.510> um<00:05:38.830> let<00:05:39.830> me<00:05:39.860> let<00:05:40.550> me<00:05:40.670> look<00:05:40.850> for<00:05:41.090> it

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
command is um let me let me look for it

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.060 
command is um let me let me look for it
and<00:05:41.300> i'll<00:05:41.420> see<00:05:41.630> you<00:05:41.690> guys<00:05:41.720> in<00:05:41.930> a<00:05:42.470> second

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
and i'll see you guys in a second

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.030 
and i'll see you guys in a second
alright<00:05:43.940> so<00:05:44.150> i<00:05:44.180> just<00:05:44.510> found<00:05:44.720> the<00:05:45.200> command<00:05:45.710> for

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
alright so i just found the command for

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.340 
alright so i just found the command for
it<00:05:46.190> and<00:05:46.370> it's<00:05:46.550> pretty<00:05:46.850> easy<00:05:47.030> i<00:05:47.450> I<00:05:47.540> was<00:05:48.080> on<00:05:48.260> the

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
it and it's pretty easy i I was on the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.730 
it and it's pretty easy i I was on the
right<00:05:48.530> path<00:05:48.800> but<00:05:49.280> it<00:05:49.550> is<00:05:50.000> cyl<00:05:50.840> and<00:05:51.170> then<00:05:51.650> you

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
right path but it is cyl and then you

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.440 
right path but it is cyl and then you
have<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:52.040> add<00:05:52.070> the<00:05:52.190> block<00:05:52.610> the<00:05:52.790> radius<00:05:53.270> and

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
have to add the block the radius and

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.230 
have to add the block the radius and
then<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.960> height<00:05:54.320> so<00:05:55.160> this<00:05:55.760> time<00:05:55.970> we're<00:05:56.150> going

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
then the height so this time we're going

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.060 
then the height so this time we're going
to<00:05:56.300> make<00:05:56.420> this<00:05:56.630> out<00:05:56.930> of<00:05:56.960> let's<00:05:57.530> just<00:05:57.770> make<00:05:57.890> this

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
to make this out of let's just make this

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.730 
to make this out of let's just make this
out<00:05:58.250> of<00:05:58.280> wood<00:05:58.670> so<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.540> block<00:05:59.750> ID<00:05:59.990> for<00:06:00.440> that<00:06:00.590> is

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
out of wood so the block ID for that is

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.110 
out of wood so the block ID for that is
five<00:06:01.340> and<00:06:01.640> then<00:06:01.880> a<00:06:01.970> radius<00:06:02.390> let's<00:06:03.110> make<00:06:03.380> it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
five and then a radius let's make it

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.180 
five and then a radius let's make it
let's<00:06:05.120> make<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.330> 15<00:06:05.600> and<00:06:06.140> then<00:06:06.350> the<00:06:06.500> height<00:06:06.770> can

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
let's make it 15 and then the height can

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.360 
let's make it 15 and then the height can
be<00:06:07.570> 20<00:06:08.570> so<00:06:08.810> this<00:06:08.960> is<00:06:09.140> not<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:10.100> can<00:06:10.220> actually

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
be 20 so this is not you can actually

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.450 
be 20 so this is not you can actually
have<00:06:10.640> a<00:06:10.760> hollow<00:06:11.560> cylinder<00:06:12.560> or<00:06:13.070> you<00:06:13.190> can<00:06:13.310> have

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
have a hollow cylinder or you can have

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.190 
have a hollow cylinder or you can have
just<00:06:13.730> a<00:06:13.910> normal<00:06:14.120> cylinder<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:14.900> I'm<00:06:14.990> just<00:06:15.080> going

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
just a normal cylinder so I'm just going

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.990 
just a normal cylinder so I'm just going
to<00:06:15.260> show<00:06:15.350> you<00:06:15.470> guys<00:06:15.530> this<00:06:15.740> one<00:06:15.950> first<00:06:16.340> so<00:06:16.640> let's

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
to show you guys this one first so let's

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.970 
to show you guys this one first so let's
just<00:06:17.330> press<00:06:17.510> enter<00:06:17.660> and<00:06:18.230> then<00:06:18.320> it's<00:06:18.770> going<00:06:18.920> to

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
just press enter and then it's going to

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.800 
just press enter and then it's going to
freeze<00:06:19.190> like<00:06:20.000> it<00:06:20.150> is<00:06:20.300> right<00:06:20.480> now<00:06:20.540> it's

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
freeze like it is right now it's

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.110 
freeze like it is right now it's
actually<00:06:21.110> frozen<00:06:21.440> but<00:06:22.160> i'll<00:06:22.310> see<00:06:22.520> you<00:06:22.610> guys<00:06:22.670> in

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
actually frozen but i'll see you guys in

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.720 
actually frozen but i'll see you guys in
a<00:06:23.390> few<00:06:23.750> seconds<00:06:24.260> alright<00:06:25.100> so<00:06:25.340> as<00:06:25.400> you<00:06:25.490> can<00:06:25.550> see

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
a few seconds alright so as you can see

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.850 
a few seconds alright so as you can see
it<00:06:25.940> just<00:06:26.150> worked<00:06:26.420> but<00:06:26.720> as<00:06:27.260> you<00:06:27.440> can<00:06:27.530> see<00:06:27.710> it's

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
it just worked but as you can see it's

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.100 
it just worked but as you can see it's
not<00:06:27.980> Hollow<00:06:28.280> of<00:06:28.520> course<00:06:28.790> and<00:06:29.030> so<00:06:29.780> we<00:06:29.870> have<00:06:29.960> to

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
not Hollow of course and so we have to

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.960 
not Hollow of course and so we have to
break<00:06:30.290> our<00:06:30.560> self<00:06:30.920> out<00:06:31.070> so<00:06:31.460> let's<00:06:31.610> just<00:06:31.760> quickly

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
break our self out so let's just quickly

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.840 
break our self out so let's just quickly
do<00:06:32.480> that<00:06:32.690> all<00:06:32.840> we<00:06:32.960> just<00:06:33.080> fell<00:06:33.290> through<00:06:33.500> that

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850 
do that all we just fell through that

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.210 
do that all we just fell through that
was<00:06:34.850> easier<00:06:35.210> arm<00:06:35.540> setting<00:06:35.960> see<00:06:36.170> now<00:06:36.620> we<00:06:36.680> have<00:06:36.860> a

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
was easier arm setting see now we have a

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.330 
was easier arm setting see now we have a
cylinder<00:06:37.910> there<00:06:38.120> and<00:06:38.330> we<00:06:38.930> have<00:06:39.140> two<00:06:39.620> safir's

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
cylinder there and we have two safir's

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.550 
cylinder there and we have two safir's
as<00:06:40.580> well<00:06:40.790> so<00:06:40.970> let's<00:06:41.120> just<00:06:41.270> make<00:06:41.420> one<00:06:41.720> that<00:06:42.350> is

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
as well so let's just make one that is

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.790 
as well so let's just make one that is
hollow<00:06:42.920> arm

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
hollow arm

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.350 
hollow arm
actually<00:06:44.009> you<00:06:44.099> guys<00:06:44.190> can<00:06:44.430> do<00:06:44.580> that<00:06:44.789> so<00:06:45.090> what

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
actually you guys can do that so what

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.080 
actually you guys can do that so what
you<00:06:45.449> can<00:06:45.569> also<00:06:45.810> do<00:06:46.229> with<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:47.039> world<00:06:47.520> edit<00:06:47.909> mode

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
you can also do with the world edit mode

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.210 
you can also do with the world edit mode
you<00:06:48.300> can<00:06:48.330> check<00:06:48.659> your<00:06:48.900> Byam<00:06:49.440> so<00:06:49.800> if<00:06:49.860> i'll<00:06:50.039> just

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
you can check your Byam so if i'll just

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.240 
you can check your Byam so if i'll just
type<00:06:50.370> in<00:06:50.580> by<00:06:50.879> them<00:06:51.080> you<00:06:52.080> can<00:06:52.620> check<00:06:52.830> certain

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
type in by them you can check certain
