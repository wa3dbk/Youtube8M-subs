deadlift exercise it's great for working

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.290 
deadlift exercise it's great for working
the<00:00:10.470> glutes<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.160> hamstrings<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.090> back

the glutes the hamstrings in the back

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.419 
the glutes the hamstrings in the back
all<00:00:12.570> at<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> same<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.469> like<00:00:14.190> using

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
all at the same time I like using

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.280 
all at the same time I like using
exercises<00:00:14.910> clients<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.570> as<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.170> just

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:16.290 
exercises clients because as I just

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.840 
exercises clients because as I just
mentioned<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.130> working<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.580> lot<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
mentioned it's it's working a lot of

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.870 
mentioned it's it's working a lot of
muscles<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.199> exercise<00:00:19.440> to<00:00:19.949> start

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
muscles for this one exercise to start

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.300 
muscles for this one exercise to start
when<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.390> use<00:00:21.539> use<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> dumbbell<00:00:22.830> as<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> name

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
when you use use a dumbbell as the name

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.269 
when you use use a dumbbell as the name
implies<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:24.470> perhaps<00:00:25.470> seen<00:00:25.769> people<00:00:26.039> use<00:00:26.250> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
implies you perhaps seen people use a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.849 
implies you perhaps seen people use a
Olympic<00:00:26.939> bar<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> same<00:00:27.510> exercise<00:00:27.900> the

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
Olympic bar do the same exercise the

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.500 
Olympic bar do the same exercise the
emotion<00:00:29.550> pattern<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.000> actually<00:00:30.090> gonna<00:00:30.359> be<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
emotion pattern is actually gonna be the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.320 
emotion pattern is actually gonna be the
same<00:00:30.689> whether<00:00:30.990> using<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> dumbbell<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.890> a

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
same whether using the dumbbell or a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.010 
same whether using the dumbbell or a
barbell<00:00:35.270> what<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.630> we'll<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> we'll

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
barbell what what we'll do is we'll

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
barbell what what we'll do is we'll
start<00:00:37.260> off<00:00:37.380> standing<00:00:37.860> above<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.460> weight<00:00:38.640> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
start off standing above the weight so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.060 
start off standing above the weight so
I'm<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.390> back<00:00:40.079> behind<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.590> am<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.770> gonna<00:00:40.890> be

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I'm not back behind it am I gonna be

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'm not back behind it am I gonna be
pretty<00:00:41.370> much<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.360> top<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> weight

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
pretty much right on top of the weight

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.250 
pretty much right on top of the weight
to<00:00:43.890> go<00:00:44.070> down<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.790> gonna<00:00:45.059> push<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:45.480> pelvis<00:00:45.930> back

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to go down I'm gonna push my pelvis back

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
to go down I'm gonna push my pelvis back
so<00:00:47.010> distinction<00:00:47.489> between<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.789> squat<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so distinction between a squat and a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
so distinction between a squat and a
deadlift<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.960> squat<00:00:49.649> I'm<00:00:49.890> gonna<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> upright

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
deadlift a squat I'm gonna be upright

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.510 
deadlift a squat I'm gonna be upright
when<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> come<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.750> deadlift<00:00:52.410> my<00:00:53.219> torso

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
when I come down on a deadlift my torso

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.869 
when I come down on a deadlift my torso
is<00:00:53.760> gonna<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.180> closer<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.870> almost<00:00:55.520> 45<00:00:56.520> degrees

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is gonna be closer to almost 45 degrees

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
is gonna be closer to almost 45 degrees
with<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> ground<00:00:58.050> perhaps<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.800> closer

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
with the ground perhaps you even closer

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
with the ground perhaps you even closer
to<00:00:59.399> parallel<00:00:59.789> than<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.840> again<00:01:01.020> I'm<00:01:01.230> gonna

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to parallel than that so again I'm gonna

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.070 
to parallel than that so again I'm gonna
go<00:01:01.500> back<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.100> tail<00:01:02.489> my<00:01:03.270> chest<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> still

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
go back with my tail my chest is still

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.490 
go back with my tail my chest is still
out<00:01:04.289> I've<00:01:05.100> got<00:01:05.670> I've<00:01:06.299> got<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.570> almost<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.080> flat

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
out I've got I've got it almost a flat

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.320 
out I've got I've got it almost a flat
lumbar<00:01:08.010> spine<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
lumbar spine right here so it's in a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.270 
lumbar spine right here so it's in a
neutral<00:01:09.659> position<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.680> important<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.189> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
neutral position it's important that you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.980 
neutral position it's important that you
don't<00:01:11.369> round<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> flexed

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
don't round it so this is a flexed

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
don't round it so this is a flexed
position<00:01:13.369> we<00:01:14.369> want<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> be<00:01:14.729> tail<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
position we want to be tail it's a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.789 
position we want to be tail it's a
little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
little bit I don't want to go all the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.109 
little bit I don't want to go all the
way<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.070> direction<00:01:17.400> either<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.000> this

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
way the other direction either so this

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.539 
way the other direction either so this
is<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> keep<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.250> nice

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
is going to keep that in in a nice

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.780 
is going to keep that in in a nice
neutral<00:01:21.000> position<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> tail<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.830> chest<00:01:23.549> out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
neutral position so tail out chest out

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.210 
neutral position so tail out chest out
those<00:01:24.000> are<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.180> most<00:01:24.330> important<00:01:24.990> cues<00:01:25.320> from

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
those are the most important cues from

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
those are the most important cues from
here<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> grab<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> weight<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
here I'm going to grab the weight and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.440 
here I'm going to grab the weight and
I'm<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.799> ahead<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.009> push<00:01:29.580> through<00:01:30.270> my

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
I'm gonna go ahead and push through my

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.700 
I'm gonna go ahead and push through my
heels<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.890> bring<00:01:32.100> myself<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> tall<00:01:32.939> position

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
heels to bring myself in a tall position

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
heels to bring myself in a tall position
as<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:35.369> pushing<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.270> publicist<00:01:36.900> coming

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
as I'm pushing my publicist coming

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.770 
as I'm pushing my publicist coming
forward<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> differently<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
forward so I can do it differently I can

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
forward so I can do it differently I can
actually<00:01:40.430> lift<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> weight<00:01:41.759> without

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
actually lift the weight without

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.020 
actually lift the weight without
bringing<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.570> pelvis<00:01:42.930> forward<00:01:43.850> engages<00:01:44.850> more

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
bringing my pelvis forward engages more

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.969 
bringing my pelvis forward engages more
of<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> back<00:01:45.509> muscles<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.770> you're

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of the back muscles so if you if you're

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
of the back muscles so if you if you're
doing<00:01:47.159> exercise<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.299> feel<00:01:48.509> like<00:01:48.630> your<00:01:48.750> back

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
doing exercise you feel like your back
