00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.899 
right now but I think it's actually a
good<00:05:23.770> thing<00:05:23.830> right<00:05:24.009> now<00:05:24.159> for<00:05:24.430> the<00:05:24.490> lightweight

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909

end<00:05:26.409> of<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:26.680> year<00:05:26.800> so<00:05:27.250> we<00:05:27.370> can<00:05:27.520> kind<00:05:27.669> of<00:05:27.819> sort

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
end of the year so we can kind of sort
