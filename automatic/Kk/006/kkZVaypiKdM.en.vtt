00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.460
 Low fuel consumption is a goal we all strive to achieve 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.920
 And there are a number of things you can do to get ahead 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.480
 Especially when fuel prices only rise and rise 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.040
 So the first thing to keep in mind is time treatments 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.440
 For two reasons - 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.500
 First reason - parts that are not replaced while developing high wear 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.100
 And in fact directly affect fuel consumption 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.500
 For example, an air filter 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.800
 Once it is blocked then the air does not pass properly 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.920
 Air-to-fuel ratio and so on 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.340
 And lighters, known as plug-ins, when they are not good 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.120
 So too - igniting the fuel is not good and the whole process goes wrong again 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.500
 Another reason for doing this is that a professional garage may outperform car problems and problems that also affect fuel consumption 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.880
 Another thing to keep in mind is not to over-strain the engine 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.300
 But the engine will work as much as it should 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.840
 For example - not to travel with air conditioning and open windows 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.160
 Do not accelerate unnecessary algae 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.540
 Do not drive on the road in a high speed vehicle with 4X4 integrated 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.740
 Do not overload the vehicle 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 And another important thing to keep it really is to drive a highway at 90 mph and not beyond that 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.200
 Between 90 and 100 you can also say, just no passage and no unnecessary algae 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.180
 It certainly saves fuel 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.700
 The 90 kph speed is not only a limitation of the law, but actually saves fuel 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.780
 And of course the last thing - to be sure to press the tires correctly 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580
 And turn off the engine when not needed 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.900
 Successfully!
