it's the n55 SF and it's a brand new

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.930 
it's the n55 SF and it's a brand new
model<00:00:49.719> where<00:00:50.170> we've<00:00:50.469> been<00:00:50.829> focusing<00:00:51.519> a<00:00:51.730> lot<00:00:51.879> on

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
model where we've been focusing a lot on

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.880 
model where we've been focusing a lot on
the<00:00:52.210> audio<00:00:52.659> because<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.379> is<00:00:53.499> something<00:00:53.649> that

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
the audio because that is something that

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.380 
the audio because that is something that
is<00:00:54.190> very<00:00:54.579> important<00:00:55.449> for<00:00:55.649> aces<00:00:56.649> to<00:00:57.249> be<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
is very important for aces to be the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.259 
is very important for aces to be the
number<00:00:58.719> one<00:00:58.749> in<00:00:59.199> audio<00:00:59.559> both<00:00:59.859> for<00:01:00.280> desktops

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
number one in audio both for desktops

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.310 
number one in audio both for desktops
and<00:01:01.569> notebooks<00:01:02.909> okay<00:01:03.909> is<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.420> especially<00:01:04.930> made

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and notebooks okay is it especially made

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.219 
and notebooks okay is it especially made
for<00:01:05.350> gamers<00:01:06.040> or<00:01:06.479> for<00:01:07.479> all<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.990> aim<00:01:11.200> is

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
for gamers or for all I think the aim is

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.069 
for gamers or for all I think the aim is
actually<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.130> little<00:01:12.430> bit<00:01:12.790> more<00:01:13.270> for<00:01:14.159> overall

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
actually a little bit more for overall

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually a little bit more for overall
but<00:01:17.079> it's<00:01:17.289> got<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.530> really<00:01:17.770> powerful<00:01:18.070> graphic

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
but it's got a really powerful graphic

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.630 
but it's got a really powerful graphic
card<00:01:19.119> so<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:20.229> could<00:01:20.500> be<00:01:20.530> used<00:01:20.799> for<00:01:20.950> gaming<00:01:21.399> as

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
card so it could be used for gaming as

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.330 
card so it could be used for gaming as
well<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:22.240> course<00:01:22.539> but<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.770> mostly

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
well of course but it's mostly

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.310 
well of course but it's mostly
multimedia<00:01:25.180> okay<00:01:26.140> so<00:01:26.710> what's<00:01:26.950> new<00:01:27.280> or<00:01:28.320> what's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
multimedia okay so what's new or what's

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.420 
multimedia okay so what's new or what's
the<00:01:29.670> thing<00:01:30.670> there's<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.509> n<00:01:31.750> 55<00:01:32.439> SF<00:01:32.979> that

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the thing there's in n 55 SF that

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.359 
the thing there's in n 55 SF that
they're<00:01:34.240> your<00:01:34.570> competitors<00:01:35.350> don't<00:01:35.859> have<00:01:36.390> well

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
they're your competitors don't have well

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.999 
they're your competitors don't have well
first<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.549> all<00:01:39.729> and<00:01:40.090> we<00:01:40.869> have<00:01:40.960> put<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.229> bang

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
first of all and we have put in bang

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.849 
first of all and we have put in bang
olufsen<00:01:42.310> ice<00:01:42.670> power<00:01:42.939> amplifier<00:01:43.600> I<00:01:43.899> think<00:01:44.740> it's

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:44.859 
olufsen ice power amplifier I think it's

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:47.010 
olufsen ice power amplifier I think it's
about<00:01:44.920> 5<00:01:45.490> watts<00:01:45.759> per<00:01:46.030> channel<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.539> there<00:01:46.780> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
about 5 watts per channel in there and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.620 
about 5 watts per channel in there and
which<00:01:47.649> doesn't<00:01:48.100> sound<00:01:48.399> like<00:01:48.640> much<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.329> for<00:01:49.390> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
which doesn't sound like much but for a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.380 
which doesn't sound like much but for a
notebook<00:01:49.929> speaker<00:01:50.469> that's<00:01:50.979> plenty<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:52.000> that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
notebook speaker that's plenty and that

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.050 
notebook speaker that's plenty and that
is<00:01:52.509> class<00:01:52.840> t<00:01:53.200> amplifier<00:01:53.829> which<00:01:54.189> is<00:01:54.429> really

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
is class t amplifier which is really

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.510 
is class t amplifier which is really
utilizing<00:01:56.049> all<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> power<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.189> gets<00:01:57.369> so

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
utilizing all the power that it gets so

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.190 
utilizing all the power that it gets so
there<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.820> long<00:01:57.880> as<00:01:58.149> no<00:01:58.329> heat<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.689> spin<00:01:58.929> shins

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
there as long as no heat to spin shins

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.980 
there as long as no heat to spin shins
just<00:01:59.679> pure<00:01:59.979> power<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:00.640> straight<00:02:01.119> through

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
just pure power going straight through

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.850 
just pure power going straight through
and<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.939> that<00:02:04.329> amplifier<00:02:04.960> we're<00:02:05.350> connected<00:02:05.829> to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
and to that amplifier we're connected to

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.460 
and to that amplifier we're connected to
30<00:02:06.490> millimeters<00:02:06.729> speakers<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.990> 30

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
30 millimeters speakers and 30

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.380 
30 millimeters speakers and 30
millimeters<00:02:09.099> in<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.489> notebook<00:02:09.729> world<00:02:10.149> is

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
millimeters in the notebook world is

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.720 
millimeters in the notebook world is
actually<00:02:10.869> quite<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.170> lot<00:02:11.520> normally<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.700> have

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
actually quite a lot normally you have

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.990 
actually quite a lot normally you have
20<00:02:13.630> millimeters<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:14.920> every<00:02:15.160> millimeter

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
20 millimeters so for every millimeter

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.920 
20 millimeters so for every millimeter
you<00:02:16.300> get<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.930> get<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.380> much<00:02:17.560> more<00:02:17.800> bass<00:02:18.069> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
you get you get so much more bass and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.809 
you get you get so much more bass and
actually<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.050> top<00:02:20.319> of<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.800> we've<00:02:21.099> connected

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
actually on top of that we've connected

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.990 
actually on top of that we've connected
at<00:02:22.150> external<00:02:22.599> sub<00:02:23.080> woofer<00:02:23.560> which<00:02:24.190> is<00:02:24.430> still

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
at external sub woofer which is still

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540 
at external sub woofer which is still
quite<00:02:25.330> portable<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:26.110> like<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.739> same<00:02:26.980> size

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
quite portable it's like the same size

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.110 
quite portable it's like the same size
as<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> cup<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:29.040> can<00:02:30.040> show<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.280> here<00:02:30.640> yeah<00:02:30.849> let's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
as a cup I can show you here yeah let's

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.430 
as a cup I can show you here yeah let's
see<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:35.110> this<00:02:35.680> external<00:02:36.220> subwoofer<00:02:37.440> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
see it so this external subwoofer it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.039 
see it so this external subwoofer it's
needed<00:02:38.980> because<00:02:39.130> there<00:02:39.670> are<00:02:39.819> some<00:02:40.350> physical

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
needed because there are some physical

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.130 
needed because there are some physical
boundaries<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.670> cannot<00:02:46.019> go<00:02:47.019> around

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
boundaries that we cannot go around

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.830 
boundaries that we cannot go around
unless<00:02:47.620> we<00:02:48.069> have<00:02:48.430> an<00:02:48.580> external<00:02:48.970> box<00:02:49.420> because

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
unless we have an external box because

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.000 
unless we have an external box because
if<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.680> want<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.010> get<00:02:51.190> powerful<00:02:52.350> bass<00:02:53.350> from

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
if if you want to get powerful bass from

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.870 
if if you want to get powerful bass from
a<00:02:54.100> notebook<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:54.900> very<00:02:55.900> hard<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:57.610> will<00:02:57.700> get

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
a notebook that's very hard you will get

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.030 
a notebook that's very hard you will get
a<00:02:57.940> lot<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.209> distortion<00:02:58.810> because<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.860> whole

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
a lot of distortion because the whole

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.949 
a lot of distortion because the whole
chances<00:03:00.549> will<00:03:00.730> start<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> vibrate<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.780> that's

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
chances will start to vibrate so that's

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.660 
chances will start to vibrate so that's
why<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.380> chose<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.950> have<00:03:03.099> an<00:03:03.280> external

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
why we chose to have an external

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.949 
why we chose to have an external
subwoofer<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:04.599> with<00:03:05.560> external<00:03:06.010> subwoofer

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
subwoofer and with external subwoofer

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.849 
subwoofer and with external subwoofer
you<00:03:07.959> get<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.380> much<00:03:08.560> more<00:03:08.950> space<00:03:09.940> for<00:03:09.970> the

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
you get so much more space for the

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.509 
you get so much more space for the
speaker<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:12.070> play<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.230> because<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.260> that

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
speaker to play with and because of that

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.120 
speaker to play with and because of that
you<00:03:15.519> get<00:03:16.239> so<00:03:16.510> much<00:03:16.660> deeper<00:03:17.230> bass<00:03:17.470> than<00:03:17.980> you

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
you get so much deeper bass than you

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.030 
you get so much deeper bass than you
would<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:18.760> this<00:03:19.690> it'll<00:03:19.900> be<00:03:20.019> like<00:03:20.440> half<00:03:20.799> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
would if this it'll be like half the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.840 
would if this it'll be like half the
size<00:03:22.230> even<00:03:23.230> though<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:24.280> not<00:03:24.519> really

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
size even though it's not really

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.780 
size even though it's not really
portable<00:03:25.120> with<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.510> external<00:03:26.470> subwoofer<00:03:27.310> you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
portable with a external subwoofer you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.699 
portable with a external subwoofer you
really<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.480> take<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:28.989> with<00:03:29.230> you<00:03:29.470> when

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
really want to take this with you when

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.800 
really want to take this with you when
you're<00:03:29.890> on<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.250> wrong<00:03:30.370> because<00:03:30.819> it<00:03:31.420> really

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
you're on the wrong because it really

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.430 
you're on the wrong because it really
gives<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.920> whole<00:03:33.519> other<00:03:34.019> sound<00:03:35.019> experience

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
gives a whole other sound experience

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.130 
gives a whole other sound experience
that<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.459> get<00:03:36.670> without<00:03:36.880> it<00:03:37.209> but<00:03:37.630> of<00:03:37.720> course<00:03:37.989> it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
that you get without it but of course it

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.979 
that you get without it but of course it
will<00:03:38.350> work<00:03:38.650> without<00:03:39.160> subwoofer<00:03:40.000> as<00:03:40.120> well<00:03:40.329> okay
