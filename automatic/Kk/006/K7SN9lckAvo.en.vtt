00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260 
the controller where you would prefer to
have<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.319> button<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.880> right<00:02:11.060> here

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
have the button I like it right here

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.840 
have the button I like it right here
because<00:02:11.750> it's<00:02:12.620> pretty<00:02:12.830> easy<00:02:13.010> access<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
because it's pretty easy access to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.440 
because it's pretty easy access to
pulling<00:02:14.150> off<00:02:14.239> hit<00:02:14.600> with<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:16.450> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
pulling off hit with I so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.199 
pulling off hit with I so
once<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.690> drill<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.870> hole<00:02:18.050> one<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:19.209> stick

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
once you drill the hole one you stick

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.790 
once you drill the hole one you stick
the<00:02:20.300> button<00:02:20.540> through<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.930> either<00:02:21.440> crazy

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
the button through and either crazy

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.160 
the button through and either crazy
bullet<00:02:22.190> or<00:02:22.400> hot<00:02:23.000> glue<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.870> doesn't<00:02:24.020> come

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
bullet or hot glue it so it doesn't come

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.650 
bullet or hot glue it so it doesn't come
down<00:02:24.319> when<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> push<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.209> it's<00:02:26.209> pretty<00:02:26.420> simple

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
down when you push it it's pretty simple

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.780 
down when you push it it's pretty simple
so<00:02:27.290> then<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.860> screw<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> controller<00:02:28.610> back

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
so then you screw the controller back

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.870 
so then you screw the controller back
together<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:32.420> have<00:02:32.660> ratified<00:02:33.550> also<00:02:34.550> when

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
together and you have ratified also when

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.070 
together and you have ratified also when
you're<00:02:35.000> taking<00:02:35.390> apart<00:02:35.630> your<00:02:35.720> controller

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
you're taking apart your controller

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.330 
you're taking apart your controller
you're<00:02:36.709> going<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.950> notice<00:02:37.630> these<00:02:38.630> things

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you're going to notice these things

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.250 
you're going to notice these things
they're<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.060> vibrators<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:41.930> what

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
they're just the vibrators and what

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.840 
they're just the vibrators and what
makes<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.680> controller<00:02:42.980> vibrate<00:02:43.489> when<00:02:43.670> you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
makes the controller vibrate when you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.309 
makes the controller vibrate when you
shoot<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.360> stuff<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.690> some<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.900> some<00:02:45.080> games

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
shoot and stuff in some of some games

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.350 
shoot and stuff in some of some games
just<00:02:46.310> basically<00:02:46.580> what<00:02:46.760> makes<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.030> controller

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
just basically what makes the controller

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.949 
just basically what makes the controller
vibrate<00:02:47.810> pretty<00:02:48.200> simple<00:02:48.550> now<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:50.660> can<00:02:50.810> take

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
vibrate pretty simple now you can take

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.960 
vibrate pretty simple now you can take
them<00:02:51.170> off<00:02:51.290> cut<00:02:51.769> them<00:02:51.890> out<00:02:51.980> rip<00:02:52.340> them<00:02:52.489> out<00:02:52.610> route

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
them off cut them out rip them out route

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.580 
them off cut them out rip them out route
doesn't<00:02:53.269> matter<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.930> doesn't<00:02:54.140> affect<00:02:54.500> your

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
doesn't matter it doesn't affect your

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.020 
doesn't matter it doesn't affect your
controller<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.100> any<00:02:55.280> ways<00:02:55.430> except<00:02:55.850> taking

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
controller in any ways except taking

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270 
controller in any ways except taking
away<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.450> vibration<00:02:56.989> now<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.530> had<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.100> take

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
away the vibration now I had to take

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.300 
away the vibration now I had to take
them<00:02:58.459> out<00:02:58.580> because<00:02:59.319> my<00:03:00.319> button<00:03:00.650> right<00:03:00.769> here<00:03:00.799> it

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
them out because my button right here it

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.220 
them out because my button right here it
wouldn't<00:03:01.610> fit<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.940> because<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.810> vibrator

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
wouldn't fit in because of the vibrator

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.080 
wouldn't fit in because of the vibrator
so<00:03:03.860> I<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.100> ripped<00:03:04.400> them<00:03:04.580> out<00:03:04.640> nothing

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
so I just ripped them out nothing

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.650 
so I just ripped them out nothing
happens

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
happens

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.740 
happens
they're<00:03:06.380> right<00:03:06.680> here<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.610> right<00:03:08.209> here<00:03:08.480> we

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
they're right here and right here we

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.229 
they're right here and right here we
take<00:03:08.959> back<00:03:09.110> control<00:03:09.340> so<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:10.760> pretty<00:03:11.150> much

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
take back control so that's pretty much

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.739 
take back control so that's pretty much
simple<00:03:11.780> enough<00:03:12.079> and
