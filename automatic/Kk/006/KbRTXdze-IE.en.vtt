00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
in collages because there is still a

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.279

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
related to the term of the clarity I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.350 
related to the term of the clarity I
really<00:04:45.530> like<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.979> title<00:04:46.460> because<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.120> think

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
really like the title because I think

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.840 
really like the title because I think
it's<00:04:48.050> really<00:04:48.289> intelligent<00:04:49.039> it's<00:04:49.490> really

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
it's really intelligent it's really

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.390 
it's really intelligent it's really
smart<00:04:50.090> why<00:04:50.479> because<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:53.030> obligates<00:04:53.590> myself<00:04:54.590> to

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
smart why because it obligates myself to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.159 
smart why because it obligates myself to
make<00:04:57.430> two<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:59.479> make<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> trip<00:04:59.960> to<00:05:00.229> go<00:05:00.910> like<00:05:02.169> talk

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.800 
make two to make a trip to go like talk
to<00:05:03.500> go<00:05:03.680> further<00:05:04.580> away<00:05:04.759> from<00:05:05.060> the<00:05:05.389> world<00:05:05.660> when<00:05:05.780> I

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
to go further away from the world when I

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.010 
to go further away from the world when I
think<00:05:06.229> up<00:05:07.010> gripe<00:05:07.460> when<00:05:07.880> I<00:05:07.910> think<00:05:08.270> when<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:08.870> do

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
think up gripe when I think when I do

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.250 
think up gripe when I think when I do
think<00:05:09.530> to<00:05:09.740> Guantanamo<00:05:10.430> my<00:05:10.970> BAE<00:05:11.240> when<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:11.720> think

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
think to Guantanamo my BAE when I think

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.320 
think to Guantanamo my BAE when I think
to<00:05:12.919> Hurricane<00:05:13.520> Katrina<00:05:13.940> when<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.330> do<00:05:14.539> think<00:05:15.050> two

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
to Hurricane Katrina when I do think two

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.640 
to Hurricane Katrina when I do think two
to<00:05:17.330> go<00:05:18.320> here<00:05:18.350> with<00:05:18.860> his<00:05:19.130> work<00:05:19.930> disaster<00:05:20.930> when<00:05:21.620> I

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
to go here with his work disaster when I

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.560 
to go here with his work disaster when I
think<00:05:22.010> all<00:05:22.280> all<00:05:22.580> all<00:05:23.240> but<00:05:24.639> is<00:05:25.639> related<00:05:26.270> so

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
think all all all but is related so

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.260 
think all all all but is related so
deeply<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.229> a<00:05:27.349> historical<00:05:28.010> moment<00:05:28.220> so<00:05:28.970> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
deeply in a historical moment so I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.909 
deeply in a historical moment so I
cannot<00:05:29.960> get<00:05:30.260> it<00:05:30.789> without<00:05:32.139> making<00:05:33.139> a<00:05:33.500> distance

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
cannot get it without making a distance

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.790 
cannot get it without making a distance
even<00:05:34.610> a<00:05:34.849> physical<00:05:35.360> distance<00:05:35.690> so<00:05:35.900> I<00:05:35.930> had<00:05:36.259> to<00:05:36.289> I

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
even a physical distance so I had to I

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.200 
even a physical distance so I had to I
had<00:05:37.310> to<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:38.870> had<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.199> step<00:05:40.010> back<00:05:40.280> but<00:05:40.729> not<00:05:40.910> only

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
had to I had to step back but not only

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.640 
had to I had to step back but not only
step<00:05:41.419> back<00:05:41.599> like<00:05:42.610> with<00:05:43.610> our<00:05:43.900> with<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> few<00:05:45.199> say<00:05:45.410> I

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
step back like with our with a few say I

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.500 
step back like with our with a few say I
have<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.990> go<00:05:47.990> high<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:49.130> go<00:05:49.280> high<00:05:49.550> in<00:05:50.270> the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
have to go high to go high in the

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.320 
have to go high to go high in the
atmosphere<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.530> to<00:05:52.370> understand<00:05:52.940> the<00:05:53.150> world

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
atmosphere and to understand the world

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.930 
atmosphere and to understand the world
differently<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.560> see<00:05:54.889> to<00:05:55.130> see<00:05:55.580> it

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
differently and to see to see it

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.600 
differently and to see to see it
differently<00:05:56.240> like<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.080> planet<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.800> this<00:05:58.280> gives

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
differently like a planet and this gives

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.589 
differently like a planet and this gives
me<00:05:58.760> the<00:05:58.880> possibility<00:05:59.349> perhaps<00:06:01.060> to<00:06:02.060> engage

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
me the possibility perhaps to engage

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.850 
me the possibility perhaps to engage
differently<00:06:03.260> with<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.740> problems<00:06:04.190> who<00:06:04.699> I<00:06:04.729> can

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
differently with the problems who I can

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.520 
differently with the problems who I can
afterward<00:06:06.860> who<00:06:07.099> I<00:06:07.130> can<00:06:07.460> see<00:06:08.150> like<00:06:08.389> points<00:06:09.020> yes

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
afterward who I can see like points yes

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.230 
afterward who I can see like points yes
all<00:06:09.919> related<00:06:10.789> together<00:06:11.210> and<00:06:11.449> then<00:06:12.020> I<00:06:13.210> when<00:06:14.210> I

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
all related together and then I when I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.230 
all related together and then I when I
make<00:06:14.690> when<00:06:15.110> I<00:06:15.169> make<00:06:15.380> this<00:06:15.530> trip<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.699> planet

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
make when I make this trip to the planet

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.710 
make when I make this trip to the planet
Mars<00:06:17.479> for<00:06:17.750> example<00:06:17.810> or<00:06:18.229> another<00:06:18.530> so<00:06:18.919> then<00:06:19.159> and

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
Mars for example or another so then and

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.620 
Mars for example or another so then and
I<00:06:20.720> have<00:06:21.710> to<00:06:21.830> go<00:06:21.979> back<00:06:22.250> of<00:06:22.550> course<00:06:23.000> because<00:06:23.360> I<00:06:23.389> am

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
I have to go back of course because I am

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.020 
I have to go back of course because I am
a<00:06:23.720> human<00:06:24.020> in<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.650> interval<00:06:25.099> so<00:06:25.340> I<00:06:25.370> have<00:06:25.789> to<00:06:25.909> go

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
a human in the interval so I have to go

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.010 
a human in the interval so I have to go
back<00:06:26.060> and<00:06:26.449> then<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.110> in<00:06:28.010> doing<00:06:28.400> this<00:06:28.550> trip<00:06:28.820> I<00:06:29.479> I

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
back and then I in doing this trip I I

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.550 
back and then I in doing this trip I I
can<00:06:30.470> engage<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.130> think<00:06:31.520> it's<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:31.909> possibility

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
can engage I think it's a possibility

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.290 
can engage I think it's a possibility
differently<00:06:33.560> the<00:06:34.010> question<00:06:34.460> of<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:34.639> being<00:06:35.150> a

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
differently the question of the being a

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.420 
differently the question of the being a
human<00:06:35.539> being<00:06:35.720> in<00:06:36.139> the<00:06:36.169> world<00:06:36.289> and<00:06:36.620> so<00:06:36.979> this

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
human being in the world and so this

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.029 
human being in the world and so this
metaphor<00:06:38.060> of<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.690> there<00:06:39.110> life<00:06:39.380> on<00:06:39.560> Mars<00:06:39.740> I

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
metaphor of is there life on Mars I

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.490 
metaphor of is there life on Mars I
think<00:06:40.370> it's<00:06:40.729> a<00:06:40.880> very<00:06:41.000> smart<00:06:41.389> one<00:06:41.690> because<00:06:42.020> it's

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
think it's a very smart one because it's

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.909 
think it's a very smart one because it's
not<00:06:42.770> about<00:06:43.539> the<00:06:44.539> old-fashioned<00:06:45.409> term<00:06:45.650> of

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
not about the old-fashioned term of

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.390 
not about the old-fashioned term of
globalization<00:06:46.550> in

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
globalization in

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.939 
globalization in
nationalism<00:06:48.060> irregularly<00:06:48.870> isma<00:06:49.169> etc<00:06:49.860> etc

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:49.949 
nationalism irregularly isma etc etc

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:52.219 
nationalism irregularly isma etc etc
it's<00:06:50.490> another<00:06:50.790> term<00:06:51.120> it's<00:06:51.449> a<00:06:51.540> term<00:06:51.750> who<00:06:52.110> is

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:52.229 
it's another term it's a term who is

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:54.740 
it's another term it's a term who is
related<00:06:52.560> to<00:06:52.650> kind<00:06:53.070> of<00:06:53.130> mystery<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.790> also<00:06:54.449> fun

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
related to kind of mystery and also fun

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.860 
related to kind of mystery and also fun
and<00:06:55.020> kind<00:06:55.560> of<00:06:55.620> irony<00:06:55.919> and<00:06:56.400> I<00:06:56.759> think<00:06:57.060> this<00:06:57.509> fern

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
and kind of irony and I think this fern

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.219 
and kind of irony and I think this fern
and<00:06:58.080> desirable<00:06:58.740> are<00:06:58.919> not<00:06:59.850> to<00:07:00.449> talk<00:07:00.720> to<00:07:01.080> make

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
and desirable are not to talk to make

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.779 
and desirable are not to talk to make
jokes<00:07:01.620> of<00:07:01.919> one<00:07:02.820> it's<00:07:03.120> about<00:07:03.600> an<00:07:04.169> opening

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
jokes of one it's about an opening

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:07.810 
jokes of one it's about an opening
towards<00:07:05.789> another<00:07:06.000> public<00:07:06.449> towards

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
towards another public towards

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.550 
towards another public towards
possibilities<00:07:08.820> I<00:07:09.060> didn't<00:07:09.750> expect<00:07:10.050> perhaps

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
possibilities I didn't expect perhaps

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.719 
possibilities I didn't expect perhaps
myself<00:07:11.039> and<00:07:11.280> I<00:07:11.520> didn't<00:07:11.880> I<00:07:12.530> didn't<00:07:13.530> wait<00:07:14.340> for<00:07:14.370> it

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
myself and I didn't I didn't wait for it

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.260 
myself and I didn't I didn't wait for it
so<00:07:15.210> this<00:07:15.780> trip<00:07:16.139> is<00:07:16.470> imaginary<00:07:17.130> trip<00:07:17.520> to<00:07:18.060> go<00:07:18.210> to

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:18.270 
so this trip is imaginary trip to go to

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.450 
so this trip is imaginary trip to go to
Mars<00:07:18.660> and<00:07:18.900> come<00:07:19.259> back<00:07:19.440> gives<00:07:20.100> me<00:07:20.340> the

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 
Mars and come back gives me the

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.879 
Mars and come back gives me the
possibility<00:07:20.699> or<00:07:21.419> so<00:07:22.050> I<00:07:22.080> see<00:07:22.410> this<00:07:22.530> exhibition

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
possibility or so I see this exhibition

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.560 
possibility or so I see this exhibition
like<00:07:23.690> do<00:07:24.710> to<00:07:25.710> engage<00:07:25.850> differently<00:07:26.850> with<00:07:27.150> the

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
like do to engage differently with the
