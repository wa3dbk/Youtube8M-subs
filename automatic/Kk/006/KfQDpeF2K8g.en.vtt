and<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.960> would<00:01:01.109> start<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.469> beginner<00:01:01.800> off<00:01:02.010> at

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
and we would start our beginner off at

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
and we would start our beginner off at
the<00:01:02.250> top<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.730> they'd<00:01:02.820> ski<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.359> snowboard<00:01:03.480> down

have people that come here that say
they've<00:01:10.740> been<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> snow<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> day<00:01:11.640> or

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
they've been to the snow for a day or

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
they've been to the snow for a day or
two<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.060> they<00:01:12.150> didn't<00:01:12.360> learn<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:13.020> teach

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
two and they didn't learn that we teach

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.600 
two and they didn't learn that we teach
that<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.799> twenty<00:01:14.100> five<00:01:14.250> minutes

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
that in the first twenty five minutes

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.660 
that in the first twenty five minutes
and<00:01:15.090> how<00:01:15.270> would<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.450> say<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.710> similar<00:01:17.250> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and how would you say this is similar to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.070 
and how would you say this is similar to
the<00:01:17.790> snow<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> when<00:01:18.360> what's<00:01:18.540> different<00:01:19.049> about

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the snow and when what's different about

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
the snow and when what's different about
it<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> similarities<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.250> differences

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it the similarities and the differences

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.969 
it the similarities and the differences
well<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.540> main<00:01:21.869> difference<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.830> it's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
well the main difference is that it's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.469 
well the main difference is that it's
warmer<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.430> drier<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> more<00:01:24.180> controlled

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
warmer and drier in a more controlled

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.480 
warmer and drier in a more controlled
environment<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.320> people<00:01:25.740> usually<00:01:25.950> find<00:01:26.340> they

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
environment so people usually find they

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670 
environment so people usually find they
can<00:01:26.670> learn<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.090> much<00:01:27.210> faster<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:28.110> than<00:01:28.140> on

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
can learn so much faster here than on

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.399 
can learn so much faster here than on
the<00:01:28.740> snow<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.820> difference<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.140> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the snow the difference is it is a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.490 
the snow the difference is it is a
carpet<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:32.310> moves<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> snow<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:34.229> move

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
carpet it moves and on the snow we move

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
carpet it moves and on the snow we move
over<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> snow<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.579> doesn't<00:01:35.970> move<00:01:36.060> underneath

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
over the snow it doesn't move underneath

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.179 
over the snow it doesn't move underneath
our<00:01:36.540> feet<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> carpet<00:01:37.500> tends<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> catch

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
our feet so the carpet tends to catch

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.770 
our feet so the carpet tends to catch
little<00:01:38.549> mistakes<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.360> away<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
little mistakes you can get away with on

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450 
little mistakes you can get away with on
the<00:01:40.020> snow<00:01:40.229> helps<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> correct<00:01:41.159> them<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460

the snow helps you to correct them to
have<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> lot<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:41.790> fun<00:01:42.150> next<00:01:42.329> time<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:42.750> up

looks<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.200> same<00:02:01.380> as<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.979> already<00:02:02.070> know

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
looks the same as what they already know

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.039 
looks the same as what they already know
how<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.840> snow

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
how to do and when they go to the snow

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
how to do and when they go to the snow
they<00:02:04.229> find<00:02:04.469> out<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.040> are<00:02:05.130> big

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
they find out that there are big

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
they find out that there are big
differences<00:02:05.969> between<00:02:06.299> surfing<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
differences between surfing and

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
differences between surfing and
snowboarding<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.179> want<00:02:09.450> to

learn
it's<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.190> little<00:02:10.399> easier<00:02:10.490> here<00:02:10.850> than<00:02:10.880> on<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
it's a little easier here than on the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
it's a little easier here than on the
snow<00:02:11.540> yeah<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.170> just<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.470> know<00:02:12.530> getting<00:02:12.890> your

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
snow yeah and just you know getting your

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.699 
snow yeah and just you know getting your
balance<00:02:13.580> underway<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.480> me<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.900> grew<00:02:15.350> up<00:02:15.380> in

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
balance underway for me I grew up in

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.620 
balance underway for me I grew up in
Florida<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:16.250> I've<00:02:16.730> been<00:02:17.000> wakeboarding<00:02:17.540> my
