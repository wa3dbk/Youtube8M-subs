the graphics are old school but that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.780 
the graphics are old school but that
certainly<00:03:42.920> doesn't<00:03:43.100> bother<00:03:43.430> me<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.850> sir<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:46.430> I

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
certainly doesn't bother me it sir as I

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.020 
certainly doesn't bother me it sir as I
sights<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.210> bit<00:03:47.240> of<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> blast<00:03:47.690> from<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:47.960> past

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.070 

that's<00:03:56.030> something<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:56.390> we<00:03:56.540> can<00:03:56.660> pick<00:03:56.810> up<00:03:56.960> on
