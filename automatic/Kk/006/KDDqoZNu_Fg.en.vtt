next to a red dot sign on the radar that

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.390 
next to a red dot sign on the radar that
means<00:02:52.510> there's<00:02:52.900> an<00:02:53.049> enemy<00:02:53.260> right<00:02:53.769> by<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.099> and

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so yeah and let me mention this again to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.629 
so yeah and let me mention this again to
those<00:03:03.370> who<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.239> didn't<00:03:05.049> say<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.620> clearly<00:03:05.889> to<00:03:06.190> if

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
those who I didn't say it clearly to if

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.220 
those who I didn't say it clearly to if
you<00:03:06.819> are<00:03:06.909> moving<00:03:07.060> towards<00:03:07.389> an<00:03:07.599> area<00:03:07.900> which<00:03:08.049> has

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
you are moving towards an area which has

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.559 
you are moving towards an area which has
no<00:03:08.440> green<00:03:08.739> arrow<00:03:08.980> then<00:03:09.609> this<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.090> a<00:03:10.120> dangerous

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
no green arrow then this is a dangerous

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.030 
no green arrow then this is a dangerous
zone<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.109> are<00:03:11.200> likely<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.709> come<00:03:11.859> into

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
zone and you are likely to come into

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.280 
zone and you are likely to come into
combat<00:03:12.370> within<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.909> next<00:03:13.060> 10<00:03:13.359> to<00:03:13.389> 15<00:03:13.629> seconds

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
combat within the next 10 to 15 seconds

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.319 
combat within the next 10 to 15 seconds
so<00:03:14.440> as<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.099> move<00:03:15.250> forward<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.669> need<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.209> be

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
so as you move forward you need to be

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.699 
so as you move forward you need to be
brushing<00:03:16.720> against<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.109> war<00:03:17.319> on<00:03:17.410> your<00:03:17.530> right

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
brushing against the war on your right

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.280 
brushing against the war on your right
or<00:03:17.739> left<00:03:17.859> side<00:03:18.099> as<00:03:19.060> possible<00:03:19.690> sticking<00:03:20.079> close

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
or left side as possible sticking close

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.530 
or left side as possible sticking close
to<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.530> war<00:03:20.739> or<00:03:21.250> whatever<00:03:21.459> object<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.060> available

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
to a war or whatever object is available

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.849 
to a war or whatever object is available
means<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.930> don't<00:03:23.109> need<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.379> worry<00:03:23.560> much<00:03:23.799> about

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
means you don't need to worry much about

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:25.949 
means you don't need to worry much about
the<00:03:24.250> side<00:03:24.459> of<00:03:24.639> you<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.359> also<00:03:25.480> means<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.930> are

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
the side of you it also means you are

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.589 
the side of you it also means you are
most<00:03:26.199> likely<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.560> be<00:03:27.010> close<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.090> cover<00:03:28.359> or

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
most likely to be close to cover or

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.110 
most likely to be close to cover or
escape<00:03:29.019> if<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.620> situation<00:03:30.190> requires<00:03:30.220> it<00:03:30.970> you

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
escape if the situation requires it you

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.939 
escape if the situation requires it you
know<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:32.139> is<00:03:32.260> important<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.709> you

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
know and it is important that you

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.229 
know and it is important that you
constantly<00:03:33.340> think<00:03:33.699> about<00:03:33.970> where<00:03:34.120> your

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
constantly think about where your

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
opponents will will be coming from and

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.640 
opponents will will be coming from and
if<00:03:37.090> there's<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.419> route<00:03:37.599> that<00:03:37.870> you<00:03:38.019> think<00:03:38.290> they

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
if there's a route that you think they

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.670 
if there's a route that you think they

might be traveling and can surprise you
then<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:42.000> might<00:03:43.000> consider<00:03:43.030> dropping<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.989> claim

where<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:44.650> it'll<00:03:45.099> be<00:03:45.280> way<00:03:45.609> safer<00:03:45.910> for<00:03:46.239> you

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
rather than dropping prone you could

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.719 
rather than dropping prone you could
throw<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.660> flashbang<00:05:59.100> around<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.220> corner<00:06:00.550> and

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
throw a flashbang around the corner and

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.840 
throw a flashbang around the corner and
take<00:06:00.880> down<00:06:01.090> your<00:06:01.240> blinded<00:06:01.690> targets<00:06:02.610> it's<00:06:03.610> like
