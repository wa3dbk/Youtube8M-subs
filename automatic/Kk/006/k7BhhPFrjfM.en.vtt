00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
S hooks and I've I've installed the two

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.830 
S hooks and I've I've installed the two
and<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.870> half<00:00:41.050> millimeter<00:00:41.650> jaw<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.379> tool<00:00:45.840> to

and a half millimeter jaw on the tool to

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:56.370 
and a half millimeter jaw on the tool to
make<00:00:47.020> the<00:00:48.030> s<00:00:49.030> hook<00:00:50.640> I'll<00:00:51.640> put<00:00:52.060> the<00:00:52.800> wire<00:00:55.380> wire

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
make the s hook I'll put the wire wire

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:06.240 
make the s hook I'll put the wire wire
in<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.630> out<00:00:58.630> form<00:00:59.050> one<00:00:59.710> a<00:01:00.130> small<00:01:04.229> small<00:01:05.229> eye<00:01:05.290> on

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
in and out form one a small small eye on

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.550 
in and out form one a small small eye on
the<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:09.700> end<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.119> wire<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.840> now<00:01:11.110> I'm<00:01:11.290> just

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the one end of the wire and now I'm just

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.289 
the one end of the wire and now I'm just
going<00:01:11.800> to

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:27.380 

form<00:01:19.899> the<00:01:20.170> larger<00:01:20.950> loop

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200 

now<00:01:27.960> I'll<00:01:28.800> go<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> other<00:01:29.520> end<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> wire

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
now I'll go to the other end of the wire

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:41.359 
now I'll go to the other end of the wire
and<00:01:32.180> form<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.480> small<00:01:36.830> on<00:01:37.830> that<00:01:38.040> end<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.430> wire

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:53.429 

and<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.479> can<00:01:43.659> see<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:44.830> I'm<00:01:47.130> keeping<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:49.530> up

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.139 

so<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.520> when<00:01:54.640> I'm<00:01:54.759> formed<00:01:55.569> is<00:01:55.749> if<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.909> this

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
so that when I'm formed is if on this

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.789 
so that when I'm formed is if on this
end<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.749> will<00:01:59.850> automatically<00:02:01.439> bring<00:02:02.439> it<00:02:02.679> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
end it will automatically bring it the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.120 
end it will automatically bring it the
other<00:02:02.950> way

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.780 

and<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:07.820> might<00:02:08.060> need<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:09.880> do<00:02:10.880> some<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.580> might

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and you might need to do some you might

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.560 
and you might need to do some you might
need<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.270> go<00:02:14.840> back<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.350> pose<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:16.570> small

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
need to go back and pose these small

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.680 
need to go back and pose these small
loops<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.700> because<00:02:19.700> they<00:02:19.880> tend<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.209> open<00:02:20.540> up

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
loops up because they tend to open up

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.199 
loops up because they tend to open up
when<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.020> form<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.650> larger<00:02:22.310> loop<00:02:22.490> after<00:02:22.850> I

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
when you form the larger loop after I

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.460 
when you form the larger loop after I
formed<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.320> s<00:02:24.500> hook<00:02:24.790> then<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:27.130> hard<00:02:28.130> soldered

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
formed the s hook then I hard soldered

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.060 
formed the s hook then I hard soldered
the<00:02:30.470> small<00:02:31.130> ice<00:02:31.520> hose<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:33.380> each<00:02:33.620> end<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
the small ice hose on each end of the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.090 
the small ice hose on each end of the
eye<00:02:34.100> and<00:02:34.430> then<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.120> also<00:02:35.870> hard<00:02:36.320> soldered<00:02:36.860> them

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
eye and then I also hard soldered them

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.340 
eye and then I also hard soldered them
to<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.970> mid<00:02:38.350> middle<00:02:39.350> member<00:02:39.830> of<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.370> book<00:02:41.350> so

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to the mid middle member of the book so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.580 
to the mid middle member of the book so
there's<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:43.900> solder<00:02:44.900> joint<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:46.450> here<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.380> in

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
there's a solder joint here here and in

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.910 
there's a solder joint here here and in
the<00:02:48.709> center<00:02:49.000> after<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.030> formed<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.470> s<00:02:52.130> hook<00:02:52.550> and

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
the center after I formed the s hook and

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.390 
the center after I formed the s hook and
soldered<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.280> three<00:02:56.140> places<00:02:57.140> on<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.830> S<00:02:58.100> sub

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
soldered the three places on the S sub

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.590 
soldered the three places on the S sub
then<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:59.000> all<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.290> next<00:03:00.440> step<00:03:00.860> was<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.600> solder

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
then I all I the next step was to solder

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.130 
then I all I the next step was to solder
a<00:03:02.780> jump<00:03:03.320> ring<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.739> each<00:03:04.220> end<00:03:04.580> of<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.000> S<00:03:05.209> hook

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.520 

then<00:03:09.140> after<00:03:09.739> I<00:03:10.810> soldered<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.310> jump<00:03:13.310> rings<00:03:13.580> on

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
then after I soldered the jump rings on

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.940 
then after I soldered the jump rings on
the<00:03:15.530> s<00:03:16.310> hook<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:17.320> used<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:19.239> bench<00:03:20.239> block<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the s hook I used a bench block and a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.820 
the s hook I used a bench block and a
frets<00:03:22.519> planishing<00:03:23.450> hammer

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
frets planishing hammer

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:36.430 
frets planishing hammer
to<00:03:26.470> flatten<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:30.350> cash<00:03:30.830> hook<00:03:31.130> I<00:03:35.350> flattened<00:03:36.350> it

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
to flatten the cash hook I flattened it

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.380 
to flatten the cash hook I flattened it
on<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:36.740> side<00:03:36.980> then<00:03:37.400> flipped<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.940> over<00:03:38.090> and

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
on one side then flipped it over and

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.570 
on one side then flipped it over and
flattened<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.510> other<00:03:41.660> side<00:03:42.130> after<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.190> got<00:03:43.370> all

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
flattened the other side after I got all

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.840 
flattened the other side after I got all
the<00:03:43.880> S<00:03:44.180> hooks<00:03:44.540> made<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:45.460> linked<00:03:46.460> them<00:03:46.580> together

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
the S hooks made I linked them together

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.050 
the S hooks made I linked them together
with<00:03:47.510> jump<00:03:47.810> rings
