chrome<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.719> gonna<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:05.030> pretty

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
chrome and I think it's gonna be pretty

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.500 
chrome and I think it's gonna be pretty
hard<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.310> slippery<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.490> yeah<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.360> think

of<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.170> women<00:05:00.290> couldn't<00:05:00.710> make<00:05:00.980> it<00:05:01.010> over<00:05:01.400> like

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
of the women couldn't make it over like

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.980 
of the women couldn't make it over like
they<00:05:01.700> sent<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.120> lot<00:05:02.300> of<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.450> teams<00:05:02.630> are<00:05:02.720> sending

they sent a lot of the teams are sending

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.290 
they sent a lot of the teams are sending
just<00:05:03.170> very<00:05:03.560> very<00:05:03.680> few<00:05:04.130> women<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:05.030> know<00:05:05.090> other

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.640 
just very very few women you know other
than<00:05:05.420> I<00:05:05.630> think<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.870> US<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.140> the<00:05:06.230> Canadian

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
than I think the US and the Canadian

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.290 
than I think the US and the Canadian
teams<00:05:06.860> are<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:07.070> only<00:05:07.220> two<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.640> sent<00:05:07.880> as<00:05:08.030> many

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
teams are the only two that sent as many

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.410 
teams are the only two that sent as many
riders<00:05:08.570> as<00:05:08.930> they<00:05:09.050> possibly<00:05:09.230> could<00:05:10.360> what<00:05:11.360> do

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
riders as they possibly could what do

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.490 
riders as they possibly could what do
you<00:05:11.480> think<00:05:11.720> about<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:11.930> do<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:12.170> think<00:05:12.380> this
