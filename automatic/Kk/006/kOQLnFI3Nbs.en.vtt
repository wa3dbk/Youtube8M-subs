00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 cost of girls so today I you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.330
 found in this video for you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.250
 do a tutorial but yart so that's 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.460
 really a super easy tutorial to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.960
 do so you will remain in voiceover and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.849
 I will introduce the verniers as 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.580
 and to where and when is it really 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.510
 something accessible to all have some 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.330
 last if not cheap and so that's it 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.820
 is going to be simple and it's gone for 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.029
 the polishes that I finished it's these 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 four pico sedan and two of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.160
 made for a to start jappix 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.930
 vernetti home is part of these games 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 Using the base can be very successful in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 use like everything as I will see 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.930
 afterwards I put the house and especially 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.559
 who suddenly it's really fun 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.960
 it's a pretty fine material so 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.629
 it's not a lot of thickness 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.629
 we can put very good as basel 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 then I wait for it to dry 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:09.189
 I apply the 20 th of chekut and that he 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.810
 369,1 totally gorgeous pink and 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.920
 I apply we have not only a 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.270
 satchel because as you go the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.810
 see that they would put easter 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.649
 my heart but really very very opaque 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.840
 and not a single layer is largely enough 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.080
 and I continue to do that especially my 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 fingers 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.720
 so there you see you did a 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.400
 cold on the bottom that because I 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.020
 I was wrong I wanted to apply 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 our color so after I go quickly 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.870
 removed and I recalled was from there 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.890
 so I apply each orange color 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:03.840
 which unfortunately 39 from sephora so it's 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.860
 the one I wanted to apply on a 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.860
 mansion where I found myself 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.560
 or one that is very opaque too and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.080
 well it avoids putting too close but 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.870
 I expect that all the dry varnish 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.060
 start with the top coat so this one 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.450
 gets rid of matifying ribs from home 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.040
 really great cusenier so I'm going 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.980
 apply it on everything but must this 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.569
 times so of course we have to wait until 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.069
 the varnish is totally dry 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:45.250
 we have more yes you will see as and when 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.450
 as you nail varnish come match 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.230
 s 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.230
 escada 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.120
 he wished there 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.200
 that you will see the result of my father 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.200
 make up my foot 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.480
 finished 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.290
 then I take belmont scotch that 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.830
 joseph the scene yes I have a lot of trouble 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.690
 look for a good thing and in the end I 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.230
 English nie can be played maybe 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.530
 family than to try to place well 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.530
 law 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.230
 and Africa again the fax and to 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:36.299
 basics from sephora and it's like these 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:57.510
 for suddenly it works well it is 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:59.760
 turned out that it's fine I do not complain 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.959
 well we're still that there is a 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.959
 polish shining in haiti 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.730
 I sell my doubts what am I 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.730
 I'm going to do that especially now 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.399
 and I have a dream of course on the nail 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.949

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.680
 the thigh 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.629

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.189
