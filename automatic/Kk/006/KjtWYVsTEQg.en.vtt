half that is enormous that is a big
piece<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.150> chaga<00:01:24.259> this<00:01:25.259> has<00:01:25.410> probably<00:01:25.770> been

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
piece of chaga this has probably been

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.080 
piece of chaga this has probably been
growing<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.940> for<00:01:27.470> 30<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.560> 40<00:01:29.009> years<00:01:29.090> that's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
growing here for 30 or 40 years that's

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.060 
growing here for 30 or 40 years that's
about<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.720> 30<00:01:30.960> 40<00:01:31.380> years<00:01:31.650> collecting

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
about probably 30 40 years collecting

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880 
about probably 30 40 years collecting
all<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.750> energies<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.200> forest<00:01:34.710> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
all the energies from this forest so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.139 
all the energies from this forest so
this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:36.259> and<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.470> makes<00:01:38.119> incredible

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
this is and this makes incredible

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
combined with with with reishi

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.330 
combined with with with reishi
this<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.430> an<00:01:44.550> incredible<00:01:45.360> tea<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:47.100> will

this is an incredible tea so this will

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.169 
this is an incredible tea so this will
last<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.179> winter<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.759> just<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.970> just
