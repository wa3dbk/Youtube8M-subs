light that has an automatic movement I

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.980 
light that has an automatic movement I
can<00:02:11.849> see<00:02:12.180> using<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990

one<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.350> things<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.740> I'll<00:02:13.830> throw<00:02:14.100> out

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
one of the things that I'll throw out

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.180 
one of the things that I'll throw out
here<00:02:14.670> are<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.720> physical<00:02:16.050> things<00:02:16.290> canvas

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
here are just the physical things canvas

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.910 
here are just the physical things canvas
jerks<00:02:17.640> on<00:02:17.910> black<00:02:18.570> nylon<00:02:18.840> canvas<00:02:19.410> drab<00:02:19.650> feels

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
jerks on black nylon canvas drab feels

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.530 
jerks on black nylon canvas drab feels
kind<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> seat<00:02:20.580> belt<00:02:21.020> it's<00:02:22.020> uh<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.920> has

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
kind of like a seat belt it's uh it has

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840 
kind of like a seat belt it's uh it has
this<00:02:24.540> metal<00:02:24.810> buckle<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.740> end<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.550> this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
this metal buckle on the end with this

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.940 
this metal buckle on the end with this
kind<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.660> sandblasted<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.650> think<00:02:28.830> it's

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
kind of sandblasted but I think it's

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.990 
kind of sandblasted but I think it's
paint<00:02:31.790> finish<00:02:32.790> on<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:35.000> additional

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
paint finish on it and the additional

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.240 
paint finish on it and the additional
loops<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.020> to<00:02:37.230> hold<00:02:37.380> down<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> strap<00:02:37.920> are

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
loops here to hold down the strap are

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.930 
loops here to hold down the strap are
just<00:02:39.030> kind<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.240> like<00:02:39.390> round<00:02:40.310> metal<00:02:41.310> bars<00:02:41.580> which

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
just kind of like round metal bars which

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.560 
just kind of like round metal bars which
is<00:02:42.120> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> cool<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.380> its<00:02:43.560> own<00:02:43.710> right<00:02:44.070> because

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
is kind of cool in its own right because

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.810 
is kind of cool in its own right because
the<00:02:45.570> whole<00:02:45.600> thing<00:02:46.080> kind<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.470> screams<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.340> more

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
the whole thing kind of screams a more

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.330 
the whole thing kind of screams a more
utilitarian<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:49.050> you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.710> not<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> lot<00:02:50.310> of

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
utilitarian just you know not a lot of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.730 
utilitarian just you know not a lot of
high<00:02:50.610> style<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.440> functionality<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.470> feel

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
high style but just functionality I feel

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.490 
high style but just functionality I feel
like<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.760> were<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.210> rock<00:02:54.510> climber<00:02:54.870> or<00:02:55.340> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
like if you were a rock climber or a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.130 
like if you were a rock climber or a
yacht<00:02:58.500> or<00:02:58.530> something<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.790> would

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
yacht or something like that you would

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.500 
yacht or something like that you would
appreciate<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.590> because<00:03:01.800> it's<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.910> looks

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
appreciate this because it's it looks

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.420 
appreciate this because it's it looks
good<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.320> form<00:03:04.860> following<00:03:05.280> function

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
good but it's a form following function

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.600 
good but it's a form following function
for<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.240> most<00:03:06.420> part<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.250> bottom

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
for the most part and then on the bottom

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.060 
for the most part and then on the bottom
of<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.970> canvas<00:03:09.840> strap<00:03:10.200> here<00:03:10.410> it's<00:03:10.620> got<00:03:10.800> a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
of the canvas strap here it's got a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.800 
of the canvas strap here it's got a
little<00:03:11.820> bit<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.330> think<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.570> synthetic

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
little bit of I think a synthetic

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
little bit of I think a synthetic
leather<00:03:13.350> that<00:03:13.670> make<00:03:14.670> sure<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.720> holes<00:03:16.320> don't

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
leather that make sure the holes don't

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
leather that make sure the holes don't
fray<00:03:17.280> so<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:18.270> on<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> outside<00:03:19.110> and<00:03:19.440> again

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
fray so it's on the outside and again

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.210 
fray so it's on the outside and again
just<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:21.000> pretty<00:03:21.390> standard<00:03:21.870> pretty<00:03:22.800> standard

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
just a pretty standard pretty standard

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.640 
just a pretty standard pretty standard
strap<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.270> not<00:03:24.420> a<00:03:24.450> NATO<00:03:24.780> strap<00:03:25.080> obviously

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
strap it is not a NATO strap obviously

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.230 
strap it is not a NATO strap obviously
because<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.950> can<00:03:26.100> see<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> back<00:03:26.550> here<00:03:26.820> so

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
because you can see the back here so

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.360 
because you can see the back here so
it's<00:03:27.360> got<00:03:27.480> an<00:03:27.600> exhibition<00:03:27.930> window<00:03:28.470> according

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
it's got an exhibition window according

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.890 
it's got an exhibition window according
to<00:03:29.490> the<00:03:29.580> specs<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.210> hardened<00:03:30.540> mineral

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
to the specs it's a hardened mineral

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.540 
to the specs it's a hardened mineral
crystal<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.740> assume<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.190> applies<00:03:32.520> to

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
crystal and I assume that applies to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.070 
crystal and I assume that applies to
both<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> front<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.480> back<00:03:33.660> they<00:03:33.840> kind<00:03:34.020> of

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
both the front and the back they kind of

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.870 
both the front and the back they kind of
make<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.290> same<00:03:34.470> sound<00:03:34.770> and<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.520> can<00:03:35.670> tell<00:03:35.820> you

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
make the same sound and I can tell you

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.180 
make the same sound and I can tell you
that<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.720> feels<00:03:36.990> like<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> mineral

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
that it just it feels like a mineral

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.250 
that it just it feels like a mineral
crystal<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.240> that's<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.990> fine<00:03:40.230> for

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
crystal and that's and that's fine for

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.740 
crystal and that's and that's fine for
everyday<00:03:40.890> use<00:03:41.130> but<00:03:41.400> as<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:42.120> wear<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.360> you'll

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
everyday use but as you wear it you'll

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.840 
everyday use but as you wear it you'll
you'll<00:03:43.020> probably<00:03:43.200> see<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.740> light<00:03:44.460> service

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
you'll probably see some light service

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.700 
you'll probably see some light service
scratches<00:03:45.240> if<00:03:45.390> you're<00:03:45.570> really<00:03:45.750> hard<00:03:46.260> on<00:03:46.530> these

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
scratches if you're really hard on these

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.380 
scratches if you're really hard on these
types<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.040> watches<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:47.970> see<00:03:48.120> some<00:03:48.300> pretty

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
types of watches you can see some pretty

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.410 
types of watches you can see some pretty
deep<00:03:48.690> scratches<00:03:49.020> eventually<00:03:49.830> it's<00:03:50.610> not<00:03:50.790> total

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
deep scratches eventually it's not total

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.180 
deep scratches eventually it's not total
it's<00:03:51.630> not<00:03:51.810> impossible<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.350> replace<00:03:52.650> crystals

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
it's not impossible to replace crystals

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.660 
it's not impossible to replace crystals
but<00:03:53.510> again<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.600> 50<00:03:54.870> 51<00:03:55.170> dollars<00:03:55.440> retail<00:03:55.800> you're

but again at 50 51 dollars retail you're

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.030 
but again at 50 51 dollars retail you're
not<00:03:56.700> going<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.390> want<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.170> reprise<00:03:58.530> spend<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.860> lot

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
not going to want to reprise spend a lot

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.820 
not going to want to reprise spend a lot
of<00:03:59.070> money<00:03:59.280> and<00:04:00.350> replacing<00:04:01.350> crystals<00:04:01.710> on

automatic<00:04:02.370> watches<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:03.120> tell<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.750> is<00:04:04.260> a

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
automatic watches I can tell you is is a

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.840 
automatic watches I can tell you is is a
quite<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.650> bit<00:04:04.830> more<00:04:04.950> difficult<00:04:05.010> than<00:04:05.430> doing<00:04:05.700> it

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
quite a bit more difficult than doing it

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.150 
quite a bit more difficult than doing it
on<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> quartz<00:04:06.420> watch<00:04:06.660> where<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:08.040> whole

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
on a quartz watch where the the whole

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.970 
on a quartz watch where the the whole
movement<00:04:08.370> comes<00:04:08.700> out<00:04:08.820> for<00:04:08.970> easily<00:04:09.240> I<00:04:10.050> wasn't

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
movement comes out for easily I wasn't

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.260 
movement comes out for easily I wasn't
able<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.160> find<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:11.490> whole<00:04:11.760> lot<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.030> information

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
able to find a whole lot of information

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.840 
able to find a whole lot of information
on<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.110> movement<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:13.770> let's<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.550> assume

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
on this movement but let's just assume

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.340 
on this movement but let's just assume
right<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.090> it's<00:04:15.360> a<00:04:15.450> Seiko<00:04:15.810> automatic

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
right now it's a Seiko automatic

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.430 
right now it's a Seiko automatic
movement<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.799> can<00:04:16.920> see<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.989> cam<00:04:19.200> they're

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
movement you can see the the cam they're

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.570 
movement you can see the the cam they're
moving<00:04:19.859> around<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.970> wait<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.479> says<00:04:21.830> 21<00:04:22.830> joules

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
moving around the wait it says 21 joules

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.470 
moving around the wait it says 21 joules
it's<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:24.000> Seiko<00:04:24.800> branded<00:04:25.800> movement

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
it's a Seiko branded movement

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.460 
it's a Seiko branded movement
and<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:27.140> actually<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:29.230> moves<00:04:30.230> pretty

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and it actually is it moves pretty

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.110 
and it actually is it moves pretty
nicely<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.130> one<00:04:31.280> of<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.430> things<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.820> can<00:04:32.000> tell

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
nicely and one of the things I can tell

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.390 
nicely and one of the things I can tell
you<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:32.390> when<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.630> order<00:04:32.960> some<00:04:33.710> really<00:04:34.070> cheap

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
you so when you order some really cheap

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.070 
you so when you order some really cheap
Asian<00:04:34.850> watches<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.360> have<00:04:35.420> automatic

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
Asian watches that have automatic

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.110 
Asian watches that have automatic
movement<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:36.500> they<00:04:36.590> do<00:04:36.770> work<00:04:36.980> you<00:04:37.700> can<00:04:37.910> just

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
movement so they do work you can just

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.570 
movement so they do work you can just
tell<00:04:38.420> that<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:39.470> machining<00:04:40.010> isn't<00:04:40.370> great

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
tell that the machining isn't great

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.980 
tell that the machining isn't great
because<00:04:41.860> sometimes<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.940> lobe<00:04:44.540> can<00:04:44.840> get

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
because sometimes the the lobe can get

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.320 
because sometimes the the lobe can get
stuck<00:04:45.410> and<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.340> actually<00:04:46.490> really<00:04:46.970> kind<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
stuck and you actually really kind of

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.750 
stuck and you actually really kind of
have<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.540> jar<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.080> get<00:04:48.260> it<00:04:48.410> unstuck<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:49.580> one

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
have to jar to get it unstuck this one

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.110 
have to jar to get it unstuck this one
really<00:04:50.300> moves<00:04:50.570> nicely<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.920> doesn't<00:04:52.490> seem<00:04:52.760> like

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
really moves nicely it doesn't seem like

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.870 
really moves nicely it doesn't seem like
it's<00:04:53.360> um<00:04:53.830> keeps<00:04:54.830> getting<00:04:55.250> stuck<00:04:55.460> on<00:04:55.610> anything

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
it's um keeps getting stuck on anything

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.020 
it's um keeps getting stuck on anything
and<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.770> know<00:04:57.890> I've<00:04:58.070> got<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.310> number<00:04:58.640> of<00:04:58.760> autumn

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
and you know I've got a number of autumn

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.520 
and you know I've got a number of autumn
other<00:04:59.210> automatic<00:04:59.720> watches<00:04:59.930> which<00:05:00.230> you<00:05:00.320> price

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
other automatic watches which you price

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.980 
other automatic watches which you price
have<00:05:01.280> probably<00:05:01.550> seen<00:05:01.700> in<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.970> videos<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.720> I

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
have probably seen in the videos and I

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.190 
have probably seen in the videos and I
can<00:05:03.020> tell<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.820> just<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:05.690> make<00:05:05.960> an

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
can tell you that just to make an

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.630 
can tell you that just to make an
automatic<00:05:06.440> movement<00:05:07.130> is<00:05:07.660> usually<00:05:08.660> pretty

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
automatic movement is usually pretty

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.490 
automatic movement is usually pretty
labor<00:05:10.640> intensive<00:05:10.790> and<00:05:11.300> pretty<00:05:11.660> expensive<00:05:12.230> so

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
labor intensive and pretty expensive so

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.410 
labor intensive and pretty expensive so
the<00:05:13.130> fact<00:05:13.370> that<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.700> can<00:05:13.850> get<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.300> this

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
the fact that you can get it in this

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.080 
the fact that you can get it in this
price<00:05:14.600> point<00:05:14.810> I<00:05:14.930> think<00:05:15.100> in<00:05:16.100> and<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.460> itself<00:05:16.820> the

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
price point I think in and of itself the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.270 
price point I think in and of itself the
movement<00:05:17.570> is<00:05:17.780> worth<00:05:18.080> it

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
movement is worth it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.040 
movement is worth it
the<00:05:19.520> other<00:05:19.820> thing<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.150> I'll<00:05:20.480> show<00:05:20.690> you<00:05:20.720> here

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
the other thing that I'll show you here

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.260 
the other thing that I'll show you here
is<00:05:21.200> that<00:05:21.470> it's<00:05:22.190> got<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.460> crown<00:05:22.730> and<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.120> a

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
is that it's got the crown and it's a

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.830 
is that it's got the crown and it's a
little<00:05:24.080> bit<00:05:24.200> below<00:05:24.820> Center<00:05:25.820> it's<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.480> a<00:05:26.510> screw

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
little bit below Center it's not a screw

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.990 
little bit below Center it's not a screw
down<00:05:26.990> crown<00:05:27.260> it<00:05:27.440> just<00:05:27.590> pulls<00:05:27.800> out<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.370> you<00:05:28.850> can

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
down crown it just pulls out and you can

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.840 
down crown it just pulls out and you can
go<00:05:29.150> ahead<00:05:29.360> and<00:05:29.630> adjust<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:31.220> time<00:05:31.490> anyway

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
go ahead and adjust the the time anyway

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.010 
go ahead and adjust the the time anyway
you<00:05:31.910> like

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
you like

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.180

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
about this watch is pretty much what you

about this watch is pretty much what you
see<00:05:44.570> is<00:05:44.690> what<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:44.960> get<00:05:45.290> it's<00:05:45.590> a<00:05:45.830> kind<00:05:46.220> of

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
see is what you get it's a kind of

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.480 
see is what you get it's a kind of
WYSIWYG<00:05:46.730> watch<00:05:47.030> it's<00:05:47.990> got<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.230> day<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:49.310> date

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
WYSIWYG watch it's got a day and date

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.910 
WYSIWYG watch it's got a day and date
which<00:05:49.700> is<00:05:49.850> nice<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.390> it's<00:05:50.720> actually<00:05:51.110> fairly

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
which is nice and it's actually fairly

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.150 
which is nice and it's actually fairly
impressive<00:05:52.490> again<00:05:52.790> for<00:05:53.060> an<00:05:53.150> automatic<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:54.160> the

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
impressive again for an automatic to the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.920 
impressive again for an automatic to the
automatics<00:05:55.910> are<00:05:55.970> not<00:05:56.150> like<00:05:56.330> quartz<00:05:56.660> in<00:05:56.780> that

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
automatics are not like quartz in that

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.900 
automatics are not like quartz in that
the<00:05:57.380> more<00:05:57.590> information<00:05:57.860> and<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.520> more<00:05:58.550> things

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
the more information and the more things

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.320 
the more information and the more things
that<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.210> automatic<00:05:59.890> movement<00:06:00.890> does<00:06:01.330> makes

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
that that automatic movement does makes

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.380 
that that automatic movement does makes
it<00:06:02.510> that<00:06:02.720> much<00:06:02.930> harder<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.530> produce<00:06:03.710> it's<00:06:04.580> a

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
it that much harder to produce it's a

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.870 
it that much harder to produce it's a
black<00:06:05.780> face<00:06:05.990> and<00:06:06.230> again<00:06:06.290> that<00:06:06.770> that<00:06:07.250> gray

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
black face and again that that gray

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.050 
black face and again that that gray
finish<00:06:08.420> that<00:06:09.020> gray<00:06:09.230> matte<00:06:09.440> finish<00:06:09.800> is<00:06:10.460> also<00:06:10.970> on

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
finish that gray matte finish is also on

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.130 
finish that gray matte finish is also on
the<00:06:11.180> stainless<00:06:11.540> steel<00:06:11.570> case<00:06:12.020> here<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:12.730> it's

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
the stainless steel case here and it's

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.530 
the stainless steel case here and it's
kind<00:06:15.140> of<00:06:15.170> a<00:06:15.320> nice<00:06:15.530> it's<00:06:15.890> nice<00:06:16.220> look<00:06:16.580> to<00:06:17.420> be

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
kind of a nice it's nice look to be

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.700 
kind of a nice it's nice look to be
really<00:06:17.840> honest<00:06:18.290> I<00:06:18.470> like<00:06:19.430> the<00:06:19.700> design<00:06:20.380> if<00:06:21.380> this

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
really honest I like the design if this

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.760 
really honest I like the design if this
were<00:06:22.120> ten<00:06:23.120> millimeters<00:06:23.720> larger<00:06:24.290> in<00:06:24.560> diameter

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
were ten millimeters larger in diameter

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.850 
were ten millimeters larger in diameter
so<00:06:25.700> a<00:06:25.730> forty<00:06:26.270> seven<00:06:26.570> millimeter<00:06:26.750> instead<00:06:27.440> of<00:06:27.620> a

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
so a forty seven millimeter instead of a

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.420 
so a forty seven millimeter instead of a
thirty<00:06:28.280> seven<00:06:29.020> me<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.170> this<00:06:30.320> watch<00:06:30.530> it<00:06:31.100> would

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
thirty seven me and this watch it would

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.370 
thirty seven me and this watch it would
be<00:06:31.460> even<00:06:31.820> more<00:06:32.240> desirable<00:06:32.570> this<00:06:32.930> is<00:06:33.080> actually

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
be even more desirable this is actually

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.990 
be even more desirable this is actually
