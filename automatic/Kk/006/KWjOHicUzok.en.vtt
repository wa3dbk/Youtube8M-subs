00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 and that should be so for example so 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.629
 this section is currently being upgraded 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.790
 the garden theme has par excellence 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.440
 create many times if ever 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.670
 wants to have an overview you want 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 do not have a garden one 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.089
 vegetable garden where it really wants 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.540
 self-catering will be over the whole 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.240
 year 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.859
 but it works today and it has to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.320
 I always say we live in one 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.320
 Great time even if everyone is over 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.849
 complain everything and will for their 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 scandals we have in everyday life 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.140
 in a fantastic time 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.969
 we lack nothing and what we here 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 in the end, doing everything in the garden is everything 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.540
 our leisure time 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120
 we do not have to reap that one 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.829
 but can enjoy the pleasure and 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 that's what it's all about and therefore 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
 really a high bed embodies that you 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.059
 have on a relatively small beet one 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.219
 Crops can experience as if from one 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.010
 seed suddenly a vegetable becomes one 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.230
 carrots radishes a tomato is used for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.789
 yourself or for your children and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 grandchildren better profit that is the 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.390
 main task of us the children 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 ever explain how grows 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.690
 a tomato bent at all he could 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.519
 many do not have any at all 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.119
 guess who is going to say that now for that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.159
 live in the country but if in vienna one 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.130
 dear friend and he has the following 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.840
 tells gardeners children or said in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 The city has no idea 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.009
 how something grows 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.130
 and then I had a kindergarten 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 invited to put in a pot 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.880
 given earth or potatoes like apples 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 we say and nature used 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 had explained why and how and what and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.990
 the growing and form to bloom and it 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.450
 with home give the pot and then 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.790
 came hold the call one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.640
 mother after a few weeks otherwise ground 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.010
 come up there the fruits 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.840
 so now we are laughing about it now 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.670
 again over it but I pray that 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680
 probably many have no idea 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.180
 How raspberries grow like blackberries 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.520
 Growing the talk of the city 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.229
 big city and that 's probably the one 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.259
 main reason why people suddenly 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.050
 Again I want to pull tomatoes 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.520
 I do not want to see carrots grow 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.190
 because we have to survive but because 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 we have this experience of growing and being 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.209
 want to enjoy harvest and that is 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.790
 probably the symbol raised bed on 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.239
 Smallest room a big yield too 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.130
 to have 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.260
 this has been described exactly with always 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.660
 again a sketch that you can see below and 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.489
 Guitar puts grids against the mice 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.880
 and probably also no mice 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.350
 I have some to give 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360
 very nice i tell you really nice 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.280
 you do not have to worry 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.769
 these mice eat everything so they 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.900
 ensure survival 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.800
 Incredible meuser sandra so there 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.230
 then cut them into compost 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.880
 kreuser fresh compost finished compost 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.040
 and above ground and then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.140
 planted and that is something really 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.239
 a huge really huge 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.610
 power has such a high bed you have one 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 harvest that is huge and really huge 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.140
 that probably excites the people
