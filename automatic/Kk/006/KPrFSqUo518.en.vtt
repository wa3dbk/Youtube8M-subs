00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello we are on the stand acer mwc 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.660
 to present you the acer liquid e 1 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.380
 a mid-range android smartphone 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.940
 ok here we see a finish a little bit 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.279
 plastic rather unpleasant in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.080
 plastic a polo kind rubber qua 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.250
 no who do not say hands it's 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.660
 rather nice good he would announce a 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.820
 very high-end finish is a 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 mid-range smartphone but it's 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 not bad it's not too cheap 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 how can the sometimes used to 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.320
 level of technical characteristics 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.300
 so it's a smartphone to a screen of 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 4.5 inches by cons it is only 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.000
 in 960 by 540 so it's not a slab 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 hd so low pixel density 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 but hey that's it 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 acceptable we have already seen already seen worse 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.789
 even if we would still like how 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.430
 better level power so it rests 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.070
 on a dual core processor 1 gig hertz 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.120
 he has a 5 megapixel camera 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.739
 with led flash and it is under android of 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 jelly bean so the 4-point version 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.049
 so we have at the front a front camera 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 of 0.3 megapixel and so as it is 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.430
 see at the level of many hits so c 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.049
 was slightly modified by acer but 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.170
 it remains discreet that rather widgets 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.760
 that something else here we have a slight 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.760
 slight graphical changes from there 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.350
 that the notification bar is by 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.810
 against the level of settings it's 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.480
 relatively relatively classic 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.370
 it's really google design here 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.710
 very slightly modified enough salary 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.410
 fluid we still have a processor 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.390
 dual-core on it so there is no 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.070
 real reason the high level 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.910
 battery which he embarks a battery 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.800
 of 1760 milliamperes and its strength lies 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.080
 especially in his case we know 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.450
 officially at 199 euros so here is a 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.780
 just under 200 euros probably very 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.220
 very quickly 170 160 euros in the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.080
 stores all the more so he's going out 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.460
 one as early as March where alan who will 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:05.460
 available very soon so for a 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 official price at the launch of 199 sure
