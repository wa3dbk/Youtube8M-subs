00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.930
 hi to all by cropping makers today 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.450
 we are here to review a 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.830
 product which is the zuma h1 microphone 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:25.010
 purchased together with his access of pec 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.590
 access to the non-material traveler 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.050
 of why it comes with this 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.449
 carrying case very well 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.210
 done august with a monkey of 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:39.830
 attach the belt this is the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.070
 support for the star and microphone ie 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.659
 just enable the microphone on the screw 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.610
 that under which I see, 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.699
 stick this mic that is one 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.229
 windproof sponge still serves the neck 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.409
 even without the wind it will be anyway 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:57.290
 reduce the background noise that rustling 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.710
 annoying very convenient then there is the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:05.720
 USB charger with the cable is a small one 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.590
 tripod to use it from the table let's go to 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.590
 see the microphone 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:20.030
 then here it is very light weight 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.030
 160 g, the plastic construction, however, not 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.310
 looks fragile it looks quite sturdy 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.070
 on the front it is very intuitive because it is there 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.850
 the display is the button to start e 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.460
 finish administration on the side we find 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:39.350
 input for headphones or for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.330
 attach it to an external microphone or 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.950
 to an amplifier if you want to hear 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.210
 what is recording and the volume 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.160
 of headphones 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.310
 the entry for the micro sd that precisely 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.050
 remember a micro sd and not sd col 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.630
 microphone is included one by him eyelashes e 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.080
 the usb adapter 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.159
 on the other side we find the entrance to 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.050
 sorry this year the entrance for the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.060
 microphone and this for the headphones here 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.860
 c point input for the microphone and the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.560
 recording of the acquisition volume 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.360
 built-in microphone or the one 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.090
 connected we remember is in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.819
 xy configuration or a dream 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.849
 crossover records in this way e 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.319
 can perceive more levels not 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.989
 only the first one who speaks but 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.550
 perceives more levels for only one more 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.110
 then accurate buttons for 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.130
 listen to the recording we have 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.130
 done delete it turn on and off e 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.990
 Lock the buttons and the USB cable to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.740
 synchronizing a computer can load it 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:41.400
 below is the cash to listen 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.440
 the audio is behind here we find among the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.050
 selectors one for quality or in 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.270
 web format in mp3 and wav la 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.730
 better quality because it is not compressed into 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.660
 able to get 24 bit recording a 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.090
 96,000 hertz then we have the regulation 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.600
 automatic level ie understands from 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.570
 just as much as raising or lowering 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.380
 the acquisition goes from less than 40 decibels 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.510
 at 0 and the low pass filter though 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.040
 will cut off annoying low frequencies 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.420
 as an example we are recording and passing 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.730
 a car and a distance that makes one 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.010
 very low frequency this excludes it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.140
 el to the hole for the screw parade dear to 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.040
 easel the penalty to enter is one 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.480
 normal aa stylus stack and allows us to 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:29.160
 make a recording of more or less one 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.620
 ten hours 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.870
 anyway so a good range 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.110
 even even more even more hours if we 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.280
 we continue to stop the sen 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.989
 remember that the web format occupies 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.180
 much more space than the mp3 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.100
 obviously in the case of memory 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.020
 integrated 2 GB with the web at 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.620
 highest quality we will be able to record 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.360
 more or less 45 50 minutes of audio while 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.670
 already on the mp3 are on the three four 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
 hours of audio but the advantage of the web 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.239
 that we will have much less rustling than 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.720
 background and better quality not 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'm more embracing now we'll go to 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.700
 make a video that is let's continue the video 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.890
 feeling the difference between the microphone 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.620
 what we're using now that's it 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.530
 here is the audio m the pro luxury and sb 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.060
 which is a condenser microphone 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 attached to the mac via usb and sta 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.980
 acquiring then we will compare this here 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.680
 testing supplements to our canon 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.520
 signs that he is recording and then the audio 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.889
 zoom to hear the difference 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.930
 ok this is the registration test 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.250
 audio with the m audio microphone 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.650
 connected with the usb 123 test 123 test 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.830
 this is the audio recorded by the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.479
 integrated canon 6 microphone 123 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:47.659
 try 123 ok this is the audio that 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.150
 we are recording from the zoom to 1 with the 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:53.659
 active low pass filter and level 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.590
 automatic noise 123 finds one the 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.440
 lugo and 3rd test 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.150
 ok to recording always from zoom h1 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.819
 this time with the windproof sponge 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.110
 inserted to hear if it always changes 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:11.740
 records in 96 kg 24-bit hearts 123 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:14.000
 try 123 test for this review e 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.520
 listening to the difference in quality of the 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.849
 Three microphones are all cuts right now 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.849
