00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.559
When humans invented the wheel

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.639
it was the beginning of a long list of
vehicle designs.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.059
This long and sometimes rather crazy
history

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000
was particularly amazing during the 20th century.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.620
Here's a taste...

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.970
"Gravity itself is our motor power and pulls us along."

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.830
In 1930, John Archival Purves patented the Dynasphere,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.940
a mono-wheel vehicle inspired by a sketch made by Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.680
Two prototypes were made -

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.880
an electrical model and another one
with a gasoline motor.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.820
This one could reach 30 miles per hour

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.690
and after several tests it was hailed for years as the high-speed vehicle of the future!

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.350
However, the dynasphere never left its prototype stage

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.840
because, like with most mono-wheels,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.280
is was nearly impossible to steer or brake.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.760
One might agree, these are pretty important features!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.360
Rigid airships, commonly called Zeppelins,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.740
enjoyed a relative success from
the early 1900s

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.360
until the end of the 1930s.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.780
The world's first airline in revenue service,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.500
the German DELAG, had
carried over 10,000 paying passengers

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
in more than 1,500 flights by
1914.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.140
And during World War 1, the Germans used Zeppelins to bomb British territory

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.169
killing over 500 people.

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:26.680
Their defeat in World War 1

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.030
forbade German companies from
building new Zeppelins until the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.649
prohibition was lifted in 1926.

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.880
That's when this vehicle had its second
golden decade,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.660
building the LZ-129 Hindenburg
which operated regular transatlantic

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.509
flights from Germany to America.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.860
In 1937, the Hindenburg disaster

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.920
started the downfall of this vehicle.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.080
Not that we have footage from the period,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.649
but an early Chinese text, "The Book of the Golden Hall Master",

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.929
dated 500AD,  already describes large vehicles

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.649
with masts and sails mounted on
them.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.520
These wind-driven carriages were able to carry

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.200
30 people at once.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.530
It wasn't until 1600 that these vehicles were introduced to Europe,

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.170
mainly for recreation purposes.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.180
However, during the 19th century and the early 20th century,

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.940
land yachts were also used for the transport of goods on dry lakes in the US.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.720
"The United States Navy reveals the
closest thing yet to a magic carpet.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.920
"It's called the flying platform."

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.479
In 1955, they thought that perhaps

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.140
this could become the
personal vehicle of the future.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.849
The Hiller VZ1 Pawnee, also known as the "flying platform",

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.000
was a rotor aircraft designed by the US Army

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.340
that lifted a platform using contra
rotating ducted fans.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.080
The pilot had to shift his body weight to control its direction.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.280
Six prototypes were built and they flew successfully

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.750
at a maximum speed of 26km per
hour.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.720
However, it was discarded as a combat vehicle due to its small size,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.110
slow speed - and the fact that it could only fly a few feet above the ground.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.780
The SP350 Denise is linked to the
name a famous scientist Jacques Cousteau.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.100
Denise was the very first
underwater vehicle designed

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.450
for scientific exploration.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.280
This diving saucer sailed the depths of the oceans from 1959.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.060
She could work as deep
as 350 meters down.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.920
She moved like a squid, with a simple jet
propulsion system that gave her a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.820
a maximum speed of 3.7 km an hour.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.660
With a capacity of two people. stretched
on mattresses.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.650
the scientists inside would watch their
surroundings through tilted portholes

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.710
that allowed them to get just a few
centimeters from theirs subjects.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.880
Equipped with movable lights,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.380
cameras and tape recorders, Denise
became an essential piece

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.320
of Cousteau's ship, the Calipso, until 1965.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.320
Nobody's saying or disputing whether flying saucers exist nowadays,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.700
but we know now that during the 50s,
the armies of several nations

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.260
developed designs for flying disks that looked very much like our idea of a UFO.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.920
Does that explain anything?

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.860
As they say: the truth is out there!

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.830
"Sorry to disappoint you. It didn't drop in
from Mars or Venus.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.080
"It has been suggested that the aircraft of
the future may well develop along these

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.440
"lines - or rather curves!"

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.670
In 1959, the union of the hovercraft and
the motor scooter

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.430
gave us the hover scooter.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.580
Although technically airborne, it became clear
that it couldn't really raise above the

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.520
six inches or so of air cushion.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.220
Its rather bulky shape and the
unprotected ducted fan on the front

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.380
were the reasons why this vehicle never
went mainstream.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.860
We have longed for this invention as a
means of transport

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.260
since we watched James Bond fly using a similar gadget.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.600
The jet pack is a real device propelled by jets of escaping gases

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.270
that lift a single traveller into the air,
allowing him to fly.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.520
It started being developed in the
1960s when sci-fi technology

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.790
was actually available

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.470
and it has been used for astronauts' extra-vehicular activities.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.700
However the Earth's gravity, and the difficult adaptation

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.000
of humans to flying, naturally have been the main obstacles for not using it

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.330
in the army

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.590
or as a means of personal transport.
