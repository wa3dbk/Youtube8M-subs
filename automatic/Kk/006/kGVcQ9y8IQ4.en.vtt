a<00:02:02.359> little<00:02:02.479> while<00:02:02.569> so<00:02:03.319> we<00:02:03.439> tried<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:03.739> do

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:03.889 
a little while so we tried to do

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:05.289 
a little while so we tried to do
strength<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.340> other<00:02:04.489> night<00:02:04.700> we've<00:02:05.270> been

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
strength the other night we've been

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.920 
strength the other night we've been
doing<00:02:05.689> that<00:02:05.840> but<00:02:06.079> not<00:02:06.319> no<00:02:06.529> cardio

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
doing that but not no cardio

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.230 
doing that but not no cardio
so<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.649> was<00:02:08.770> kind<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.100> damper<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:09.789> that's

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
so that was kind of a damper but that's

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.050 
so that was kind of a damper but that's
okay<00:02:10.479> it's<00:02:10.869> gonna<00:02:11.050> be<00:02:11.200> better<00:02:11.350> so<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.610> heal<00:02:12.790> and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.570 
okay it's gonna be better so to heal and
