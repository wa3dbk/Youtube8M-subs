00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.769
 I'm tony strong the first time I run 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.150
 a man three in the thriller with us 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.219
 but that we still have one and a half months 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.320
 waiting does not stop us 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.390
 with a shelf of comics armed 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.860
 latest and longest so far 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.290
 trailer disassemble down 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.030
 What's the story and themes? 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.460
 of the third film with the red golden 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.960
 be a venture for the new one 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.690
 antagonists may be an absolute 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.489
 take the classic franchises of 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.929
 Mandarin is one of the oldest enemies 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.199
 from a man and has it a first 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:40.059
 occurs already in 1964 his trademark 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.100
 are ten rings of one 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.050
 crashed alien spaceship stolen 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.530
 has and various forces him super 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.679
 gives 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.449
 since in a man once the tennis 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.190
 mentioned as a group of terrorists 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.960
 were these rings in the film 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 probably more symbolic of the power 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.979
 of the mandarin over different 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.690
 terrorist organizations also the 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.609
 occupation of the almond ring smit server in 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.079
 kingsley is close to the background 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.039
 the character of the movie is strong 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.379
 is being revised 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.150
 he should not be Chinese 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.620
 to be a descendant and not a master 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.630
 several martial arts 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.670
 the previous pictures of kings left 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.960
 Mandarin at the same time but also remember 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.370
 not to the modern comic 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.020
 interpretation of a rich 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.790
 industrial tycoons in suit 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.590
 there is probably a whole new one here 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 own design of the also on the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.150
 was selected 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.460
 on the side of the good remains this time 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.690
 the cast will be constant thursday 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.760
 Of course, from Robert Downey 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.980
 played junior and also gwyneth paltrow 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.230
 is back as virginia pepper potts again 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.510
 while james rhodes will once again by 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.280
 don cheadle and jon favreau 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.020
 who was previously the director of the series 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.970
 kicks again as a driver and 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.070
 bodyguard happy eyes on even if he 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.050
 his post behind the camera at shane 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.870
 has given the black also with am 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.940
 script has worked black has as 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.530
 author with the live web in series or with 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.150
 deadly christmas a hand for 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.920
 Action proved but as a director 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.870
 so far only kiss kiss bang bang 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.490
 delivered in which he but already with 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.040
 Robert Downey Jr. worked together 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.900
 the change seems to be on everyone 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 fall as soon as the trailer hint 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.080
 by a rather gloomy tone of the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.700
 third to make a human noticeable 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 tony strongly has obviously 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 now a real army of 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.010
 armor built and a classic from 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.690
 the comics the so-called hall 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 low water for the containment of 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.850
 green monster incidents is too 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.350
 with it 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.970
 what is already shown is the new one 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.650
 ability of tony strong his 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690
 technology apparently just per 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.940
 to control thought is one 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.830
 loan from a 2005 published 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.170
 comic series about a man with the title 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.930
 extreme thoroughly fresh the heroes 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.090
 has overworked extremely it is a nano 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.470
 Technology that enables the body 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.360
 a human virtually from the inside 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.250
 to rebuild and change 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.290
 while the main purpose is actually the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.970
 create better reflexes more effectively 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.070
 organ and superhuman strength and 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.630
 Speed ​​is exploiting Tony Strong in 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.790
 the comic template same technology 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.930
 to fundamentally change his brain 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.570
 and the networking with 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.410
 different wireless 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.209
 to enable communication means 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.280
 a consequence of this is also the ability 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.270
 communicate directly with the armor 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.010
 and remotely control them 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.300
 it indicates even more that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.550
 extreme is a very important partner 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.530
 the story will be with the development 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.480
 employ people from the comic are 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.769
 as figures listed in the film and also in the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.600
 trailer to see how here 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.239
 inventors meyer hanson or her 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.890
 colleague eldridge alien also we see 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.870
 a short excerpt of an operation 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.940
 anton probably strong with the extreme 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.440
 The man also has to do it 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.480
 trying him in the comics, the 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 nanotechnology as 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.300
 to use a mass destruction weapon 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.860
 connection to the current villain 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.860
 is already outside the 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.630
 films this scene might indicate that 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.160
 even rows of people with extreme 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.290
 to be infected and changed 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.700
 So a whole troupe so revised 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.040
 opponent could occur 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.019
 this, in turn, and other aspects of the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.060
 story remind of the current and very 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.300
 successful comic series like invincible 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.430
 the new design by rudi as one 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.380
 Patriot is actually from a phase 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.180
 taken in the spiderman opponent 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.040
 Norman Osborn takes control of the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.959
 also from the movies and ventures 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.670
 well-known organization switched over 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.250
 and also some technology of 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.930
 startup had something to do with it 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.970
 all probable not a topic of 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.739
 films becomes air force one 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.600
 see is an address under president 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.430
 government use of 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.229
 Strong technology for defense 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.760
 purposes play a role 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.530
 Explosions in turn affect the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.360
 strokes from the same series 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.620
 the likewise stolen technology of 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.270
 Strongly used 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.400
 what are the questions about his reaction 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.250
 in the trailer would explain if he was like that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.780
 indirectly co-responsible 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.130
 besides, it is personally the attack 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.990
 on starks villa was already in the first 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.060
 trailer and beyond 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.980
 pepper potts seems to be some trouble 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.110
 and possibly even 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.580
 to come in contact with extreme it and 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.470
 The relationship with Tony is strong 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.850
 apparently something serious that continues 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.310
 never really wanted anything in the comics 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.750
 but will be like the two and 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.490
 even if it guarantees a lot 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.900
 Uncertainties will be huge 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.650
 plush animals seem to be fine again 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.990
 to be able to do 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.820
 a detail in matters of humor background 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.800
 we noticed in the last one 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.720
 scene of the trailer track tony strong 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.030
 t-shirt with the inscription em 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.650
 the warmed up the american ones are one 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.690
 repeating group of opponents of 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.460
 once their logos were already on 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.990
 sings and we are comfortable 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.790
 not far from the window when we are 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.350
 assume that they belong to the groups 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.780
 belong to the mandarin presumably 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.370
 uses and controls and to good 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.680
 last product placement 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.330
 a man continues to drive if he 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.640
 not just wearing an armor and im 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.350
 trailer the hybrid audi r8 e-tron 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.490
 nevertheless not even on the market is and 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.560
 because of difficulties with the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.669
 battery capacity maybe a whole 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.380
 will not wait 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.090
 that keeps a tony strong naturally 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.900
 not from the thing ever to 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.940
 to run 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 if we say as a result of the trailer 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.690
 what must come in the coming man 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.970
 three would happen it would be the following 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.800
 due to increasing terror threat 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.900
 pressure is strongly exerted on tony the 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.100
 A technology that makes the start more generous 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.229
 to provide 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.120
 the probably prompt refusal as well 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.100
 attacks with the help of strong technology 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.900
 make sure that toni on the edge 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.180
 is pushed and that extreme program 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.530
 his chance really gets 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.270
 behind the whole staging of the 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.310
 mandarin, which at the same time global 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.200
 implementing terror plans and competition 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.090
 a man wants to get out of the way 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.680
 at the end of thursday only remains 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.300
 Even a treatment with extreme too 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.260
 undergo for this threat 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.200
 to be able to compete 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.910
 showdown as much as be wrong 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.419
 You can start in the cinema at the beginning of May 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.160
 see 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:21.840
 in advance, but let us in comments 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.190
 know what we have overlooked or 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.789
 which other connections possible 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.789
 would
