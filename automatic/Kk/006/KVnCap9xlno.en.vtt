00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 because you can spend consul as well 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.109
 said this time is that there is someone who 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 come to put order or make someone 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.190
 You have to first get the Lord North 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.370
 santa cruz that when he hits the win 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.289
 and he is self-diagnosed to be well 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.570
 to be wrong I did it like this in all 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 stories in the internal cross the other 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 History of knowing because it has been spoken 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 much that economically blue cross no longer 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.650
 is that power funds some 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
 years was that you have to care more 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.020
 budget that are no longer in the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.020
 moment like to run like this 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 as to bring players high 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 league quality of the league itself mx 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.170
 blue cross is still stuck to the idea that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.030
 is not his and is not a reality 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.530
 gentlemen stole trucks of yours what 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.530
 they took the second division finalist 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:59.090
 many many 56 in their own way 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.330
 manuel madrid that both here they were 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.330
 in the second action 44 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:21.800
 it was not a party where he made a fool of himself 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.800
 but that was killed to say it was 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.410
 something that dominated him was the word 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:34.890
 for a bad game but you told him what 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:37.530
 who does not work on the radio in a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.479
 blue cross problem but it does with another 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.030
 he is free so I also less than 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.500
 the cougars but everything is more free 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.899
 well you can speak well Cougars 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.250
 can speak well we already understood it well 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.250
 we want to see him I was right 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.440
 the topic here is what you say is 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.910
 important blue cross does not have the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.550
 resources already to go for those figures 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.260
 but more than betting on something if the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.820
 you have to see I do believe that the 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.540
 budget that they have because there's no 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.730
 be very wise to know that you are paid 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.800
 to help and take advantage of it but help 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.140
 to define a project look if 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.510
 define it sportingly 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.910
 pachuca with all the criticisms that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.910
 his directors deserve 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.090
 he wants to play I understand his a 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.090
 pure youth project 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.040
 with propped up with 34 veterans 5 of 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
 soon in excess of foreigners and that of 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.120
 sundance to pull you close once 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.830
 that is playing something is not invested in 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390
 a structure of basic forces 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.090
 is giving they are going to sell their 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 players there is something or even have in 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
 america is a firm firm project 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.570
 the great figures bring the offensive 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 it is a definite project 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.030
 chivas is today defined with those of the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.140
 Blue Cross tower if in limbo 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.910
 The limb 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.310
 you are cougars like in limbo are 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.390
 many teams cross blue buy fidel 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.390
 martÃ­nez tomorrow of the u of g 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.330
 decisions that are going to serve the 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 life footballers who have worked your 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.459
 equipment happens what to what I do 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.709
 but if I red 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.420
 it is always characterized not only once a 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.420
 bring the figure of the league 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 placement 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.480
 the reality is that you do not give the channel to one 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.550
 it reaches you there are other teams always 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.800
 they beat the figure once the figure the 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.209
 Benitez League who took it to America 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.760
 the figure of the league 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.760
 Oribe a background 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:02.330
 huntsman who also had his things ok 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 but I told them soccer player 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:17.360
 red as I played in Morelia 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.360
 I did not play 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.030
 red as was his attitude to life 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.030
 I insist consists of Morelia 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:42.270
 to the angels this account that there was 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.700
 entered in bolus 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.700
 I read a colleague of the press 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.650
 I already since I really red and it puts 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.780
 someone care this people cross blue or 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.930
 Red leaves an impressive speed in 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.760
 your car when the people are 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.070
 cause an accident something is going to happen 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.510
 some day for that but it's 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.280
 completely out of control now 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.950
 also probably another technician can 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.720
 put in place but many people and 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.830
 I leave you if in the personal aspect that 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.430
 here we do not get 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:27.960
 the truth if something happened very strong with him 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:32.790
 but not very strong the personal and the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:37.760
 very strong end the cut and this one 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:40.230
 affected did not want and the problem was 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.640
 when a technician and I have nothing in 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.410
 against luis fernando but that you do not 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.400
 you know put the same order in the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.350
 dressing and a science is blue but I 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.410
 I return to the subject and I do not know what has happened to him 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.380
 to this man whatever if he suggests 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.790
 drama does not justify the other does not justify 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.790
 the author from a point of view the 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.100
 lowering the cut but again there is 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.940
 where the manager will not coach 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.940
 exercise
