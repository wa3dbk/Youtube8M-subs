00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
boat the truth of the matter is

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.030 
boat the truth of the matter is
fiberglass<00:00:41.700> boats<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> hull<00:00:43.020> shape<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
fiberglass boats have a hull shape that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760 
fiberglass boats have a hull shape that
allows<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:45.000> bit<00:00:45.120> drier<00:00:45.360> ride<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
allows for a little bit drier ride and a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130 
allows for a little bit drier ride and a
little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.070> smoother<00:00:47.430> ride<00:00:47.930> aluminum<00:00:48.930> boats

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
little bit smoother ride aluminum boats

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.889 
little bit smoother ride aluminum boats
allow<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> better<00:00:50.399> whole<00:00:50.820> shot<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> that's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
allow for a better whole shot and that's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
allow for a better whole shot and that's
really<00:00:52.379> important<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.280> you're<00:00:53.370> trying<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
really important when you're trying to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
really important when you're trying to
traverse<00:00:54.000> big<00:00:54.480> waves<00:00:54.719> because<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.469> boat

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
traverse big waves because the boat

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.979 
traverse big waves because the boat
would<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.010> lot<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.250> responsive<00:00:57.239> compared

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
would be a lot more responsive compared

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
would be a lot more responsive compared
to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.289> sluggishness<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> glass<00:00:59.789> boat

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
to the sluggishness of that a glass boat

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
to the sluggishness of that a glass boat
will<00:01:00.210> give<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.649> you'd<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.100> to

really have is an ideal boat that would
have<00:01:04.290> both<00:01:04.530> characteristics<00:01:05.309> there's<00:01:05.790> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
have both characteristics there's really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.850 
have both characteristics there's really
not<00:01:06.180> any<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.869> other<00:01:07.049> than<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.590> boat

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
not any out there other than this boat

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.520 
not any out there other than this boat
here<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.390> different<00:01:10.260> type<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
here this is kind of a different type of

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.580 
here this is kind of a different type of
technology<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.270> stretch<00:01:12.630> form<00:01:13.020> aluminum

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
technology it's a stretch form aluminum

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830 
technology it's a stretch form aluminum
hull<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.820> means<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
hull and what that means is that the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840 
hull and what that means is that the
boat<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> characteristics<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> aluminum

great hole shot unbelievable

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.030 
great hole shot unbelievable
responsiveness<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.770> built

a<00:01:53.610> dry<00:01:53.939> smooth<00:01:54.509> ride<00:01:54.899> even<00:01:55.439> though<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> an

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
a dry smooth ride even though this is an

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.819 
a dry smooth ride even though this is an
aluminum<00:01:56.909> boat<00:01:57.149> which<00:01:57.990> gives<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.380> again<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
aluminum boat which gives you again that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
aluminum boat which gives you again that
whole<00:01:59.040> shot<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.909> responsiveness<00:02:00.840> it's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
whole shot and the responsiveness it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.069 
whole shot and the responsiveness it's
shaped<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.310> fiberglass<00:02:03.000> boat<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.810> has

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
shaped like a fiberglass boat it has

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.889 
shaped like a fiberglass boat it has
reversed<00:02:04.710> running<00:02:05.549> strikes<00:02:05.969> what<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.689> means

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
reversed running strikes what that means

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
reversed running strikes what that means
is<00:02:07.110> when<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> boat<00:02:07.680> comes<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.459> rough

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
is when the boat comes down on rough

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.910 
is when the boat comes down on rough
water<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> cushions<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> fall<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.830> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
water it cushions in the fall so you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.080 
water it cushions in the fall so you
don't<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.430> pound<00:02:11.730> pound<00:02:12.180> pound

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
don't get that pound pound pound

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.240 
don't get that pound pound pound
it<00:02:13.450> also<00:02:13.599> throws<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> water<00:02:14.319> down<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.980> out

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
it also throws the water down and out

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.070 
it also throws the water down and out
which<00:02:15.819> gives<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.239> more<00:02:16.269> of<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.660> cushioning

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
which gives you more of a cushioning

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.220 
which gives you more of a cushioning
effect<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.800> very<00:02:18.250> severe<00:02:19.000> reverse<00:02:19.750> chime

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
effect as a very severe reverse chime

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.009 
effect as a very severe reverse chime
dope<00:02:20.530> into<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:21.040> again<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.970> results<00:02:22.810> in

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
dope into it again that results in

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.320 
dope into it again that results in
cushioning<00:02:23.650> effect<00:02:23.800> drawing<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.879> water<00:02:25.090> out

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
cushioning effect drawing the water out

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.479 
cushioning effect drawing the water out
into<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.019> side<00:02:26.260> instead<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.890> up<00:02:27.010> into<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.370> air

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
into the side instead of up into the air

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.100 
into the side instead of up into the air
where<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.819> wind<00:02:28.060> can<00:02:28.239> get<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.450> back<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:28.870> spray

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
where the wind can get it back and spray

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.990 
where the wind can get it back and spray
it<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.319> your<00:02:29.470> face<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.549> other<00:02:30.610> thing<00:02:30.970> that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
it in your face the other thing that

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.080 
it in your face the other thing that
this<00:02:31.330> boat<00:02:31.540> has<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.980> set<00:02:33.430> back<00:02:33.700> just

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
this boat has is a is a set back just

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.789 
this boat has is a is a set back just
like<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.299> fiberglass<00:02:34.900> boat<00:02:35.200> would<00:02:35.379> have<00:02:35.410> it

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
like a fiberglass boat would have it

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.130 
like a fiberglass boat would have it
gives<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.190> better<00:02:36.489> performance<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.510> top-end

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
gives you better performance and top-end

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.050 
gives you better performance and top-end
speed<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.010> not<00:02:39.160> only<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.849> rough

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
speed so you not only have that rough

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.900 
speed so you not only have that rough
water<00:02:40.360> running<00:02:40.840> capability<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:42.310> smooth

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
water running capability and a smooth

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.330 
water running capability and a smooth
dry<00:02:43.239> ride<00:02:43.599> but<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.260> speed<00:02:44.650> associated

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
dry ride but you have a speed associated

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.190 
dry ride but you have a speed associated
with<00:02:45.549> it<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:45.970> last<00:02:46.569> thing<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.870> this

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
with it and the last thing that this

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.880 
with it and the last thing that this
boat<00:02:47.440> has<00:02:47.739> is<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.340> running<00:02:48.910> tab<00:02:49.239> which<00:02:50.049> is<00:02:50.079> not

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
boat has is a running tab which is not

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.979 
boat has is a running tab which is not
as<00:02:51.069> much<00:02:51.250> for<00:02:51.519> rough<00:02:51.760> water<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.480> if<00:02:52.599> it<00:02:52.750> comes

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
as much for rough water but if it comes

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.720 
as much for rough water but if it comes
out<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.560> boats<00:02:53.799> gonna<00:02:53.980> actually<00:02:54.190> be<00:02:54.519> able<00:02:54.610> to

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
out the boats gonna actually be able to

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.030 
out the boats gonna actually be able to
increase<00:02:55.360> more<00:02:55.750> space<00:02:56.140> that<00:02:56.560> gives<00:02:56.799> you<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
increase more space that gives you the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.130 
increase more space that gives you the
capability<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.879> having<00:02:58.120> speed<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:59.110> a
