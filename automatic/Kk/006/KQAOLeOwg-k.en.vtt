the mixing bucket if you have a lot you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.940 
the mixing bucket if you have a lot you

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.790 
can dump it into an extra waste bucket
but<00:03:32.730> what<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.000> want<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.240> avoid<00:03:33.570> is<00:03:33.960> dumping<00:03:34.650> it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
but what you want to avoid is dumping it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.400 
but what you want to avoid is dumping it
down<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.100> drain<00:03:35.370> even<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.180> small<00:03:36.510> amount<00:03:36.540> with

inside the pipes once it's completely
hardened<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.630> just<00:03:42.780> flex<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.230> bucket

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
hardened you can just flex the bucket

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.010

dump<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> chunks<00:03:45.270> out<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.750> you'll<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:45.990> a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
dump the chunks out and you'll have a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.220 
dump the chunks out and you'll have a
clean<00:03:46.350> mixing<00:03:46.530> bucket<00:03:47.010> again<00:03:48.230> whatever

hardening<00:03:51.240> times<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:52.170> stuff<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.500> use<00:03:52.680> says<00:03:52.980> it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
hardening times this stuff I use says it

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.800 
hardening times this stuff I use says it
takes<00:03:53.280> half<00:03:53.610> an<00:03:53.760> hour<00:03:53.910> before<00:03:54.210> you<00:03:54.480> could<00:03:54.630> deem

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
takes half an hour before you could deem

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.200 
takes half an hour before you could deem
mold<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.290> plus<00:03:56.040> or<00:03:56.220> goes<00:03:56.370> through<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> chemical

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
mold it plus or goes through a chemical

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.640 
mold it plus or goes through a chemical
reaction<00:03:57.480> when<00:03:57.810> it's<00:03:57.960> mixed<00:03:58.260> with<00:03:58.410> water

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
reaction when it's mixed with water

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.100 
reaction when it's mixed with water
first<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.610> heats<00:03:59.820> up<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.270> then<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.690> gets<00:04:00.870> cool

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
first it heats up and then it gets cool

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.050 
first it heats up and then it gets cool
again<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.980> once<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.340> starts<00:04:02.610> getting<00:04:02.700> cool

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
again so once it starts getting cool

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.699 
again so once it starts getting cool
again<00:04:03.420> that's<00:04:03.930> how<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.110> know<00:04:04.320> it's<00:04:04.500> time<00:04:04.680> for

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
again that's how you know it's time for

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:50.020 
again that's how you know it's time for
the<00:04:04.950> mold

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.790 

now<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.630> get<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.990> oil<00:04:51.020> clay<00:04:51.440> out<00:04:51.470> we're

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
now to get the oil clay out we're

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.260 
now to get the oil clay out we're
basically<00:04:52.130> going<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.520> have<00:04:52.670> to<00:04:52.790> start<00:04:53.030> digging

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
basically going to have to start digging

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.150 
basically going to have to start digging
it<00:04:53.540> out<00:04:53.630> of<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.870> plaster<00:04:54.350> being<00:04:54.710> careful<00:04:55.130> not

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
it out of the plaster being careful not

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.150 
it out of the plaster being careful not
to<00:04:55.340> disturb<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.060> actual<00:04:56.420> mold<00:04:56.720> surface<00:04:57.160> so

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
to disturb the actual mold surface so

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.730 
to disturb the actual mold surface so
your<00:04:58.400> oil<00:04:58.640> model<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.450> essentially<00:05:00.170> destroyed

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
your oil model is essentially destroyed

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.350 
your oil model is essentially destroyed
at<00:05:01.040> this<00:05:01.250> point<00:05:01.640> and<00:05:01.880> you're<00:05:01.970> just<00:05:02.180> going<00:05:02.330> to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
at this point and you're just going to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:13.529 
at this point and you're just going to
ball<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.780> up<00:05:02.870> until<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.260> big<00:05:03.530> ball<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.830> clay

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.150 

if<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:14.810> wanted<00:05:15.080> to<00:05:15.199> save<00:05:15.440> your<00:05:15.590> oil<00:05:15.830> clay

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
if you wanted to save your oil clay

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.020 
if you wanted to save your oil clay
model<00:05:16.639> you<00:05:17.000> could<00:05:17.210> cool<00:05:17.539> everything<00:05:18.169> down

until<00:05:20.030> that<00:05:20.210> well<00:05:20.389> clay<00:05:20.690> model<00:05:21.139> is<00:05:21.349> hard<00:05:21.860> and

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
until that well clay model is hard and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.909 
until that well clay model is hard and
rigid<00:05:22.720> then<00:05:23.720> you<00:05:23.840> might<00:05:24.020> be<00:05:24.199> able<00:05:24.319> to<00:05:24.440> peel<00:05:24.889> it

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
rigid then you might be able to peel it

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.279 
rigid then you might be able to peel it
out<00:05:25.190> there<00:05:25.759> will<00:05:25.849> be<00:05:25.880> some<00:05:26.240> distortion<00:05:26.990> but<00:05:27.169> it

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
out there will be some distortion but it

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.900 
out there will be some distortion but it
should<00:05:27.470> be<00:05:27.590> easy<00:05:27.830> once<00:05:28.160> it's<00:05:28.370> out<00:05:28.520> of<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.729> mall

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
should be easy once it's out of the mall

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.879 
should be easy once it's out of the mall
to<00:05:29.150> sort<00:05:29.389> of<00:05:29.509> place<00:05:29.780> it<00:05:30.020> back<00:05:30.229> to<00:05:30.530> how<00:05:30.680> it's

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
to sort of place it back to how it's

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
to wash it out before we use it warm
