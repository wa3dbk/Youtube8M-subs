Jackson's<00:01:05.970> King<00:01:06.270> Kong<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.409> official<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:08.490> of

the movie that's the title of the game
I'm<00:01:12.510> sure<00:01:12.869> King<00:01:13.350> Kong<00:01:13.619> would<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.010> just

suffice<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.540> guess<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.140> felt<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
suffice but I guess they felt they have

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.230 
suffice but I guess they felt they have
to<00:01:16.770> make<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> huge<00:01:17.280> long<00:01:18.180> title<00:01:22.729> yeah<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.939> first
