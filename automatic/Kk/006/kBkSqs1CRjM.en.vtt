00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 is a random access memory random access memory is memory 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.500
 based on semiconductors that can be read and written by the microprocessor 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.109
 or other devices let fly 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.830
 uu among the features is the internal location are the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.250
 motherboard capacity 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.760
 played today it is not uncommon to find PC computers equipped with 64 128 256 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.300
 mb ram memory or 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.010
 oo access method 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.300
 is a random access memory 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.660
 oo this means that a word or country can be found in a 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.830
 directly without taking into account the Baha'is stored before or after said 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.330
 word the ram allows access to read and write information 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.650
 no access speed 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.260
 uu you can currently find ram memory systems capable of 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 make transfers at frequencies of the order of the tirabichis per second 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.130
 the ram loses all the information when disconnecting the computer types 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.800
 the rom memory is that storage memory that allows only the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.730
 reading of the information and not its destruction regardless of the 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.820
 presence or not of a source of energy that the feeding 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.510
 characteristics 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.590
 the data is not lost when it is for the team 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.850
 the stored data can not be changed 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 the rom chips contain a row of rows and columns although the way in which 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 they interact is quite different unlike the ram memories that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.680
 uses transistors to make way for a capacitor at each intersection promus 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.460
 audio to connect the lines and the value is equal to 1 on the contrary if 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.910
 the value is zero the lines do not connect at all 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.050
 There are five basic types of Rome 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.350
 but 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.559
 the flash memory top 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.010
 in this part we will talk about the cache of a hard disk 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.450
 cache memory is a ram that has the characteristic of 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.210
 be built based on transistors unlike ram memory that the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.180
 most of us use in computers which is made from 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.309
 capacitors 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.169
 characteristics 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.849
 the most important characteristic of ram memory is that all the properties 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.720
 electronic transistor 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.220
 it does not need to be dry talking constantly of electricity to 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.109
 difference of the party apra 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.870
 which needs constantly recharging 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.949
 because otherwise it loses the stored data 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.939
 that's why they tend to be memory extremely fast and also expensive points 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.869
 they are expensive memories and therefore of very little use 

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:56.739
 regularly have 80 SMEs that are inserted in a special slot 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.739
 they usually have very little storage capacity but they are too much 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.679
 fast 

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:06.199
 can coexist with other types of memories on the same main card 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.669
 parts of a cache 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.889
 card 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.659
 is a plastic plate on which the components of the 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.409
 memory 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.709
 are volatile memory modules city 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.929
 with hector 80 terminals 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.159
 memory base that is inserted into the special slot for serra 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.569
 indicates the correct position within the memory band 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:36.679
 This part shows how to increase the visual memory in a computer with 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:39.679
 operating system xp and the steps are as follows 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.980
 let's go to my pc 2 right click on properties 3 go where it says options 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.059
 advanced 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:51.749
 4 we will see in the part above we click on configuration 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.009
 5 let's go to advanced options 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.369
 6 we will see below a different button change for them we click 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.709
 7 we will see in the middle of the picture a part saying custom size and 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.959
 one part below different initial size maximum size 8 we will be 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.809
 a lot of attention in the part that says recommended is memory 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:19.570
 recommended for your pc can put a little more but it will take space 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.009
 of the hard drive and I warn that if you put more than what you give your disk 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.110
 hard 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.509
 will die so you do not risk doing something like that now a brief 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.719
 virtual memory explanation 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:34.279
 virtual memory 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.799
 is a way to reduce constant access to memory by the 

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:38.969
 processor 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:42.969
 when a program is running and especially if you have several 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.089
 open applications the computer has to load into ram memory the values 

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:52.969
 and instructions of such programs drawings memory fascinated memory 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.159

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.869
 that was all thanks for your attention the material was made by 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.400
 Miguel Angel will go up 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.580
