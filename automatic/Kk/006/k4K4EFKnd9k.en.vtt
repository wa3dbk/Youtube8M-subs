is I don't know what really the idea is
here<00:01:50.820> except<00:01:51.060> maybe<00:01:51.180> old<00:01:52.110> people<00:01:52.409> find<00:01:52.649> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
here except maybe old people find it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.289 
here except maybe old people find it
easier<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.100> use<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.579> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> cool<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
easier to use but it is kind of cool I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.840 
easier to use but it is kind of cool I
like<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:56.070> I'll<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.310> tape<00:01:56.490> looks<00:01:56.700> more

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
like it so I'll this tape looks more

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.850 
like it so I'll this tape looks more
like<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> pen<00:01:57.240> won't<00:01:57.930> fit<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> unit<00:01:58.590> itself

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
like a pen won't fit on the unit itself

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.289 
like a pen won't fit on the unit itself
of<00:01:59.130> course<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.549> that's<00:01:59.700> okay<00:01:59.880> comes<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.240> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
of course but that's okay comes with a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.200 
of course but that's okay comes with a
regular<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.950> easily<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> mouth<00:02:02.939> of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
regular one it's easily in the mouth of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.530 
regular one it's easily in the mouth of
a<00:02:03.360> puppet<00:02:03.659> giraffe<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.430> last<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.270> least
