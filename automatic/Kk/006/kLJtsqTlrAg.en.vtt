 introduced my new bike so that 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.420
 I bought yesterday so 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.009
 excuse me if I see the vocabulary again 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.619
 perfect of a cycling because I 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.640
 did not find it so that's what 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.270
 I 'll tell you is that it's rabbit 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.449
 a 26 inch rockrider on the bow 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.529
 here we recreate russia so that's 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.109
 a match that you like you can 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:36.809
 see us me cell knows that miley 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:42.809
 black rims of May 8th at the gente 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.629
 black down next to it just we have six 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.340
 mtv stubs I think that's it so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.739
 there is no course yesterday did not 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 of rubber air through a fabric that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.010
 will act veiled metal bar what by 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 against no suspension at the back 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 So here are the brakes with 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.120
 skates this not the disc brakes is a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.090
 model with brakes 10 a frame a 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 little lighter and not the same system of 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.250
 speed kit is at 300 euros me I am 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.229
 there I had 200 so it goes bankruptcy 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.920
 is other than it is a little pain in the ass 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.140
 get used to it 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 he has this speed and three dishes all 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.759
 and I realized that by tray we 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 could turn three times so basically 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.110
 there is one can say that there are nine 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.189
 trays what the three trays there and at 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 three trays per tray what for the 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.450
 the system can be rotated three times 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:43.320
 2 1 2 we can tone and three times alas 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 three times alas he is too beautiful 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.759
 turned three funds pluton and that a 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.220
 time 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.990
 so basically there are six trays here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.540
 so if place to test six test 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.490
 birdies 42,6 makes us a total of 42 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.890
 referred 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.210
 you 're still going pretty well the sword to art 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.200
 plastic only occupy the crampons 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 I said we could see 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.060
 and on this subject Spain is a model 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.979
 pedals so be cream of the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.760
 plastic pedals because it's less 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.170
 badly if we are cut to roof here is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.150
 and pick a canvas I also bought 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.390
 an antitheft on a burnt I find that 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.370
 very happy to be poked in cancale 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.769
 340 that's not good so that means so if 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.150
 anyone knows maybe it's death 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:39.319
 bike finally the model of tomorrow we 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.099
 to the water go-between so the new big 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.670
 you but me it's quite bulky 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:48.140
 against these bikes I really had 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.700
 no difficulty proofs of his six 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.040
 first boats and first gear 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.470
 so we mouline necessarily one climbs the 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.959
 ribs easily here and can also 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.060
 go down the stairs welcome they are 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:05.239
 lucid and scali easily render of a 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:08.090
 hand in any case but it brakes 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.889
 many costs of goods and basel 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.420
 front brake actually I made myself already 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.870
