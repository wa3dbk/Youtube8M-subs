00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.419
 and increase milk production 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.419
 [Music] 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.400
 most of the mothers can 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.980
 Give your babies all the milk 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.020
 that these need, however, if their 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.449
 baby does not thrive as it should 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.369
 breastfeeding you more effectively will help 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.259
 to increase milk production to 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.869
 meet the needs every time 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.550
 older baby this video will show you 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.810
 ways to increase your production of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.680
 milk and breastfeeding your baby 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.980
 [Music] 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.030
 first improve the way the baby 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030
 it comes off the chest 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.410
 if the baby only grabs the nipple 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.410
 gets very little milk 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.780
 but if you take a larger portion of the breast 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.170
 with the mouth the milk will flow more 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.170
 easily 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.260
 and learn the baby deeply at 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.150
 breast will help suckle effectively 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.840
 allowing him to extract more milk from 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.390
 breasts 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.429
 this stimulates milk production the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.429
 enough for the needs of the baby 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.980
 Many children thrive, although not 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.690
 learn well from the breast because 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.190
 principle most of mothers 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.350
 they produce more milk 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.630
 but after a few months if the baby does not 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.620
 stimulates the breasts can reduce the 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.620
 milk production 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.060
 the baby will begin to show uneasiness 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.479
 suck will give jerks or blows and can 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 completely reject the breast or suck 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.680
 during very short periods of time 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.860
 because the milk flow does not 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.380
 meets your needs 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.450
 to avoid it I tried to improve the way 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.760
 in which the baby latches on to the chest 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.960
 from the first moment when the baby 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960
 just born 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.690
 together 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.110
 then perform compressions of 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.110
 chest 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.980
 this will improve the flow of milk and will 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.860
 that the baby continues to drink if the baby is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.920
 falls asleep while Mom improves the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.350
 way it is turned on and then 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.990
 compress the breast until milk flows 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.220
 the baby will start drinking and will wake up 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.220
 when the milk comes 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.670
 perform compressions by pressing the sine 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 between the thumb and the fingers so far 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.530
 of the nipple as much as possible so that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.909
 there are no discomforts the pressure should be 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.909
 firm but not painful 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.990
 compress while the baby sucks 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.819
 and rest when the baby rests 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.620
 if the baby drinks well it is not necessary that 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.620
 you with premium 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.810
 [Music] 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.860
 and finally to mom before the baby to 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.860
 often and well 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.800
 in the first days after birth 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.320
 the baby will often have appetite so 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.230
 minus 10 times between a sunrise 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.540
 and the next the stomach of the newly 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.890
 born is small so you need 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.080
 eat little and often 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.240
 it is possible that the baby has eaten well 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.240
 and be hungry again soon 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.470
 can you arouse your interest in 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.120
 breastfeeding by placing him near his breasts 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.310
 I observed the signals that it emits and that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.430
 indicate that he wants to suck moves the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.430
 lips 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.250
 he puts a hand to his mouth 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.770
 and turns his head to one side and the other 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.900
 mom before the baby whenever I watched 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.480
 those appetite signals of day and of 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.970
 night you do not need to remember 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.480
 how long have you nursed the baby 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.600
 nor that he has not sucked 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.620
 some babies suck quickly and others 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.290
 they are slower 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.260
 the baby will know when the flow of milk 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.620
 One breast is slower and the other will 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.620
 breast 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.130
 by reducing the flow of milk is 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.669
 It is possible for the baby to release the breast 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.669
 itself 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.340
 keep him on his chest while 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.380
 you wait patiently the baby can 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.889
 start showing again signs of 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.379
 who wants to feed 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.009
 I was interested in going back to breast two 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.009
 more times 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.150
 finally satiated it is possible that the baby 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.150
 fall asleep and release the breast 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.870
 sometimes the baby suddenly 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.150
 may want more milk than before this is 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.159
 normal means that the baby is 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.159
 growing and your appetite also grows 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.090
 follow the signs of the baby and am 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:23.010
 lover you more often this will increase 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.010
 naturally milk production 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.610
 not the baby water 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.849
 sugar water 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.280
 you honey 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:39.530
 infant formulas or anything else 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.040
 can make the baby feel full 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.240
 so when suckling does not feed the same 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.400
 this will reduce milk production 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.889
 it is also possible that these products 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.129
 transmit harmful germs to the baby and 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:55.469
 make you sick 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:58.439
 instead follow the signs of the 

00:05:55.469 --> 00:06:02.149
 baby suckle often read whenever 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:02.149
 give signs that you have an appetite 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.630
 after a few days of extra breastfeeding 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.850
 as long as the baby is well attached to 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.100
 chest and you perform and compressions 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.500
 so that each lactation session is 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.450
 effective increase milk production 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.140
 and it will be enough for the needs 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.140
 of the baby 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.480
 the best milk is the maternal is the only 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.700
 that the baby needs during his 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.400
 first six months of life contains 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.740
 all the nutrients and exactly in 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.030
 the proportions necessary for your 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.870
 baby grow and flourish 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.870
 two 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.100
 remember 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.630
 almost all women can produce 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.630
 all the milk your baby needs 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.590
 I used compressions to improve the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.590
 milk flow 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.720
 if your baby latches on well and you 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.380
 breastfeed whenever you have an appetite 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:07.160
 will produce a lot of milk from you 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.160
