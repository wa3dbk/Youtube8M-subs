00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.629
 dampers is not just used to 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.399
 make your ride more enjoyable 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.530
 cushioning the chaos while you 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.400
 roll it contributes to the stability of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.980
 your vehicle 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.060
 without this traction you would risk 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.550
 to lose control 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:23.000
 these pieces play a big role in 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.500
 level safety wheel vibrations 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.330
 make sure that a piston in 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.180
 the damper sending the oil through 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.580
 a valve the absorbed energy damped the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.960
 shock for the vehicle 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.300
 this reaction occurs in both 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.650
 shock absorber tubes the tank tube 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.420
 and the cylinder that is at 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.649
 inside and that houses the stem of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.940
 piston is the compression valve 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.739
 more factories are making these two tubes to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.059
 from a sliced steel sheet 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.770
 tape in this machine a fluid of 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.690
 cooling prevents the band from 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.489
 overheat while a series of 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.149
 profiling rollers turns it into 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:05.689
 tube a road solder Sudan copper 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.579
 following this tube while the tube of five 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.530
 meters and a half comes out of the machine a 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.610
 slice torque tool to length 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.950
 buffer 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 the manufacturing process is the same 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.520
 for displacements the tank tubes 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.740
 except that they are subject to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.440
 extra step their ends 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 are compressed the damper can well 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.480
 shelter a bigger tank tubes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.940
 containing more oil the last step 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.740
 for the tank tube and the press a 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.330
 matrix inside punches the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.350
 number of the coin the date of 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.970
 manufacture and the name of the brand 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 several components are made of metal 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.150
 sintered compact press the powder in 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 a matrix then a furnace welds them 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.940
 particles this piece of sintered metal 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 is the valve by which the piston 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.619
 ejects the oil from the steel disks and a 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.690
 resort allow to control the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.310
 speed at which the valve opens 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.619
 according to the driving conditions 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.810
 a stamping tool undulate 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.259
 the end of the tube in order to retain their 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.450
 fate up the valve that is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.510
 now fully assembled the one the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.980
 bottom of the cylinder 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.600
 during this time a press punches 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.900
 steel discs in others 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 components its loops allow for 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.430
 attach the shock absorbers to the vehicle a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.410
 worker positions a cup on 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.410
 each then a robot the bunkers 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.769
 the workers inserts a loop assembly 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.390
 cut is one of the ends of the tube 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:54.299
 tank then the south 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:56.190
 this assembly and the base and place them 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.079
 on a conveyor with the end 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.790
 open up so that 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.790
 workers can insert in the cylinder 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.870
 automated injectors fill 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.819
 now these oil pieces 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.480
 specially designed to keep its 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.549
 consistency 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.549
 no matter the differences in temperature 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.040
 next comes the assembly of the head 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.319
 which comprises steel piston rod 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.470
 and fixing at the other end of 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.660
 the road shock absorber copper weld 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.510
 weld this assembly to the base with a 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.739
 cap the room is so closed it's 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.739
 slow oil inside 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 a steel protective tube is 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.430
 then welded the housing serves as barrier 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:48.300
 mud and prevents dirt from hobbling 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.700
 the movement of the piston rod a 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.860
 pad is pressed on each attachment 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.590
 the vibrations coming from the vehicle 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.000
 are thus mitigating the dampers 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 now go on a carousel 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.590
 automated robots people too 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.240
 in each and mortis hours and injects 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.230
 nitrogen to prevent the oil from 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.300
 inside to foam after injection 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.590
 the robot that the hole in nice or in 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:19.049
 a tiny pebble dassier is 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.330
 now an electrostatic painting 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.210
 a machine sends an electric current 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.400
 positive through the dampers and a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.410
 negative current through the particles 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.480
 painting like a magnet 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 static electricity attracts the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.490
 paint on the shock absorbers in one 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.170
 perfectly uniform layer 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.330
 technicians use equipment 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.280
 sophisticated to assess how much 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.260
 the shock absorber dampens shocks to 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.850
 different speeds 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.860
 the configuration of the cylinder and the 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.450
 valve inside varies according to the 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.070
 vehicle 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.350
 and the dampers of a car 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.030
 sport with low ground clearance are 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.190
 very different from those of a sedan 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.730
 luxury or those of a robust 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.730
 van
