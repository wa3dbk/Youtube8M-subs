00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.099
 show what games are running on a pc 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 2010 model with a force lock 8400gs 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.959
 good start with the resident evil 4 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.990
 I can play this game with graphics 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.449
 to the maximum and in addition it is very good game already 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.910
 I have completed it and I liked it very much 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.550
 unlikely that they have not got this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.310
 game on your pc i have a friend with a pc 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.099
 model 98 and has less than a gig of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.500
 ram and he's doing fine if they have a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.950
 PC moderately with resources can 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 play with high graphics good let's continue 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.410
 with this other game the resident evil 5 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 is the continuation of 4 as you know 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.879
 I play it with graphics almost to the minimum 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.420
 but he throws it well and also played it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.219
 quite online now almost not what 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 game but it's very fun and also 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.469
 has more types of weapons than the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.379
 Resident Evil 4 also calculate that a 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.410
 pc model 2008 onwards and a plate 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.300
 as the 8400 gs geforce is going to 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.640
 walk the game well and good 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.580
 to have to have 2 gb of rne per 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.010
 at least to play it like I do now 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.350
 let's continue with a game that many said 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 that I was not going to walk with video boards 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.210
 like mine I want you to know that if I 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.180
 went and very well this game is the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.910
 resident evil 6 the continuation of 4 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 from 5 this game is very good in my 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.670
 opinion and has more gameplay 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.950
 simple for two players if they have one 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.410
 pc similar to mine or with the same 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 plate and a 2010 model only have 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.880
 than download all the possible graphics 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 to the minimum and even though they will believe 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.890
 that it does not look so good they look very good 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.390
 since it 's a game of the year 2012 so 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.970
 which is more modern and the graphics 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.550
 they are always improving by more minimum 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.040
 that are this game is long and 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.290
 complicated in some parts it was 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.630
 I recommend fans of games like 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.700
 call of duty on the medals of honor 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.980
 the fans of the whole saga of resident 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 evil I only recommend the campaign 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.790
 lion since this game has lost 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.929
 originality with terror and good and 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.480
 you know 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.400
 now that we already talked about the residents 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.560
 bill let's go with the next game 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.469
 this is the dragon ball z budokai 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.480
 tenkaichi 3 for pc emulated this 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.489
 game is simulated by an emulator of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.010
 willy but despite everything is fine and today 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.019
 in day I can enjoy it they just have 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.450
 to download the graphics to the minimum and 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.870
 set it up and well you will see that it walks 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.810
 very good if it works well on my pc in pc more 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 you are going to love them, I want you 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.290
 know that this game is not a hoax 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.269
 but it is real 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 soon I will upload a sample video 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.810
 playing this game now let's continue 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 the fish 2013 good do not have to give many 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.159
 descriptions about this wonderful 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.109
 this game I downloaded it from the page 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.450
 gameto rent and weighed only 3 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.400
 gigabytes of ram is a game that does not 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.680
 nothing needs to be changed since with the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.799
 graphics that brings posts goes well and the 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.019
 language is totally in Spanish as 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.160
 it's such a well-known game I do not talk much 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.290
 of the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.330
 now before talking about San 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.640
 andreas wanted to tell you that too 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.710
 it works four before I had it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.780
 installed but I took it out because when I 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.120
 had completed with and without the treatment of 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 I resigned I did not find so fun mods 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.860
 like those who did for him is san 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.510
 Andreas ended up boring me and I took it out 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.510
 but it may be quite average 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.730
 well if you download the graphics completely 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.220
 to the minimum 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.709
 now let's move on to san san andreas 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.349
 well you can play it with graphics at 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.420
 maximum and they will walk excellent is very 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.610
 fun and if you get bored once you 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.700
 they end up can put many ways 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.940
 how to fly dance new new houses 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.180
 cars make a cameo to put creatures 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.519
 Jason or Freddie and much more 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.519
 it's weird to find a pc where I do not know 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.560
 can play is san andreas good 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.200
 let's continue with this other killing game 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.780
 crazy zombies is called let for dead 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.790
 and it's very good is like playing 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.790
 counter in team against many 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.980
 zombies and in the dark xd i think that 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.349
 this game does not equal the resident evil 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.620
 but it's the closest thing to scary games 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.169
 with zombies to play it down a little 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.419
 the graphics and they will be good this 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.669
 I recommend them to all those who 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.389
 watch the video because here if you combine the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.939
 action with fear 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.159
 Now let 's talk about the game that follows 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:34.439
 Operation 7 is a game similar to 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.469
 counter but in my personal opinion a 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.419
 little better this game is played online and 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.449
 you can load money to buy 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.969
 objects do not need to put anything to 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.370
 this game just register and 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:50.999
 enjoy it also remember that always 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.129
 the mode is online the next game is 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.680
 called a rudder limited and it's about 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.960
 a guy who has to hunt animals 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.090
 I recommend them little I took them down 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.400
 thinking that it would be more fun but 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.800
 when they play it they do not even have 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.379
 weapons that have a pointer to shoot 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.430
 that is, they have to know how to aim for themselves 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.529
 alone 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.719
 Well, maybe they're fans of 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.669
 hunting and however complicated it may be 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.860
 they are going to play a lot and it is not necessary 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.979
 down to the graphics but to them 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.050
 I recommend that you upload it to the maximum 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.750
 last game is the angry birds river ' 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.089
 good this game goes in all the pcs 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.750
 If I'm not mistaken, they can play it for 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:32.150
 internet this and the normal version 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.610
 good this video is the first part 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.010
 then I will make another video with others 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.440
 games that he did not mention here I hope that 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.850
 you liked it, like to subscribe 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.850
