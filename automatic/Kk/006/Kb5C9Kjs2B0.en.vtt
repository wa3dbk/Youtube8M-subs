00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 solon welcome to the first 3 d 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.629
 video here we are in the main menu of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.710
 dragon ball raging blast 2 only game 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 What I do not have them here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.599
 so dry can play for the xbox 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.950
 right here you think your hairdresser was running 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.179
 in your forest are a router and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 vegetarians are the coolest 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.580
 definitely say I'm quite common 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 Of course you can ride cooler 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 anyway where then the piece of wgr 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 from riesa also a really cool scene 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.890
 was that we did not find the underworld 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.109
 I'm cool 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 So today is only a very short video 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.050
 I think we are only fighting 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.559
 I want you here today 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
 just ask what you want to see what 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.989
 for a game 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.520
 Let's play because I have him 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.079
 but there's no real way around 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.020
 story has no real sequences 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 and so what i want so too 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 correct sequences are shown for 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.920
 example now how many killed 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.570
 admission 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.910
 So let me say that was that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.410
 second I have intensive product 3 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 also played a really awesome game 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.699
 I heard that either that completely 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.070
 normal raging blast for the xbox halt 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.280
 should be good and that's just boka 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.619
 the lot should be two current sky 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 I also know her for the ps 1 ps 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.400
 if so, can always record the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.090
 comments write that works then could 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 that also make gps 10 space that 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.120
 you me the comments write something 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.370
 for one 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.530
 play display is supposed to be running the 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.450
 whole story through games 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.160
 that is also the move here is cool the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.600
 clean killed recording really cool 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.190
 So here at channel gehring is that 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 If you are a super professional now 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.150
 used to wait for today's out with 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.520
 the plane that then the planet is not 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.310
 is destroyed because otherwise changes 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.320
 the whole planet 2 3 was that whole 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.090
 I like the game 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.800
 he's almost dead I'll be a bit 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.020
 torture a bit here because many 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.390
 know what to tell 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.220
 In any case, I think many say 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.830
 I want to buy all dvds now too 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.300
 not via usb stick or as a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.660
 Shit I want to have it right 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.490
 I want to have the chance to do all stagia 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.620
 I even find a series that I could 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.830
 so on 13 should take care of her 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 I'm not too good at killing here either 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.280
 the game I 'm not a plate now 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.280
 versager a real benefit here 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.170
 it comes here to the user now rtl 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 is up there left change or 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 transformation because here this 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.550
 One hundred percent frieda that was yes 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.230
 also the right teeth at the end 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.120
 just lost against symbolic 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.360
 audience the last bit of energy the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 the all this turn that to me now 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.270
 Know energy still gives with it 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.190
 can survive if he uses these 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.540
 it was with you 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.580
 good for this death and me 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.610
 would say oh and very cool that I 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.780
 I'm the one who does it through everybody 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.150
 so 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.660
 a channel design so it should be so right 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.610
 color dark red his contract that's it 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.920
 So color is dark red and should 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.569
 somehow to the burghof riesa and how are you 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.040
 should make it easy to program 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.290
 can you not like I 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.090
 cut and so on and so forth 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.500
 well so I decided fallen if so 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.709
 then do not forget high and so on 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.709
 and so on
