00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.079
 Click here on the left of his icon 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.090

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.649
 one normal some kind of combat and pull out 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 Well, not everything is just fire, and I'm completely in 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.270
 the boxes went maybe it will be my dog 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.270
 let's not think long and I just 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.950
 immediately kill his gut along oki oki 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.170
 press it all quickly means here now in 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.079
 this fight we will fight see who 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.060
 will win and so on so here it will be in 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.430
 our first series will be a battle of one 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.200
 pokemon on another pokemon and then 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.000
 let's see why captcha why by the way 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.800
 I have a peasant she has a peasant two peasants 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.860
 peasants fighting dragons fight and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:27.410
 some dude i'm starting i am now 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.410
 let me raise for nothing let's come first 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:37.319
 grieve wink and so it is super efficient 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:48.090
 okay let's go there 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:57.300
 the volume of me immediately oh no you too i 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:59.760
 now seriously beauty hazard it almost 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.620
 would have lost so now means 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.390
 stop ours and i think repeat took 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.450
 because I'm not completely 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.370
 felt the whole system like it all 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.269
 here it works here how it works here 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.760
 boevka here she is the starting point is busy all 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.849
 Masturbation I do not understand until the end how 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.650
 it works then i no longer need if i 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.030
 just gonna charge the same 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.200
 attack then it will also be super 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.580
 effectively call your 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:32.250
 Let show the world that their fight then 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.790
 let's try to attack you than this 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.970
 so who remembers who does not remember the volume 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.970
 bodies 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.640
 look and now i'm getting a little damage 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.069
 which one will and tried to use 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:51.989
 missed mozilla still let 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.120
 I think by the way I'm not 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.390
 very Th there you somehow feeble volume 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:07.049
 that i 'm not very effective you me 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:09.299
 I'll probably understand my fire when 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.150
 die of your roast but here 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.250
 it is obvious that if my not yours 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.259
 fry the crowd lost some 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.100
 I got pokemonchik such max 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.870
 let's say honestly weak 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.600
 but the robot is the third time I'm interested in it 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.850
 will not happen again or my pokemon all 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.790
 will be able to make him play 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.980
 three rounds here on the right is a nasty window 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.510
 win three rounds see how 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.880
 guys write comments like it 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.480
 you or not this idea and write your 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.180
 I think that the proposal is worth at 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.250
 few people with you not worth nadal 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.370
 several still not beat the Pokemon 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:49.870
 one by one so let's first 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:53.110
 then fry the strongest well and you 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.420
 missed you just be him taram me 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.570
 beat don't understand other abilities not 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:03.130
 that's why why why how are you me 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.690
 just using the same motivator 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.790
 and and everything to him always ends well my he 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.630
 just do not sew and take up to your 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:16.360
 copper with me I right now it is unfair and I 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.580
 I think, but in any case, my x 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.130
 resort of course lost truth still 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.080
 I don't understand why maybe this mod is like 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.000
 then not to the end . but in this later 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.860
 we learn okay 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.280
 a series of short appeared apparently this 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.210
 rubric will go short 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.530
