00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.620

 I'm an example 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.380
 now you need to make beer 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.349
 thought about jerky now 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.920
 try to eat a piece 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.750
 beef 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:37.370

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:41.600
 beef salt about half a cup 60 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:47.180
 grams of brandy red pepper and probably 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.289
 a bundle of red pepper africa can still 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.000
 add as desired 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.499
 13 island need to add more 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.499
 cayenne so chili pizza any other 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.499

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.040
 design back into medium sized pieces 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.120
 take the salt and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.909
 pour it in the bowl 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.110

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.430
 pour 2 incomplete glass of grimak salt 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.800
 we take meat 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.810
 we roll it down here neatly and beautifully 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.810
 we cover them here from all sides 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.069
 I don't know, usually it's just called 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.830
 jerky but very much now 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.180
 fashionable name shot down tons so 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.200
 called do not know 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.600
 South African meat principle is cooked 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.080
 similarly only without alcohol and 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:07.440
 many many many salt therefore we will call 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.280
 it's just corned beef and salted meat 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.870
 anywhere here 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:19.910
 covered with salt from all sides 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.910
 smeared on top now we put a little plate 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.980
 we send everything to the fridge for a day 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.540
 after the day we will continue 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.850
 so we have been exactly one day since 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.660
 the moment we astral our meat 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.660
 refrigerator pickle 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.450
 now our task is to coat it on top 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.450
 paprika 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:19.140
 paprika mixed with red cayenne 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.209

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:28.910
 Diana by half a teaspoon of cayenne 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:28.910

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.209
 try to make fewer passes 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:01.849
 if you get smoked paprika 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.680
 smoked alone 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:09.550
 you can take it and it will smell smoked 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.550
 also quite nothing 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.860
 by the way can be replaced in principle by 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.580
 funny let's hop-suneli 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.520

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.070
 Minsk well to about that state 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.750
