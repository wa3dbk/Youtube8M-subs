00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.870
 sudden fall 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.570

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:52.370

 I do too little, my son arrives. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.459
 Only in the first episode, I'm not mistaken. 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.680
 I think it's nothing like that to see 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.299

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.579
 secretly hides her entrance 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.950

 I want to put something here but still 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.859
 I'll think well what it is. 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.590
 iac has a raise i made to 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.090

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.950
 I worked to increase waterfall beyond 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.720
 have a very long view and have access 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 to this life- giving part that is a 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 part that we did not even dream about me 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.400
 Ok, what else is going on now, you guys are going? 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.600

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.880
 Avina falls into this here and ends up stopping 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.859
 here galleys are seeing illegal human 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.450
 I really enjoyed having given a lot of time to 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.849
 do it here because I had to 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.160
 to fall and lose life all the time 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.720
 To see it right, it was going to fall. 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.519
 we got here and look the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.150
 interesting fact that in this part 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.560
 contains a super cave well hand in 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.230
 part of the then it will get kind of 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.260
 secret passage to the secret cave 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.699
 Okay, we have a super 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.959
 here and has a lot of ore if not 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.759
 I'm wrong, there's a part that has 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.760
 diamonds just forgot about it and then I go 

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:17.489
 give a nail home better 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.570
 but the bigger the diamond he goes 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.150
 Catch the diamond but I 'm afraid of 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.040
 that down there 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.780
 I love you look how beautiful but already 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.389
 we got diamonds that already 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.930
 mining is just to make your secret passage 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.340
 here and it's all beauty guys I hope 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.169
 that you have enjoyed this passage 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.100
 secret because it really gave a lot 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.320
 work to do 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.820
 That's what I'm still working on. 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.080
 to do here is to make her come back because 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.210
 her turn 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.970
 I had to do it totally manual be 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.160
 They were from here, that's the way I intend it. 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.320
 railing here, I'm fine, I'm fine. 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.330
 using the rail that I took in the 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.729
 mine to pass through this 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.060
 part here so it stayed like this you go 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.320

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.560

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.479
 totally secret also hand type 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.100
 It's really a joke, this is a joke. 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.690
 logical do not need to do anything secret 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.570
 jackson the game on the map né 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.130
 But it's okay, he made it here, by the way. 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.860
 that he left here in the middle of the 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.910
 water near here in our 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.530
 passage 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.990

 this update-only video I do not know 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.400
 Because you're both struggling but I'm fine. 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.860
 I did I 'm starting to increase motorfreight. 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.320
 The guys remember the episode, I guess. 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.750
 that three or four sectors only I started 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.690
 to increase is that the sectors make one more 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.470
 only sector that I want to do 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:54.570
 a height much higher than this to see 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.120
 if more furniture is born up there 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.169
 so what I did guys, I'll show you 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:05.039
 for you here 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:07.710
 we climbed what I did was show 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:10.500
 process is better than talking 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:13.110
 You are seeing here, I do this. 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.360
 tube and it takes you up there and there 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.830
 The one we 're going to build is I do not 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.510
 I put up a ladder that is still up 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.550
 because the build that there I just 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.500
 falling and did not come back there 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.229
 and I did not die but I was very close to the 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.580
 death believe it's and I'm going to continue 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.159
 after 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.009
 including stairs to give do care about 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:33.479
 It's good, the updates are 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.490
 I hope you like these 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.169
 in the next episode we build 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:40.080
 something in video but in this episode 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.599
 Like I said it's make you update yourselves. 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.159
 because I did a lot of things offline 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.240
 do not forget to evaluate and 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:49.889
 mainly staff to leave their 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.199
 opinion of what I leave in that room 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.949
 Secret, that 's cool, I want it. 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.750
 do something really cool there yet 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:00.509
 It is also true that our 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.520
 water to our farm guy who is going a lot 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.500
 well I'm really getting a lot of food 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.110
 I'll show you both here and I all 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:11.159
 time updating it already has it all take 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:12.569
 here is roasted and have the 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:14.759
 normal potatoes that I do not think have 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.860
 Nothing here because I planted everything but 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.659
 Now I'm going to pick them up to show you 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.000
 How much are you giving here? 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:23.310
 potatoes although not everything was born then 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.020
 is next good video really good 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.849
 I hope you liked it as I did. 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.560
 I already told you, do not forget to comment 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.599
 very important sorry for the video 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.789
 being short is because we are 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.979
 trying to take care of the two channels and the 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:36.690
 trot is so I think not but it gives 

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:39.090
 a break will record practice because 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:41.039
 a lot of people do not express the reaction 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.080
 usually when the person does not express 

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:45.870
 the relationship gets a little annoyed 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.810
 so it goes there if you write nuno trotando tv 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.159
 which is bt bar the channel is a channel 

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.669
 old and that I had but the people 

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:55.319
 he then turned to these guys 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.870
 Enroll there is very cool already have a 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:08:00.509
 I think there are almost 15 

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.409
 a thousand people are doing great to do 

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:03.690
 these trots 

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:07.430
 then this is it will stop rolling here one 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.430
 Big hug to you and I went
