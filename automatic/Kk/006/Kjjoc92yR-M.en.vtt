the gym well that it's easy to start
training<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:20.880> everybody<00:00:21.359> else<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:22.109> see

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
training like everybody else you see

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.599 
training like everybody else you see
people<00:00:22.529> doing<00:00:22.560> things<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.310> easy<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
people doing things and it's easy to

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.189 
people doing things and it's easy to
kind<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.970> follow<00:00:24.150> them<00:00:24.449> follow<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.990> crowd

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
kind of follow them follow the crowd

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
kind of follow them follow the crowd
with<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.519> don't<00:00:26.640> always

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
with this but you know they don't always

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.279 
with this but you know they don't always
know<00:00:27.029> exactly<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.630> they're<00:00:27.720> doing<00:00:27.960> yeah

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
know exactly what they're doing yeah

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
know exactly what they're doing yeah
it's<00:00:28.560> easy<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.890> assume<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.189> dumbbell

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's easy to assume that dumbbell

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.400 
it's easy to assume that dumbbell
lateral<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.539> good<00:00:30.689> example<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:31.289> an

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
lateral is a really good example of an

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.139 
lateral is a really good example of an
exercise<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.130> look<00:00:32.279> around<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.000> see

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
exercise that you look around and see

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.370 
exercise that you look around and see
people<00:00:33.180> doing<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.750> thinking<00:00:34.050> they're<00:00:34.200> doing

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
people doing it thinking they're doing

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
people doing it thinking they're doing
it<00:00:34.469> right<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.520> might<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> missing<00:00:35.940> out

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it right but you might be missing out

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.580 
it right but you might be missing out
yeah<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.719> mean<00:00:36.899> when<00:00:37.079> you're<00:00:37.200> seeing<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
yeah I mean when you're seeing that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.750 
yeah I mean when you're seeing that
people<00:00:37.860> doing<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> laterals<00:00:38.670> are

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
people doing them the laterals are

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.490 
people doing them the laterals are
seeing<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.090> coming<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.110> parallel

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
seeing them coming up to about parallel

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.810 
seeing them coming up to about parallel
and<00:00:40.739> stopping<00:00:40.980> letting<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> weight<00:00:41.640> back

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and stopping letting the weight back

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.459 
and stopping letting the weight back
down<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.660> really<00:00:42.870> they're<00:00:43.020> missing<00:00:43.320> out<00:00:43.410> on

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
down but really they're missing out on

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.380 
down but really they're missing out on
full<00:00:44.010> fiber<00:00:44.250> stimulation<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.120> middle

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
full fiber stimulation of these middle

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.229 
full fiber stimulation of these middle
flavors<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.739> know<00:00:46.829> by<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.250> above<00:00:47.550> that

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
flavors you know by going above that

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
flavors you know by going above that
range<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> motion<00:00:48.660> yeah<00:00:49.440> by<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.890> about<00:00:50.039> 45

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
range of motion yeah by going about 45

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.670 
range of motion yeah by going about 45
degrees<00:00:50.700> past<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.449> parallel<00:00:51.899> point<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.530> can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
degrees past the parallel point you can

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.439 
degrees past the parallel point you can
really<00:00:52.920> tie<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.489> middle<00:00:53.789> deltoid<00:00:54.000> as

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
really tie in your middle deltoid as

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
really tie in your middle deltoid as
well<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.960> upper<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.289> lower<00:00:55.410> traps<00:00:55.890> your

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
well as your upper and lower traps your

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
well as your upper and lower traps your
scapula<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.600> rhomboids<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.350> total

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
scapula and your rhomboids for total

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.770 
scapula and your rhomboids for total
shoulder<00:00:59.010> development<00:00:59.730> exactly<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> day

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
shoulder development exactly so the day

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
shoulder development exactly so the day
we're<00:01:00.930> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> show<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> four<00:01:01.800> points

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
we're going to show you the four points

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
we're going to show you the four points
what<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.670> call<00:01:02.820> 135<00:01:03.629> degree<00:01:03.930> laterals<00:01:05.689> now<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
what we call 135 degree laterals now the

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
what we call 135 degree laterals now the
one<00:01:07.140> thing<00:01:07.260> remember<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.220> used<00:01:08.430> to

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
one thing remember is if you're used to

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.190 
one thing remember is if you're used to
normally<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> parallel<00:01:09.840> you're

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
normally just going to parallel you're

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
normally just going to parallel you're
going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> lower<00:01:11.100> weight<00:01:11.430> than

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to want to use a lower weight than

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.070 
going to want to use a lower weight than
what<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.880> used<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.360> normally<00:01:12.720> doing<00:01:12.990> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
what you're used to normally doing you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
what you're used to normally doing you
going<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.380> higher<00:01:13.619> reps<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going for higher reps here because you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
going for higher reps here because you
want<00:01:15.030> total<00:01:15.360> shoulder<00:01:15.630> doming<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.229> going

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
want total shoulder doming you're going

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.810 
want total shoulder doming you're going
to<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.530> hitting<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.009> little<00:01:17.220> bit<00:01:17.460> different

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
to be hitting it a little bit different

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.240 
to be hitting it a little bit different
than<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.659> drop<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> just

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
than here so drop down the way it's just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.830 
than here so drop down the way it's just
a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.460> bit<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> top<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
a little bit now at the top of the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390 
a little bit now at the top of the
movement<00:01:21.960> notice<00:01:22.380> he's<00:01:22.530> not<00:01:22.680> he's<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.070> past

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
movement notice he's not he's going past

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480 
movement notice he's not he's going past
parallel<00:01:23.909> again<00:01:24.360> about<00:01:24.570> 45<00:01:25.049> degrees<00:01:25.340> now<00:01:26.340> if
