00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.240
 Zellos a lot of supposedly professional 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 in games especially in online shooters 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 one of these ribbons of taste is perfect 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 randomly and his channel is quite large 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 completely dedicated to the shooter in particular 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.609
 consider almost god tops, although 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 he plays on average 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 in one of the videos he spotted a couple of times 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 bill and I know that this is not an indicator 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.320
 skill but nevertheless the ratio was 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 about 1 to one that's not such to 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 experts on the Internet more and more 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.079

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.449
 so steep that it says its supposed 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.739
 mistaken for cheat-enabled players 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 especially konsolschiki proud of their 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.329
 kashnikov more I can not that is 10 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.979
 strongly pro players 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.840
 for example, Russian 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.729
 butcher even though he falls short 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 the level of professional teams I'm up to 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.570
 of recent times and considered myself cool and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.729
 skill player and with my skills and not 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.900
 but I will analyze the people who 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.619

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.270
 pro players 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.460
 battlefield 4 shooters and code 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.500
 advance rp the game itself I have several times 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.030
 lighted up here and accordingly my nickname 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.280
 By the way, you can add in steam and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.140
 origin can then breathe play 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 I'm not playing very well, but the goal is for 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.020
 exactly learned 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 and miss some tactical moments 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 like you any other player skill to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.430
 I came with experience the more you play 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.500
 the better the skill 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.210
 I play all the players on the server 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 ray someone is worse if my gameplay 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 imposed on the background of your video some 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.090
 right quotes player then his subscribers 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 would put almost not notice sooner 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.659
 of all it would have been that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 It turns out almost every player who 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.800
 now playing with me with a good score 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.570
 you can hide the channel on u tube and 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.000
 impersonate steep champions of all and 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.320
 malaga championships strange situation i 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.240
 I am sure that among my subscribers 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.979
 there are a few dozen people 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.110
 which will say 100 are played at the level of 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.730
 me or not worse and they will confirm that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.710
 they consider themselves beyond the roller 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.120
 drag the frame guys if all accomplish your goal 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.920
 comment back to topic 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.020
 honestly say pisses me off people like that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.270
 I know how you they have become a fish 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.350
 I am amazed even more by their viewers if 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.910
 they consider mediocre players 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.680
 I'm scared by professionals 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.480
 imagine at what level they themselves 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.250
 play as you can see me too 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.260
 take for super mega feet from the lake 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.240
 all so if you play well and not 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220
 put it all down on every corner and on 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.170
 your channel you are well done provide you 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.640
 good luck in further raising the skill but 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.800
 if you consider yourself the coolest 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.670
