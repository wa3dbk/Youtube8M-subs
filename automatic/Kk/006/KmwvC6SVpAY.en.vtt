so<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.299> bit<00:01:54.479> behind<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> curve

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
so it's a little bit behind the curve

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.690 
so it's a little bit behind the curve
already<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.560> regard<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.549> just

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
already in that regard but just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.249 
already in that regard but just
navigating<00:01:57.060> between<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> three<00:01:57.689> home<00:01:57.960> screen

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so it looks pretty smooth but we did

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.850 
so it looks pretty smooth but we did

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
a little better job on the Opera Mini

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.890 
a little better job on the Opera Mini
and<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.700> course<00:02:41.939> it<00:02:42.060> renders<00:02:42.359> it<00:02:42.510> pretty<00:02:42.720> good

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and of course it renders it pretty good

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.440 
and of course it renders it pretty good
so<00:02:43.200> it's<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.470> decent<00:02:43.650> experience<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.329> of

smooth not the best out there but it

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.319 
smooth not the best out there but it

really smooth but when we loaded up one

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.649 
really smooth but when we loaded up one
in<00:03:13.500> 800<00:03:14.010> by<00:03:14.099> 480<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.879> had<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.090> tendency<00:03:15.389> to<00:03:15.540> be

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
in 800 by 480 it had a tendency to be

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.780 
in 800 by 480 it had a tendency to be
stuttering<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.379> also<00:03:16.859> slow<00:03:17.069> down<00:03:17.099> we're

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
stuttering and also slow down we're

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.059 
stuttering and also slow down we're
really<00:03:18.030> impressed<00:03:18.419> with<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> once<00:03:19.379> image

and pretty good colors but taking

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.539 
and pretty good colors but taking
indoors<00:03:33.449> with<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.810> flash<00:03:34.109> we<00:03:35.040> did<00:03:35.190> tend<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
indoors with the flash we did tend to

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.710 
indoors with the flash we did tend to
notice<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:35.970> images<00:03:36.239> still<00:03:36.389> looked<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.660> little

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
notice the images still looked a little

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.420 
notice the images still looked a little
bit<00:03:36.900> hazy<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.709> color<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.069> a<00:03:38.129> little<00:03:38.280> bit

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
bit hazy and a color so a little bit

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.099 
bit hazy and a color so a little bit
washed<00:03:38.639> out<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.629> might<00:03:39.780> want<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.989> look

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
washed out you might want to look

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.420 
washed out you might want to look
elsewhere<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.560> you're<00:03:40.709> into<00:03:40.889> taking<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.220> lot<00:03:41.400> of

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
elsewhere if you're into taking a lot of

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.220 
elsewhere if you're into taking a lot of
videos<00:03:41.849> that's<00:03:42.209> just<00:03:42.449> because<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.870> Iowan

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
videos that's just because the Iowan

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.640 
videos that's just because the Iowan
only<00:03:43.530> shoots<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.280> 352<00:03:45.090> by<00:03:45.389> 288<00:03:45.870> resolution

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
only shoots it in 352 by 288 resolution

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.640 
only shoots it in 352 by 288 resolution
so<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.370> really<00:03:47.879> pixelated<00:03:48.269> not<00:03:49.019> detail<00:03:49.500> at

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
so it's really pixelated not detail at

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.189 
so it's really pixelated not detail at
all<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.010> also<00:03:50.579> shoots<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.209> 15<00:03:51.690> frames<00:03:51.900> per

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
all and also shoots it at 15 frames per

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.839 
all and also shoots it at 15 frames per
second<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.769> do<00:03:52.889> notice<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.340> lot<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.609> jerking

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
second so you do notice a lot of jerking

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.390 
second so you do notice a lot of jerking
movements<00:03:54.449> :<00:03:55.290> quality<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> eye<00:03:55.859> one<00:03:56.190> was

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
movements : quality in the eye one was

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.250 
movements : quality in the eye one was
more<00:03:56.579> than<00:03:56.730> satisfactory<00:03:57.269> thanks<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:58.079> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
more than satisfactory thanks to the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.229 
more than satisfactory thanks to the
strong<00:03:58.620> tones<00:03:58.889> emitted<00:03:59.250> by<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.400> earpiece<00:03:59.940> it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
strong tones emitted by the earpiece it

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.000 
strong tones emitted by the earpiece it
made<00:04:00.389> our<00:04:00.540> callers<00:04:00.900> voices<00:04:01.260> sound<00:04:01.440> very<00:04:01.709> clear

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
made our callers voices sound very clear

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.830 
made our callers voices sound very clear
and<00:04:02.129> distinct<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:02.730> our<00:04:03.150> end<00:04:03.359> though<00:04:03.510> there<00:04:03.720> was

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
and distinct on our end though there was

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.539 
and distinct on our end though there was
some<00:04:03.989> static<00:04:04.379> noise<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.799> be<00:04:04.889> heard<00:04:05.069> especially

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
some static noise to be heard especially

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.280 
some static noise to be heard especially
when<00:04:05.639> we<00:04:05.730> had<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.000> on<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.299> high<00:04:06.419> setting<00:04:06.780> but

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
when we had it on the high setting but

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.809 
when we had it on the high setting but
when<00:04:07.409> we<00:04:07.530> put<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.889> down<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.040> couple<00:04:08.280> notches<00:04:08.519> it

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
when we put it down a couple notches it

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.699 
when we put it down a couple notches it
just<00:04:08.970> disappeared<00:04:09.479> we're<00:04:09.959> really<00:04:10.349> impressed

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
just disappeared we're really impressed

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.530 
just disappeared we're really impressed
though<00:04:10.979> with<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.370> speakerphone<00:04:11.760> quality<00:04:12.329> it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
though with the speakerphone quality it

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.119 
though with the speakerphone quality it
produced<00:04:12.840> some<00:04:12.959> strong<00:04:13.290> tones<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.859> made<00:04:14.010> it

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
produced some strong tones that made it

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.680 
produced some strong tones that made it
very<00:04:14.280> easy<00:04:14.519> for<00:04:14.699> us<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.879> hear<00:04:15.000> our<00:04:15.090> callers<00:04:15.479> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
very easy for us to hear our callers and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.899 
very easy for us to hear our callers and
they're<00:04:16.169> really<00:04:16.409> natural<00:04:16.919> too<00:04:17.159> when<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:17.849> came
