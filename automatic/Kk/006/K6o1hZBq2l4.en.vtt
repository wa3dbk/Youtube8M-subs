and<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.300> few<00:03:37.480> other<00:03:37.630> bits<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.990> pieces<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.100> I

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
and a few other bits and pieces so I

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.560 
and a few other bits and pieces so I
think<00:03:39.340> he's<00:03:39.460> kind<00:03:39.610> of<00:03:39.730> he<00:03:39.910> would<00:03:40.210> come<00:03:40.360> onto

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
think he's kind of he would come onto

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.530 
think he's kind of he would come onto
the<00:03:40.600> scene<00:03:40.690> fairly<00:03:41.260> late<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:42.120> showed<00:03:43.120> promise

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
the scene fairly late and showed promise

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.120 
the scene fairly late and showed promise
behind<00:03:43.840> colour<00:03:44.020> squadron<00:03:44.260> on<00:03:44.620> his<00:03:44.710> debut<00:03:44.920> I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
behind colour squadron on his debut I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.440 
behind colour squadron on his debut I
thought<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.400> was<00:03:45.550> a<00:03:45.580> really<00:03:45.610> good<00:03:45.970> run<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:46.210> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
thought that was a really good run for a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.000 
thought that was a really good run for a
first<00:03:46.690> run<00:03:46.870> over<00:03:47.110> hurdles<00:03:47.290> especially<00:03:47.860> as<00:03:47.920> a

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
first run over hurdles especially as a

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.800 
first run over hurdles especially as a
soft<00:03:48.250> ground<00:03:48.490> really<00:03:49.210> suited<00:03:49.630> colour

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
soft ground really suited colour

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.090 
soft ground really suited colour
squadron<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.380> day<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.650> he's<00:03:50.740> not<00:03:50.920> a<00:03:50.950> bad

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
squadron that day and he's not a bad

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.380 
squadron that day and he's not a bad
horse<00:03:51.340> anyway<00:03:51.670> should<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:51.970> one<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.210> tell

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
horse anyway should have one to tell

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.780 
horse anyway should have one to tell
worth<00:03:52.600> really<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:54.190> course<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.520> didn't<00:03:54.700> learn

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
worth really of course we didn't learn

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.970 
worth really of course we didn't learn
much<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.060> prompt<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:55.810> last<00:03:56.380> week<00:03:56.620> is<00:03:56.740> a<00:03:56.770> real

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
much a prompt and so last week is a real

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.100 
much a prompt and so last week is a real

beaten<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.520> just<00:04:12.880> get<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.270> feeling<00:04:13.410> it's<00:04:14.410> a

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
beaten and I just get the feeling it's a

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.020 
beaten and I just get the feeling it's a
moot<00:04:14.740> point<00:04:14.770> nurse<00:04:15.160> but<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.430> might<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.940> had

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
moot point nurse but you might just had

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.120 
moot point nurse but you might just had
colour<00:04:16.270> squadron<00:04:16.510> beaten<00:04:17.140> when<00:04:17.530> he<00:04:17.650> fell<00:04:18.040> at

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
colour squadron beaten when he fell at

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.070 
colour squadron beaten when he fell at
the<00:04:18.160> second<00:04:18.520> last<00:04:18.640> anyway<00:04:19.000> so<00:04:19.570> if<00:04:19.900> they'd

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
the second last anyway so if they'd

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.800 
the second last anyway so if they'd
stood<00:04:20.350> up<00:04:20.500> then<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.340> think<00:04:21.669> I'm<00:04:22.150> taking<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.630> mom

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
stood up then I think I'm taking the mom

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.700 
stood up then I think I'm taking the mom
pass<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.140> probably<00:04:23.440> would

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
pass on probably would

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.760 
pass on probably would
the<00:04:24.100> one<00:04:24.280> anyway<00:04:25.199> and<00:04:26.199> I<00:04:26.289> still<00:04:26.500> think<00:04:26.650> there's

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
the one anyway and I still think there's

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.809 
the one anyway and I still think there's
a<00:04:26.800> hell<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:27.039> lot<00:04:27.160> more<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.430> come<00:04:27.580> from<00:04:27.610> this

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
a hell of a lot more to come from this

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.400 
a hell of a lot more to come from this
also<00:04:28.000> i<00:04:28.150> still<00:04:28.330> think<00:04:28.449> it's<00:04:28.660> better<00:04:28.840> on<00:04:28.930> decent

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
also i still think it's better on decent

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.749 
also i still think it's better on decent
ground<00:04:29.620> he's<00:04:29.830> been<00:04:30.009> running<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.370> good<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.729> soft

single<00:05:53.050> figures<00:05:53.409> i<00:05:53.560> would<00:05:53.710> suggest<00:05:53.830> so<00:05:54.669> i

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
single figures i would suggest so i

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.730 
single figures i would suggest so i
think<00:05:55.360> it's<00:05:55.599> worth<00:05:55.810> taking<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.259> chance<00:05:56.320> it

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
think it's worth taking the chance it

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.640 
think it's worth taking the chance it
might<00:05:56.889> not<00:05:57.070> run<00:05:57.280> but<00:05:57.729> a<00:05:57.880> small<00:05:58.210> bear<00:05:58.449> 25<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.199> 1<00:05:59.409> I

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
might not run but a small bear 25 to 1 I

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.740 
might not run but a small bear 25 to 1 I
think<00:06:00.430> that<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.699> risk<00:06:00.940> of<00:06:01.060> it<00:06:01.210> not<00:06:01.330> running<00:06:01.630> is

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
think that the risk of it not running is

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.629 
think that the risk of it not running is
factored<00:06:02.110> in<00:06:02.199> the<00:06:02.320> price<00:06:02.530> of<00:06:02.740> 25<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.340> this

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
factored in the price of 25 and this

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.640 
factored in the price of 25 and this
also<00:06:03.880> holds<00:06:04.180> inches<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:04.840> Supreme<00:06:05.289> and<00:06:05.530> the
