little bad company to plan as the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.450 
little bad company to plan as the
engineer<00:00:18.390> class<00:00:18.630> today<00:00:19.020> thought<00:00:19.980> I'd<00:00:20.130> go<00:00:20.340> over

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
engineer class today thought I'd go over

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.390 
engineer class today thought I'd go over
some<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:21.449> engineering<00:00:22.020> tips<00:00:22.410> since<00:00:23.220> I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
some some engineering tips since I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.300 
some some engineering tips since I
haven't<00:00:23.609> yet<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> usually<00:00:25.740> play<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
haven't yet you know I usually play the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.759 
haven't yet you know I usually play the
assault<00:00:26.670> class<00:00:26.880> definitely<00:00:27.449> my<00:00:27.539> favorite<00:00:27.960> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
assault class definitely my favorite but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.070 
assault class definitely my favorite but
the<00:00:28.800> engineer<00:00:29.340> class<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.810> lot

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the engineer class can be can be a lot

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.770 
the engineer class can be can be a lot
of<00:00:31.140> fun<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:32.160> fact<00:00:32.399> I'd<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.030> prefer<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
of fun in fact I'd probably prefer this

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.260 
of fun in fact I'd probably prefer this
class<00:00:34.110> over<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.010> assault<00:00:35.430> class<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:36.149> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
class over the assault class because it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.619 
class over the assault class because it
has<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.750> silencer<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.520> find<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.329> run<00:00:39.600> out

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
has a silencer but I find that I run out

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.560 
has a silencer but I find that I run out
of<00:00:39.750> ammo<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.350> lot<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.100> if<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.390> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
of ammo a lot and if I'm not with like a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470 
of ammo a lot and if I'm not with like a
buddy<00:00:42.870> or<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> teammate<00:00:45.450> that's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
feeding his teammates ammo well then I'm

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.119 
feeding his teammates ammo well then I'm
kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.780> stuck<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.559> end<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.100> know

kind of stuck and then I end up you know

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.900 
kind of stuck and then I end up you know
grabbing<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:54.149> people's<00:00:54.510> weapons<00:00:54.899> anyway

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910

but you know this this class is is a lot
of<00:00:59.129> fun<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.579> know<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> silencer<00:01:00.239> allows<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
of fun you know the silencer allows you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.680 
of fun you know the silencer allows you
to<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> mix<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.149> stealth

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
to really get in the mix and stealth

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.980 
to really get in the mix and stealth
around<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:04.530> plus<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> rocket<00:01:05.430> launcher

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
around and then plus the rocket launcher

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
around and then plus the rocket launcher
that<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.310> definitely<00:01:09.000> an

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that you get as a side is definitely an

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.859 
that you get as a side is definitely an
amazing<00:01:10.380> weapon<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.119> will<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.299> right

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
amazing weapon as you will see right

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.160 
amazing weapon as you will see right
here<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.400> important<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here it is very important for you as the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
here it is very important for you as the
engineering<00:01:16.680> class<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.340> enemy<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
engineering class if the enemy has a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.469 
engineering class if the enemy has a
tank<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> any<00:01:18.900> way<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.580> least<00:01:20.850> at<00:01:21.330> least

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
tank in any way to at least at least

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
tank in any way to at least at least
take<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.890> two<00:01:22.950> rockets<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> put<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> into

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
take one or two rockets and put it into

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960 
take one or two rockets and put it into
it<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.310> usually<00:01:26.460> kill<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
it if you can you can usually kill it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.260 
it if you can you can usually kill it
with<00:01:27.150> probably<00:01:27.810> too<00:01:28.549> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.670> well-placed

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
with probably too you know well-placed

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740 
with probably too you know well-placed
rockets<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:32.520> know<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.509> an

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
rockets you know and that's that's an

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
rockets you know and that's that's an
easy<00:01:33.990> tank<00:01:34.350> takedown<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.130> quite<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> big

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
easy tank takedown it's quite a big

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
easy tank takedown it's quite a big
target<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.770> besides<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.250> can<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.549> use

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
target and besides that you can also use

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
target and besides that you can also use
that<00:01:38.939> rocket<00:01:39.150> launcher<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.619> shoot<00:01:40.890> people

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
that rocket launcher to to shoot people

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.550 
that rocket launcher to to shoot people
in<00:01:41.400> buildings<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.320> blow<00:01:43.320> them<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in buildings and blow them to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
in buildings and blow them to
smithereens<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.079> trying<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> do

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
smithereens like I was trying to do

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.620 
smithereens like I was trying to do
right<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.180> fun<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right here it is so fun this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.480 
right here it is so fun this
destructible<00:01:49.200> environment<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.799> am<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
destructible environment I am going to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.600 
destructible environment I am going to
be<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.820> disappointed<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.659> metal<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.079> honor<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
be so disappointed if metal of honor is

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.130 
be so disappointed if metal of honor is
not<00:01:54.110> destructible<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.950> guess<00:01:56.340> we'll<00:01:56.520> see

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
not destructible but I guess we'll see

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.609 
not destructible but I guess we'll see
so<00:01:58.140> yeah<00:01:59.130> today<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.390> 27th<00:02:01.140> by<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> way<00:02:01.560> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
fuckin starcraft comes out in about five

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.650 
fuckin starcraft comes out in about five
or<00:02:06.630> six<00:02:06.899> hours<00:02:07.340> which<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.700> pretty<00:02:09.479> exciting

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
or six hours which is pretty exciting

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.130 
or six hours which is pretty exciting

in that machinima is given the top

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.260 
in that machinima is given the top
precedence<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.530> starcraft<00:02:16.310> videos<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.000> I'm

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
precedence to starcraft videos so I'm

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.290 
precedence to starcraft videos so I'm
going<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.310> get<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> first<00:02:19.640> impressions<00:02:20.180> video

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
going to get a first impressions video

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.230 
going to get a first impressions video
up<00:02:20.690> right<00:02:21.260> away<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.459> hopefully<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.030> first

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
up right away and hopefully be the first

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.040 
up right away and hopefully be the first
one<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.740> look<00:02:25.459> for<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:26.050> hopefully

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
one to do so so look for that hopefully

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.760 
one to do so so look for that hopefully
tomorrow<00:02:28.450> maybe<00:02:29.450> wednesday<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.350> most<00:02:30.620> likely

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
tomorrow maybe wednesday but most likely

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.460 
tomorrow maybe wednesday but most likely
tomorrow<00:02:31.360> because<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.480> will<00:02:32.660> probably<00:02:32.840> geek

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
tomorrow because I will probably geek

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.390 
tomorrow because I will probably geek
out<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.680> it<00:02:34.010> for<00:02:34.280> for<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> few<00:02:35.480> hours<00:02:35.510> tonight

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
out on it for for a few hours tonight

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.000 
out on it for for a few hours tonight
but<00:02:37.400> anyway<00:02:38.209> that<00:02:38.420> that's<00:02:39.290> another<00:02:39.530> story<00:02:39.650> I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
but anyway that that's another story I

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.010 
but anyway that that's another story I
just<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.489> wanted<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.760> get<00:02:40.880> the<00:02:41.209> another

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
just kind of wanted to get the another

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.190 
just kind of wanted to get the another
bad<00:02:42.800> company<00:02:43.310> video<00:02:43.880> up<00:02:44.300> before<00:02:44.900> I<00:02:44.930> did

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
bad company video up before I did

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.820 
bad company video up before I did
another<00:02:45.860> gamer<00:02:46.190> 101<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.970> am<00:02:47.540> probably<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.709> to

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
another gamer 101 I am probably going to

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.880 
another gamer 101 I am probably going to
do<00:02:48.950> my<00:02:49.100> next<00:02:49.400> game<00:02:49.580> or<00:02:49.760> 101<00:02:50.239> on<00:02:51.110> modern<00:02:51.650> warfare

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
do my next game or 101 on modern warfare

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.310 
do my next game or 101 on modern warfare
even<00:02:52.640> though<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.390> tactics<00:02:53.870> I'm<00:02:53.989> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> go

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
even though the tactics I'm going to go

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.060 
even though the tactics I'm going to go
over<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.790> can<00:02:55.940> use<00:02:56.150> for<00:02:56.330> both<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.860> doesn't

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
over you can use for both so it doesn't

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.160 
over you can use for both so it doesn't
really<00:02:58.160> matter<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.670> seem<00:02:59.239> like<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> lot<00:03:00.140> of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
really matter but seem like a lot of

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.630 
really matter but seem like a lot of
people<00:03:00.500> wanted<00:03:00.769> me<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:01.040> kind<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.250> go<00:03:01.400> back<00:03:01.610> and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
people wanted me to kind of go back and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.060 
people wanted me to kind of go back and
forth<00:03:01.850> between<00:03:02.239> bad<00:03:03.200> company<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.800> modern

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
forth between bad company and modern

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.130 
forth between bad company and modern
warfare<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.640> i<00:03:04.670> thought<00:03:04.910> i<00:03:04.970> would<00:03:05.120> i<00:03:05.690> would<00:03:05.810> do

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
warfare so i thought i would i would do

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.250 
warfare so i thought i would i would do
so<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.970> know<00:03:08.090> I'd<00:03:08.269> obviously<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.870> next<00:03:09.080> call

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
so you know I'd obviously the next call

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.320 
so you know I'd obviously the next call
of<00:03:09.290> duty<00:03:09.380> will<00:03:09.709> be<00:03:09.739> coming<00:03:10.010> out<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.400> not<00:03:10.580> not

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
of duty will be coming out and not not

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.130 
of duty will be coming out and not not
too<00:03:11.600> long<00:03:11.870> so<00:03:12.290> i'll<00:03:12.590> probably<00:03:12.830> just<00:03:12.980> focus<00:03:13.459> on

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
too long so i'll probably just focus on

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.720 
too long so i'll probably just focus on
you<00:03:15.140> know<00:03:15.170> bad<00:03:15.500> company<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.070> modern<00:03:16.549> warfare

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you know bad company and modern warfare

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.460 
you know bad company and modern warfare
two<00:03:17.090> for<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.360> little<00:03:17.510> bit<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.870> then<00:03:17.930> just<00:03:18.320> stick

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
two for a little bit and then just stick

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.410 
two for a little bit and then just stick
with<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:19.250> bad<00:03:19.459> company<00:03:19.670> until<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.239> next

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
with with bad company until the next

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.330 
with with bad company until the next

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
know perhaps some new tactics that I

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.420 
know perhaps some new tactics that I
need<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.400> go<00:03:25.880> over<00:03:26.560> but<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.010> saw<00:03:28.190> right

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
need to go over but if you saw right

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.330 
need to go over but if you saw right
there<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.970> rocket<00:03:29.329> launcher<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:30.010> quite<00:03:31.010> a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
there the rocket launcher is quite a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.569 
there the rocket launcher is quite a
handy<00:03:31.970> weapon<00:03:32.150> for<00:03:32.720> picking<00:03:33.680> people<00:03:33.920> out<00:03:34.280> of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
the building up usually you can at least

the building up usually you can at least
severely<00:03:45.980> damage<00:03:46.370> them<00:03:46.579> or<00:03:46.790> punch<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.900> hole<00:03:47.930> in

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
I've cut up this this footage a little

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.310 
I've cut up this this footage a little
bit<00:03:58.370> because<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.420> match<00:03:59.600> you<00:03:59.870> know<00:03:59.989> was<00:04:00.140> like

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
bit because the match you know was like

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.740 
bit because the match you know was like
I<00:04:00.560> don't<00:04:00.980> know<00:04:01.070> 15<00:04:01.549> or<00:04:01.579> 16<00:04:01.970> minutes<00:04:02.329> long<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:02.510> I

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
I don't know 15 or 16 minutes long so I

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.150 
I don't know 15 or 16 minutes long so I
just<00:04:02.930> cut<00:04:03.049> it<00:04:03.170> up<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.290> all<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.560> action<00:04:03.890> parts

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
just cut it up to all the action parts

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
lot more of the map which is a which is

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.779 
lot more of the map which is a which is
a<00:05:22.729> huge<00:05:23.029> plus<00:05:23.740> so<00:05:24.740> just<00:05:25.099> just<00:05:25.279> keep<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.639> in

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
a huge plus so just just keep that in

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.550 
a huge plus so just just keep that in

are<00:05:27.979> in<00:05:28.069> one<00:05:28.279> little<00:05:28.460> building<00:05:28.909> usually

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
are in one little building usually

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.820 
are in one little building usually
probably<00:05:29.690> in<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.990> third<00:05:30.229> floor<00:05:30.469> with<00:05:30.800> a

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
probably in the third floor with a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.439 
probably in the third floor with a
sniper<00:05:31.099> you<00:05:31.639> just<00:05:31.940> you<00:05:32.029> know<00:05:32.150> has<00:05:32.300> been

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
sniper you just you know has been

sniper you just you know has been
sitting<00:05:32.659> there<00:05:32.830> don't<00:05:33.830> spawn<00:05:34.069> to<00:05:34.279> them

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
sitting there don't spawn to them

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.830 
sitting there don't spawn to them
because<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:35.029> will<00:05:35.150> probably<00:05:35.389> just<00:05:35.719> get

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
because you will probably just get

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.379 
because you will probably just get
killed<00:05:36.139> in<00:05:36.830> a<00:05:36.949> big<00:05:37.159> you<00:05:37.550> know<00:05:37.669> air<00:05:37.879> strike<00:05:38.210> or

something like that here's another
rocket<00:05:40.819> kill<00:05:41.060> in<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.569> building<00:05:41.900> see<00:05:42.199> like

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
rocket kill in the building see like

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.140 
rocket kill in the building see like
good<00:05:42.979> examples<00:05:43.339> like<00:05:43.460> that<00:05:43.669> like<00:05:43.849> you<00:05:43.940> take<00:05:44.120> a

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
good examples like that like you take a

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.730 
good examples like that like you take a
couple<00:05:44.300> talk<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.659> somebody<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.349> know<00:05:45.529> they

took<00:05:45.919> cover<00:05:46.129> in<00:05:46.310> that<00:05:46.460> building<00:05:46.849> well<00:05:47.029> you

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
took cover in that building well you

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.189 
took cover in that building well you
might<00:05:47.270> as<00:05:47.360> well<00:05:47.479> just<00:05:47.599> immediately<00:05:48.020> take<00:05:48.169> a

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
might as well just immediately take a

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.140 
might as well just immediately take a
rock<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.620> out<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.770> see<00:05:49.129> if<00:05:49.250> maybe<00:05:49.279> you<00:05:49.580> can<00:05:49.759> you

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
rock it out and see if maybe you can you

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.390 
rock it out and see if maybe you can you
know<00:05:50.270> pick<00:05:50.509> them<00:05:50.629> out<00:05:50.750> of<00:05:50.900> it<00:05:51.020> it's<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:52.099> it's

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
know pick them out of it it's a it's

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.769 
know pick them out of it it's a it's
little<00:05:52.669> things<00:05:52.699> like<00:05:52.969> that<00:05:53.240> but<00:05:53.479> you<00:05:53.599> should

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
little things like that but you should

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.119 
little things like that but you should
definitely<00:05:53.930> keep<00:05:54.229> in<00:05:54.409> mind<00:05:54.650> because<00:05:54.860> you'll

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
definitely keep in mind because you'll

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.159 
definitely keep in mind because you'll
get<00:05:55.279> you<00:05:56.000> know<00:05:56.029> you'll<00:05:56.300> get<00:05:56.389> extra<00:05:56.569> kills<00:05:56.960> I

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
get you know you'll get extra kills I

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.959 
get you know you'll get extra kills I
mean<00:05:57.289> I<00:05:57.319> probably<00:05:57.529> got<00:05:57.740> four<00:05:58.339> extra<00:05:58.729> kills

00:05:58.959 --> 00:05:58.969 
mean I probably got four extra kills

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.839 
mean I probably got four extra kills
from<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.930> know<00:06:00.020> Rockets<00:06:00.529> this<00:06:00.710> match<00:06:00.949> just

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
from you know Rockets this match just

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.300 
from you know Rockets this match just
doing<00:06:02.479> that<00:06:02.629> that<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:03.229> know<00:06:03.349> I<00:06:03.379> otherwise<00:06:03.919> had

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
doing that that you know I otherwise had

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.879 
doing that that you know I otherwise had
no<00:06:04.669> chance<00:06:04.909> of<00:06:05.089> getting<00:06:05.150> those<00:06:05.449> people<00:06:05.830> so<00:06:06.830> you

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:06.889 
no chance of getting those people so you

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.260 
no chance of getting those people so you
know<00:06:07.009> it's<00:06:07.250> worth<00:06:07.430> it's<00:06:07.759> worth<00:06:07.879> taking<00:06:08.089> the

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
know it's worth it's worth taking the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.450 
know it's worth it's worth taking the
extra<00:06:08.509> second<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:08.990> pull<00:06:09.740> that<00:06:09.889> good<00:06:10.310> old

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
extra second to pull that good old

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.540 
extra second to pull that good old
rocket<00:06:11.180> launch<00:06:11.360> out<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.860> another<00:06:13.250> thing<00:06:13.339> to

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
rocket launch out so another thing to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.159 
rocket launch out so another thing to
keep<00:06:13.669> in<00:06:13.789> mind<00:06:13.849> and<00:06:14.629> I<00:06:14.719> was<00:06:14.779> kind<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:15.020> saying

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
keep in mind and I was kind of saying

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.170 
keep in mind and I was kind of saying
before<00:06:15.379> with<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.919> engineer<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.639> you<00:06:16.909> really

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
before with the engineer is you really

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.969 
before with the engineer is you really
have<00:06:17.360> to<00:06:17.509> be<00:06:17.629> aware<00:06:17.870> of<00:06:17.930> your<00:06:18.080> ammo<00:06:18.740> and

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
have to be aware of your ammo and

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.619 
have to be aware of your ammo and
luckily<00:06:19.310> right<00:06:19.639> here<00:06:19.819> I<00:06:19.849> pick<00:06:20.150> up<00:06:20.300> a<00:06:20.389> clip

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
luckily right here I pick up a clip

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.170 
luckily right here I pick up a clip
somewhere<00:06:21.050> on<00:06:21.229> the<00:06:21.319> ground<00:06:21.560> but<00:06:22.339> you<00:06:23.060> know

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
somewhere on the ground but you know

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.390 
somewhere on the ground but you know
when<00:06:23.300> you're<00:06:23.419> on<00:06:23.629> your<00:06:23.659> last<00:06:23.960> clip<00:06:24.650> you<00:06:25.370> need

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 
when you're on your last clip you need

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.719 
when you're on your last clip you need
to<00:06:26.000> be<00:06:26.569> thinking<00:06:26.599> okay<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.680> next<00:06:27.860> guy<00:06:28.129> I<00:06:28.159> kill

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
to be thinking okay the next guy I kill

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.450 
to be thinking okay the next guy I kill
I<00:06:28.969> have<00:06:29.270> to<00:06:29.449> take<00:06:29.599> his<00:06:29.810> weapon<00:06:30.099> you<00:06:31.099> know<00:06:31.219> if

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
I have to take his weapon you know if

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.059 
I have to take his weapon you know if
you<00:06:31.639> don't<00:06:32.000> have<00:06:32.240> an<00:06:32.539> assault<00:06:33.349> teammate

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
you don't have an assault teammate

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.399 
you don't have an assault teammate
around<00:06:34.430> you<00:06:34.729> to<00:06:34.969> you<00:06:35.539> know<00:06:35.569> be<00:06:35.899> feeding<00:06:36.289> you<00:06:36.380> a

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:36.409 
around you to you know be feeding you a

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.910 
around you to you know be feeding you a
mo

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
mo

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.400 
mo
you<00:06:37.730> really<00:06:38.000> need<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.180> to<00:06:38.870> be<00:06:38.990> aware<00:06:39.200> of<00:06:39.260> that

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
you really need to to be aware of that

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.490 
you really need to to be aware of that
so<00:06:39.950> just<00:06:40.700> you<00:06:41.660> know<00:06:41.750> if<00:06:41.840> you're<00:06:41.960> not<00:06:42.050> with<00:06:42.350> your

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:42.500 
so just you know if you're not with your

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.160 
so just you know if you're not with your
buddies<00:06:42.800> just<00:06:43.130> plan<00:06:43.430> that<00:06:43.940> you<00:06:44.720> know<00:06:44.930> the

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
buddies just plan that you know the

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.320 
buddies just plan that you know the
assault<00:06:45.500> guys<00:06:45.680> are<00:06:45.890> probably<00:06:46.090> going<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.180> be

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:47.330 
assault guys are probably going to be

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.930 
assault guys are probably going to be
spacing<00:06:47.960> out<00:06:48.080> throwing<00:06:48.590> ammo<00:06:49.250> out<00:06:49.400> a<00:06:49.430> lot<00:06:49.670> so

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
spacing out throwing ammo out a lot so

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.570 
spacing out throwing ammo out a lot so
you<00:06:50.540> just<00:06:50.900> kind<00:06:51.020> of<00:06:51.110> have<00:06:51.170> to<00:06:51.290> feel<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.620> out<00:06:51.740> but

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
you just kind of have to feel it out but

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.270 
you just kind of have to feel it out but
you<00:06:53.060> know<00:06:53.450> the<00:06:53.840> engineer<00:06:54.680> class<00:06:54.890> you<00:06:55.130> can

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 
you know the engineer class you can

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.220 
you know the engineer class you can
really<00:06:55.640> kind<00:06:55.910> of<00:06:56.060> get<00:06:56.270> up<00:06:56.450> in<00:06:56.600> the<00:06:56.690> mix<00:06:56.900> it's

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:57.230 
really kind of get up in the mix it's

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.850 
really kind of get up in the mix it's
it's<00:06:57.560> really<00:06:57.800> good<00:06:58.100> to<00:06:58.130> stay<00:06:58.460> in<00:06:58.940> buildings

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
it's really good to stay in buildings

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.160 
it's really good to stay in buildings
you<00:07:00.860> know<00:07:00.890> your<00:07:01.460> range<00:07:01.850> isn't<00:07:02.210> as<00:07:02.510> far<00:07:02.900> as<00:07:03.050> the

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
you know your range isn't as far as the

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.410 
you know your range isn't as far as the
assault<00:07:03.470> class<00:07:03.910> you<00:07:04.910> know<00:07:05.000> in<00:07:05.090> terms<00:07:05.240> of

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420 
assault class you know in terms of

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.020 
assault class you know in terms of
damage<00:07:05.980> the<00:07:06.980> assault<00:07:07.310> class<00:07:07.430> seems<00:07:07.730> to<00:07:07.880> take

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
damage the assault class seems to take

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.690 
damage the assault class seems to take
maybe<00:07:08.540> a<00:07:08.630> bullet<00:07:08.900> or<00:07:09.140> two<00:07:09.260> less<00:07:09.500> at<00:07:09.800> really

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
maybe a bullet or two less at really

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.580 
maybe a bullet or two less at really
long<00:07:10.880> range<00:07:11.210> but<00:07:11.930> you<00:07:12.140> can<00:07:12.440> pick<00:07:12.830> people<00:07:13.250> off

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:14.590 
long range but you can pick people off

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.670 
long range but you can pick people off
from<00:07:15.590> at<00:07:16.220> least<00:07:16.580> probably<00:07:17.120> as<00:07:17.240> as<00:07:17.420> far<00:07:18.050> as<00:07:18.290> most

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
from at least probably as as far as most

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.420 
from at least probably as as far as most
of<00:07:18.830> the<00:07:18.890> assault<00:07:19.250> weapons<00:07:19.570> that<00:07:20.570> I<00:07:20.630> found<00:07:21.050> I

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:21.430 
of the assault weapons that I found I

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.370 
of the assault weapons that I found I
you<00:07:22.430> know<00:07:22.520> I<00:07:22.550> usually<00:07:23.000> use<00:07:23.360> the<00:07:23.690> longer

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
you know I usually use the longer

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.920 
you know I usually use the longer
accuracy<00:07:24.980> the<00:07:25.100> longer-range<00:07:25.930> engineering

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
accuracy the longer-range engineering

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.080 
accuracy the longer-range engineering
weapons<00:07:27.230> just<00:07:28.220> just<00:07:28.550> because<00:07:28.820> of<00:07:28.940> that<00:07:28.970> reason

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090 
weapons just just because of that reason

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.960 
weapons just just because of that reason
