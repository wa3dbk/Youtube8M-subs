00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hey guys and welcome to this very first

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:06.799 
video in the very first tutorial series

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.970 
video in the very first tutorial series
that<00:00:07.799> actually<00:00:08.069> produces<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.730> result<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.980> called

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
that actually produces a result I called

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.959 
that actually produces a result I called
this<00:00:11.269> series<00:00:12.269> appetizer<00:00:13.009> for<00:00:14.009> two<00:00:14.400> reasons

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
this series appetizer for two reasons

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.080 
this series appetizer for two reasons
first<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.690> all<00:00:16.430> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:17.880> going<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
first of all this is what we're going to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.960 
first of all this is what we're going to
create<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.350> all<00:00:19.800> it's<00:00:20.130> kind<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> fits<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.880> an

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
create so all it's kind of fits to an

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.840 
create so all it's kind of fits to an
appetizer<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.689> wine<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
appetizer and wine and so on and the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
appetizer and wine and so on and the
other<00:00:23.970> reason<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.900> as<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
other reason is that this is like as I

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.929 
other reason is that this is like as I
said<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> first<00:00:26.189> series<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.730> actually

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
said the first series it actually

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.019 
said the first series it actually
produces<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.599> result<00:00:28.019> okay<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.340> yeah

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
produces a result okay and yeah

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.749 
produces a result okay and yeah
hopefully<00:00:30.650> after<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.949> tutorial<00:00:32.430> series

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hopefully after this tutorial series

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.060 
hopefully after this tutorial series
you'll<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.210> more<00:00:33.390> appetite<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.559> more

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
you'll have more appetite for more

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.790 
you'll have more appetite for more
blender<00:00:35.460> stuff<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.960> yeah<00:00:37.170> let<00:00:37.350> me<00:00:37.380> just<00:00:37.440> show

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
blender stuff so yeah let me just show

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
blender stuff so yeah let me just show
you<00:00:37.829> what<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.610> scene<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.850> made<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you what the scene is made up of and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.500 
you what the scene is made up of and
what<00:00:40.530> we<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.980> cover<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:44.180> as<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.390> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
what we are going to cover so as you can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.319 
what we are going to cover so as you can
see<00:00:46.100> from<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> modeling<00:00:47.610> side<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> things

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
see from the modeling side of things

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.920 
see from the modeling side of things
it's<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.670> fairly<00:00:50.670> simple<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.510> well

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
it's going to be fairly simple or well

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's going to be fairly simple or well
not<00:00:52.140> quite<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.680> simple<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.160> not

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
not quite that simple but it's not

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
not quite that simple but it's not
really<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.640> big<00:00:54.059> deal<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> work<00:00:55.260> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
really a big deal we're going to work a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.189 
really a big deal we're going to work a
little<00:00:55.739> bit<00:00:55.920> with<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:57.390> displacement

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little bit with a displacement

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.459 
little bit with a displacement
displacement<00:00:58.800> modifier<00:00:59.750> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> olives<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
displacement modifier on the olives and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.530 
displacement modifier on the olives and
a<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.550> bit<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> sculpting<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:04.250> make<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.540> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
a little bit of sculpting to make it so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.380 
a little bit of sculpting to make it so
as<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:06.960> I'm<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> oil<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.549> here<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> olive<00:01:09.270> oil

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
as if I'm the oil in here the olive oil

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
as if I'm the oil in here the olive oil
is<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:12.320> bending<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> say<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:14.369> close

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is actually bending so to say I'm close

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.120 
is actually bending so to say I'm close
to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.210> olives<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.979> other<00:01:16.979> than<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:19.130> yeah

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to the olives and other than that yeah

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
to the olives and other than that yeah
not<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.540> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
not not that much more a little bit of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.390 
not not that much more a little bit of
lighting<00:01:22.409> quite<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> simple<00:01:23.670> lighting<00:01:23.970> rig

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
lighting quite a simple lighting rig

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
lighting quite a simple lighting rig
then<00:01:26.400> quite<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.939> we're<00:01:27.689> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.960> cover

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
then quite a bit we're going to cover

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.060 
then quite a bit we're going to cover
quite<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> few<00:01:28.710> things

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
quite a few things

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.990 
quite a few things
and<00:01:29.430> concerning<00:01:30.030> materials<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> textures

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
and concerning materials and textures

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
and concerning materials and textures
mainly<00:01:33.000> material<00:01:33.420> still<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:35.630> then<00:01:36.630> any<00:01:36.750> note

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
mainly material still and then any note

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.990 
mainly material still and then any note
as<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.530> see<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
as you can see we are also going to do a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.130 
as you can see we are also going to do a
little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> compositing<00:01:40.189> I<00:01:41.270> try<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> pack

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
little bit of compositing I try to pack

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.609 
little bit of compositing I try to pack
in<00:01:43.320> quite<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> few<00:01:43.590> techniques<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:45.030> ID<00:01:45.899> masks

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
in quite a few techniques like ID masks

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.569 
in quite a few techniques like ID masks
and<00:01:47.000> how<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> create<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> vignette<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.579> little

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and how to create a vignette a little

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.190 
and how to create a vignette a little
color<00:01:50.759> correction<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.140> on

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.520 

and<00:01:56.200> yeah<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.770> on<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:02.290> from<00:02:02.440> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
and yeah it's it is on a but from the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.900 
and yeah it's it is on a but from the
from<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.800> modeling<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.100> set<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.610> things<00:02:03.730> it's

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
from the modeling a set of things it's

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.980 
from the modeling a set of things it's
on<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.000> beginner<00:02:04.270> level<00:02:04.480> I'd<00:02:04.660> say<00:02:04.870> but<00:02:05.710> from<00:02:06.070> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
on a beginner level I'd say but from the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.850 
on a beginner level I'd say but from the
composing<00:02:07.990> side<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.259> things<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.649> from<00:02:08.800> the

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
composing side of things and from the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.710 
composing side of things and from the
materials<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.399> textures<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:10.300> probably

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
materials and textures it's probably

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.620 
materials and textures it's probably
intermediate<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:12.070> yeah<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.060> hope<00:02:13.210> you<00:02:13.300> enjoy<00:02:13.510> it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
intermediate so yeah I hope you enjoy it
