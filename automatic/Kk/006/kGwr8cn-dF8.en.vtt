00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.430
 Hello everyone and we are in 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.830
 the hidden novelties of apra made 1 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.230
 point 4.4 this version was published yesterday 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.550
 Thursday, November 8th 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.740
 I made a video talk about her talking 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.090
 about the official news I leave you 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.190
 it comes in the description I recommend 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.990
 a lot to see and good in today's video 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.640
 we see you two novelties that are not 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.140
 they said officially and informed me 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.779
 thanks to the aval craft forum and the 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.250
 minecraft wiki and are two novelty nodes 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.290
 It is quite curious and here as I say 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.210
 they have told us officially and they are 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.229
 pretty good and good the first of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.909
 all is that they have added a new 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:39.530
 command and it serves both in the mode 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.199
 creative like survival mode and it's the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.519
 command of swell enchantment as well 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.940
 saying it is written like that I'm going to write 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.710
 here the sant is written well and well this 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.610
 command will serve to enchant our 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.280
 weapons you know that the weapons in him 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.290
 increase enchantments the swords have 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.850
 his own enchantments the armor 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.980
 has its own enchantment after 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.900
 the picks and shovels have their own 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.650
 enchantments and then the arches 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.300
 they also have their own 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.950
 spells the left in the creation 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.600
 a link of the micra quick and where 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.670
 you will have enchantments for all 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.260
 who wants to investigate and good for this 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.700
 command both the survival mode and the 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.200
 creative I think that afterwards 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.180
 will change and they will only put it in the mode 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.220
 creative I think since the survival mode 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.229
 It's a bit stupid 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.910
 now I will explain it and well once 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.979
 we have written this good enchantment 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.840
 this command sorry I messed up in sant 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.130
 then we will have to put the name of 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.470
 user to which we are going to put the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.930
 enchantment in this case I think fence 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.670
 there we will put a space and 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.470
 then we will have to put the idea of 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.229
 enchantment in this case as I have 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.550
 an ax in the axes the shovels and 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.649
 peaks as I said has its own 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.350
 enchantments and the enchantment of 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.420
 improbability is number 34 as already 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.500
 I say all these numbers and from more what 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.390
 would have in the script tion in a link 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.630
 well here we will have to put the leader 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.659
 of the enchantment in this one 434 and act 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.830
 followed we will have to put everything level 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.210
 we want disenchantment the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.520
 enchantment 34 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.080
 being broken skill has maximum 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.640
 the number three with this case that put 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.799
 the maximum I will put the 3 we give to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 enter and as you see immediately 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.090
 love the ax as you see here it comes out and 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.380
 break skill after what more thanks 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.880
 that this also serves the survival mode 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.410
 and you know what survival mode for 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.840
 love things we need the table of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.010
 enchantment why I believe that this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.480
 they will change it already after this is in 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.220
 test mode and I was only now the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.080
 survival for now I think it is 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.580
 I'll just put it in the creative and it will come 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.260
 pretty good for people who do more 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.870
 adventure maps for the simple fact of 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.019
 that's because thanks to this you do not have to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.910
 be modifying minecraft files 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.900
 without being in game so 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.310
 say it you know that the maps of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.260
 adventures have that there are times that you 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.820
 you find enchanted weapons but they are 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.459
 modify thanks to external programs 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.440
 thanks to this to this new command 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.790
 you can love with a simple command 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.350
 whenever he 's so creative in the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.510
 I think survival is what I forget 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.489
 has said they will remove it and also this 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.050
 command we can add the other command 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.420
 for example well look here another idea of 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.910
 the haches and shovels and picks to see the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.519
 trentino to see what to put 35 for example 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.440
 fortune by fortune also the number 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.730
 35 to put here to charm 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.430
 we will put the user's name 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.880
 included in the enchantment that is the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.500
 number 35 and level 3 and as you can see 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.330
 will add here the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.620
 profitability and fortune as I say 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.840
 this is now pretty good for the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.210
 maps of adventure and good the next 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.470
 change is with respect to squid and 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.790
 it's basically that now they die when 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.200
 they are not out of the water until before 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 I was going to look for the egg here 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.060
 squid I think there's a list in general 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.680
 karam to squid talk to them times and 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.120
 good as I'm going to put it here or in 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.720
 a while will die as you see when it happens 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.050
 a few seconds to see come from metro 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.290
 dies dies with the sea ​​if you are going to die 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.760
 in a good pispás not move very and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.320
 morella please do not leave me the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.360
 ridiculous before this test of 10 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.310
 it's true that you die but there it is as 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.500
 you see this before it did not happen and this is 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.270
 pretty good since it's illogical but a 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 Squid out of the water and keep it alive 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.040
 As you can see, here is the ink 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.660
 but he has given me 33 to 40 and good guys 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.770
 these are the two changes that have not 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.390
 said officially is quite 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.130
 well the enchantment stopped point of 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.270
 view and you know I leave the description 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.250

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.230
 enchantments of objects in 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.400
 issue like that stops the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.659
 enchantment 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.150
