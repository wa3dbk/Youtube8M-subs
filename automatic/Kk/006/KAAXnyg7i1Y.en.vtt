here so let's plug the tab in and see if

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.800 
here so let's plug the tab in and see if
it<00:02:22.599> actually<00:02:22.629> charges<00:02:23.439> it<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:24.629> displays<00:02:25.629> it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
it actually charges it and displays it

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.869 
it actually charges it and displays it
at<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.110> time<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:29.590> right<00:02:29.829> this<00:02:30.790> is

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
at the same time all right this is

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.220 
at the same time all right this is
what's<00:02:31.060> gonna<00:02:31.150> look<00:02:31.329> like<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.659> your<00:02:31.810> desk<00:02:32.019> on

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
start using the irregular battery so the

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.830 
start using the irregular battery so the
battery<00:03:00.760> charge<00:03:01.090> adopt<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.959> definite<00:03:02.470> go

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
battery charge adopt is a definite go

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.390 
battery charge adopt is a definite go
next<00:03:07.349> got<00:03:08.349> another<00:03:08.560> case<00:03:08.829> now<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.220> one<00:03:09.370> I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
next got another case now this one I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.039 
next got another case now this one I
haven't<00:03:09.609> even<00:03:09.790> open<00:03:10.180> yet<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.540> had<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.870> sitting

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
haven't even open yet I had it sitting

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.479 
haven't even open yet I had it sitting
around<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.530> minute<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:11.950> let's<00:03:12.129> finally

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
around for a minute so let's finally

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.310 
around for a minute so let's finally
take<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> look<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.269> see<00:03:13.359> what<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.540> looks<00:03:13.569> like

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:26.460 

now<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.920> nice<00:03:21.100> leather<00:03:21.370> case<00:03:25.470> of

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
now this is just a nice leather case of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.160 
now this is just a nice leather case of
course<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.830> poison<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:29.080> the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
course the poison in it with the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.840 
course the poison in it with the
direction<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.040> one<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.310> those<00:03:30.400> fold

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
direction so this is one of those fold

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.360 
direction so this is one of those fold
out<00:03:31.030> case<00:03:31.300> stains<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.680> let's<00:03:32.830> pop<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.220> and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
out case stains so let's pop it in and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.410 
out case stains so let's pop it in and
see<00:03:33.490> if<00:03:33.550> we<00:03:33.640> can<00:03:33.790> figure<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.450> fly

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.080 

so<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.510> just<00:03:40.630> pop<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.960> tab<00:03:41.170> in<00:03:44.910> and<00:03:45.910> this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
so you just pop the tab in and this
