00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
costs a lot of money and was pretty

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
costs a lot of money and was pretty
complicated<00:00:45.840> i<00:00:45.870> would<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> hire<00:00:46.590> someone

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

all<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.890> kinds<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.309> things<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.579> get<00:00:53.760> out

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
all these kinds of things to get out

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.860 
all these kinds of things to get out
there<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.420> didn't<00:00:57.750> have

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
there and and I just really didn't have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.560 
there and and I just really didn't have
the<00:00:57.960> funds<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.760> came<00:00:59.940> upon

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the funds to do that and so I came upon

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.590 
the funds to do that and so I came upon
lights<00:01:00.870> camera<00:01:01.320> cache<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.969> made<00:01:03.420> all<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
lights camera cache and it made all the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.630 
lights camera cache and it made all the
sense<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> world<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.500> me<00:01:04.530> except<00:01:05.400> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
sense in the world to me except it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
sense in the world to me except it
really<00:01:06.049> scared<00:01:07.049> me<00:01:07.110> um<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.340> always
