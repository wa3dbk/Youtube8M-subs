would<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.190> look<00:02:15.430> at<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.690> what<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:18.310> I

and<00:02:21.090> judging<00:02:22.090> from<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> iconography<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.680> think

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
and judging from the iconography I think

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.260 
and judging from the iconography I think
it's<00:02:24.430> safe<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.610> say<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:25.840> emptied<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
it's safe to say when that's emptied the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.080 
it's safe to say when that's emptied the
