00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.660
 the mind 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.059
 Hello, friends, how are you going to cook? 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.070
 dish well healthy and balanced a 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.730
 hake with vegetable sauce for this 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.379
 recipe 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.799
 We are going to use four slices of 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:18.350
 hake a broth cube magín el 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.980
 tomato is home fried solís pimiento 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.840
 green thyme and oregano the first thing that 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 I'm going to do is start preparing the 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.180
 sauce, I'm going to put the onion 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.789
 the green pepper we put a splash of 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.210
 olive oil 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.280
 add onion and green pepper 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.980
 also if we wanted we could 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.540
 previously add a clove of garlic 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.160
 minced we would also look good 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.070
 in the sauce now we 're going to leave 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.070
 sauté gently for a few minutes 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.899
 once we have the pepper and the onion 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.300
 sautéed then we put half 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.120
 glass of water that would be about 100 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.829
 milliliters 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.829
 and ulna Caldono 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.020
 we crumble 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:16.900
 and let it cook for 45 minutes once 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.250
 we have reduced the broth we add the 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 home fried tomato solís 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 we move it 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 and we will need to aromatize with some 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.270
 thyme herbs 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.700
 and a pinch of oregano 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.440
 and now we're going to let it cook 45 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.890
 minutes 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.890
 add a pinch of salt and pepper 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.650
 and we have listed our sauce 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.860
 tomato 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.870
 and now we are going to proceed to crush the 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.870
 we put it here in the glass 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.540
 we put it in the bowl 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.759
 and now we're going to continue passing the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.800
 hake to roast the fish is 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 important to heat the pan well 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.210
 prevent us from getting a little bit of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.580
 olive oil 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.460
 we worship her well on one side and then the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.270
 we turn in this case we have used 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.070
 hake but with this same sauce not 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.920
 it's okay another white fish even a 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.160
 blue fish one golden a sardines 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 tuna is to say that we can choose a 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.940
 fish that we like more we turn the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.910
 hake 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.740
 and you see that it has a golden color if 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.560
 we want it to take us even more color there 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.460
 a trick that is to put in the pan a 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.880
 little bit of salt helps us 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.730
 leave more color we add a little bit of 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.599
 Salt 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.599
 and pepper 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.130
 and we remove the hake 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.580
 for the pie 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.850
 and now just with ketchup 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.830
 and vegetables 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.370
 and decorate with some tools 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.610
 parsley a splash of olive oil 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.310
 and we already have our hake ready 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.310
 you see how healthy and how simple this dish 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.410
 for me 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.140
 no no
