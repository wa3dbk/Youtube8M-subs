00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.490
 That book 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:19.500
 Surface preparation before painting and surface finishing of work items 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 Sanding of stubborn iron rust and rough grain is a hard time 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.329
 This yes wave will show you how to use a disc grinder 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:37.910
 A disk grinder can cut and polish materials at will when it rotates at high speed 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.310
 It is a power tool that can 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.010
 Let's actually use a disk grinder 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.460
 me 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.880
 First, attach the attached offset grinding wheel 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:58.930
 Work on helping metal and deburring 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.930
 Be sure to use a grinding wheel that is compatible with the material 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 In the search for metal, but sparks come out 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.100
 Let's be careful whether there is anything easy to burn 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:22.700
 If you wear a pop brush again 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.700
 We can work on rust removal of large surfaces such as porch and handrails of stairs 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.330
 Let's use it also when taking old paint by making the groundwork before painting 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.230
 Hmm 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.230
 I had 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:45.850
 Hmm 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.159
 It is good to replace the disc with a paper material to finish the surface of wood etc. 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.380
 Hmm 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.799
 Suitable for surface finish because it can be scratched at high speed 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.110
 In addition, the elder of wood makes it smooth 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.110
 You can process such as making a dent 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.660
 I also used felt bisque 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.660
 Bicycle testimony 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:22.110
 A wide range of applications by replacing the risk, such as metal cutting using a dedicated cover and cutting Poi child 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.110
 available 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 How was it 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.940
 Let's follow the steps of ground making and finish work using a disc grinder 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920
