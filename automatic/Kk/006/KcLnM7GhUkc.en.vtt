a<00:00:55.940> backup<00:00:56.149> is<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.690> ha<00:00:56.780> where<00:00:56.989> else<00:00:57.020> put<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.350> in

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
a backup is that ha where else put it in

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.430 
a backup is that ha where else put it in
the<00:00:57.530> back<00:00:57.739> now<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.220> he's<00:00:58.340> going<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.550> go<00:00:58.699> back

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
the back now so he's going to go back

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
the back now so he's going to go back
basically<00:01:00.440> there's<00:01:00.649> one<00:01:00.829> Road<00:01:01.070> out

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.350 

so<00:01:05.860> that's<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.159> situation<00:01:06.729> now<00:01:06.760> event<00:01:07.210> he's

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
so that's a situation now event he's

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.640 
so that's a situation now event he's
gonna<00:01:07.479> kind<00:01:07.750> of<00:01:07.780> look<00:01:07.900> at<00:01:08.049> what<00:01:08.200> he<00:01:08.350> wants<00:01:08.619> to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
gonna kind of look at what he wants to

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.910 
gonna kind of look at what he wants to
do<00:01:08.830> here<00:01:09.070> is<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.590> rest<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.860> the

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
do here is the first and the rest of the

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.249 
do here is the first and the rest of the
guys<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.520> think<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:13.299> think<00:01:13.509> right<00:01:13.869> now<00:01:14.049> his

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
guys I think I think right now his

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.170 
guys I think I think right now his
strategy<00:01:14.710> just<00:01:14.860> changed<00:01:15.400> this<00:01:15.850> goal

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
strategy just changed this goal

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.969 
strategy just changed this goal
obviously<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.960> was<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.170> get<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.320> turn<00:01:17.560> one<00:01:17.770> in

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
obviously it was to get to turn one in

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.230 
obviously it was to get to turn one in
front<00:01:18.159> of<00:01:18.340> everyone<00:01:18.550> else<00:01:18.899> Booster<00:01:19.899> Gold<00:01:20.369> yes

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.720 

to<00:01:24.869> bid<00:01:25.049> terrific<00:01:25.530> separators<00:01:25.950> lots<00:01:26.220> of

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.670 

and<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.150> you<00:01:29.420> were<00:01:29.540> also<00:01:29.780> racing<00:01:30.170> Travis

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
and so you were also racing Travis

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.100 
and so you were also racing Travis
Pastrana's<00:01:30.800> car<00:01:31.460> that<00:01:32.150> car<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.480> really<00:01:32.660> wanted

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
Pastrana's car that car is really wanted

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.470 
Pastrana's car that car is really wanted
before<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:33.890> like<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.850> really<00:01:35.210> want<00:01:35.390> to

before so it's like you really want to
do<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.690> trout<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.080> Travis's<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:36.830> Watson<00:01:37.190> yes

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
do it trout and Travis's here Watson yes

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.000 
do it trout and Travis's here Watson yes
exactly<00:01:38.000> can<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.360> go<00:01:38.510> be<00:01:38.660> with<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.410> anti-lag

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
exactly can you go be with the anti-lag

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.590 
exactly can you go be with the anti-lag
systems<00:01:40.490> in<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:40.640> launch<00:01:40.940> control<00:01:41.090> these<00:01:41.360> cars

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
systems in the launch control these cars

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.570 
systems in the launch control these cars
have<00:01:41.660> is<00:01:41.870> actually<00:01:42.140> really<00:01:42.350> tricky<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.040> it's

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
have is actually really tricky so it's

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.250 
have is actually really tricky so it's
not<00:01:43.730> surprising<00:01:43.850> Bryce<00:01:44.420> was<00:01:44.630> not<00:01:44.900> a<00:01:44.930> lot<00:01:45.170> of

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
not surprising Bryce was not a lot of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.600 
not surprising Bryce was not a lot of
races<00:01:45.500> lenders<00:01:45.770> felt<00:01:46.040> might<00:01:46.220> have<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.400> little

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
races lenders felt might have a little

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.010 
races lenders felt might have a little
bit<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.790> an<00:01:46.910> issue<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.450> system<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:47.930> he's

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
bit of an issue in the system but he's

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.930 
bit of an issue in the system but he's
got<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.380> either<00:01:49.010> be<00:01:49.160> very<00:01:49.190> precise<00:01:49.700> there's
