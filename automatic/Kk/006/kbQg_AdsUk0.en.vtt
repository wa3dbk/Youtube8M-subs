 simple a caravan that is a little bit 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.860
 atypical that serves as studio 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.599
 recording that moves on 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.400
 four cities of the country auray would have 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.559
 break pluvigner carnac for 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.050
 municipal elections 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.809
 weary of this 2014 year and so you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 are invited to ask questions to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.980
 lists in the presence 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.970
 and you that from there questions 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.480
 to his post on the internet on a site 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.100
 dedicated and then one in a second time 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.560
 the candidates themselves they will come to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 this same place respond to these 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.070
 questions is like that it could even 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.670
 give them ideas on what the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.670
 population is waiting 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.930
 I think it was never done 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.000
 so local way I told myself that 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.630
 it was a simple way to go from 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.130
 meet people to listen to them a 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.780
 opportunity given to the inhabitants of 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.150
 to seize the question 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.350
 public for will create bridges 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.580
 links between the political world and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.990
 people and locals there is a 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.650
 moment when I think everyone is getting 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.729
 ask about on life together and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.229
 now everyone is free to 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.619
 come to design old or young and 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.869
 that we have the same impact on the place 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.970
 where I will be told why I do not know 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:03.180
 how to say it if we like or do not like 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.180
 I was touched by that I went there 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.340
