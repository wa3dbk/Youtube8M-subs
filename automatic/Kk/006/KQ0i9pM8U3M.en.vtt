00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.410
 thereafter 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.700
 as we know 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.090
 Why 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 further investigation 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 on the bridge

 m work with the blues 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.950
 nantes 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.890
 why other than that 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 little by little archambault 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.540
 at the beginning 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.860
 Why 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.320

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 his offer understands why 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.579
 school 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.209
 domains 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.519
 now 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.429
 an example 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:26.999
 more and more complex 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.249
 finally 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.249
 this is basically 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.429
 a little bit taller 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.309
 all prepare 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.429
 really 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:44.429
 so 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.659
 trav art 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.749
 the air is the era 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.619
