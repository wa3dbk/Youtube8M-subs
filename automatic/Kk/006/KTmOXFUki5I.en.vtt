there<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:48.209> bright<00:03:48.480> slam<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:49.579> one-handed

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
there this bright slam can one-handed

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.110 
there this bright slam can one-handed
gym<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.530> probably<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:54.299> a<00:03:54.360> rebound

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120

come<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.090> this<00:03:59.269> again<00:03:59.870> most<00:04:00.739> TVs<00:04:01.549> there<00:04:02.420> are<00:04:02.510> a

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
come see this again most TVs there are a

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.289 
come see this again most TVs there are a
lot<00:04:02.629> of<00:04:02.659> TVs<00:04:03.080> in<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.290> car<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:04.370> can't<00:04:05.000> even<00:04:05.150> see

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
it

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.300 
it
I<00:04:05.599> think<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:06.290> for<00:04:06.440> 230<00:04:06.680> 240<00:04:06.860> degree<00:04:07.220> in

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
I think it's for 230 240 degree in

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.809 
I think it's for 230 240 degree in
contra<00:04:07.549> hotel<00:04:07.819> so<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:08.629> is<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.750> close<00:04:08.989> game<00:04:09.200> to

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819
