00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
every single game ended up with us

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
every single game ended up with us
taking<00:00:24.180> every<00:00:24.539> objective<00:00:24.980> rotating<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.430> over

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
taking every objective rotating all over

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
taking every objective rotating all over
the<00:00:26.880> map<00:00:27.000> without<00:00:27.180> getting<00:00:27.720> any<00:00:27.840> response

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the map without getting any response

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.820 
the map without getting any response
from<00:00:28.289> h2k<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.240> went<00:00:30.359> off<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.830> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
from h2k and we just went off of that so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
from h2k and we just went off of that so
that<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.340> sums<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.759> Justin<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
those three games can just be summed up

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.620 
those three games can just be summed up
as<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.399> guys<00:00:35.520> got<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.880> objectives<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.480> just

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
as you guys got all objectives and just

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.950 
as you guys got all objectives and just
one<00:00:36.780> pretty<00:00:37.559> much<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.950> wasn't<00:00:38.280> much<00:00:38.960> going

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
one pretty much there wasn't much going

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.630 
one pretty much there wasn't much going
on<00:00:40.170> during<00:00:40.410> laning<00:00:40.620> phases<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.370> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
on during laning phases it was just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
on during laning phases it was just
taking<00:00:42.180> objectives<00:00:42.629> over<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.960> over<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> over

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
taking objectives over and over and over

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.139 
taking objectives over and over and over
and<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.680> slowly<00:00:43.829> building<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> lead<00:00:44.430> all

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
and just slowly building a lead all

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.040 
and just slowly building a lead all
right<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.420> let's<00:00:45.539> break<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.809> down<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> little

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
right well let's break it down a little

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
right well let's break it down a little
bit<00:00:46.170> more<00:00:46.289> than<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.680> why<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.430> think<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
bit more than out why do you think you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.069 
bit more than out why do you think you
were<00:00:47.789> able<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.180> those<00:00:48.390> objectives<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.930> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
were able to get those objectives was it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.240 
were able to get those objectives was it
like<00:00:49.200> champ<00:00:49.440> pics<00:00:49.649> where<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.100> out

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
like champ pics where you just out

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
like champ pics where you just out
playing<00:00:50.520> them<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.449> allowed<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
playing them what really allowed you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.680 
playing them what really allowed you
guys<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.530> control<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> map<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:53.460> well

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
guys to to control the map so well

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
guys to to control the map so well
mostly<00:00:54.690> having<00:00:54.899> more<00:00:55.199> efficient<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.940> just

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
mostly having more efficient and just

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.160 
mostly having more efficient and just
having<00:00:57.149> better<00:00:57.329> communication<00:00:57.930> shield

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
having better communication shield

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.709 
having better communication shield
calling<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
calling and so that was I was it do you

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
calling and so that was I was it do you
think<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:02.160> guys<00:01:02.190> played<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.910> better

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
think that you guys played a lot better

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
think that you guys played a lot better
than<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.390> had<00:01:03.570> been<00:01:03.750> previously<00:01:04.140> because<00:01:04.650> if

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
than you had been previously because if

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
than you had been previously because if
you<00:01:05.040> look<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.519> dominant<00:01:05.939> today<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.390> what

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
you look so dominant today you know what

where<00:01:07.080> was<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.520> CW<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.119> couple

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
where was this CW you know just couple

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.210 
where was this CW you know just couple
weeks<00:01:09.479> ago<00:01:09.680> definitely<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> lot<00:01:10.799> better<00:01:10.860> than

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
weeks ago definitely a lot better than

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280 
weeks ago definitely a lot better than
we<00:01:11.369> played<00:01:11.549> an<00:01:11.670> LCS<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.240> about<00:01:12.479> even<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.080> what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we played an LCS and about even on what

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
we played an LCS and about even on what
we<00:01:13.380> played<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.860> screams<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.369> last<00:01:14.520> few<00:01:14.640> weeks

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we played in screams the last few weeks

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.200 
we played in screams the last few weeks
so<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.470> think<00:01:16.470> we're<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.890> pretty<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.670> LCS<00:01:18.060> team

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so I think we're a pretty good LCS team

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
so I think we're a pretty good LCS team
right<00:01:18.330> now<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.340> going

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
right now so do you think you're going

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
right now so do you think you're going
to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> really<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.180> LCS<00:01:21.600> team<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> Berlin

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to be a really good LCS team and Berlin

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940 
to be a really good LCS team and Berlin
next<00:01:23.040> year<00:01:23.189> hopefully<00:01:24.259> when<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.409> if<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.710> keep

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
next year hopefully when I if we keep

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.920 
next year hopefully when I if we keep
playing<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.640> definitely

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
playing this way we can definitely

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
playing this way we can definitely
contest<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> much<00:01:28.409> higher<00:01:28.560> spot<00:01:28.890> then<00:01:29.070> they

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
contest for a much higher spot then they

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.910 
contest for a much higher spot then they
split<00:01:29.869> let's<00:01:30.869> talk<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.200> bit<00:01:31.500> about

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
split let's talk a little bit about

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
split let's talk a little bit about
worlds<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.729> seems<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:32.970> your

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
worlds because it seems like your

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.120 
worlds because it seems like your
matches<00:01:34.170> was<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> such<00:01:34.619> an<00:01:34.770> open-and-shut

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
matches was just such an open-and-shut

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.270 
matches was just such an open-and-shut
case<00:01:35.570> what<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.040> what

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.469 
case what do you think a you know what
do<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.820> we'll<00:01:38.970> see<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
do you think we'll see out of the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.330 
do you think we'll see out of the
European<00:01:39.960> teams<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.439> Worlds<00:01:40.829> especially<00:01:41.250> now

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
European teams at Worlds especially now

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.030 
European teams at Worlds especially now
that<00:01:41.369> you've<00:01:41.520> seen<00:01:41.700> groups<00:01:42.140> I'm<00:01:43.140> hoping<00:01:43.710> for

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that you've seen groups I'm hoping for

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.499 
that you've seen groups I'm hoping for
allowing<00:01:44.430> us<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> make<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.000> think<00:01:45.210> they

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
allowing us to make it out I think they

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.840 
allowing us to make it out I think they
will<00:01:45.659> phonetic<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> bit<00:01:46.649> tougher<00:01:46.979> group<00:01:47.159> but

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
will phonetic as a bit tougher group but

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.130 
will phonetic as a bit tougher group but
I<00:01:47.880> still<00:01:48.119> believe<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.020> would

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I still believe in them and I would

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
I still believe in them and I would
still<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.560> money<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.799> them<00:01:50.009> we've<00:01:50.790> got<00:01:50.970> two

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
still put my money on them we've got two

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.700 
still put my money on them we've got two
coming<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.630> group<00:01:51.780> son<00:01:52.049> yeah<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> don't

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
coming out of group son yeah I don't

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
coming out of group son yeah I don't
give<00:01:53.009> as<00:01:53.130> K<00:01:53.280> much<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> chance<00:01:53.820> do<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> think

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
give as K much of a chance do you think

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
give as K much of a chance do you think
do<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.590> means<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.920> TSM<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.460> go

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
do you think that means the TSM will go

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.260 
do you think that means the TSM will go
that<00:01:56.790> instead<00:01:57.469> probably<00:01:58.469> yes<00:01:58.590> yeah<00:01:58.969> so<00:01:59.969> then

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
that instead probably yes yeah so then

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.410 
that instead probably yes yeah so then
for<00:02:01.079> North<00:02:01.560> America<00:02:01.979> we've<00:02:02.130> got<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.579> least<00:02:02.640> ts7

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
for North America we've got at least ts7

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.840 
for North America we've got at least ts7
your<00:02:03.570> predictions<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.200> think<00:02:04.380> lmq<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.159> cloud

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
your predictions you think lmq or cloud

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.479 
your predictions you think lmq or cloud
nine<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> chance<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:07.860> cloud

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
nine have a chance at all I think cloud

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.559 
nine have a chance at all I think cloud
line<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> get<00:02:09.090> third<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> their

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
line is going to get third in their

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.830 
line is going to get third in their
group<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.020> same<00:02:10.470> for<00:02:10.500> lmq<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.090> we've<00:02:12.629> got

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
group and same for lmq so we've got

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.970 
group and same for lmq so we've got
three<00:02:13.230> western

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
three western

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
games making out of groups I guess so

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
hopefully they get a little bit further

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.229 
hopefully they get a little bit further

do<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.150> think<00:03:15.299> that<00:03:15.420> they<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.750> ability

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019

to<00:03:16.079> maybe<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.650> during<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.859> expansion

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
to maybe get in during the expansion

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.370 
to maybe get in during the expansion
tournament<00:03:17.670> they<00:03:18.329> do<00:03:18.389> they're<00:03:18.780> definitely<00:03:19.169> a

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
tournament they do they're definitely a

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.170 
tournament they do they're definitely a
really<00:03:19.530> strong<00:03:19.769> team<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.190> they<00:03:20.310> are<00:03:20.910> probably

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
really strong team and they are probably

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.809 
really strong team and they are probably
topped<00:03:21.480> in<00:03:21.660> ten<00:03:21.900> team<00:03:22.109> in<00:03:22.230> LCS<00:03:22.530> EU<00:03:22.739> LCS<00:03:23.099> so
