star patterns that we're looking for to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.940 
star patterns that we're looking for to
show<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:39.899> kids<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> set<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
show our kids and we want to set up a

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.799 
show our kids and we want to set up a
telescope<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.030> today<00:00:42.450> we're<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> show

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
telescope and today we're going to show

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
telescope and today we're going to show
you<00:00:42.899> how<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.230> Google<00:00:43.920> Earth<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> find<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
you how to use Google Earth to find that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
you how to use Google Earth to find that
location<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.100> need<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> do<00:00:47.489> first<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
location and what we need to do first to

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.700 
location and what we need to do first to
find<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.360> location<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> find<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
find that location we need to find it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.670 
find that location we need to find it
and<00:00:50.070> how<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> exists<00:00:51.420> parallel<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and how it exists parallel from the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.470 
and how it exists parallel from the
location<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.579> are<00:00:53.879> sending<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
location that we are sending up the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.270 
location that we are sending up the
telescope<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.140> what<00:00:55.649> we're<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:56.010> first

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
telescope so what we're gonna do first

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.790 
telescope so what we're gonna do first
is<00:00:56.610> we're<00:00:56.730> gonna<00:00:56.820> find<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> degree<00:00:58.379> or

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
is we're gonna find out the degree or

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.939 
is we're gonna find out the degree or
angle<00:00:59.399> from<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.510> center<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.020> our<00:01:01.170> axis<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
angle from the center of our axis of the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.500 
angle from the center of our axis of the
earth<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.789> located

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
earth to where we are located

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
earth to where we are located
and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.170> fixing<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> minus<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> or

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and then we are fixing a minus that or

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.340 
and then we are fixing a minus that or
plus<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.180> depending<00:01:06.600> whether<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.020> north

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
plus that depending whether it's north

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.530 
plus that depending whether it's north
or<00:01:07.560> south<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> us<00:01:08.360> from<00:01:09.890> wherever<00:01:11.150> the<00:01:12.150> star<00:01:12.420> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
or south of us from wherever the star is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.030 
or south of us from wherever the star is
located<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> we'll<00:01:13.320> show<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> find

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
located and we'll show you how to find

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.289 
located and we'll show you how to find
the<00:01:14.159> star<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> moment<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:14.970> first<00:01:15.119> we're

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the star in a moment but first we're

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.640 
the star in a moment but first we're
gonna<00:01:15.360> show<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> locate<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> degrees

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
gonna show you how to locate the degrees

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
gonna show you how to locate the degrees
that<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> axis<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.360> we're<00:01:18.960> gonna

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that we are from the axis so we're gonna

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.870 
that we are from the axis so we're gonna
zoom<00:01:19.259> down<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> North<00:01:20.009> Pole<00:01:20.250> you'll<00:01:20.610> see

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
zoom down on the North Pole you'll see

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
zoom down on the North Pole you'll see
where<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> pictures<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.380> panoramic

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
where all the pictures the panoramic

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
where all the pictures the panoramic
pictures<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.720> bringing<00:01:24.720> down

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
pictures are kind of bringing down

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.630 
pictures are kind of bringing down
together<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.799> point<00:01:26.070> you'll<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
together at one point you'll see a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640 
together at one point you'll see a
little<00:01:26.790> like<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> starburst<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.990> what<00:01:28.560> we're

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
little like a starburst here what we're

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
little like a starburst here what we're
going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> we're<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> ruler

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
going to do is we're going to the ruler

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.569 
going to do is we're going to the ruler
and<00:01:30.530> with<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> line<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:32.430> gonna

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and with the line that we're gonna

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.020 
and with the line that we're gonna
create<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.930> dot<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.490> then<00:01:35.610> we're<00:01:35.700> gonna<00:01:35.790> pull

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
create a dot and then we're gonna pull

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.399 
create a dot and then we're gonna pull
it<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> where<00:01:36.540> we're<00:01:36.689> gonna<00:01:36.780> be<00:01:36.990> setting<00:01:37.170> up

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it to where we're gonna be setting up

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
it to where we're gonna be setting up
the<00:01:37.500> telescope<00:01:37.740> let's<00:01:38.369> say<00:01:38.520> we're<00:01:38.729> setting<00:01:39.030> up

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the telescope let's say we're setting up

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.120 
the telescope let's say we're setting up
the<00:01:39.210> sella<00:01:39.479> scope<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.439> home<00:01:40.740> city<00:01:40.950> which

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the sella scope and my home city which

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:51.310 
the sella scope and my home city which
is<00:01:41.280> Bogalusa<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> we'll<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> Bogalusa

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.930 

and<00:01:51.770> drop<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.340> dot<00:01:52.960> now<00:01:53.960> that<00:01:54.230> line<00:01:54.940> is

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
and drop the dot now that line is

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.940 
and drop the dot now that line is
showing<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.390> length<00:01:56.750> of<00:01:56.870> miles<00:01:57.170> from<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.770> top

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
showing a length of miles from the top

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.290 
showing a length of miles from the top
of<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.130> axis<00:01:58.550> we're<00:01:58.760> not<00:01:58.880> worried<00:01:59.060> about<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
of the axis we're not worried about the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.850 
of the axis we're not worried about the
miles<00:01:59.570> footage<00:02:00.110> or<00:02:00.200> anything<00:02:00.380> else<00:02:00.590> well

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
miles footage or anything else well

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.610 
miles footage or anything else well
we're<00:02:01.010> worried<00:02:01.280> about<00:02:01.430> is<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.850> degrees<00:02:02.810> we

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
we're worried about is the degrees we

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620 
we're worried about is the degrees we
show<00:02:03.800> 59<00:02:04.310> point<00:02:04.610> two<00:02:04.790> five<00:02:05.000> we're<00:02:05.420> gonna<00:02:05.480> go

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
show 59 point two five we're gonna go

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.810 
show 59 point two five we're gonna go
ahead<00:02:05.690> start<00:02:06.250> putting<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.550> notepad

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
ahead start putting this on a notepad

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.260 
ahead start putting this on a notepad
and<00:02:12.700> 59<00:02:13.700> point<00:02:14.330> two<00:02:14.600> five<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.840> believe<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.290> was

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
and 59 point two five I believe it was

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.040 
and 59 point two five I believe it was
yes<00:02:17.440> so<00:02:18.440> now<00:02:18.620> what<00:02:18.800> we're<00:02:18.950> gonna<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:20.900> I'm

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
yes so now what we're gonna do is I'm

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.600 
yes so now what we're gonna do is I'm
going<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.230> show<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.380> why<00:02:21.620> first<00:02:21.980> we're<00:02:22.370> doing

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
going to show you why first we're doing

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.610 
going to show you why first we're doing
this<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.630> this<00:02:23.750> will<00:02:23.870> make<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.110> little<00:02:24.260> bit<00:02:24.470> more

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
this so this will make a little bit more

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.620 
this so this will make a little bit more
sense<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:26.740> well<00:02:27.740> we<00:02:27.770> have<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.580> whole<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
sense to you well we have and whole is

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.780 
sense to you well we have and whole is
we<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.959> line<00:02:30.260> from<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.800> top<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.550> leads

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
we have a line from the top that leads

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.360 
we have a line from the top that leads
to<00:02:32.090> here<00:02:32.420> imagine<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.500> line<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:34.040> runs<00:02:34.220> through

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
to here imagine a line that runs through

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.220 
to here imagine a line that runs through
the<00:02:34.580> center<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.180> earth<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.660> from<00:02:35.990> that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
the center of the earth and from that

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.370 
the center of the earth and from that
line<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.920> have<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.160> line<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.580> comes<00:02:38.120> out<00:02:38.420> now

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
line you have a line that comes out now

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.430 
line you have a line that comes out now
the<00:02:39.440> fifty<00:02:40.070> nine<00:02:40.280> point<00:02:40.760> two<00:02:41.090> five<00:02:41.440> represents

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
the fifty nine point two five represents

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.920 
the fifty nine point two five represents
the<00:02:42.620> angle<00:02:43.130> or<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.400> degrees<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.090> we

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
the angle or the degrees that we

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.949 
the angle or the degrees that we
ourselves<00:02:45.200> are<00:02:45.709> from<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.400> axis<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.720> what<00:02:47.840> we

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
ourselves are from the axis and what we

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.870 
ourselves are from the axis and what we
need<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.230> do<00:02:48.380> now<00:02:48.620> is<00:02:48.980> find<00:02:49.250> out<00:02:49.459> what<00:02:49.670> angle

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
need to do now is find out what angle

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.320 
need to do now is find out what angle
the<00:02:50.860> star<00:02:51.860> or<00:02:52.220> planet<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.180> looking

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330

for is gonna be so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:55.640> go<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.760> sky<00:02:56.410> appear<00:02:57.410> on<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> planet<00:02:58.040> then

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
and go to sky appear on the planet then

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.759 
and go to sky appear on the planet then
go<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:58.970> sky<00:02:59.269> and<00:03:01.450> pull<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.570> ruler<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:03.080> go

point three eight bring our pad back up
and<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:35.610> we're<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.850> do<00:04:36.000> here<00:04:36.360> is

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and what we're going to do here is

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.190 
and what we're going to do here is
ninety<00:04:37.380> six<00:04:37.650> point<00:04:38.010> three<00:04:38.220> eight<00:04:38.810> minus<00:04:39.810> fifty

ninety six point three eight minus fifty
nine<00:04:40.590> point<00:04:41.040> two<00:04:41.220> four<00:04:41.790> and<00:04:43.310> let's<00:04:44.310> just<00:04:44.490> do

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
nine point two four and let's just do

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.560 
nine point two four and let's just do
that<00:04:44.669> on<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.000> calculator<00:04:45.120> right<00:04:45.600> quick<00:04:48.500> so

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
that on the calculator right quick so

00:04:50.570 --> 00:05:01.430 
that on the calculator right quick so
96.3<00:04:52.070> a-minus<00:04:55.669> 59.2<00:04:56.810> whoops<00:04:59.180> -<00:05:00.180> four<00:05:00.510> would

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
96.3 a-minus 59.2 whoops - four would

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.760 
96.3 a-minus 59.2 whoops - four would
equal<00:05:01.830> thirty<00:05:02.070> seven<00:05:02.430> point<00:05:02.639> one<00:05:03.180> four<00:05:04.020> thirty

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
equal thirty seven point one four thirty

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.420 
equal thirty seven point one four thirty
seven<00:05:05.340> point<00:05:05.760> one<00:05:06.419> four<00:05:06.870> now<00:05:07.860> I'm<00:05:08.100> gonna<00:05:08.220> show

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
seven point one four now I'm gonna show

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.450 
seven point one four now I'm gonna show
you<00:05:08.460> why<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:11.070> our<00:05:11.400> angle<00:05:13.190> so<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.340> just

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
you why this is our angle so this just

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.969 
you why this is our angle so this just
makes<00:05:14.700> perfect<00:05:15.060> sense<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.330> you<00:05:15.950> create<00:05:16.950> a

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
makes perfect sense to you create a

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.110 
makes perfect sense to you create a
circle<00:05:17.810> this<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.080> Earth<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.820> line<00:05:20.820> through

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
circle this is the Earth a line through

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.310 
circle this is the Earth a line through
the<00:05:21.240> earth<00:05:21.350> this<00:05:22.350> is<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.560> axis<00:05:23.720> not<00:05:24.720> exactly

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
the earth this is the axis not exactly

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.710 
the earth this is the axis not exactly
at<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.620> 23<00:05:26.160> degree<00:05:26.370> angle<00:05:26.669> here<00:05:26.850> but<00:05:27.450> this<00:05:27.570> is

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
at the 23 degree angle here but this is

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.740 
at the 23 degree angle here but this is
your<00:05:27.840> axis<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:28.530> now<00:05:29.250> only<00:05:29.820> Earth<00:05:30.270> we<00:05:30.570> had<00:05:30.720> a

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
your axis and now only Earth we had a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.090 
your axis and now only Earth we had a
certain<00:05:31.020> distance<00:05:31.440> that<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:31.800> were<00:05:31.889> located

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
certain distance that we were located

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.900 
certain distance that we were located
that<00:05:33.060> distance<00:05:33.590> let's<00:05:34.590> say<00:05:34.860> let's<00:05:35.610> say<00:05:35.760> it's

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
that distance let's say let's say it's

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.670 
that distance let's say let's say it's
not<00:05:36.150> right<00:05:36.360> there<00:05:36.539> let's<00:05:37.110> say<00:05:37.260> it<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.500> right

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
not right there let's say it is right

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.480 
not right there let's say it is right
here<00:05:38.160> that<00:05:39.650> angle<00:05:40.650> was<00:05:41.610> be<00:05:42.090> our<00:05:43.340> fifty<00:05:44.340> nine

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
here that angle was be our fifty nine

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.060 
here that angle was be our fifty nine
point<00:05:44.910> two<00:05:45.120> four<00:05:45.750> that<00:05:46.410> would<00:05:46.530> be<00:05:46.620> our<00:05:46.740> angle

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
point two four that would be our angle

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.570 
point two four that would be our angle
but<00:05:47.580> now<00:05:47.760> we're<00:05:47.940> looking<00:05:48.090> for<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.770> planet<00:05:49.770> and

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
but now we're looking for a planet and

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.730 
but now we're looking for a planet and
what<00:05:51.180> we<00:05:51.270> want<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.570> do<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.990> we<00:05:52.110> want<00:05:52.289> to<00:05:52.349> set

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
what we want to do is we want to set

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.240 
what we want to do is we want to set
this<00:05:53.190> as<00:05:53.520> our<00:05:53.669> zero<00:05:54.090> platform<00:05:54.889> this<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:56.039> where

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
this as our zero platform this is where

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.520 
this as our zero platform this is where

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
our scope would be set on we would be

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.170 
our scope would be set on we would be
sitting<00:05:58.710> in<00:05:58.889> a<00:05:58.950> telescope<00:05:59.400> on<00:05:59.580> this<00:05:59.760> angle

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
sitting in a telescope on this angle

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.770 
sitting in a telescope on this angle
okay<00:06:00.800> but<00:06:01.800> where<00:06:02.370> our<00:06:02.550> planet<00:06:03.060> is<00:06:03.210> let's<00:06:03.630> say

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
okay but where our planet is let's say

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.900 
okay but where our planet is let's say
it's<00:06:03.930> represented<00:06:04.560> by<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:04.770> line<00:06:05.310> way<00:06:05.669> out

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
it's represented by this line way out

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.770 
it's represented by this line way out
from<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.389> earth<00:06:07.099> now<00:06:08.099> the<00:06:09.060> distance<00:06:09.510> between

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
this line to this line is how we would

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.780 
this line to this line is how we would
set<00:06:13.140> the<00:06:13.289> telescope<00:06:13.830> to

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
set the telescope to

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.790 
set the telescope to
you<00:06:14.880> what<00:06:15.870> we<00:06:16.020> want<00:06:16.200> to<00:06:16.320> see<00:06:16.970> so<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.240> angle

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
you what we want to see so that angle

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.600 
you what we want to see so that angle
would<00:06:19.800> be<00:06:20.630> 37<00:06:21.630> point<00:06:21.870> one<00:06:22.110> four<00:06:22.410> and<00:06:22.740> then<00:06:23.520> we

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
would be 37 point one four and then we

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.310 
would be 37 point one four and then we
put<00:06:23.820> his<00:06:23.940> dead-on<00:06:24.300> what<00:06:24.870> we're<00:06:25.020> looking<00:06:25.290> for

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
put his dead-on what we're looking for

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.160 
put his dead-on what we're looking for
you<00:06:25.740> can<00:06:26.190> use<00:06:26.370> this<00:06:26.580> on<00:06:26.850> any<00:06:27.090> star<00:06:27.480> any<00:06:28.080> star

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
you can use this on any star any star
