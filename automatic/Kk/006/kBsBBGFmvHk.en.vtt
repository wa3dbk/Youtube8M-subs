00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.160 
price point and then have it raised up
at<00:00:11.549> its<00:00:11.820> different<00:00:12.209> stages<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.780> development

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
at its different stages of development

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.169 
at its different stages of development
so<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.590> know<00:00:13.830> when<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.040> goes<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.190> beta<00:00:14.490> rays<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
so you know when it goes to beta rays it

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
so you know when it goes to beta rays it
when<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.480> goes<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.630> full<00:00:15.929> game<00:00:16.110> you<00:00:16.830> know<00:00:16.890> Rose

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
when it goes to full game you know Rose

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.609 
when it goes to full game you know Rose
it<00:00:17.279> again<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.630> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.470> also

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it again so we want to do that but also

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.010 
it again so we want to do that but also
for<00:00:20.099> the<00:00:20.189> initial<00:00:20.400> release<00:00:20.759> we<00:00:21.119> don't<00:00:21.270> want<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
for the initial release we don't want a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.620 
for the initial release we don't want a
lot<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.829> people<00:00:23.099> I'm<00:00:23.550> talking<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.239> very

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
lot of people I'm talking about the very

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.569 
lot of people I'm talking about the very
first<00:00:24.720> release<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.919> want<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.250> limit<00:00:26.399> the

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
first release we want to limit the

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.120 
first release we want to limit the
amount<00:00:26.669> of<00:00:26.820> people<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.119> play<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.130> we

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
amount of people that play it so we

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.350 
amount of people that play it so we
might<00:00:29.309> look<00:00:29.520> at<00:00:29.640> doing<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.270> of

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.360 
might look at doing some kind of

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.069 
might look at doing some kind of
developer<00:00:30.899> supporters<00:00:31.680> package<00:00:32.149> which<00:00:33.149> will

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
developer supporters package which will

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.569 
developer supporters package which will
allow<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.739> something<00:00:35.040> maybe<00:00:35.489> like

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
allow you to do something maybe like

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.400 
allow you to do something maybe like
name<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.300> being<00:00:36.480> creative<00:00:36.870> swallows<00:00:37.260> or

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
name is on being creative swallows or

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.079 
name is on being creative swallows or
something<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> you'll<00:00:38.910> get

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
something like that and and you'll get

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.380 
something like that and and you'll get
the<00:00:39.739> initial<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:41.100> access<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> will<00:00:42.149> limit

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the initial first access and will limit

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
the initial first access and will limit
the<00:00:42.600> number<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.870> those<00:00:43.079> keys<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.739> gives

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the number of those keys and that gives

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.009 
the number of those keys and that gives
us<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.160> pool<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.399> people<00:00:44.699> who<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.210> really

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
us a pool of people who are really

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.779 
us a pool of people who are really
committed<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.679> development<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.519> might

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
committed to the development so we might

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.630 
committed to the development so we might
do<00:00:47.999> that<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.690> not<00:00:48.899> sure<00:00:49.230> yeah<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.519> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
do that but I'm not sure yeah we need to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.040 
do that but I'm not sure yeah we need to
think<00:00:50.760> about<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.210> mean<00:00:51.359> to<00:00:51.390> talk<00:00:51.690> about<00:00:51.839> it

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
think about it mean to talk about it

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.259 
think about it mean to talk about it
with<00:00:52.140> people<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.159> discussion<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.089> on

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
with people see some discussion on it on

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.360 
with people see some discussion on it on

punch<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.909> all<00:00:57.059> those<00:00:57.179> all<00:00:57.480> those<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.749> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
punch and all those all those are the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.250 
punch and all those all those are the
forms<00:00:58.109> around<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.589> best<00:00:58.829> forms<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.370> well<00:00:59.399> and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
forms around your best forms as well and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.500 
forms around your best forms as well and
and<00:01:01.260> yeah<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.429> then<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.210> look<00:01:03.390> at

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
and yeah and then and then just look at

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.610 
and yeah and then and then just look at
the<00:01:03.569> options<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.170> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
the options and see which is the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.899 
the options and see which is the
smartest<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.370> think<00:01:05.580> if<00:01:05.670> we're<00:01:05.820> just

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
smartest and I think if we're just

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.100 
smartest and I think if we're just
honest<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.420> what<00:01:06.720> we're<00:01:06.870> trying<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
honest about what we're trying to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
honest about what we're trying to
achieve<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.860> what<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
achieve you know what we really want to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.150 
achieve you know what we really want to
achieve<00:01:08.910> as<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> limited<00:01:09.840> initial<00:01:10.680> pull<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
achieve as a limited initial pull of

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.360 
achieve as a limited initial pull of
those<00:01:11.370> of<00:01:11.700> those<00:01:12.060> people<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.280> know

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
those of those people and you know

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.420 
those of those people and you know
reward<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.000> people<00:01:15.180> who<00:01:16.070> really<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.220> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
reward the people who really want to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.480 
reward the people who really want to
participate<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> project<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
participate in the project and I think

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.390 
participate in the project and I think
when<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.610> open<00:01:21.000> out<00:01:21.120> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.660> full-scale<00:01:22.470> alpha

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
when we open out to the full-scale alpha

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.000 
when we open out to the full-scale alpha
you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.300> that's<00:01:25.080> definitely<00:01:25.740> when

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
you know that's that's definitely when

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.410 
you know that's that's definitely when
we'll<00:01:26.190> be<00:01:26.310> releasing<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.270> low

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
we'll be releasing with it very low

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
we'll be releasing with it very low
price<00:01:27.630> point<00:01:27.690> I<00:01:28.080> don't<00:01:28.440> think<00:01:28.650> we're<00:01:28.950> not

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
price point I don't think we're not

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
price point I don't think we're not
we're<00:01:29.730> not<00:01:29.760> far<00:01:30.060> away<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.600> basically

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
we're not far away from that basically

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.960 
we're not far away from that basically
once<00:01:31.440> we've<00:01:31.740> done<00:01:32.370> a<00:01:32.430> server<00:01:32.730> client

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
once we've done a server client

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480 
once we've done a server client
architecture<00:01:33.720> will<00:01:34.230> do<00:01:34.410> an<00:01:34.530> initial<00:01:34.830> batch<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
architecture will do an initial batch of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.750 
architecture will do an initial batch of
keys<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:37.500> confirm<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.160> the<00:01:38.280> central<00:01:38.610> server

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
keys to confirm that the central server

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.090 
keys to confirm that the central server
can<00:01:39.120> handle<00:01:39.570> large-scale<00:01:40.080> demand<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.920> then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
can handle large-scale demand and then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.580 
can handle large-scale demand and then
we'll<00:01:41.250> just<00:01:41.370> turn<00:01:41.550> her<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:43.500> know

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
we'll just turn her on so you know

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.470

architect<00:01:48.060> i<00:01:48.360> really<00:01:48.690> liked<00:01:48.900> how<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> could

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
architect i really liked how you could

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.520 
architect i really liked how you could
you<00:01:50.040> know<00:01:50.160> name<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> inmate<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.200> stuff<00:01:52.380> like

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you know name and inmate and stuff like

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
you know name and inmate and stuff like
that<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.180> we're<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.480> at<00:01:54.600> options

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
that so we're going to look at options

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.870 
that so we're going to look at options
like<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.830> that's<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.850> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
like that and i think that's the kind of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.310 
like that and i think that's the kind of
stuff<00:01:56.970> we'll<00:01:57.210> talk<00:01:57.330> about<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.990> reddit

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
give out keys as we have servers to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.849 
give out keys as we have servers to
adequately<00:03:20.909> connect<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:21.720> them<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.049> i<00:03:22.259> think

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
adequately connect to them I i think

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.219 
adequately connect to them I i think
that<00:03:23.040> people<00:03:23.220> are<00:03:23.879> allowed<00:03:24.389> an<00:03:24.780> expectation

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:25.229 
that people are allowed an expectation

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.599 
that people are allowed an expectation
that<00:03:25.620> they're<00:03:25.859> going<00:03:25.949> to<00:03:26.040> be<00:03:26.129> able<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.370> play<00:03:26.519> a

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
that they're going to be able to play a

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.879 
that they're going to be able to play a
game<00:03:26.759> when<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.269> sell<00:03:27.509> it<00:03:27.659> so<00:03:28.199> I<00:03:28.229> think<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.739> we

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
game when you sell it so I think that we

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.219 
game when you sell it so I think that we
have<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.370> absolutely<00:03:29.790> everything<00:03:30.239> in<00:03:30.900> our

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
have to do absolutely everything in our

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.039 
have to do absolutely everything in our
ability<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.739> ensure<00:03:32.189> that<00:03:32.220> happens<00:03:33.049> and

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
ability to ensure that happens and

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.189 
ability to ensure that happens and
saying<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:35.009> people<00:03:35.189> at<00:03:35.609> may<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.329> you<00:03:36.629> know<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
saying to people at may not you know it

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.869 
saying to people at may not you know it
may<00:03:37.439> not<00:03:37.470> happen<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:38.040> mean<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:38.189> guess<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.639> an

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
may not happen I mean I guess it is an

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.689 
may not happen I mean I guess it is an
alpha<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.540> however<00:03:40.109> we<00:03:40.349> release<00:03:41.159> it<00:03:41.400> when<00:03:41.549> you

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
alpha and however we release it when you

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.309 
alpha and however we release it when you
buy<00:03:41.909> it<00:03:41.939> it's<00:03:42.299> going<00:03:42.479> to<00:03:42.569> have<00:03:42.780> warnings

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
buy it it's going to have warnings

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.839 
buy it it's going to have warnings
printed<00:03:43.739> everywhere<00:03:44.189> you<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.430> kind<00:03:44.609> of<00:03:44.639> do

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
printed everywhere you know kind of do

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.939 
printed everywhere you know kind of do
not<00:03:45.030> buy<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:45.359> game<00:03:45.750> particularly<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:46.919> a

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
not buy this game particularly for a

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.280 
not buy this game particularly for a
start<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.879> I<00:03:47.909> think<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.449> we've<00:03:48.930> got<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.139> lot

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
start but I think that we've got a lot

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.170 
start but I think that we've got a lot
of<00:03:49.319> experience<00:03:49.859> from<00:03:50.009> the<00:03:50.189> dayz<00:03:50.370> mod<00:03:50.699> in<00:03:50.909> terms

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
of experience from the dayz mod in terms

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.449 
of experience from the dayz mod in terms
of<00:03:51.329> how<00:03:51.780> things<00:03:52.049> didn't<00:03:52.500> work<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:53.009> terms<00:03:53.370> of

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
of how things didn't work in terms of

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.149 
of how things didn't work in terms of
the<00:03:53.579> service<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.269> we<00:03:55.079> should<00:03:55.829> realistically

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
the service so we should realistically

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.580 
the service so we should realistically
be<00:03:56.519> able<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:57.090> solve<00:03:57.689> most<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.259> those<00:03:58.379> issues

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
be able to solve most of those issues

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.309 
be able to solve most of those issues
and<00:03:58.949> we'll<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.189> be<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.459> little<00:03:59.609> things<00:03:59.939> that

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
and we'll just be the little things that

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:07.050 
and we'll just be the little things that
will<00:04:01.319> trip<00:04:01.919> us<00:04:02.040> down

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.120
