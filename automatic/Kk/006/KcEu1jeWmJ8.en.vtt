strike dual action air strike bike pump
and<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.900> way<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.110> gun<00:01:34.380> functions<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.810> pump

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and the way this gun functions is pump

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.359 
and the way this gun functions is pump
it<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.680> pump<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.020> eight<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.380> ten<00:01:40.680> times<00:01:42.079> do

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
it you pump it and eight to ten times do

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.670 
it you pump it and eight to ten times do
actions<00:01:44.369> pretty<00:01:44.729> much<00:01:44.990> 20<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.409> 10

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
actions pretty much 20 if you do 10

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.350 
actions pretty much 20 if you do 10
pumps<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:48.770> don't<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.119> way

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
pumps and I don't know this is way

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.859 
pumps and I don't know this is way
better<00:01:51.570> than<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:52.040> regularly<00:01:53.040> model<00:01:53.939> busby

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
better than a regularly model busby

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.100 
better than a regularly model busby
altima<00:01:55.200> missile<00:01:55.590> blasts<00:01:55.829> because<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:57.540> dual

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
altima missile blasts because this dual

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.770 
altima missile blasts because this dual
action<00:01:58.350> bike<00:01:58.740> pump<00:01:59.009> gives<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.579> different

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
action bike pump gives it a different

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.590 
action bike pump gives it a different
like<00:02:00.780> blast<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> air<00:02:02.070> it's<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.850> 10<00:02:03.360> times

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
like blast of air it's like 10 times

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
like blast of air it's like 10 times
stronger<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:05.369> ranges<00:02:05.759> I've<00:02:05.909> been

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
stronger and the ranges I've been

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.999 
stronger and the ranges I've been
getting<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.600> are<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.770> really

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
getting with this are really really

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.480 
getting with this are really really
consistent<00:02:08.700> between<00:02:10.190> 195<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.700> 200<00:02:12.209> feet

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
consistent between 195 to 200 feet

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.860 
consistent between 195 to 200 feet
and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:14.020> might<00:02:14.320> do<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> range<00:02:14.830> test<00:02:15.130> video<00:02:15.400> later

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and I might do a range test video later

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.840 
and I might do a range test video later
anyways<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:18.130> gun<00:02:18.520> also<00:02:19.000> cannot<00:02:19.960> use<00:02:20.260> clips

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
anyways this gun also cannot use clips

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.460 
anyways this gun also cannot use clips
because<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.270> single<00:02:22.630> gun<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.290> put<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
because it's a single gun you can put a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.180 
because it's a single gun you can put a
hopper<00:02:23.920> in<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.220> or<00:02:24.820> RF<00:02:25.390> TV<00:02:25.720> clip<00:02:25.990> but<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.710> CPVC

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.910 
hopper in it or RF TV clip but the CPVC
barrel<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.880> runs<00:02:28.540> down<00:02:28.900> all<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.320> way<00:02:29.440> into

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
barrel just runs down all the way into

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.440 
barrel just runs down all the way into
the<00:02:30.220> coupler<00:02:30.640> which<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.940> about<00:02:31.150> right<00:02:31.390> here<00:02:33.450> my

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
the coupler which is about right here my

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.110 
the coupler which is about right here my
friend<00:02:34.720> gave<00:02:34.870> me<00:02:34.930> her<00:02:35.350> since<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.890> cut<00:02:36.190> too<00:02:36.850> big

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
friend gave me her since I cut too big

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.630
