00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.480
 in 1 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.970
 why do you need to run safe 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.070
 safe mode recommended 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.949
 run windows 8 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.199
 and indeed suddenly other Mercs minus 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.390
 in order to debug the system after 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.859
 some kind of failure failing as a rule 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.680
 it happens after a virus attack 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.140
 when windows doesn't boot or 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.760
 loading inadequately 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.680
 does not work correctly in this case 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.410
 it is recommended to start safe mode 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.579

 shut down or restart computer 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.469
 and the moment it reboots and 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.460
 still the operating system did not have time 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.710
