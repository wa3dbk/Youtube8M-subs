00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:09.639
 yesterday's day 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.979
 admittedly 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.369
 According to Rotterdam, people can often stand up to it 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.019
 Baker is the other 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.019
 high fidelity of state 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.830
 certainly albin trading floors certainly with non anti trading floor ali was ultimately 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.100
 knew 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.960
 biggest game of the year 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.790
 for me yes if that it is just how saif and they have at the e3 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.960
 announced the first saw the first game spot there first explain 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.520
 that whole full of info 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.699
 without being too happy I can't but there are still learning 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.870
 I play tennis I play a week 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.220
 well i know for sure as in the first part 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.910
 from then there is still a heel judgment through you then very hard carnival 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.250
 watch 8 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.040
 yes i had i was honestly saying a bit scared because i found fallout 3 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.390
 very good and I was very curious how they would go over that yes 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.000
 almost a number of parts will be a whole fall story you know 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.229
 the world goes on 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.020
 these can fall and there is a purpose built 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.490
 now the world is being thrown in and you have to do something 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.840
 I was wondering if it is going to be 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.080
 and expanded 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.820
 m i have to say for sure with this beck story the new growing carillonneur is already 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 200 years 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 yes how we don't know but 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.229
 is helped forward in time 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.310
 i'm walking yeah but about one thing i'm doing 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 seen a bit like such images seen about 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.140
 2 karting we have seen very well about the perpetrator the story itself 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.770
 continuation 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.410
 but could, just like the underrated child and belong there 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.980
 15 10 db of being seen as a little fat it is very strange you have 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.690
 because 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.030
 what become very clear now it is over 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.990
 they are not just many different types of weapons 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.230
 but it is also all very necessary 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.550
 every year the enemy asked for a different weapon yes and so 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.179
 I also like betting when I mainly play 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.309
 I always have a certain way to play 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.389
 The time specials I see always have a certain way in it 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.319
 I want callers to keep them too much longer 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.319
 I am in contrast to you you say the real life 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.579
 the tournament is going to win 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.529
 and I prefer 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.559
 baarn with you that sometimes i play the same way and also 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.699
 people who in the same way playroom cannot become a donor 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.569
 and I have the idea that this tweet incident is going to get a bit out of you 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.530
 Coulibaly is going to offer the options to make it easy in another way 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.339
 For example, we saw through a story 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:44.209
 for the competitions where normally only two men were taken 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.689
 if you look at weapons everyone has to be a bit and not everyone is 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:49.699
 of the doubt 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.689
 can be very easy the right story I bakuba product available 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.699
 after the attack 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.919
 it is really cool but with that you may not always come with the same weapons 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.629
 supply lawyers for example so that you are in the area 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.369
 sometimes find weapons that have already been modified 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:07.329
 leave them but what maybe it is now time to see what happens to that 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.149
 Others 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.549
 wanted to say that in very disappointing, for example, you do one of those 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.029
 candle to 2 that song then from enemies to both in an email from it or racist 

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:19.979
 out if you are always spoiled with a bus to driver sailing and you are a whole 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:23.049
 nice place but the one about bullying but the house 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.159
 maybe you grab that also china and ramires 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.879
 I think they even have to use them because there are situations in which 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.540
 staying the muzzle on a local yet the car could not just take away 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.650
 it is very cool to see that the bomb in the debate is still seeing that 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.319
 enemies nowadays 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.579
 also just a little bit more anp 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.269
 if you look at the 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.110
 we have well-known pharaoh carbon yes also where is all that four times the price 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.249
 they've been around for a long time 

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.019
 Now, for example, you also saw that the goalkeeper was no longer just the goalkeeper 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.680
 but some also don't just die if you have taken another one yes that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.870
 means that you will have to indicate each water in a different way 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.079
 super cool to see 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.129
 so basically what I hear the general trend is a little Schiphol 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.609
 all that win to much more variety acclaimed job opportunities 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.629
 always been in full map every the best game actually 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.220
 az is seriously actually listing shows you more of how you actually are 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.410
 do all the service in the inside and trinidad through the fog with it on it 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.109
 so also 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.229
 One cannot tackle another because it is now standard individuals 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.280
 works at any given fall atmosphere makes it very easy for you to get one 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.689
 Another way to go at NAC did at least out of games that is best 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.380
 that it saves on fear because 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.159
 If the Fallout game is dead, you may already have the same sets 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:39.199
 and now new things start working 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.430
 it's all a bit easier that you can see in the specials 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.129
 contests in which you can assign certain from.de to attributes that is 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:50.860
 nevertheless once so strong with the carried or I have a sites where you 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.150
 more options in the conversation 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.570
 now they already have attacks 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.099
 the market is standing still 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.240
 and you can now sjÃ¶stedt a press trip 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.830
 You can also broadcast corps 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.139
 both clubs were always yes but not under part in the specials time 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.139
 some things you can only rage war from his mind 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:13.409
 and that is good in turn its seats so the rtv utrecht 30 does 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.409
 her work 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.279
 peres how many hours do you go for stabbing 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.689
 I know that in fallout 3 I will be closed for about two hundred hours 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.249
 how much suffering you will master 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:39.769
 I think all the seats from 200 euros yes if I heard this so we still go there 

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:43.270
 much further yes the world has every appearance of combining a piece 

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:44.229
 bigger s 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.189
 but also to smell that a second play with being in this part of her 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.249
 predecessor 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:52.879
 and I think that it's about worth a quarter more one of the strongest things 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.610
 but at the first experience it can be that awfully different 

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:59.300
 train you 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.420
 I also want it very important that we can almost do it I want it now 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.020
 but have to wait a while 11 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.629
 November 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.940
 on 4 November 10 November 2015 in advance 4 meta courses 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.350
 the figure for sure
