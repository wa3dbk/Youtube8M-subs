 a new tutorial label tutorials 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.280
 Today again from factory session 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.420
 fashion something and this time the so what 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.660
 we can do it right away 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 now for the first time the crafting recipe 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
 how we do it all 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.740
 we need silva in god for it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 all sorts of things actually go and 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 mark and also the rest 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.520
 Head on what all has so 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.130
 race director Doug Irwin 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.870
 this is now linked to the last one 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.540
 tutorial where that explains everything again 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.940
 where that does not explain that extra 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 So their broadcasting ladder all right then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 I can explain it for a moment 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.020
 charts will be all in that too 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.280
 as I said explained and a knife 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 brick you can do this here and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.170
 Do you have a resigned so then 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.430
 you still need glass panes in the rest 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.559
 which we get here 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 and yes he does then here then 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.330
 silver in god so I take silver in 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.350
 God also cool it silver ingot or 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.270
 the factory session is the same for a god 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.130
 as you say in the beautiful beautiful 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.100
 beautiful beautiful beautiful slack of ace 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.659
 war if you silver silver ore here 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.820
 you do not get there purely as pure 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.650
 byproduct the beautiful thing in the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.299
 In the middle , your rating ladder grabs and then 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 you only need four days left 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.549
 old and already you have a clock 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.310
 I 'm even going to make two 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.060
 then three then four olds how many can 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.649
 because you can still do what you want 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.079
 I am completely satisfied with one 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.500
 so now I've made that out 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.369
 we go in the night you then the door 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.560
 stood open 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.360
 out of my beautiful new wants out 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.890
 Actually, it's all just factor 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.409
 Station area could be said that way 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 Bru that I have my place is 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.780
 is stockduster then lights 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.849
 curiously, that in this light bugs 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.179
 so they are quite good in january 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.040
 lamps here 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.319
 you can use them too but me 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.299
 would not be like that now though 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.989
 could use that very well 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:24.069
 we'll put them here now 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.260
 now watch out so once sees 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.359
 If these particles such as would return 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.139
 the words use these flaming ones 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:35.019
 So they're in there and you see 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:38.739
 it has a very great luminosity 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.269
 and very big radius not just like that 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.620
 but also quite far into the height 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.989
 here where I am now 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:54.700
 You can see that very well if I have the 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:03:00.760
 make out and then we pack up here 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 So she has a lot 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.480
 extensive reach into the deep 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.150
 and I do not see them in the dark 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.280
 that's the beautiful everything is bright 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.979
 lit up and that is up there and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.859
 annoying myself , I'll be on a little day 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.870
 The night does not fall at all 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.310
 if the beautiful black is me 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.479
 think that is a very, very, very, very 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.010
 beautiful travel are very nice idea 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.060
 and yes it was a it all to more 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.370
 is there nothing to say that is 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.109
 so to speak a decoration spot bright 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.819
 and yes if you liked it there 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.389
 a thumbs up when the markets are now 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.139
 do not want to subscribe then subscribed 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:45.489
 we will not miss any case which 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.930
 and I would just say that up there 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.930
