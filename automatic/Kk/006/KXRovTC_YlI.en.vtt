00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 Welcome to the forecast of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.970
 arsenal fc against fc bavaria munich 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.590
 in the Champions League in the eighth finals 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 yes, we are looking at this for now 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.450
 hinspiel lawn at home bavaria are the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.270
 Guests and we are looking at each other here now 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.100
 the initial situation in the last two 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.960
 years ago, the fc departed in the uefa 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.269
 Champions League each in the eighth finals 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.430
 From now on it goes against the FC Bayern 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 Munich and the mistakes of the past 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 should not be repeated if possible 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.020
 in the 2011 finals 2011 12 lost the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.309
 londoner playing the ac milan with 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050
 0 to 4 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.000
 although they tried in the return match 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 once everything was different but with one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 overall result from three to four 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.579
 after all, Bavaria is in three 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.559
 the last four seasons in the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.690
 Quarterfinal recovered and the winner 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 the group f will hope that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.860
 this time again against the second of the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.940
 Group B, yes, she was there 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.399
 FC Schalke 04 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.230
 We will see each other succeed 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.300
 once earlier encounters between 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.460
 arsenal and bavaria 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.920
 Because we have four encounters there 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.280
 in the champions league once with back 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.920
 and second leg in the eighth and with 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
 back and forth in the group stage 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.390
 out of these play against bavaria twice 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 winner 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 arsenal once as winner and once 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.130
 they parted with one 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 draw 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.580
 So it's the question how will it be today 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.290
 run 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 what do you think but just write times 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.530
 comments like it between bavaria and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.210
 Asia is going out here in this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 round and we will now 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.479
 just the same times the gates and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.790
 watch the highlights 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 the first half is in the hands of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.460
 arsenal 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.580
 and here we just see a corner 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.390
 the 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.830
 a little bit warped and meter further 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.070
 next to it there did not have to be new 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.590
 effort next opportunity times of bayern 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.140
 Munich in the 16 minute da dancing there 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 a little bit around Schweinsteiger for 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.890
 sushi fernschuss and the lands unfortunately 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.220
 addition scarce 15 minutes later arsenal 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 a nice chance over here in the outside 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.410
 the center inveigled free in the middle 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.400
 the end of the beautiful chance is today 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.110
 it's already halfway there 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.870
 changed and that is purely robben 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.700
 we'll see him soon, too, and he 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.440
 swaps the place with thomas müller 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.140
 thomas müller should get out first 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.560
 Robben should be pure who knows how useful 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.580
 That's what you think 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.120
 We'll definitely be seeing you for now 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.530
 another chance for bavaria munich 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.180
 Great has now the possibility plays 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.950
 first on mandzukic starting looking 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.010
 quickly back to big and there shoots 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.800
 at the post and purely in the 56 minute 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.900
 toni kroos to 1 0 in the first 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.090
 at half past time he was hazel at the pusher though 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.720
 bavaria in the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.390
 second 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.060
 Shoot the gate again a chance 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.720
 for this aasener they fit a bit 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.140
 back and forth 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.600
 podolski flanks in but then fit 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.590
 on santi cazorla jury 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.730
 he is voted out so far santi and 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.350
 directly into the hands of manuel newer 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.830
 yes still about twenty minutes too 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.130
 play 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.140
 now here on the outside ribery played the 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.730
 pass or flank 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.420
 no, he plays a pass on toni kroos 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.980
 alaba ab on gomez signed the thing 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.350
 Just relax in the 72 minute 2 0 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.770
 two important away goals can arsenal 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:39.720
 there's something else to do 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:43.860
 Djourou has the space and there is the 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.710
 ding offenders shoots the thing 2013 will 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.270
 a winning he tagged in and there are 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.530
 only a few here 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.690
 Bayern has to play again 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.570
 At the end of a possibility but there is 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.870
 the game is already arsenal 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.720
 beaten with 1 2 so the hinspiel 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.820
 can bavaria with two foreign goals 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.310
 quit and of course that's a lot 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.080
 good starting position you believe that 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.300
 game could go something like this 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.390
 for the bavaria now just the 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.220
 comments and we hope so 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.640
 then tonight for the bavaria then quite good 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.739
 running 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.930
 see you next time 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.080
 again making the next forecast 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.080
 Well
