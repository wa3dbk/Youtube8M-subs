00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the information presented in these 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.600
 videos is a reference to use it as 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.589
 complement of more learning 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.970
 exhaustive looks for the experience and 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 wisdom of a technical guide or 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.300
 instructor help us make the mountains 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.300
 more angular 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.380
 Hello friends welcome to another antrum 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.239
 producer y'all we continue with the series of 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.610
 via ferrata today we are going to have fun 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.500
 well we come to the mountain in a group that 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.170
 How can we best enjoy it? 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.910
 we are on a shared land we are going to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.440
 they must take into account in what way 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.750
 we must progress safely 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.269
 taking into account the group both the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.729
 ours as another group groups that 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.470
 can be in the same via ferrata 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:52.239
 for this always when we go to 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.589
 organize our material and prepare 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.900
 the planning for the promotion always 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.610
 waiting area is the place in principle 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.119
 that the supplier has decided that it is 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.369
 safe 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:05.890
 especially because there are stones already 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.780
 we are equipped now we are going right to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.670
 foot of the via ferrata as we should 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 approaching in group in principle 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.450
 we have to assess the possibility of 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.939
 falls of stones always sometimes we 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.380
 will warn either by posters or can 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.170
 be not but always have to be 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.170
 in our mind we will always approach 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.990
 of the form by one by a lateral place 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.840
 and stuck as much as possible to the rock the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.940
 main group will be waiting and we will go 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.000
 entering progress 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.580
 second risk factor to evaluate aimar 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.100
 people the student to via ferrata goes by the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.050
 same vertical makes sistach very 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.250
 important to keep this in mind because 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.500
 all people above 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.050
 we can produce falling stones 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.270
 or some type of carabiner or tool 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.700
 that can carry third and very 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
 important the order in which we have to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.740
 position each of the people in 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.420
 via ferrata the time of progression 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.460
 first the leader and a person must go 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.760
 that can make decisions is to say 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.620
 principles an experienced person at 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.929
 final will also go a person who 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.730
 can make decisions or at least 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.420
 have a good communication with that 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:16.880
 leader and can resolve situations and in 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.520
 In the beginning, people will go 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.530
 less skilled or needing a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.790
 given moment of help or they can make us 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.760
 some question to solve 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.980
 important the communication of the group is 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.000
 a failure to have communication between 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.300
 group components 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 must be notified of the change of 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.150
 fractionation of cable when there is already 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.460
 a lot of autonomy between each of them 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.800
 a simple click carabiner as 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.090
 enough but to keep this 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.850
 communication and that things are done 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.920
 really well you should warn those who 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.940
 they are below that they can already perform 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.910
 the change of stretch 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.720
 how far should we keep in the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.390
 progression as a basic rule always a 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.470
 cable stretch this is measured by each 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.280
 one of the subdivisions that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.500
 we will find 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.600
 it's true that we can find some 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.730
 series of specific situations that we 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.030
 they're going to make it two or three 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.760
 sections and how much should we leave more than one 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.830
 stretch in the progression 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.600
 normally as long as the situation is 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.300
 a lot of verticality and the fall of 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.040
 person above can hit the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.860
 person who is below remember that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.640
 we have an anchor nail of almost 85 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.440
 centimeters and that can also dissipate 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.590
 cushioning and lengthening this more 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.410
 it will have to be taken into account well this is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.209
 a simulation very vertical stretch look 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.920
 what would happen if we are if we leave 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.500
 only a stretch between 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.000
 the first and the second 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.540
 ahead 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.540
 strip 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.790
 my partner could happen in principle 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.690
 we are in different sections we are 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.880
 going up and I would now change 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.109
 I have a fall we are in stretches 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:20.639
 different I wanted 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:23.099
 my loop would take me from reception but 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.909
 I would hit my partner which 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:29.490
 would also cause him to fall into this 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.870
 case the first one should warn this 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.349
 situation 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.099
 and leave two stretches of cable between both 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.099
 that ratists 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:46.280
 ideal or correct situation 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.860
 the partner keeps us going up 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.000
 arrives 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.000
 next section 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.140
 now is how much the partner would have to 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.050
 He is having entered the section in which 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.810
 find more tips regrouping 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.390
 in via ferratas the most important thing or the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.550
 most common failure is to get everyone and follow 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.900
 all anchored in it the same 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.260
 cable stretch 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.930
 you have to try without losing the cable in 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.810
 one part of the anchor side 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.810
 look for alternative anchors in this 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.320
 case they could be the same steps or 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.360
 a descuelgue that we have parallel to him 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.830
 wide areas where we can change 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:33.480
 impressions study what we are missing and 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.480
 know a little bit how is the group 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.900
 good friends we said goodbye remember that 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.370
 everything has been safety advice 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.820
 help us make the mountains more 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.820
 secure
