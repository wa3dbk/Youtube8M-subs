I'm going to talk to you about making a
pinch<00:00:08.670> pot<00:00:09.030> out<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.269> clay<00:00:09.630> without<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.110> kiln<00:00:10.469> so

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
pinch pot out of clay without a kiln so

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.160 
pinch pot out of clay without a kiln so
generally<00:00:12.090> when<00:00:12.210> you're<00:00:12.360> doing<00:00:12.570> ceramics<00:00:13.080> you

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
generally when you're doing ceramics you

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.839 
generally when you're doing ceramics you
want<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> use<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> kiln<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> harden<00:00:14.429> your<00:00:14.580> clay

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
want to use a kiln to harden your clay

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.420 
want to use a kiln to harden your clay
and<00:00:15.150> make<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.839> more<00:00:16.049> durable<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.770> change<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and make it more durable and change the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
and make it more durable and change the
consistency<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.359> make<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.410> more

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
consistency of it make it more

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.179 
consistency of it make it more
water-resistant<00:00:20.340> etc<00:00:20.820> however<00:00:21.480> sometimes<00:00:22.439> at

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
water-resistant etc however sometimes at

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
water-resistant etc however sometimes at
home<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.670> don't<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> kiln<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.840> always

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
home you don't have a kiln like always

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.300 
home you don't have a kiln like always
so<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.660> variety<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.710> things<00:00:28.800> in

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so you can do a variety of things in

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.600 
so you can do a variety of things in
order<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> make<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> pinch<00:00:30.960> pot<00:00:31.199> anyway<00:00:31.619> one

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
order to make a pinch pot anyway one

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.889 
order to make a pinch pot anyway one
thing<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.930> use<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.219> different<00:00:35.730> type<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.450> clay

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
thing is to use a different type of clay

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.549 
thing is to use a different type of clay
called<00:00:37.620> polymer<00:00:38.190> clay<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.750> turn<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
called polymer clay which will turn and

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
called polymer clay which will turn and
it's<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.250> made<00:00:41.460> out<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> like<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
it's just it's made out of like a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.020 
it's just it's made out of like a
plastic<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.770> harden<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.789> oven

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
plastic and will harden in your oven

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
plastic and will harden in your oven
you're<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.079> make<00:00:46.140> sure<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> clean

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
you're gonna want to make sure to clean

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.639 
you're gonna want to make sure to clean
your<00:00:46.890> oven<00:00:47.039> after<00:00:47.399> after<00:00:48.360> baking<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.469> there

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
your oven after after baking it in there

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
your oven after after baking it in there
because<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.129> does<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.940> some<00:00:51.270> chemicals<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
because it does have some chemicals that

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
because it does have some chemicals that
are<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.170> gross<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.890> really

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
are kind of gross and you don't really

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420 
are kind of gross and you don't really
want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.340> eat<00:00:53.520> however<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.199> totally<00:00:55.680> make

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
want to eat however you can totally make

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.819 
want to eat however you can totally make
it<00:00:56.489> at<00:00:56.699> home<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> toaster

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it at home also you can use a toaster

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.709 
it at home also you can use a toaster
oven<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.969> are<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> be

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
oven for it if you are going to be

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
oven for it if you are going to be
making<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.500> these<00:01:01.680> things<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
making a lot of these things you can

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.109 
making a lot of these things you can
probably<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.170> toaster<00:01:05.159> oven<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.939> for

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
probably get a toaster oven just for

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.260 
probably get a toaster oven just for
that<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> wanted<00:01:07.640> alternately<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.970> can

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that if you wanted alternately you can

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
that if you wanted alternately you can
use<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.020> variety<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> other<00:01:10.860> types<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.400> clay<00:01:12.590> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
use a variety of other types of clay to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.060 
use a variety of other types of clay to
make<00:01:14.580> pinch<00:01:15.360> pots<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.990> probably<00:01:16.380> will<00:01:16.920> not

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
make pinch pots they probably will not

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120 
make pinch pots they probably will not
be<00:01:17.340> safe<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> wash<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.509> they<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.960> last<00:01:19.710> for

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
be safe to wash but they will last for

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.780 
be safe to wash but they will last for
instance<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:21.049> your<00:01:22.049> table<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
instance on your table if you want to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.660 
instance on your table if you want to
just<00:01:23.909> display<00:01:24.240> things<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.549> basically<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just display things in it so basically a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
just display things in it so basically a
pinch<00:01:27.030> pot<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.570> very<00:01:28.020> simple<00:01:28.409> pot<00:01:28.619> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
pinch pot is a very simple pot it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.370 
pinch pot is a very simple pot it's
great<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.250> starting<00:01:29.520> out<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:31.259> you're

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
great for starting out and what you're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.080 
great for starting out and what you're
gonna<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.860> first<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.400> you're<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.670> take<00:01:32.970> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
gonna do first is you're gonna take your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.780 
gonna do first is you're gonna take your
clay<00:01:33.329> you're<00:01:33.540> gonna<00:01:33.659> need<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.229> clay

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
clay you're gonna need your clay

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
clay you're gonna need your clay
kneading<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:36.470> just<00:01:37.470> trying<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.920> trying<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
kneading is just trying to trying to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
kneading is just trying to trying to
soften<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> air<00:01:39.990> bubbles<00:01:40.170> out

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
soften it up and get the air bubbles out

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.590 
soften it up and get the air bubbles out
all<00:01:40.979> right<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:42.270> you've<00:01:42.390> done<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
all right so when you've done that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
all right so when you've done that
you're<00:01:43.259> gonna<00:01:43.380> roll<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.710> clay<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> ball

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you're gonna roll your clay into a ball

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.319 
you're gonna roll your clay into a ball
you<00:01:45.259> can<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> whatever<00:01:47.520> size<00:01:47.970> you'd

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
you can do this in whatever size you'd

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.340 
you can do this in whatever size you'd
like<00:01:48.890> if<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.070> using<00:01:50.100> polymer<00:01:50.850> clay<00:01:51.350> keep

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
like if you're using polymer clay keep

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.130 
like if you're using polymer clay keep
it<00:01:52.560> sort<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> thin<00:01:53.820> side<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.659> thicker

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it sort of on the thin side not thicker

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190 
it sort of on the thin side not thicker
than<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.619> inch<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.310> else<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.630> doesn't<00:01:57.899> bake

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
than an inch or else it doesn't bake

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.280 
than an inch or else it doesn't bake
well<00:01:59.360> alright<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:00.390> once<00:02:00.750> you've<00:02:00.899> got<00:02:01.110> your

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
well alright so once you've got your
