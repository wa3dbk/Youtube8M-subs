00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.950
 here we are running afterwards from 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.410
 not even zombies are true 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.740
 started the day and it rains by two 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.630
 days and above all now we must 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 go and recover the fucking simi 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.330
 strange objects that have adverse 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.000
 meanwhile, thousands of zombies chase us 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.010
 everywhere these nice that not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 we don't even know the fucking direction 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.490
 go because as there is no sun not 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 we can orient ourselves slutty fork 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.149
 listen, we have a big problem too 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.350
 because the stuff could disappear after a 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.570
 little what I know 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 I believe it has already disappeared in reality 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.829
 I would not be fatalistic but not a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.989
 school but fucking zombies do 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.320

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.150

 little 0 we should put some cubes of wool 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:28.830
 every once in a while you know how he did pollicino 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.250
 obviously the right wool cubes for 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.750
 maybe maybe maybe we got some 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.990
 Fuck the rain in the alleys 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.640
 combines the perfect rain ok we have 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.369
 we almost did 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:53.070
 I think you think it's here 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.790
 I can honestly say we are at night 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.170
 founded 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.869

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.650
 Sora forgives because the moon rises 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.610
 on the opposite side of the sun we 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.210
 we have to go this way 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.710
 look at bern crickets where he had to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.209
 in reality this thing is completely 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.920
 wrong in reality in minecraft 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:17.430

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.800

 hopping the public they are 7 a 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.270
 that slime knows very well but you know 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.190
 what does this altitude do to us? 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.700
 because they are usually in the dark in the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.410
 caverns though it's all very nice and 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.410
 above all I would like to go up this street 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.580
 let me go up but where we are 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.980
 then we must go here we are 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.730
 going well the right direction I believe 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.440
 I have to kill the hen wait 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.930
 I have to stop on the ground if I can't 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.490
 understand where the moon is the water of 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.950
 shit but without that the moon is there 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.190
 where the moon is setting then the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.780
 sun is about to rise here or the horses 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:37.190
 Holy bitch we could do for horses 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.500
 horses and but we have nothing for 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.590
 attracting them carrots it takes us 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.810
 I had carrots for dinner before freezing 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 in the village we had raided 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.150
 let's go and see the horses we have 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.400
 never seen the eva whore open a seat 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.930
 I took everything in the village 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.950

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:06.629

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.479

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.479
 day 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.500
 look at how many horses I'd say 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.289

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.280

 I can, however, I can't eat myself 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.500
 eating me this had not driven out 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:46.160
 Ugly civilians piece of shit you don't have 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.160
 did nothing to help me 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.419
 I owe them what I saw at dinner 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.729
 from above a skeleton from a position 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.880
 very unfortunate he made a gesture 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.570
 athletic nothing paid homage to the cock 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.570
 damn 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.750

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.750
 stay alive you understand 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:19.610
 sanchez is reborn and I arrived 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:23.300
 I don't know where I know where and I think 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.210
 we were lost forever even then 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.100

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:32.180

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:35.320
 here you guys excuse us for these 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.320
 continuous failures 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:46.100
 but let's start with the blasphemy notes 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:48.770

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.340

 there is nothing to do and brown in your pocket as well 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.250

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.330
 take it Italian and don't need it 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.330

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.240

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.580

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.110

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.039

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.669
