together I've told them they'll be very
honestly<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.759> any<00:01:27.420> she<00:01:27.479> had<00:01:27.659> some<00:01:27.869> ghost

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
honestly I think any she had some ghost

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
honestly I think any she had some ghost
his<00:01:28.409> game<00:01:28.619> he<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> good<00:01:29.549> finisher<00:01:30.060> when<00:01:30.930> he

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
his game he has a good finisher when he

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.539 
his game he has a good finisher when he
gets<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> front<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.530> goal<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.009> he's<00:01:32.189> he's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549

taking<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.060> positions<00:01:33.509> needs<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.780> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
taking out of positions needs to be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
taking out of positions needs to be
