00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
these other controls to jump to run I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.530 
these other controls to jump to run I
can<00:03:36.280> press<00:03:36.489> this<00:03:36.700> one<00:03:36.909> here<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.269> get<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.480> the

see that some of the controls in the
side<00:03:43.629> here<00:03:43.959> have<00:03:44.049> changed<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:45.730> can<00:03:45.969> begin

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
side here have changed and I can begin

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.990 
side here have changed and I can begin
driving<00:03:46.599> with<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.019> accelerator<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:48.069> can<00:03:48.849> go

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
driving with the accelerator I can go

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.199 
driving with the accelerator I can go
left<00:03:49.269> or<00:03:49.450> right<00:03:49.510> using<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.319> controls<00:03:50.739> on<00:03:51.209> the

left or right using the controls on the
left<00:03:52.450> hand<00:03:52.989> side<00:03:53.170> of<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:54.099> screen<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.480> let's

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
left hand side of the screen so let's

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:11.270 
left hand side of the screen so let's
try<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.659> do<00:03:58.659> this

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.550 

okay<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.150> not<00:04:12.480> very<00:04:12.540> good<00:04:12.930> there<00:04:13.140> but<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.380> can

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
okay so not very good there but you can

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.690 
okay so not very good there but you can
get<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.580> idea<00:04:15.560> and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.769> can<00:04:17.010> then<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.639> out

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
get the idea and then I can then get out

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.210 
get the idea and then I can then get out
the<00:04:18.000> car<00:04:21.260> that's<00:04:22.260> right<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.650> wants<00:04:22.860> me<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.070> get

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the car that's right it wants me to get

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.180 
the car that's right it wants me to get
back<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.790> car<00:04:24.380> but<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.470> get<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.680> idea<00:04:25.800> i

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
back in the car but you get the idea i

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.240 
back in the car but you get the idea i
can<00:04:28.490> move<00:04:29.490> around<00:04:29.900> I've<00:04:30.900> got<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.680> map<00:04:31.919> in<00:04:32.190> the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
can move around I've got the map in the

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.720 
can move around I've got the map in the
top<00:04:33.060> corner<00:04:33.330> here<00:04:33.750> as<00:04:34.500> well<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:35.070> that's<00:04:35.400> poor

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
top corner here as well so that's poor

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.180 
top corner here as well so that's poor
important<00:04:36.330> for<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.540> gameplay<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:38.010> if<00:04:38.100> i<00:04:38.160> go

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
important for the gameplay so if i go

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.620 
important for the gameplay so if i go
back<00:04:38.340> i<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.910> get<00:04:39.060> in<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.210> car<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:42.389> image

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
back i can get in the car the image

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.659 
back i can get in the car the image
looks<00:04:42.660> pixelated<00:04:43.350> on<00:04:43.830> screen<00:04:44.220> battery<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.640> my

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
looks pixelated on screen battery on my

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.760 
looks pixelated on screen battery on my
arc<00:04:44.970> it's<00:04:45.330> actually<00:04:45.780> fairly<00:04:46.020> crisp<00:04:46.590> and

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
arc it's actually fairly crisp and

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.560 
arc it's actually fairly crisp and
that's<00:04:46.950> all<00:04:47.130> going<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.340> be<00:04:47.520> affected<00:04:48.419> by<00:04:48.510> the

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
that's all going to be affected by the

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.560 
that's all going to be affected by the
resolution<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.320> your<00:04:49.380> display<00:04:50.040> and<00:04:50.570> the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
resolution of your display and the

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:03.110 
resolution of your display and the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.320 

so<00:05:03.990> I<00:05:04.050> can<00:05:04.290> zoom<00:05:04.530> in<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:04.830> change<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.030> camera

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
so I can zoom in and change the camera

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.310 
so I can zoom in and change the camera
angles<00:05:06.840> here<00:05:07.820> to<00:05:08.820> whichever<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.449> prefer<00:05:12.320> not

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
angles here to whichever you prefer not

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.770 
angles here to whichever you prefer not
sure<00:05:13.470> if<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.680> hear<00:05:13.800> that<00:05:14.360> I've<00:05:15.360> got<00:05:15.660> the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
sure if you can hear that I've got the
