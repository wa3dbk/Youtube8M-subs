00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
my next virtual reality headset kind of

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.490 
my next virtual reality headset kind of
upgrade<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.960> bet<00:00:07.109> you're<00:00:07.230> thinking<00:00:07.440> about

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
upgrade and I bet you're thinking about

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.200 
upgrade and I bet you're thinking about
now<00:00:07.740> why<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.340> looking<00:00:08.550> at<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> picture<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
now why are we looking at a picture of a

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.959 
now why are we looking at a picture of a
dinosaur<00:00:09.660> well<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.800> why<00:00:10.950> um<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.670> next

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
dinosaur well this is why um the next

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.730 
dinosaur well this is why um the next
version<00:00:12.210> kind<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.929> makes<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.200> look<00:00:13.440> like<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
version kind of makes you look like a

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.289 
version kind of makes you look like a
Paris<00:00:14.309> or<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.610> think<00:00:14.700> that's<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.210> that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
Paris or I think that's what that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.150 
Paris or I think that's what that
dinosaurs<00:00:15.690> call<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:15.929> least<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.680> gives<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
dinosaurs call at least it gives you

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.070 
dinosaurs call at least it gives you
kind<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> horn<00:00:17.730> look<00:00:17.940> but<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
kind of horn look but it is actually a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.510 
kind of horn look but it is actually a
very<00:00:19.230> nice<00:00:19.470> design<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.100> we've<00:00:20.220> done<00:00:20.400> is

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
very nice design what we've done is

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.250 
very nice design what we've done is
we've<00:00:20.670> moved<00:00:20.939> away<00:00:21.090> from<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.449> LED<00:00:21.779> model<00:00:22.109> and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
we've moved away from the LED model and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.830 
we've moved away from the LED model and
move<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> gyroscopic<00:00:23.609> mouse<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.720> we're

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
move to a gyroscopic mouse so we're

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.599 
move to a gyroscopic mouse so we're
still<00:00:25.109> using<00:00:25.260> mouse<00:00:25.529> control<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.070> control<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
still using mouse control to control the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.279 
still using mouse control to control the
virtual<00:00:26.910> reality<00:00:27.390> which<00:00:27.779> has<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> lot<00:00:28.260> of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
virtual reality which has a lot of

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
virtual reality which has a lot of
upsides<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.800> lot<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:28.980> downsides<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.699> it's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
upsides a lot of downsides as well it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.330 
upsides a lot of downsides as well it's
compatible<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.960> games<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.560> it's

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
compatible with a lot of games but it's

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.540 
compatible with a lot of games but it's
not<00:00:32.550> as<00:00:32.759> virtual<00:00:33.300> reality<00:00:34.290> sq<00:00:35.040> can't<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.309> role

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
not as virtual reality sq can't do role

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
not as virtual reality sq can't do role
and<00:00:35.790> stuff<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.649> see

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and stuff like that and here you see

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
and stuff like that and here you see
exactly<00:00:38.579> how<00:00:38.790> responsive<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.690> much

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
exactly how responsive it is it's much

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.680 
exactly how responsive it is it's much
much<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.559> responsive<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.430> almost<00:00:42.030> every<00:00:42.660> way

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
much more responsive in almost every way

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
much more responsive in almost every way
this<00:00:43.320> specific<00:00:43.860> gyroscopic<00:00:44.370> mouse<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.730> i'm

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
this specific gyroscopic mouse that i'm

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
this specific gyroscopic mouse that i'm
using<00:00:44.910> costs<00:00:45.329> twenty<00:00:45.750> dollars<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.230> amazon

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
using costs twenty dollars on amazon

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.990 
using costs twenty dollars on amazon
i'll<00:00:46.920> link<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.399> description<00:00:47.489> down

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
i'll link it in the description down

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.510 
i'll link it in the description down
below<00:00:48.120> go<00:00:48.420> check<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.829> very

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
below go check that out it is very

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.479 
below go check that out it is very
pretty<00:00:51.059> very<00:00:51.270> cheap<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.690> mean<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.230> LED<00:00:52.559> concept

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
pretty very cheap i mean the LED concept

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.200 
pretty very cheap i mean the LED concept
that<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> were<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.059> build

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that you were going to have to build

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
that you were going to have to build
before<00:00:54.510> was<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> cost<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.350> somewhere

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
before was going to cost you somewhere

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
before was going to cost you somewhere
between<00:00:55.829> may<00:00:56.160> five<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.610> ten<00:00:56.730> dollars<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.480> this

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
between may five and ten dollars so this

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.819 
between may five and ten dollars so this
is<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.840> ten<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.140> fifteen<00:00:58.440> dollars<00:00:58.680> more

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
is about ten or fifteen dollars more

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
is about ten or fifteen dollars more
expensive<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.370> old<00:00:59.609> version<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
expensive than the old version but it is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.630 
expensive than the old version but it is
significantly<00:01:01.710> better<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> lot<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
significantly better it has a lot of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.160 
significantly better it has a lot of
advantages<00:01:03.120> first<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.750> easier<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
advantages first off it's easier to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.800 
advantages first off it's easier to
install<00:01:04.439> less<00:01:05.250> lag<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.030> wireless<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.689> can

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
install less lag it's wireless you can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.969 
install less lag it's wireless you can
play<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.140> another<00:01:07.350> room<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.830> head

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
play it in another room with head

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
play it in another room with head
tracking<00:01:08.280> there's<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.420> easier<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
tracking there's just it's easier to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
tracking there's just it's easier to
install<00:01:10.049> all<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:10.650> around<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.310> lot

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
install all the way around it's a lot

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
install all the way around it's a lot
better<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> reason<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.200> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
better now the reason we have it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.480 
better now the reason we have it
sticking<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
sticking up the back like that is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.770 
sticking up the back like that is
because<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.909> does<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
because this does have to have the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
because this does have to have the
orientation<00:01:16.500> such<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> front<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.970> at<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
orientation such as the front is at the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.060 
orientation such as the front is at the
front<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.659> can't<00:01:18.930> turn<00:01:19.080> outside<00:01:19.590> or

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
front you can't turn outside or

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
front you can't turn outside or
vertically<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:20.909> anything<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
vertically or anything like that and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.120 
vertically or anything like that and
this<00:01:21.960> allows<00:01:22.229> us<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.439> actually<00:01:22.619> get<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> very

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this allows us to actually get a very

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
this allows us to actually get a very
good<00:01:23.189> weight<00:01:23.909> balance<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.110> reason

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
good weight balance so that's the reason

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.010 
good weight balance so that's the reason

can<00:03:04.540> actually<00:03:04.660> go<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.290> find<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.560> instructions

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
can actually go to find the instructions

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.039 
can actually go to find the instructions
to<00:03:06.220> make<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.700> one<00:03:06.849> that<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.060> made<00:03:07.360> it's<00:03:07.900> very

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
to make the one that I made it's very

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.990 
to make the one that I made it's very
easy<00:03:08.260> to<00:03:08.410> make<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.829> this<00:03:09.220> whole<00:03:09.430> project<00:03:09.640> if

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
easy to make and this whole project if

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.910 
easy to make and this whole project if
you<00:03:10.030> do<00:03:10.360> build<00:03:11.049> it<00:03:11.230> yourself<00:03:11.410> from<00:03:11.829> the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
you do build it yourself from the

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.400 
you do build it yourself from the
scratch<00:03:12.190> you're<00:03:12.940> looking<00:03:13.299> probably<00:03:13.720> at

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
scratch you're looking probably at

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.830 
scratch you're looking probably at
twenty-five<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.370> fifty<00:03:15.489> dollars<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.510> if<00:03:16.780> you

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
twenty-five to fifty dollars and if you

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.690 
twenty-five to fifty dollars and if you
go<00:03:16.959> ahead<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.139> go<00:03:17.260> thither<00:03:17.440> ovis<00:03:17.829> dive<00:03:18.130> you're

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
go ahead and go thither ovis dive you're

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.099 
go ahead and go thither ovis dive you're
looking<00:03:19.090> at<00:03:19.269> I<00:03:19.389> think<00:03:19.600> what<00:03:19.870> would<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.049> be

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
looking at I think what would that be

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.970 
looking at I think what would that be
$90<00:03:20.920> or<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:21.389> very<00:03:22.389> fun<00:03:22.600> project<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
$90 or so very fun project this is the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.729 
$90 or so very fun project this is the
what<00:03:24.250> really<00:03:25.019> finishes<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.139> off<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.470> think<00:03:26.650> the

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
what really finishes it off I think the

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.860 
what really finishes it off I think the
LED<00:03:27.040> models<00:03:27.340> were<00:03:27.430> okay<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:28.180> this<00:03:28.420> is<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> way

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
LED models were okay but this is the way

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.199 
LED models were okay but this is the way
that<00:03:29.019> it<00:03:29.170> was<00:03:29.260> meant<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.650> be<00:03:29.709> done<00:03:30.069> we're<00:03:31.000> still

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
that it was meant to be done we're still

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.089 
that it was meant to be done we're still
using<00:03:31.480> tried<00:03:32.019> f.3d<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.739> lot<00:03:32.920> of<00:03:32.950> our

and some other oculus rift games we are

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.809 
and some other oculus rift games we are
using<00:03:38.680> mouse<00:03:38.920> control<00:03:39.370> which<00:03:39.519> again<00:03:39.760> doesn't

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
using mouse control which again doesn't

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.120 
using mouse control which again doesn't
give<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.269> positional<00:03:41.019> tracking<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.560> doesn't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
give you positional tracking and doesn't

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.159 
give you positional tracking and doesn't
give<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.400> roll<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.329> you're<00:03:43.569> only<00:03:43.750> getting<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
give you roll so you're only getting the

give you roll so you're only getting the
up-down<00:03:44.590> left-right<00:03:44.700> movement<00:03:45.700> but<00:03:46.450> again

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
up-down left-right movement but again

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.330 
up-down left-right movement but again
it's<00:03:47.079> compatible<00:03:47.440> with<00:03:47.650> almost<00:03:47.919> all<00:03:48.069> games

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
it's compatible with almost all games

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.220 
it's compatible with almost all games
and<00:03:48.579> it's<00:03:48.849> much<00:03:49.090> much<00:03:49.299> much<00:03:49.540> cheaper<00:03:49.599> than

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
and it's much much much cheaper than

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.720 
and it's much much much cheaper than
getting<00:03:50.319> something<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.799> an<00:03:50.919> oculus<00:03:51.280> rift<00:03:51.519> I
