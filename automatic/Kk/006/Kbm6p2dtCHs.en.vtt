 ends up with some new information and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.649
 also knowing a new mode map 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 multiplayer everyone already has some 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 map images we do not have and player 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
 even though the staff were still there 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 play but no gameplay left in the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.430
 youtube still sure this flu you are 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.039
 background is also of the event is the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 and intel that was present in the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 event this morning on the map wants to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.510
 which was one of the maps revealed in the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 in the gamestop exposed I'm not mistaken 7 was 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.299
 at the same time he reveals the way 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 beautiful game that the one you enter 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.960
 in portals and such I do not think it's enough 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 bringing you a gameplay here in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 channel on this map 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 so if you do not know the map of 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.130
 a look it looks like a pretty big map 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.420
 It's quite interesting. I liked it. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.430
 quite and I remember even a little 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.439
 Archer w3 I do not know if you will 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.479
 agree with me but anyway this is a 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.840
 break and the new map that was announced 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.030
 The bigger the gamer is an ok raven pistol that 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.119
 it was a boy who already showed up at 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 multiplayer trailer and must remember 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.560
 from that in that part is the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.320
 Grein, that's where everybody's falling. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.180
 I never opened right when you start 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.500
 talk about the maps you'll remember and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.130
 seeing the images as well you should 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 remember 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.070
 then it happens basically it's next 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.780
 to the right coastal castle and the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.490
 reason why it has so far understood the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.770
 people will power both have replay inside 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 the castle and on the outside also 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.520
 sure to have a brief description here that the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.930
 infinity ward dropped on the map I 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 I'll tell you what we understand. 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.829
 a little better how it's going to work 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.810
 is the following opens quotation marks is a large 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.569
 with the coastal castle and a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.300
 which can be downloaded to 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.800
 change the routes of the player next to this 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.080
 the map also has a maze 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.910
 external fortification ruins and a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.740
 weathervane with all these events 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.980
 both long range weapons 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.870
 how close kors will prevail 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.580
 follows then according to the finitude itself is 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.690
 a work that will be useful both for 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.190
 who likes long range weapons 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.090
 point for those who like short weapons 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.920
 reach 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.060
 in fact this is a characteristic 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.070
 ritual is promising for the great 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.500
 Most maps of the vault goals that 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.910
 all maps will be good 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.650
 enough for you to use any 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.090
 kind of weapon you want it to be a 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.860
 thing that we ended up losing a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.620
 A little over the years, right? 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.170
 especially w3 here is both 3 4 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
 billion have had many maps with great 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.290
 it prevailed a lot, let's see if it 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.900
 stock conversation we can have 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.130
 a change in this direction there and beyond 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.750
 multiplayer mode people also had 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.900
 some little things revealed about the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.090
 the right game campaign this was in a 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.070
 given interview is for me the game by 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.330
 tina palace that is more 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.500
 responsible for the part of the 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.480
 multiplayer but is also involved 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.830
 with the right single player and a 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.030
 interview came to say a little more 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.520
 on the issue that they are wanting 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.640
 campaign or the phases of the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.580
 campaign but open is wider know 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.440
 less so we say linear and in a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.540
 interview she said the following opens 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.070
 was important to the team of 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.450
 design take into account all feedback 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.550
 that we receive from our projects 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.020
 where some people even earlier 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.209
 they said they felt just as if they 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.380
 were walking straight in 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.060
 no corridor 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.739
 so we decided to add a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.470
 variety in terms of how you 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.450
 Do you feel when you're playing the game? 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.280
 one thing I can already do is that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 You'll meet in one or two. 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.330
 missions where we will not talk to 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.800
 where you do not feel like 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.630
 there was a way to always follow 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.040
 completely lost 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.530
 we also want to add 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.150
 more sneaky missions but at any 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.070
 players do not want to 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.830
 stealth they can leave it to 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.620
 side and advance like crazy date 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.170
 right quotes so basically not the ones 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.450
 mass player campaigns 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.920
 the lessons of the single campaigns 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.350
 I said the truth is that saying the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.750
 single player campaign missions 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.910
 they will be less linear at least 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.410
 some of them local sheltered we will not 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.480
 lose a little focus type go 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.250
 punctuate but I do not know who rescues I do not know 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.020
 What it involves knows this is one thing that 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.400
 there's always been a lot of theory 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.730
 that you took it a little bit with the 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.230
 campaign in box 2 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.730
 and it looks like the infinity ward wants to follow 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.860
 the same way take some time off 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.110
 age the code campaign 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.690
 of fps in general always presented a certain 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.250
 and more is this is this out were the 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.810
 news that we have had so far under 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.220
 heat of goals in eurogamer any 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.170
 another novelty I bring to you 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.360
 From this month now and October should 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.740
 start getting out more things goes 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.300
 be present at bgs 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.010
 I do not know if they will bring a new map 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.240
 only for bgs because they have done this 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.190
 it is not every event that they are leading the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.260
 game I think I do not think I chose 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.120
 will be basically five maps that until 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.350
 now the three that were revealed in the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.780
 multiplayer event 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.550
 The case now and I'm revived but anyway 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.140
 but that's the end of the company I hope 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.610
 have enjoyed it if you liked do not want 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.680
 leave the mobile if your favorite and I 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.340
 I'm going to stay here a hug to everyone 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.340
 stay with god and it's even more
