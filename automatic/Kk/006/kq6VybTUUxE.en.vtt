00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
strategies and just trying to tread

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.550 
strategies and just trying to tread
water<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> 4400<00:01:06.150> range<00:01:06.720> right<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.049> until

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
water on the 4400 range right now until

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.280 
water on the 4400 range right now until
the<00:01:08.100> higher<00:01:08.750> Champions<00:01:09.750> League<00:01:09.840> rather<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the higher Champions League rather it

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.469 
the higher Champions League rather it
gets<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.650> populated<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.240> here

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
gets more populated so you can see here

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
gets more populated so you can see here
the<00:01:12.600> idea<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.979> could<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.400> kitchen

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the idea is it's could really a kitchen

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.880 
the idea is it's could really a kitchen
sink<00:01:15.240> type<00:01:15.570> strategy<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> i<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> 3

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
sink type strategy right so i have 3

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
sink type strategy right so i have 3
golems<00:01:17.070> i<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> pecka<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> don't

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
golems i have a pecka what you don't

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.170 
golems i have a pecka what you don't
usually<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> lune<00:01:20.100> obviously<00:01:20.759> but

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
usually see and go I lune obviously but

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.359 
usually see and go I lune obviously but
the<00:01:21.270> idea<00:01:21.600> here<00:01:21.869> isn't<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.380> 3<00:01:22.680> stars<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the idea here isn't to get 3 stars it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.590 
the idea here isn't to get 3 stars it's
more<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.790> get<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.420> time

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
more to get because you don't have time

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
more to get because you don't have time
to<00:01:24.750> plan<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.140> bases<00:01:25.500> obviously<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.070> pushing

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to plan for bases obviously when pushing

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.399 
to plan for bases obviously when pushing
and<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.060> think<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> strategy<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:27.960> easily<00:01:28.290> be

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
and I think the strategy could easily be

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.050 
and I think the strategy could easily be
viable<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.950> clan<00:01:29.159> wars<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:29.850> need

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
viable in clan wars where you don't need

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.730 
viable in clan wars where you don't need
the<00:01:30.240> three-star<00:01:30.900> attempts<00:01:31.259> against<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> town

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the three-star attempts against the town

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and my king actually went down by that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.620 
and my king actually went down by that
single<00:01:41.729> target<00:01:42.030> in<00:01:42.090> front<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> little

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
single target in front i was a little

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
single target in front i was a little
late<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> fries<00:01:43.380> fell<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.040> also

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
late on the fries fell there it also

bled<00:01:44.579> through<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.970> Pekka<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> idea<00:01:46.259> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
bled through that Pekka but the idea is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
bled through that Pekka but the idea is
to<00:01:46.740> rotate<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.420> basically<00:01:49.229> you're

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to rotate your so basically you're

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
to rotate your so basically you're
coming<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.100> your<00:01:50.310> ground<00:01:50.610> army<00:01:50.939> right

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
coming in with your ground army right

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.870 
coming in with your ground army right
your<00:01:51.630> Archer<00:01:52.020> Queen<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.500> king<00:01:52.799> your<00:01:53.399> golems

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
your Archer Queen your king your golems

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
your Archer Queen your king your golems
your<00:01:54.180> Pekka<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.290> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> rotate

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
your Pekka and then you want to rotate

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.060 
your Pekka and then you want to rotate
the<00:01:56.430> second<00:01:56.909> half<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> attack<00:01:57.810> about<00:01:58.110> 90

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the second half of the attack about 90

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
the second half of the attack about 90
degrees<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.149> you're<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
degrees so what you're going to do is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080 
degrees so what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> simultaneously<00:02:02.090> distract

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

is a viable strategy i'm going to go

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.320 
is a viable strategy i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.280> end<00:02:20.460> it<00:02:20.580> there<00:02:20.730> but<00:02:20.910> i<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> few

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
ahead and end it there but i got a few

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.410 
ahead and end it there but i got a few
more<00:02:21.450> percentages<00:02:22.040> there<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.730> my<00:02:24.060> attacks

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
more percentages there now in my attacks

and<00:02:30.390> 11<00:02:31.380> *<00:02:31.680> attack<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.340> hasn't<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and 11 * attack so it hasn't really

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.520 
and 11 * attack so it hasn't really
failed<00:02:33.270> me<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.510> mean<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.900> haven't<00:02:34.140> had<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.260> fail

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
even though the one star could be

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.430 
even though the one star could be
considered<00:02:36.480> somewhat<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.990> fail<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.230> you're

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
lava hounds actually do a great job of

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.400 
lava hounds actually do a great job of
distracting<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.549> defensive<00:03:51.060> units<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:52.049> I

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
distracting the defensive units so I

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.319 
distracting the defensive units so I
don't<00:03:52.920> know<00:03:53.010> is<00:03:53.430> this<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> viable<00:03:53.940> strategy

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
don't know is this a viable strategy

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.360 
don't know is this a viable strategy
yeah<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> don't<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.470> haven't<00:03:55.980> really<00:03:56.190> seen

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
yeah I don't know I haven't really seen

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.130 
yeah I don't know I haven't really seen
anybody<00:03:56.610> doing<00:03:56.940> it<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.420> exactly<00:03:57.810> this<00:03:58.079> way

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
anybody doing it just exactly this way

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.310 
anybody doing it just exactly this way
so<00:03:58.430> I'd<00:03:59.430> hate<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.700> think<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.390> was<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:01.170> only

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
so I'd hate to think that I was the only

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.199 
so I'd hate to think that I was the only
guy<00:04:01.590> who<00:04:01.650> came<00:04:02.100> up<00:04:02.250> with<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.459> strategy<00:04:02.670> if<00:04:03.090> it

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
guy who came up with a strategy if it

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.840 
guy who came up with a strategy if it
was<00:04:03.360> really<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.989> empower<00:04:04.620> phul<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.100> i'm<00:04:05.610> not

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
was really that empower phul so i'm not

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.400 
was really that empower phul so i'm not
sure<00:04:05.910> i'm<00:04:06.239> not<00:04:06.299> going<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:06.510> advocate<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.110> using

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
sure i'm not going to advocate it using

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.860 
sure i'm not going to advocate it using
being<00:04:07.890> used<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.220> clan<00:04:08.430> wars<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:09.060> yet<00:04:09.299> maybe

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
being used in clan wars just yet maybe

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.990 
being used in clan wars just yet maybe
who<00:04:10.260> knows<00:04:10.320> but<00:04:10.829> uh<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.250> didn't<00:04:11.640> want<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.820> show

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
who knows but uh I didn't want to show

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.090 
who knows but uh I didn't want to show
one<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.299> my<00:04:12.570> defenses<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> did<00:04:13.590> bring<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.950> how

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
one of my defenses I did bring you how

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.270 
one of my defenses I did bring you how
to<00:04:14.160> beat<00:04:14.400> my<00:04:14.579> base<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.720> last<00:04:15.989> episode<00:04:16.280> but

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to beat my base in the last episode but

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.039 
to beat my base in the last episode but
i<00:04:17.519> thought<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.060> attack<00:04:18.419> was<00:04:18.570> pretty<00:04:18.840> good

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
i thought this attack was pretty good

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.349 
i thought this attack was pretty good
here<00:04:19.350> by<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> dream<00:04:20.070> of<00:04:20.310> tip<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.060> spear

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
here by the dream of tip of the spear

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.150 
here by the dream of tip of the spear
and<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:21.570> really<00:04:21.720> illustrates<00:04:21.979> one<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.099> the

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and it really illustrates one of the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.339 
and it really illustrates one of the
ways<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.550> can<00:04:23.669> still<00:04:23.970> use<00:04:24.000> double<00:04:24.720> jumps<00:04:25.140> in

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
ways you can still use double jumps in

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:26.100 
ways you can still use double jumps in
the<00:04:25.590> game

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
the game

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.140 
the game
even<00:04:26.530> with<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.800> advent<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.520> earthquake<00:04:28.030> you

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
even with the advent of earthquake you

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.390 
even with the advent of earthquake you
can<00:04:28.300> see<00:04:28.539> the<00:04:28.719> dream<00:04:29.050> here<00:04:29.439> is<00:04:29.590> taking<00:04:30.069> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
can see the dream here is taking to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.040 
can see the dream here is taking to
earthquake<00:04:30.849> spells<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.300> would<00:04:31.449> not<00:04:31.689> advocate

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
earthquake spells I would not advocate

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.929 
earthquake spells I would not advocate
really<00:04:32.680> taking<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.009> earthquake<00:04:33.490> spells<00:04:33.789> he's

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
really taking to earthquake spells he's

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.390 
really taking to earthquake spells he's
obviously<00:04:34.210> using<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:35.009> maybe<00:04:36.009> it<00:04:36.189> has<00:04:36.280> an

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
obviously using it maybe it has an

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.219 
obviously using it maybe it has an
experimental<00:04:36.879> thing<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.689> try<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.960> take<00:04:38.199> down

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
experimental thing to try to take down

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.689 
experimental thing to try to take down
the<00:04:38.590> Town<00:04:38.800> Hall<00:04:38.830> if<00:04:39.189> there's<00:04:39.370> only<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.550> small

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
crazy but he's going to do a very like I

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.249 
crazy but he's going to do a very like I
said<00:04:55.449> he's<00:04:55.569> gonna<00:04:55.659> do<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.840> very<00:04:56.050> good<00:04:56.110> job

said he's gonna do a very good job

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.499 
said he's gonna do a very good job
considering<00:04:56.919> he<00:04:57.639> could<00:04:57.819> drop<00:04:58.060> two<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.389> those

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
considering he could drop two of those

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.540 
considering he could drop two of those
earthquake<00:04:58.960> spells<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.500> add<00:04:59.650> a<00:04:59.680> freeze<00:05:00.189> and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
earthquake spells and add a freeze and

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.939 
earthquake spells and add a freeze and
do<00:05:00.699> even<00:05:01.060> better<00:05:01.270> against<00:05:01.779> this<00:05:01.900> base<00:05:02.229> so<00:05:02.889> if

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
do even better against this base so if

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.219 
do even better against this base so if
you<00:05:03.009> see<00:05:03.159> a<00:05:03.189> base<00:05:03.430> like<00:05:03.699> this<00:05:03.969> and<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.900> drop

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
you see a base like this and you drop

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.830 
you see a base like this and you drop
that<00:05:05.469> jump<00:05:05.889> spell<00:05:06.219> to<00:05:06.849> jump<00:05:07.150> spells<00:05:07.419> up<00:05:07.659> in<00:05:07.810> the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
that jump spell to jump spells up in the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.330 
that jump spell to jump spells up in the
North<00:05:07.930> like<00:05:08.469> that<00:05:08.680> if<00:05:08.860> there's<00:05:09.039> an<00:05:09.189> air

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
North like that if there's an air

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.850 
North like that if there's an air
defense<00:05:09.669> on<00:05:09.849> the<00:05:09.969> outside<00:05:10.509> it's<00:05:11.139> really<00:05:11.500> a

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
defense on the outside it's really a

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.800 
defense on the outside it's really a
great<00:05:11.889> way<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.580> tackle<00:05:12.849> these<00:05:13.120> bases<00:05:13.659> you<00:05:13.779> can

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
great way to tackle these bases you can

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.019 
great way to tackle these bases you can
see<00:05:14.080> drops<00:05:14.349> a<00:05:14.529> freeze<00:05:14.800> here<00:05:15.159> he<00:05:15.669> should

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:16.029 
see drops a freeze here he should

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:17.820 
see drops a freeze here he should
probably<00:05:16.599> have<00:05:16.779> one<00:05:17.020> more<00:05:17.229> fries<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.770> it

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
probably have one more fries and it

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.529 
probably have one more fries and it
would<00:05:17.949> have<00:05:18.039> been<00:05:18.129> even<00:05:18.340> easier<00:05:18.639> like<00:05:19.120> I<00:05:19.270> said

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
would have been even easier like I said

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.360 
would have been even easier like I said
but<00:05:19.719> he<00:05:19.750> drops<00:05:20.259> both<00:05:20.469> earthquake<00:05:20.919> spells<00:05:21.219> on

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
but he drops both earthquake spells on

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.490 
but he drops both earthquake spells on
the<00:05:21.430> town<00:05:21.639> hall<00:05:21.879> now<00:05:22.090> doesn't<00:05:22.990> do<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.080> heck<00:05:23.289> of<00:05:23.379> a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
the town hall now doesn't do a heck of a

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.950 
the town hall now doesn't do a heck of a
lot<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.740> damage<00:05:24.039> to<00:05:24.279> the<00:05:25.090> surrounding<00:05:25.240> units

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
lot of damage to the surrounding units

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.200 
lot of damage to the surrounding units
but<00:05:26.439> I<00:05:26.500> guess<00:05:26.740> every<00:05:27.009> bit<00:05:27.189> helps<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.939> can<00:05:28.060> see

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
but I guess every bit helps you can see

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.790 
but I guess every bit helps you can see
the<00:05:28.330> single<00:05:28.659> time<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:29.110> single<00:05:29.439> target<00:05:29.740> is

the single time the single target is

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.260 
the single time the single target is

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
going to lock on to that barbarian can

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.119 
going to lock on to that barbarian can
get<00:05:31.449> him<00:05:31.719> or<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.169> pecker<00:05:32.409> rather<00:05:32.710> get<00:05:32.949> him

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
get him or the pecker rather get him

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.309 
get him or the pecker rather get him
down<00:05:33.400> but<00:05:34.089> at<00:05:34.240> this<00:05:34.360> point<00:05:34.599> here<00:05:34.810> he<00:05:34.930> has<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.259> in

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
down but at this point here he has it in

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.649

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.519 
barbarians to come in and get over sixty
percent<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.449> I<00:05:52.629> thought<00:05:53.080> it<00:05:53.169> was<00:05:53.229> a<00:05:53.349> really

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:53.529

percent so I thought it was a really
impressive<00:05:53.830> attack<00:05:54.159> against<00:05:54.669> my<00:05:54.819> old<00:05:55.060> base<00:05:55.330> so

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:56.189 
impressive attack against my old base so

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.129 
impressive attack against my old base so
