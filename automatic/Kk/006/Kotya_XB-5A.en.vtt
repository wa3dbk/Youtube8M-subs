guards<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> guess<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.549> say<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.909> they're

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
guards I guess you could say but they're

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700 
guards I guess you could say but they're
actually<00:01:33.150> made<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.570> leather<00:01:33.780> reels<00:01:34.500> other

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually made of leather reels other

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually made of leather reels other
material<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> wrapped<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.570> around

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
material and I kind of wrapped it around

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.679 
material and I kind of wrapped it around
and<00:01:37.049> everything<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.369> leather<00:01:38.689> tied

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and everything using more leather tied

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.929 
and everything using more leather tied
to<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> back<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.310> ended<00:01:41.610> up<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to at the back but I ended up the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.399 
to at the back but I ended up the
supercooling<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:42.960> for

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
supercooling it all on just for

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
supercooling it all on just for
stability<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.250> doesn't<00:01:44.399> fall<00:01:44.610> off<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.479> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
stability so doesn't fall off but you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.569 
stability so doesn't fall off but you
don't<00:01:45.750> way<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> thought<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> really

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
don't way I thought that was a really

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.950 
don't way I thought that was a really
clever<00:01:47.579> idea<00:01:47.729> or<00:01:48.770> it's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> cool<00:01:50.070> idea<00:01:50.960> second

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
clever idea or it's a cool idea second

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
clever idea or it's a cool idea second
he<00:01:52.140> has<00:01:52.350> his<00:01:52.649> belt<00:01:54.290> strength<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:56.340> actually<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
he has his belt strength it actually is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
he has his belt strength it actually is
