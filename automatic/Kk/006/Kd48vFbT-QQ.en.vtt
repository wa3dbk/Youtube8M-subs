00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.319
 mixing the two in the market for that little 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.319
 more than fully 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.460
 and Dmitry Okunyov 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.710
 I chose shepherds 1701 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.769
 compact niche in style 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.029
 but I do not insist on a relatively new 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.829
 models but it seems they have not seen for a long time 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.419
 and everything is based enough 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.529
 outdated intel processor 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.409
 servers it reduces about 

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:35.050
 performance and increases 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.760
 temperature he left in his 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.899
 queue based on s average 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.000
 consider themselves not bad 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.699
 performance is relatively gentle 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.510
 the ship is not only 4 lats 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.330
 highlight i7 solid state 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.000
 drive ssd even small volume 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.120
 but energy consumption 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.250
 just great installed chromosomes 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 actually hard drive which we all 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 accustomed to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.270
 however its volume allows Caliph 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.250
 more information than sitting on that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.520
 mostly not written 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.220
 a small amount of five allows you to take 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.250
 him with him anywhere he is closer even 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 small embarrassment 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.890
 we insist kremenchug more 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.410
 dimensions and weight could also be enough 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.310
 compact and all equipped with a seven-inch 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.300
 screen 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.340
 It seems that this very little year works in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.320
 Pattaya really have to put up with 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.330
 university rectors 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.490
 apply it makanin left them any 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.050
 the application actually looks also under 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.800
 by question 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.240
 according to their version sacrificed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.290
 compactness is convenient to use it 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.360
 can only a child or a girl with 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.220
 thumbnail packs 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.900
 Alas, the Musaevs are slightly less than what 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.370
 laptops but comfortable enough for 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.120
 fidelity portions print 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.700
 in the composition of the volumes we all have and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 fairly standard 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.650
 with him and he has developed a year all these 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 commands are clearly a card reader and module 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.490
 external display can we really eliminate 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.620
 the same with the reasons that the modem 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.890
 they decided to refuse him 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.620
 Well, perhaps someone needs now 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.170
 battery pack repression does not see 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.110
 however due to the small screens and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.680
 solid state drive 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.670
 working time is quite acceptable hamas 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.830
 ayman taha this problem is solved 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.300
 used techies on a two and three blog 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.010
 of women 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.310
 I answer that allows you to increase 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800
 battery life 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.940
 these laptops have a lot in common for example 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.320
 wireless interface will appear 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.000
 in front of communication cameras but for example 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.870
 skype 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.700
 but nevertheless we see how not 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.629
 time 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.359
 cost iii all-Russian 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.839
 10 thousand rubles but we can not call about 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:14.999
 complete solution 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.439
 rather, it is a gift for a girl won 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.239
 in general, have to lay out and more 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.729
 about 14 thousand rubles 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.809
 but the most far less champions 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.849
 decide all the same you cooked Dmitry 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.069
 perch and andrew mihalyuk 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.529
