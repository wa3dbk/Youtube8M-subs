two speakers that are up here in the
stock<00:03:21.340> speaker<00:03:21.790> location<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> it<00:03:24.519> looks<00:03:24.730> good

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
stock speaker location so it looks good

still<00:03:25.329> need<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.630> do<00:03:25.780> wiring<00:03:26.350> as<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.680> can<00:03:26.890> see

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
still need to do wiring as you can see

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.610 
still need to do wiring as you can see
but<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.910> wiring<00:03:28.269> actually<00:03:28.959> works<00:03:29.260> right<00:03:29.590> now

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
but the wiring actually works right now

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.509 
but the wiring actually works right now
so<00:03:30.130> for<00:03:30.340> testing<00:03:30.640> purposes<00:03:31.180> we'll<00:03:32.170> do<00:03:32.519> leave

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
so for testing purposes we'll do leave

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.420 
so for testing purposes we'll do leave
the<00:03:33.640> wiring<00:03:34.090> alone<00:03:34.420> also<00:03:35.350> glued<00:03:36.280> the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
the wiring alone also glued the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.949 
the wiring alone also glued the
headliner<00:03:36.819> in<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.269> then<00:03:37.390> secured<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.930> with

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
headliner in and then secured it with

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.069 
headliner in and then secured it with
