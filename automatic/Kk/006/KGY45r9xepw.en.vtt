00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.070
 personal device is about to 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.380

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.460
 smartphone with watch shape and size 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.950
 that attached to a belt pretend 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.900
 replace the watches of all life 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.210
 functioning as an extension of 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.519
 our mobile phones if they will be 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 part or not of our lives is something that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.140
 at first no one knows for sure 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 however, it can not be denied that in 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.180
 models like the lg watch call as 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 minimum the attention of any jeep of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.230
 this model in particular we met no 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 its name has long since 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.430
 will use android wear as a system 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.129
 operative and that will allow us to manage 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.100
 and take care of dozens of tasks that 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.590
 now we assigned to the mobile however 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.760
 many of us wondered what kind of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.789
 hardware moves 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.710
 lgg words and other similar watches 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.530
 well if they just filtered the 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 internal specifications of hey watch 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.590
 of lg features that surpass even 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 some of the most moderate smartphones 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.430
 of the market in particular the g 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.390
 It has a touch screen of 165 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 inches and resolution of 280 by 280 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.720
 pixels thus offering 240 pixels per 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.730
 inch inside we find 512 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.710
 megabytes of ram memory 4 gigas of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.600
 storage and several sensors that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.400
 They will serve as sneaks to send 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 information to the mobile in certain 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.710
 circumstances and next to applications 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.010
 lgg watch connects with our 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.590
 smartphone through bluetooth 4.0 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.620
 thus taking advantage of the low consumption of 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.510
 battery that offers this standard and with 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.610
 regarding autonomy say that this 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.130
 clock in particular equips a battery of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.250
 400 milliamps that according to the source 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.440
 can offer an autonomy of about 36 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.200
 hours is to say that we will have to 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.530
 charge it approximately every day that you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.530
 It seems
