my<00:00:32.669> cricket<00:00:33.000> pretty<00:00:33.360> honestly<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
my cricket pretty honestly and at the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
my cricket pretty honestly and at the
start<00:00:34.440> yes<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.130> did<00:00:35.399> such<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.030> can't

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
start yes I did such a bit but I can't

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.229 
start yes I did such a bit but I can't
really<00:00:36.510> pinpoint<00:00:36.899> exactly<00:00:37.320> one<00:00:38.239> particular

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
really pinpoint exactly one particular

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.790 
really pinpoint exactly one particular
sledge<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.510> better<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.230> had<00:00:40.350> been<00:00:40.559> great

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
sledge that better that had been great

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.860 
sledge that better that had been great
but<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.309> clip<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:42.149> Polly<00:00:42.420> has<00:00:42.690> been

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
but I think the clip with Polly has been

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
but I think the clip with Polly has been
played<00:00:43.079> over<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.469> over<00:00:43.559> again<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:43.950> maybe

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
played over and over again so maybe

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
played over and over again so maybe
everyone<00:00:45.180> likes<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.649> we<00:00:46.649> could<00:00:46.800> keep<00:00:46.920> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
everyone likes that we could keep a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.330 
everyone likes that we could keep a
batsman<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.579> all-time<00:00:48.890> best<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> could<00:00:50.129> keep<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
batsman of all-time best we could keep a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
batsman of all-time best we could keep a
batsman<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.910> all<00:00:51.090> time<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.480> would<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> say

playing cricket you are most likely to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.280 
playing cricket you are most likely to
become<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> cricket<00:01:38.430> commentator

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
