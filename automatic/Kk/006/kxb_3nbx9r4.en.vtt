to discuss why I prefer the seated

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.839 
to discuss why I prefer the seated
dumbbell<00:00:06.720> press<00:00:07.230> over<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> military<00:00:08.220> press

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
dumbbell press over the military press

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.600 
dumbbell press over the military press
now<00:00:09.389> before<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.809> continue<00:00:10.019> any<00:00:10.410> further<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:11.099> want

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
now before I continue any further I want

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.980 
now before I continue any further I want
to<00:00:11.700> emphasize<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.630> why<00:00:12.960> I

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
to emphasize that this is why I

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.990 
to emphasize that this is why I
personally<00:00:13.980> choose<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.400> use<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> seated

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
personally choose to use the seated

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.790 
personally choose to use the seated
dumbbell<00:00:15.120> press<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:16.170> not<00:00:16.379> saying<00:00:16.710> that

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
dumbbell press and I'm not saying that

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.890 
dumbbell press and I'm not saying that
it<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.130> without<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.520> doubt<00:00:17.670> better<00:00:18.330> than<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
it is without a doubt better than the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.019 
it is without a doubt better than the
military<00:00:19.109> press<00:00:19.619> because<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.640> military

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
military press because the military

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.179 
military press because the military
press<00:00:21.270> has<00:00:21.510> been<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> staple<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.470> many<00:00:22.769> strength

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
press has been a staple in many strength

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.849 
press has been a staple in many strength
athletes<00:00:23.640> programs<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> proven<00:00:25.500> great

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
athletes programs and is a proven great

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.640 
athletes programs and is a proven great
exercise<00:00:26.460> overall<00:00:26.970> however<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.900> have<00:00:28.289> three

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
exercise overall however I have three

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.650 
exercise overall however I have three
reasons<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.220> why<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> choose<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.359> seated

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
reasons for why I choose the seated

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.479 
reasons for why I choose the seated
dumbbell<00:00:30.840> press<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:31.859> reason<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.430> that

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
dumbbell press the first reason is that

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
dumbbell press the first reason is that
military<00:00:32.880> press<00:00:33.390> training<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
military press training can get in the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
military press training can get in the
way<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> your<00:00:34.860> bench<00:00:35.070> press<00:00:35.190> training<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.360> any

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
way of your bench press training see any

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.990 
way of your bench press training see any
day<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.739> military<00:00:38.190> press<00:00:38.520> I'd

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
day in which you can military press I'd

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
day in which you can military press I'd
rather<00:00:39.270> bench<00:00:39.660> press<00:00:39.989> from<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> general

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
rather bench press from a general

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
rather bench press from a general
strength<00:00:41.129> standpoint<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.300> bench<00:00:42.510> press

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
strength standpoint the bench press

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
strength standpoint the bench press
involves<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.320> muscles<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:43.980> I'd<00:00:44.070> rather

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
involves more muscles so I'd rather

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.369 
involves more muscles so I'd rather
focus<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> first<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:46.170> from

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
focus on that first and then from

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.410 
focus on that first and then from
specifically<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> powerlifting<00:00:47.760> perspective

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
specifically a powerlifting perspective

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
specifically a powerlifting perspective
that<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.260> event<00:00:49.559> I'm<00:00:49.829> competing<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
that is an event I'm competing in so I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.060 
that is an event I'm competing in so I
want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> make<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.690> top<00:00:51.960> priority<00:00:52.620> now

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
want to make that my top priority now

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.130 
want to make that my top priority now
obviously<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.760> bench<00:00:54.329> press<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> military

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
obviously you can bench press a military

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.470 
obviously you can bench press a military
press<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> same<00:00:56.039> day<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.059> personally

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
press on the same day but I personally

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
press on the same day but I personally
found<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.469> easier<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.039> bench

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
found that it is much easier to bench

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.790 
found that it is much easier to bench
and<00:00:59.850> then<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> dumbbells<00:01:01.170> rather<00:01:01.530> than

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and then use the dumbbells rather than

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
and then use the dumbbells rather than
the<00:01:01.920> bench<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.489> military<00:01:02.969> press<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.719> for

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the bench and then military press so for

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
the bench and then military press so for
my<00:01:04.049> training<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.589> prefer<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.040> prioritize<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
my training I prefer to prioritize the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
my training I prefer to prioritize the
bench<00:01:06.119> press<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.659> every<00:01:06.990> upper<00:01:07.260> body<00:01:07.470> training

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
bench press on every upper body training

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
bench press on every upper body training
day<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.430> now<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.850> second<00:01:09.270> reason<00:01:09.390> why<00:01:09.689> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
day I have now the second reason why I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.510 
day I have now the second reason why I
prefer<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.409> dumbbells<00:01:10.799> instead<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
prefer the dumbbells instead of the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.850 
prefer the dumbbells instead of the
military<00:01:11.970> press<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:13.140> believe<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.680> get

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
military press is that I believe you get

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.100 
military press is that I believe you get
better<00:01:14.100> shoulder<00:01:14.640> stimulation<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.869> by<00:01:16.049> using

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
better shoulder stimulation see by using

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
better shoulder stimulation see by using
dumbbells<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:17.159> more<00:01:17.369> stabilization

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
dumbbells there's more stabilization

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
dumbbells there's more stabilization
required<00:01:18.659> you're<00:01:19.259> going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> prevent

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
required you're going to prevent

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.249 
required you're going to prevent
muscular<00:01:20.400> imbalances<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.780> triceps

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
muscular imbalances and your triceps

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.960 
muscular imbalances and your triceps
won't<00:01:22.530> take<00:01:22.740> over<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.790> focus

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
won't take over as much so you can focus

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
won't take over as much so you can focus
more<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.600> shoulder<00:01:24.990> development<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
more on your shoulder development and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.710 
more on your shoulder development and
another<00:01:26.340> important<00:01:26.759> point<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.540> some

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
another important point is that some

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
another important point is that some
studies<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.110> suggested<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.610> might

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
studies have suggested that you might

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.210 
studies have suggested that you might
get<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.240> even<00:01:30.659> shoulder<00:01:31.049> development<00:01:31.619> from

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
get more even shoulder development from

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
get more even shoulder development from
using<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.759> behind<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> neck<00:01:33.600> overhead<00:01:34.170> press

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
using the behind the neck overhead press

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.410 
using the behind the neck overhead press
because<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.670> you're<00:01:35.820> involving<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
because then you're involving the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
because then you're involving the
lateral<00:01:36.869> head<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.619> however<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.430> don't

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
lateral head a bit more however I don't

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
lateral head a bit more however I don't
recommend<00:01:39.270> using<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.720> behind<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> head

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
recommend using the behind the head

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.140 
recommend using the behind the head
overhead<00:01:40.619> press<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> puts<00:01:42.030> your

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
overhead press because that puts your

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270 
overhead press because that puts your
shoulders<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.659> an<00:01:42.780> awkward<00:01:43.200> position<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
shoulders in an awkward position so I

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.859 
shoulders in an awkward position so I
find<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> dumbbells<00:01:45.270> allow<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.659> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
find that the dumbbells allow you to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
find that the dumbbells allow you to
have<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> happy<00:01:46.470> medium<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.579> in

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
have a happy medium where you're not in

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.149 
have a happy medium where you're not in
an<00:01:47.820> extremely<00:01:48.360> awkward<00:01:48.659> position<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:50.070> you're

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
an extremely awkward position but you're

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
an extremely awkward position but you're
able<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> target<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.060> shoulders<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> bit<00:01:51.750> more

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
able to target the shoulders a bit more

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
able to target the shoulders a bit more
evenly<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> third<00:01:53.280> point<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.729> by<00:01:53.970> far<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
evenly now the third point is by far the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.179 
evenly now the third point is by far the
most<00:01:54.600> important<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
most important one and it is that I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.700 
most important one and it is that I
simply<00:01:56.579> progress<00:01:57.270> better<00:01:57.600> using<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> seated

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
simply progress better using the seated

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
simply progress better using the seated
dumbbell<00:01:58.890> press<00:01:59.399> than<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.390> military

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
dumbbell press than I do the military

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.690 
dumbbell press than I do the military
press<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.979> why<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.130> entitled<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
press see this is why I entitled the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
press see this is why I entitled the
video<00:02:02.969> why<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> prefer<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> seated<00:02:04.409> dumbbell

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
video why I prefer the seated dumbbell

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
video why I prefer the seated dumbbell
press<00:02:05.009> because<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.030> might<00:02:06.299> progress<00:02:06.719> better

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
press because you might progress better

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
press because you might progress better
with<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> military<00:02:07.799> press<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
with the military press but the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.590 
with the military press but the
important<00:02:09.119> thing<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> keep<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.629> mind<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
important thing to keep in mind is that

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.360 
important thing to keep in mind is that
matter<00:02:10.840> what<00:02:10.960> you're<00:02:11.350> doing<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.890> you're<00:02:12.340> not

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
matter what you're doing if you're not

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.610 
matter what you're doing if you're not
progressing<00:02:13.180> then<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.930> need<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> change<00:02:14.380> what

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
progressing then you need to change what

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.140 
progressing then you need to change what
you're<00:02:14.740> doing<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.430> is<00:02:15.490> also<00:02:15.820> why<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you're doing and this is also why I

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.510 
you're doing and this is also why I
prefer<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.600> seated<00:02:17.140> dumbbell<00:02:17.290> press<00:02:17.770> over

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
prefer the seated dumbbell press over

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.550 
prefer the seated dumbbell press over
the<00:02:18.700> standing<00:02:19.090> dumbbell<00:02:19.330> press<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.320> true

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the standing dumbbell press it is true

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.960 
the standing dumbbell press it is true
that<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> standing<00:02:21.220> dumbbell<00:02:21.370> press<00:02:21.790> is

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that the standing dumbbell press is

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.300 
that the standing dumbbell press is
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> involve<00:02:22.480> your<00:02:22.720> core<00:02:22.960> more<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
going to involve your core more but I

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to involve your core more but I
found<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.210> simply<00:02:25.600> cannot<00:02:25.930> progress

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
found that I just simply cannot progress

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.390 
found that I just simply cannot progress
as<00:02:26.530> quick<00:02:26.800> as<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.100> can

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
as quick as I can

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.030 
as quick as I can
using<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.030> seated<00:02:28.420> variation<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.620> then<00:02:29.890> it's

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
using the seated variation so then it's

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
using the seated variation so then it's
not<00:02:30.130> going<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.790> effective<00:02:31.300> for<00:02:31.330> me<00:02:31.630> and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
not going to be as effective for me and

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.330 
not going to be as effective for me and
I<00:02:32.080> really<00:02:32.350> can't<00:02:32.590> emphasize<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:33.100> enough

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
I really can't emphasize that enough

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.420 
I really can't emphasize that enough
that<00:02:34.330> all<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.900> matters<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.500> progression<00:02:36.280> it

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
that all that matters is progression it

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.490 
that all that matters is progression it
doesn't<00:02:37.060> matter<00:02:37.240> what<00:02:37.540> certain<00:02:37.900> studies<00:02:38.290> say

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
doesn't matter what certain studies say

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.920 
doesn't matter what certain studies say
as<00:02:38.680> far<00:02:38.890> as<00:02:38.950> recruitment<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.750> if

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
as far as recruitment this with that if

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.140 
as far as recruitment this with that if
it<00:02:41.140> doesn't<00:02:41.560> end<00:02:41.740> up<00:02:41.980> helping<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.640> actually

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it doesn't end up helping you actually

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150 
it doesn't end up helping you actually
lift<00:02:43.390> more<00:02:43.660> weight<00:02:43.930> because<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.740> have<00:02:44.950> to

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
lift more weight because you have to

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.830 
lift more weight because you have to
keep<00:02:45.340> progressing<00:02:45.550> your<00:02:46.060> workouts<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
keep progressing your workouts have to

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.020 
keep progressing your workouts have to
keep<00:02:47.050> improving<00:02:47.410> your<00:02:47.770> performance

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
terms of strength or size so that's it

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.750 
terms of strength or size so that's it
guys<00:02:52.990> those<00:02:53.380> are<00:02:53.410> my<00:02:53.620> reasons<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.160> remember

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
guys those are my reasons and remember

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.700 
guys those are my reasons and remember
this<00:02:54.910> varies<00:02:55.390> based<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.870> individual<00:02:56.530> so

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
this varies based on the individual so

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.320 
this varies based on the individual so
don't<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.190> that<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.580> automatically

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
don't think that this automatically

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.420 
don't think that this automatically
means<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.720> shouldn't<00:02:59.080> military<00:02:59.530> press<00:02:59.800> this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
means you shouldn't military press this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.310 
means you shouldn't military press this
