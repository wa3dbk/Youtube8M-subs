 10 points 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.609
 so that it is not too 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.619
 narrow and also not very 2 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.619

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 of the no 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.109
 remember that it is the angel 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.950
 and you have to knit the soft ones so that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.950
 the more vaporous the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.680
 the scarf 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.820
 you can put some accessories 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 some accounts 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.390
 with any of the domain that you 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.030
 want 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.030
 and it also serves as a necklace 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.490
 see how he is giving his 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.490
 its way 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.829
 in the back 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.829
 for a scarf 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.079
 they are left 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.920
 as well as to put 0 d also of a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.650
 tie whether they have it in black or 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.450
 in coffee 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.569
 in the everything that you like the most to me 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.569
 liked this because it is very spring 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.970
 more or less 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.109
 run out 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.220
 think so too too much 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.740
 softly 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.080
 in this case and not rather weave this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.080
 let's see if they reach me the other 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.020
 and we are going to make a little roll 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.530
 and we started 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.960
 complement 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.580
 we are trying to affirm the law
