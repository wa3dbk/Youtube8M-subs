 If you want to return the photo to this original, otherwise 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 fingers 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.210
 the m 7 0 1 r has with its point eight centimeters high 19 wide and how 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 they can see only one and a half centimeters thick 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.830
 in addition you are one of the features that more of cinema this tablet this 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.850
 possibility of using the built-in kevin accelerometer 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.560
 allows you to rotate from the screen display depending on the position 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.100
 where is equipment 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.490
 if it is in horizontal form as you can see the whole disk there is in that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.140
 position 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.190
 but if we do not stop it vertically 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.630
 he solves himself by allowing the visualization 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.270
 another important feature this tablet that its processor or 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.390
 a rm 11 720 megahertz 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 in addition to as with embedded video processor 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.039
 allows to play videos up to 1080p what is pure definition 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.430
 for example 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.250
 today we can watch a video 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.000
 ap an uncertainty 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.570
 the producing without any problem we can advance the video 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.490
 we have entered to do it 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.490
 rather 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.499
 the irene 7 0 1 r 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.800
 As if that were not enough you can transmit fulham video signal and definition 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.010
 a monitor or a television only needs to connect an HDMI cable to its 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.259
 team 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.959
 adjust 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.379

 the video signal and without any problem 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.370
 for that reason it is very unfair and for luca lores for lecturers to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.819
 businessmen to be able to play all their videos in a 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.099

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:43.739
 of files that have formats because df powerpoint weksel 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.829
 percent in addition to solor the visualization also allows the 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.599
