00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.220 

one<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> requirements<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.109> building

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
one of the requirements for building

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.650 
one of the requirements for building
muscle<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.250> eat<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> lot<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> protein<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
muscle is to eat a lot of protein now I

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.419 
muscle is to eat a lot of protein now I
find<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> only<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.769> do<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.310> by

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
find the only way I can do this is by

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
find the only way I can do this is by
having<00:00:29.640> protein<00:00:29.970> bars<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.599> shapes<00:00:30.900> between

having protein bars or shapes between

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
having protein bars or shapes between
meals<00:00:31.859> now<00:00:32.369> protein<00:00:32.730> bars<00:00:32.940> are<00:00:33.059> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
meals now protein bars are really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.330 
meals now protein bars are really
expensive<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.200> find<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.559> sickly<00:00:34.980> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

carbohydrates<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> adds<00:00:55.440> really

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
carbohydrates but it adds really

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.979 
carbohydrates but it adds really
important<00:00:56.430> flavor<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.629> manage

sites all right and next onto the bar
itself<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.359> starts<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:00.989> ground<00:01:01.320> almonds

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
itself that starts with ground almonds

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.039 
itself that starts with ground almonds
so<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.670> into<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> bowl<00:01:03.180> along

so all those can go into the bowl along

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
so all those can go into the bowl along
with<00:01:04.189> porridge<00:01:05.189> oats<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> slow<00:01:06.060> release<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
with porridge oats so a slow release of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.789 
with porridge oats so a slow release of
energy<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.990> well<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.470> essentially

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
energy as well but this is essentially

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.429 
energy as well but this is essentially

next<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> final<00:02:03.720> dry<00:02:04.110> ingredient<00:02:04.710> is

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
next up the final dry ingredient is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.320 
next up the final dry ingredient is
sugar<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.850> literally<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.299> a

an 8 part so you know that's hardly any

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.570 
an 8 part so you know that's hardly any
sugar<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.230> mix<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> dry<00:02:13.920> ingredients<00:02:13.950> up

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
sugar so mix with the dry ingredients up

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.970 
sugar so mix with the dry ingredients up
and<00:02:14.820> then<00:02:15.360> in<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.260> wet<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> first<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and then in with the wet the first of

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.340 
and then in with the wet the first of
which<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.190> big<00:02:17.970> flavors<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:18.660> peanut<00:02:19.140> butter

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
which is big flavors well peanut butter

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.220 
which is big flavors well peanut butter
yeah<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> was<00:02:19.950> absolutely<00:02:20.610> over<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.150> moon<00:02:21.239> we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
were able to eat peanut butter you stay

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210 
were able to eat peanut butter you stay
on<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.239> top<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.780> still<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.709> edits<00:02:26.010> fridge

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
on the top you still do the edits fridge

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.040 
on the top you still do the edits fridge
came<00:02:26.459> in<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> office<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.209> hand<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.780> eat

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
came in the office in one hand and eat

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.960 
came in the office in one hand and eat
peanut<00:02:28.410> butter<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.830> jar<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.580> other<00:02:29.700> and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
peanut butter of a jar in the other and

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.729 
peanut butter of a jar in the other and
that<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.300> know<00:02:30.420> why<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.140> why<00:02:31.350> these

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
that you know why this is why these

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.199 
that you know why this is why these
protein<00:02:32.280> bars<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.700> solve<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.000> lot<00:02:33.180> of

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
protein bars you know solve a lot of

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.840 
protein bars you know solve a lot of
problems<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.470> know<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:35.280> really

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
problems because you know that's really

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.580 
problems because you know that's really
high<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.090> fat<00:02:36.360> peanut<00:02:36.720> butter<00:02:36.989> is<00:02:37.140> unhealthy

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
high in fat peanut butter is unhealthy

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.110 
high in fat peanut butter is unhealthy
for<00:02:37.860> me<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.040> either<00:02:38.160> amount<00:02:38.610> however<00:02:38.970> it's

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
for me to either amount however it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.580 
for me to either amount however it's
sucked<00:02:39.420> got<00:02:39.600> sucked<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.079> OT

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
sucked got sucked of OT

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.090 
sucked got sucked of OT
but<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.400> find<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.810> easy<00:02:42.840> not<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.769> so

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
but I find it's too easy not to do so

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.979 
but I find it's too easy not to do so
these<00:02:44.700> protein<00:02:45.239> bars<00:02:45.450> are<00:02:45.570> going<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.720> solve

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
these protein bars are going to solve

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.130 
these protein bars are going to solve
that<00:02:46.049> problem<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.620> probably<00:02:47.810> control<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that problem you probably control the

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.810 
that problem you probably control the
amount<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.440> per<00:02:49.769> minute<00:02:50.100> but<00:02:50.160> he'll<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.549> on<00:02:50.730> my

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
amount of per minute but he'll use on my

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.520 
amount of per minute but he'll use on my
life<00:02:51.000> control<00:02:51.870> them<00:02:52.019> Aetna<00:02:52.170> peanut<00:02:52.380> butter
