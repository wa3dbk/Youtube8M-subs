we're<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> show<00:01:53.670> them<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.939> little<00:01:54.090> time<00:01:54.210> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
we're going to show them a little time a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
we're going to show them a little time a
little<00:01:54.329> science<00:01:54.630> class<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.439> what

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
little science class here because what

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
little science class here because what
makes<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:56.399> different<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> acidity

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
makes all these different is the acidity

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.980 
makes all these different is the acidity
or<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.170> alkalinity<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> ph<00:01:59.729> okay<00:02:00.180> okay<00:02:00.390> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
or the alkalinity of the ph okay okay so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.270 
or the alkalinity of the ph okay okay so
now<00:02:01.350> we've<00:02:01.500> got<00:02:01.649> examples<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.310> soda<00:02:02.850> soda<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
now we've got examples of soda soda a

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.350 
now we've got examples of soda soda a
conditional<00:02:05.280> drinking<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.759> morning<00:02:05.939> and

conditional drinking this morning and
two<00:02:06.540> different<00:02:06.869> types<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.290> bottled<00:02:07.740> water<00:02:07.950> all

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
two different types of bottled water all

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.889 
two different types of bottled water all
in<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> put<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.810> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
in there and then when you put what is

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.869 
in there and then when you put what is
this<00:02:10.050> stuff<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.739> pH<00:02:11.069> drops<00:02:11.310> as<00:02:11.580> pH

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
this stuff this is pH drops as pH

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.800 
this stuff this is pH drops as pH

don't that separates the stream is sends

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.309 
don't that separates the stream is sends
out<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.130> acid<00:03:57.549> water<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.329> bottle<00:03:58.989> up<00:03:59.139> the
