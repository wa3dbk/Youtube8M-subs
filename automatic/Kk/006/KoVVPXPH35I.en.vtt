there's too much of a difference for
that<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.610> even<00:02:51.640> happen<00:02:52.390> you<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.320> to<00:02:53.380> happen

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
that to even happen you have to happen

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.560 
that to even happen you have to happen
the<00:02:54.010> Xbox<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.880> PlayStation<00:02:55.030> 4<00:02:55.360> would

the Xbox one and the PlayStation 4 would
have<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> be<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.860> weaker<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.940> not<00:02:58.090> even

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
have to be so much weaker it's not even

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.210 
have to be so much weaker it's not even
funny<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.440> only<00:02:59.590> reason<00:02:59.830> that<00:03:00.010> these

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
funny and the only reason that these

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.520 
funny and the only reason that these
clowns<00:03:00.910> want<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.270> talk<00:03:01.450> about<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:02.080> not<00:03:02.320> gonna

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
clowns want to talk about is not gonna

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.900 
clowns want to talk about is not gonna
be<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> leap<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.430> loop<00:03:03.610> is<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.850> be

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
be a leap the loop is going to be

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.340 
be a leap the loop is going to be
miniscule<00:03:04.480> there's<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.870> much<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.230> a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
miniscule there's not much of a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.750 
miniscule there's not much of a
difference<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.800> things<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.070> it's

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
difference and things like that it's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.210 
difference and things like that it's
because<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.209> Wii<00:03:07.450> U<00:03:07.720> has<00:03:08.470> shown<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.040> there

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
because the Wii U has shown that there

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.960 
because the Wii U has shown that there
really<00:03:09.430> is<00:03:09.820> no<00:03:10.860> difference<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.160> these<00:03:12.610> people

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
really is no difference and these people

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.729 
really is no difference and these people
are<00:03:13.090> out<00:03:13.180> here<00:03:13.209> trying<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:14.080> damage<00:03:14.410> control
