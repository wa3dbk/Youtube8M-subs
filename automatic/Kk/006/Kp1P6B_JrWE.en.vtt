00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.800 
had to get back for we got a ticket but
we<00:05:45.820> managed<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.090> beat<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.419> ticket<00:05:46.690> inspector

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810

hold<00:05:47.320> on<00:05:47.440> makkad<00:05:47.830> now<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.250> depressed<00:05:49.150> because

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
hold on makkad now and depressed because

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.920 
hold on makkad now and depressed because
obviously<00:05:49.840> we<00:05:50.050> lost<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.290> game<00:05:50.440> 2-1<00:05:51.810> in<00:05:52.810> that

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
obviously we lost the game 2-1 in that

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.420 
obviously we lost the game 2-1 in that
red<00:05:53.080> card<00:05:53.290> came<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.530> bad<00:05:53.830> time<00:05:54.070> because<00:05:54.220> I<00:05:54.370> think

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
red card came a bad time because I think

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.550 
red card came a bad time because I think
injury<00:05:55.419> time<00:05:55.630> we<00:05:55.750> were<00:05:55.840> going<00:05:56.110> for<00:05:56.290> it<00:05:56.380> hence

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
injury time we were going for it hence

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.950 
injury time we were going for it hence
why<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.770> drank<00:05:57.100> came<00:05:57.310> up<00:05:57.400> for<00:05:57.550> the<00:05:57.610> corner<00:05:58.030> it

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
why I drank came up for the corner it

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.690 
why I drank came up for the corner it
kind<00:05:59.200> of<00:05:59.230> distracted<00:05:59.710> us<00:05:59.830> Jenkins<00:06:00.340> had<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.580> go

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
kind of distracted us Jenkins had to go

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.600 
kind of distracted us Jenkins had to go
in<00:06:00.820> goal<00:06:01.000> so<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.650> think<00:06:02.650> if<00:06:02.830> that<00:06:03.250> hadn't

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
in goal so I think if that hadn't

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.159 
in goal so I think if that hadn't
happened<00:06:03.639> we<00:06:03.970> might<00:06:04.090> go<00:06:04.270> back<00:06:04.450> in<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.660> maybe<00:06:04.810> be

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
happened we might go back in it maybe be

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.470 
happened we might go back in it maybe be
hopeful<00:06:05.650> but<00:06:05.680> ultimately<00:06:06.310> pretty<00:06:07.150> sure<00:06:07.360> up

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
hopeful but ultimately pretty sure up

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.610 
hopeful but ultimately pretty sure up
enough<00:06:07.720> today<00:06:07.900> not<00:06:08.110> like<00:06:08.230> we<00:06:08.290> did<00:06:08.410> against

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
enough today not like we did against

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.760
