00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
up one end so that we have it in to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.099 
up one end so that we have it in to
start<00:01:48.599> with<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.499> we'll<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:49.799> our<00:01:50.009> ruler<00:01:51.109> and

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.300 

kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.599> a<00:02:06.689> healthy<00:02:06.959> chunk<00:02:07.200> off<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
kind of a healthy chunk off so that I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.860 
kind of a healthy chunk off so that I
can<00:02:09.060> make<00:02:09.239> sure<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.259> these

can make sure that I get all these

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.600 
can make sure that I get all these
little<00:02:12.870> Salvage<00:02:13.440> edges<00:02:13.860> off<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> have<00:02:14.580> a

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
little Salvage edges off so I have a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.420 
little Salvage edges off so I have a
straight<00:02:15.090> line<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.770> first<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.250> we're

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
straight line so the first thing we're

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.470 
straight line so the first thing we're
going<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> make<00:02:17.640> with<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.090> strip

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
going to make with this strip

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.820 
going to make with this strip
set<00:02:19.519> excuse<00:02:20.519> me<00:02:20.840> my<00:02:21.840> blade<00:02:22.080> must<00:02:22.319> not<00:02:22.500> be<00:02:22.650> very

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
set excuse me my blade must not be very

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.759 
set excuse me my blade must not be very
sure<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.959> all<00:02:28.110> right<00:02:28.260> those<00:02:28.470> things

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
sure that's all right those things

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.630 
sure that's all right those things
happen<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.670> quilt<00:02:29.970> shop<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.650> go<00:02:31.830> so

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
happen in the quilt shop there we go so

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.320 
happen in the quilt shop there we go so
now<00:02:32.760> we<00:02:32.819> have<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> nice<00:02:33.360> straight<00:02:33.840> edge<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
now we have a nice straight edge and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.490 
now we have a nice straight edge and
we're<00:02:36.330> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.510> start<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.110> table

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
we're going to start with this table

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.690 
we're going to start with this table
runner<00:02:37.680> first<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:41.250> I'm<00:02:41.400> probably

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
runner first now I'm probably

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.759 
runner first now I'm probably
reinventing<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> wheel<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:43.560> sure

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
reinventing the wheel and I'm sure

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.000 
reinventing the wheel and I'm sure
there's<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> pattern<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:46.140> tend<00:02:46.920> to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
there's a pattern for this but I tend to

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
there's a pattern for this but I tend to
be<00:02:47.129> one<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.370> those<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.730> kind<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.090> thinks<00:02:48.629> off

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
be one of those that kind of thinks off

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.600 
be one of those that kind of thinks off
the<00:02:48.900> cuff<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:49.470> I'll<00:02:49.590> I'll<00:02:49.860> see<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> little

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the cuff and so I'll I'll see a little

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.650 
the cuff and so I'll I'll see a little
thing<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.849> I'll<00:02:50.940> think<00:02:51.060> oh<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.540> do<00:02:51.629> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
thing and I'll think oh I can do a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.330 
thing and I'll think oh I can do a
little<00:02:51.870> table<00:02:52.019> runner<00:02:52.230> out<00:02:52.379> of<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.160> what

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
little table runner out of that so what

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.330 
little table runner out of that so what
I'm<00:02:53.489> what<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:53.879> did<00:02:54.209> was<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.840> took<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.890> decided

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
I'm what I did was I took a I decided

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.030 
I'm what I did was I took a I decided
how<00:02:56.670> wide<00:02:57.030> my<00:02:57.060> table<00:02:57.750> I'd<00:02:58.260> wanted<00:02:58.650> my<00:02:58.739> table

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
how wide my table I'd wanted my table

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.099 
how wide my table I'd wanted my table
runner<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.879> this<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.540> approximately

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
runner to be and this is approximately

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.470 
runner to be and this is approximately
twelve<00:03:01.470> inches<00:03:01.739> wide<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.000> just<00:03:03.299> took

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
twelve inches wide and so I just took

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.410 
twelve inches wide and so I just took
and<00:03:03.690> cut<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:03.870> 12<00:03:04.079> inch<00:03:04.410> chunk<00:03:04.859> then<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:05.670> took<00:03:06.150> the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and cut a 12 inch chunk then I took the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.710 
and cut a 12 inch chunk then I took the
a<00:03:07.319> two<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> half<00:03:08.489> inch<00:03:08.730> strip<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.120> white<00:03:09.359> and
