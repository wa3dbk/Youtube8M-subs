00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
advice you know bulk up but if you gain

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
advice you know bulk up but if you gain
fat<00:00:54.600> easily<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> recipe<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.070> disaster

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
fat easily this is a recipe for disaster

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.880 
fat easily this is a recipe for disaster
and<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.539> try<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> restrict<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> try

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
and if you try to restrict and you try

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.650 
and if you try to restrict and you try
to<00:00:58.949> cut<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.850> won't<00:01:00.030> end<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to cut it you won't end up with that

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599 
to cut it you won't end up with that
same<00:01:00.930> physique<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.920> because<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.460> don't

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
same physique you want because you don't

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
same physique you want because you don't
really<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:02.969> foundation<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> muscle

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
really have that foundation of muscle

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
really have that foundation of muscle
underneath<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:05.129> gonna<00:01:05.430> assume<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.119> are

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
underneath I'm gonna assume if you are

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
underneath I'm gonna assume if you are
currently<00:01:06.540> skinny<00:01:07.049> fat<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
currently skinny fat that you're a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
currently skinny fat that you're a
beginner<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.909> within<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.689> first<00:01:10.080> year

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
or so of working out seriously taking it

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
or so of working out seriously taking it
serious<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> good<00:01:15.000> thing<00:01:15.060> because

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
serious and this is a good thing because

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
serious and this is a good thing because
as<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> beginner<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:16.979> advantage<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
as a beginner you can take advantage of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
as a beginner you can take advantage of
a<00:01:17.820> building<00:01:18.479> muscle<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> losing<00:01:19.530> fat<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
a building muscle and losing fat at the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.999 
a building muscle and losing fat at the
same<00:01:20.549> time<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.060> can't<00:01:21.390> happen<00:01:21.830> especially<00:01:22.830> if

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
same time it can't happen especially if

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
same time it can't happen especially if
you<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> beginner<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.509> approach

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you are a beginner so this approach

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330 
you are a beginner so this approach
might<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.530> different<00:01:25.799> than<00:01:26.130> maybe

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
might be a little different than maybe

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
might be a little different than maybe
other<00:01:26.580> advice<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> might<00:01:27.210> hear<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.570> there

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
other advice you might hear out there

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
other advice you might hear out there
but<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> approach<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> I've<00:01:29.400> seen

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but this is the approach that I've seen

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.030 
but this is the approach that I've seen
personally<00:01:30.090> work<00:01:30.600> time<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> time<00:01:31.500> again<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
personally work time and time again and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.160 
personally work time and time again and
work<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.610> efficiently<00:01:33.210> first<00:01:33.689> thing<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
work very efficiently first thing you

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
work very efficiently first thing you
need<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:35.009> determine<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.729> caloric

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
need to do is determine your caloric

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
first thing you want to do is you want

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.740 
first thing you want to do is you want
to<00:01:50.040> eat<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.670> caloric<00:01:51.060> maintenance<00:01:51.090> every

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
do for us is we're gonna give the body

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.630 
do for us is we're gonna give the body
just<00:01:57.810> enough<00:01:58.140> nutrients<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.860> build<00:01:59.100> muscle<00:01:59.520> as

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just enough nutrients to build muscle as

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
just enough nutrients to build muscle as
a<00:01:59.700> beginner<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.750> still<00:02:01.079> allow<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> create

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
a beginner but still allow you to create

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.130 
a beginner but still allow you to create
a<00:02:02.040> slight<00:02:02.310> death

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
a slight death

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.440 
a slight death
for<00:02:03.440> fat<00:02:03.740> loss<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:04.310> your<00:02:04.430> training<00:02:04.910> not

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
for fat loss for your training not

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.660 
for fat loss for your training not
through<00:02:05.780> cutting<00:02:06.110> calories<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.680> nutrition<00:02:07.220> so

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
through cutting calories on nutrition so

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.730 
through cutting calories on nutrition so
I<00:02:07.700> would<00:02:07.970> put<00:02:08.149> protein<00:02:08.600> at<00:02:08.869> about<00:02:09.259> one<00:02:09.530> gram

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
I would put protein at about one gram

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.800 
I would put protein at about one gram
per<00:02:10.009> pound<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.369> body<00:02:10.580> weight<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:11.450> fats

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
per pound of body weight your fats

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.380 
per pound of body weight your fats
around<00:02:12.170> 25%<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:13.310> your<00:02:13.370> total<00:02:13.430> calories<00:02:14.240> and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
around 25% of your total calories and

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.210 
around 25% of your total calories and
then<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.960> fill<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.290> rest<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.650> nutrients

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
then just fill the rest of the nutrients

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.850 
then just fill the rest of the nutrients
with<00:02:17.060> nutrient-dense<00:02:17.750> carbs<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:18.680> want

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
with nutrient-dense carbs so you want

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.200 
with nutrient-dense carbs so you want
carbs<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.370> are<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.670> keep<00:02:19.820> your<00:02:19.970> energy

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
carbs that are going to keep your energy

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.760 
carbs that are going to keep your energy

step<00:02:24.320> 2<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.890> thing<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.220> need<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.790> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
step 2 the thing you need to do is to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.120 
step 2 the thing you need to do is to
train<00:02:26.240> with<00:02:26.420> high<00:02:26.690> intensity<00:02:27.440> what<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.680> mean<00:02:27.920> by

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
train with high intensity what I mean by

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.949 
train with high intensity what I mean by
train<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.670> intensity<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.570> trained<00:02:29.840> with

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
train is and intensity is trained with

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.680 
train is and intensity is trained with
heavy<00:02:30.320> weight<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.830> focus<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.610> hypertrophy<00:02:32.240> so

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
heavy weight and focus on hypertrophy so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.050

your<00:03:03.200> body<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.650> anabolic<00:03:04.100> threshold

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
your body and the anabolic threshold

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.250 
your body and the anabolic threshold
because<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.270> response<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.930> your<00:03:06.050> body

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
because of the response that your body

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.170 
because of the response that your body
goes<00:03:06.530> through<00:03:06.560> with<00:03:07.340> hit<00:03:07.549> cardio<00:03:07.970> there's

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
goes through with hit cardio there's

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.180 
goes through with hit cardio there's
real<00:03:08.390> similar<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:08.930> weight<00:03:09.080> training<00:03:09.410> step<00:03:09.769> for

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
real similar to weight training step for

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.100 
real similar to weight training step for
what<00:03:10.519> we<00:03:10.640> need<00:03:10.820> to<00:03:10.940> do<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.330> improve<00:03:11.840> your

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
what we need to do is improve your

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.350 
what we need to do is improve your
insulin<00:03:12.560> sensitivity<00:03:13.160> for<00:03:13.820> all<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.209> this

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
insulin sensitivity for all of this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.880 
insulin sensitivity for all of this
stuff<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:14.810> talked<00:03:15.230> about<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.650> come

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
stuff I just talked about to come

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.979 
stuff I just talked about to come
together<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.370> mold<00:03:16.640> together<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.180> work<00:03:17.420> and

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
together and mold together and work and

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.140 
together and mold together and work and
what<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.260> mean<00:03:18.500> by<00:03:18.560> improving<00:03:19.459> your<00:03:19.640> insulin

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
what I mean by improving your insulin

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.360 
what I mean by improving your insulin
sensitivity<00:03:20.540> is<00:03:20.840> essentially<00:03:21.440> insulin

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
sensitivity is essentially insulin

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.190 
sensitivity is essentially insulin
sensitivity<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:23.150> how<00:03:23.510> well<00:03:23.720> your<00:03:23.840> body's

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
sensitivity is how well your body's

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.960 
sensitivity is how well your body's
going<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.440> use<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.739> insulin<00:03:25.340> when<00:03:25.820> that

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
going to use that insulin when that

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.240 
going to use that insulin when that
insulin<00:03:26.330> spike<00:03:26.600> happens<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.200> your<00:03:27.290> body<00:03:27.440> if

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
insulin spike happens in your body if

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
insulin spike happens in your body if
it's<00:03:28.459> gonna<00:03:28.580> use<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.000> build<00:03:29.209> muscle<00:03:29.660> versed

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
it's gonna use it to build muscle versed

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.320 
it's gonna use it to build muscle versed
or<00:03:30.200> fat<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.040> best<00:03:31.250> ways<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.880> this<00:03:32.060> are

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
or fat so the best ways to do this are

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.060 
or fat so the best ways to do this are
through<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.200> weight<00:03:33.380> training<00:03:33.709> that<00:03:33.920> you'll

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
through the weight training that you'll

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.710 
through the weight training that you'll
be<00:03:34.220> doing<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.850> high-intensity<00:03:35.209> weight

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
be doing the high-intensity weight

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.509 
be doing the high-intensity weight
training<00:03:35.959> with<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.200> heavier<00:03:36.560> weight<00:03:36.799> another

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
training with the heavier weight another

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.920 
training with the heavier weight another
thing<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.000> make<00:03:38.330> sure<00:03:38.360> you're<00:03:38.660> getting

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
making sure your carbs at this stage of

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.070
