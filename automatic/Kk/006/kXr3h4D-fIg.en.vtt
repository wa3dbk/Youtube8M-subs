00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:15.680
 two mid-range entry level reflexes 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:19.439
 they are the canon eos 750 of and the canon eos 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.820
 760 of first we ask amal with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 rossi di cannes in italy than here 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.609
 next to me because two cars like this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 close together but let's say this 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 theme that we are going to cover what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.669
 to the segment between an eos 600d and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.590
 however it remains in the range is a 70 lever 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.630
 of the ten was made because 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 however we are a bit at the limit of that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.290
 that the shift to more machines 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 advanced like 70's pro maybe there is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.910
 still doubt whether for the end user 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.770
 switch to a machine body that has a 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.920
 check more or stay for that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.250
 which is the classic against the level authority 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.950
 however, we expect one 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.410
 a parallel market of these two 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.010
 machines clearly 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.020
 as I said before with 760 of a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 compactness compared to 70 of then 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.090
 really who wants to choose one 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.190
 machine with LCD control in the car 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.420
 of some functions and also at the level 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.979
 video some more function 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.470
 definitely choose at 760 of the 750 is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.150
 the step more than 700 then 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 not only in megapixels at the level of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.320
 other features certainly 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.780
 we will put many doubts of the end user 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 but I think it is very useful to put gods 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.130
 doubts about you machines then the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 differences besides appearance why 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.990
 this one has a smaller body 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.119
 and this is a little bigger than they are 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.860
 practically this then the defense 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.640
 I'm in the car, the design is very 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.619
 more at advanced body level 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.950
 and that they are the ring that remembers much 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.140
 what in advanced ambit 70 sets 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.149
 of mark ii two machines beyond what 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 the entry level is the lock and the lock 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.280
 that this is also this machines 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.200
 more high end and not that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.220
 display above control clearly 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.840
 a smaller display than 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.160
 higher machines, however, gives you the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.289
 possibility of driving with three 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.319
 just check without just one 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.759
 a key but with a certain species 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.250
 machine functions inside 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.099
 of the car itself this to el akad 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.990
 yesterday in the digital zoom video in the video 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.390
 therefore a little bit more also at the level 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.010
 of internal functions 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.640
 let's talk about the features we say 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.440
 common first and foremost 24 megapixels that is 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.510
 that this is an extra leap compared to 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.209
 18 we have on the entry level band 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.420
 we have succeeded in developing this new one 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.630
 sensor when we get it 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.069
 that with these megapixels you could 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.770
 keep even the facts are come 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.209
 never kept 12800 ISO which we have in 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.319
 models like 700 of this is a lot 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.360
 important because under going up 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.319
 megapixel tended to be seen a 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.209
 past that the iso were lowered i 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.910
 Focus points are therefore 19 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.459
 compared to the new ones of the 700 of are the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.739
 same as 19 of the 70 of then one makes a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.989
 jump over what was a 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.670
 model below are all cross-shaped therefore 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.099
 sensibility 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.140
 in the movement an important appointment 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.510
 are the shots per second 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.800
 here too, however, we maintain five 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.290
 shots per second than another element 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.690
 important on this machine is the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.360
 speech of the video on these machines 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.209
 as in sm 3 we present the new 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.280
 hybrid system shows f third then 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.739
 greater reactivity May begins 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.660
 here ment of the subject not only with 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.450
 optical estimates but also with those vsm 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.099
 so anyway a video usage that 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.380
 it should not be compared to the 70 say one 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.940
 2 simon co and it is definitely evolution 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.680
 complete some video, however, some areas 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.720
 like the daytime one in which maybe instant 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.640
 light the two systems are very words 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.230
 very similar very close 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.470
 other features that have the 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.690
 machine the intelligent viewfinder that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.330
 always recalls that of the band 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.870
 as high as 70 of a 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.900
 control always have a lcd display from 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.310
 7 27 cm touchscreen that by now there is a 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.680
 feature in a stand of many 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.569
 other touchscreen and level models 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.959
 own connection are equipped with wi 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.359
 fi 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.900
 so this is also the first entry 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:16.530
 canon level with wifi inside to whom 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.010
 with faces you would recommend the 750 of and to whom 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.780
 he has 760 then the doubt I was saying 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.720
 before 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.060
 in the sense that in any case 750 of and who 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.350
 wants to go one step further than 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.880
 what maybe they could be 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.680
 machines from the past from entry level 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.060
 level 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.750
 at the level of features just 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:41.130
 explained is an evolution throughout the 760 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.990
 who can really be taking a 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.360
 car body without optics finds maybe 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.160
 the price is also close and appreciates everything 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.630
 the one who has control in the car 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.850
 he goes to look for this speech here 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.199
 control that draws a lot of one 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.210
 more advanced machine then bet or 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.660
 someone who has already authorized machines 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.550
 similar the segment better perhaps never 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.919
 pass wants to renew not maybe not 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.860
 circulates 70 through a solution 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.910
 so maybe more compact 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.720
 certainly compared to a mid segment 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.720
 they are more compact
