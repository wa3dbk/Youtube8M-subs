00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.660
 is I bring a new top of characters 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.390
 curious 5 curious characters in the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.180
 city ​​of saints in gta 5 and good the 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.730
 we will do this little tour will 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.939
 to be franklin this character the way 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.210
 history that we all know and to see that 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.060
 this guy teaches us because there 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.400
 very very very special characters that 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.400
 now we will see so in video 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.120
 and in number 5 we find the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.000
 mime and that's why it's there because it's a 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.640
 mime and nothing special but yes 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.860
 that you miss seeing someone here 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.590
 doing this on the street you go 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.510
 strolling through this great shopping street 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.580
 and others and you meet an uncle here 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.820
 at night or problem any time 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.760
 of the day doing his little job that 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.340
 is my mind does not read mears that will be I do not know 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.470
 but hey, I found this curious 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.449
 because the uncle sees you and is motivated and 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.759
 start there to do what you 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.619
 you want what happens is that you can not 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.690
 give money and if you give money I think 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.460
 that can get to the worst things like that 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.320
 Well, we'll leave you there and let's move on 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.040
 with the number 4 that sure is better 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.930
 that you and in number 4 we are 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 with the messiah 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.490
 is the messiah as it is pronounced that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.600
 name is strange weird trying to imitate 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.130
 the true Messiah who is Jesus because 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.759
 here we do not find it in this beautiful 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.140
 beach of the saints not so precious that 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.100
 is here Jesus has chosen his 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.630
 place of preaching the word of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.210
 God or I who know what this guy will do 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 here and the truth was that it was a bit 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.590
 little bit smoked for not saying it was 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.030
 totally smoked because if you put on 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.369
 talk to him as he finds himself 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 incredible stories that go fabric then 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.110
 well here we leave it the truth that if 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.460
 you want to talk to him 30 in want of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.759
 hit him a punch which is what I 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.369
 I do but it 's a very good character 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.100
 curious and it 's in number four like that 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.890
 that we go with the 3 quickly but 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:16.830
 before I would like to do this so 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.830
 come on let's go with the number 3 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.840
 and the number 3 we find the 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670
 boxing statue is worth a statue but 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.920
 boxeadora that of what it means for 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.630
 now we see that on that same beach in the 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.070
 beach of the saints we are here 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.770
 with a statue that we do not know if it's from 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.270
 wood of o stone that we have 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.410
 find here the people doing the photo 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.180
 I say if it's a normal statue and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.050
 current I'm going to observe them 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 slowly and we see there blinking what 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.880
 pussy to uncover for 'not moving 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.870
 a little and I say this I shit on everything 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.910
 hit and try to hit me that statue and 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.440
 from sand rock I do not know what it is 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 try to hit me try 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.150
 challenge me to a fist duel and we know 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.060
 like franklin franklin does not go with 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.770
 bullshit so we knocked it down and ready 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.070
 goodbye kid good and over I'm going to 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.940
 take the collection today to get you 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.810
 with franklin lad 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.030
 [Music] 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.520
 and now we are at number 2 and we have 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.930
 that go up 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.730
 above the map of the whole by 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.739
 airport end I know very 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.340
 far to find the old man 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.900
 dancing palet and the truth is that it is 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.790
 the one that has most struck me 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.530
 but it's not in number one because the 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.260
 number one has also fabric but good 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.790
 here we see it closer, we already see 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.700
 there the spirit and the truth that has 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.230
 to tell that spirit there of dancing myself 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.849
 I know the happiness that has that 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.390
 that Christmas is coming, I support that 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.650
 uncle uncle there 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.069
 dancing and the truth that I found very 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.050
 very very curious and let's see how how 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:04:05.150
 dance to the music 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:04:08.390
 [Music] 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.900
 and we already reached the top of this top with 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.090
 the number 1 the weingut zombie and good 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.539
 not where only this zombie performs is 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.280
 in the cinema area not where we see here 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.959
 to all the actors in stars stuck 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.729
 on the ground, we can not find this 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.030
 zombie and the truth that you can be 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.770
 talking to him and him because the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.509
 it's true that you do not have to be 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.910
 a lot of time for him because he could 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.490
 devour the brain you might not know what 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.030
 that you will make a zombie habitually 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.979
 good what I put in this number 1 of the top 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.020
 5 curious characters because I thought 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.300
 the most curious obviously but because 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.430
 awakens that curiosity that I can 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.800
 have a dlc of zombies in this 7 to 5 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.830
 as there were in other roster titles 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.510
 as a network dead so I hope there's 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.150
 this because you can have the best ass 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.470
 of the world if it is not already and I love them 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.599
 the zombies as he has already said so 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.039
 this top 1 goes for this very zombie 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.630
 funny by the way that you can 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.630
 talk to him you can laugh 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.500
 and good up to here this top of 5 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.730
