00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.450
 in addition to raising the level of the 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.670
 the melting of the glaciers 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.299
 may interfere with the currents 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.900
 marine 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:25.300
 but how and why we see it in this 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:30.340
 experiment two glasses two small 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.460
 equal containers hot water salt one 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 tray for making ice cubes 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.059
 food coloring a refrigerator 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.640
 mix the water at room temperature e 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.040
 the dye in a glass 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.800
 then pour into one of the molds of the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:55.149
 tray in another glass mixes 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:57.850
 water a pinch of salt and dye e 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:02.620
 Pour into the storage tray 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:05.950
 tray in the freezer when the water comes out 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.130
 cubes has frozen and pours much water 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.119
 tap water in the two glasses 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.880
 mix 2 tablespoons of salt and put the two 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.399
 ice cubes then wait for i 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.399
 two cubes melt completely 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 the water of the salty cube sinks down onto the 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.700
 bottom of the glass while the water 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 of the other cube remains on 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.649
 surface this happens because the water 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.619
 mixed with salt it becomes denser 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.210
 of fresh water and weighs it down 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.280
 moreover, cold water is still present 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.710
 more dense than water in the glass than 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 instead it was warm and then sinks 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.360
 fresh water from the second cube 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.400
 it floats on the surface because it is less 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.400
 dense with salt water in the glass 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.219
 the ocean water circulates due 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.289
 of its density differences 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.350
 in turn caused by differences in 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.119
 more water temperature and salinity 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.550
 cold and denser than hot water 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.039
 while salt water is denser 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.410
 fresh water heated water 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.260
 near the equator travels to the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.299
 surface of the ocean to the north towards the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.910
 cold latitude where it becomes more 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:23.519
 fresh when it cools becomes more 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.310
 dense and sinks into the deep ocean 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.410
 warmer surface water flows in 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.569
 take its place it cools 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.950
 sinks and so on 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.620
 melting sea ice 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.450
 but the Arctic could change this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.489
 model since recent research 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.650
 show that the ice is standing 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.360
 dissolving quickly with risk 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.890
 that the water circulation is 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 slowed down or even affirmed i 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 Paleoclimatologists have discovered that the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.500
 Gulf Stream is already stopped more 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.510
 times over the centuries causing 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.700
 rapid climate change e 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.980
 even ice ages 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.049
 paradoxically therefore heating 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.000
 global could lead to a sharp 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:05.180
 cooling in some areas of the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.180
 planet
