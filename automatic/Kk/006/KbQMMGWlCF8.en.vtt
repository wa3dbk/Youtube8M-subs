the different links same thing with the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.000 
the different links same thing with the
imagery<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.820> let's<00:01:48.180> go<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.900> images

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.740 

there

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.510 

it<00:01:57.050> opens<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.620> different<00:01:58.070> screen

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
it opens to the different screen

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it opens to the different screen
resolutions<00:01:59.950> oh<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.010> can<00:02:01.310> make<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.790> gesture

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
resolutions oh you can make a gesture

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.020 
resolutions oh you can make a gesture
and<00:02:02.720> if<00:02:02.870> you<00:02:03.050> go<00:02:03.320> past<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.740> next<00:02:04.040> next<00:02:04.580> image

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and if you go past the next next image

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.510 
and if you go past the next next image
so<00:02:05.300> that's<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.780> idea

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.600 
take also the ducks vs. into us and
naturally<00:02:32.630> we<00:02:32.810> are<00:02:32.990> we<00:02:33.920> are<00:02:34.040> still<00:02:34.310> supporting

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
naturally we are we are still supporting

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.790 
naturally we are we are still supporting
the<00:02:35.240> traditional<00:02:36.020> softkey<00:02:36.530> based

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the traditional softkey based

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.240 
the traditional softkey based
interaction<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.420> this<00:02:38.690> gives<00:02:38.900> more

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
interaction so this gives more

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.950 
interaction so this gives more
alternatives<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.790> end<00:02:41.030> users<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.750> for

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
alternatives for the end users and for

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.190 
alternatives for the end users and for
the<00:02:42.080> license<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.680> sort<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.040> taken<00:02:43.430> to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
the license is sort of taken to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.420 
the license is sort of taken to
different<00:02:45.200> kind<00:02:45.350> of<00:02:45.440> an<00:02:45.560> devices<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.310> they

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
different kind of an devices and they

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.790 
different kind of an devices and they
can<00:02:46.610> choose<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.850> type<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.750> Tom's<00:02:48.200> device<00:02:48.590> they

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
can choose the type of Tom's device they

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.790 
can choose the type of Tom's device they
really<00:02:49.100> like<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.490> have

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
really like to have

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.550 
really like to have
so<00:02:51.730> actually<00:02:52.090> was<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:52.990> then<00:02:53.140> look<00:02:53.320> very

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
so actually was and then look very

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980 
so actually was and then look very
different<00:02:53.910> they<00:02:54.910> might<00:02:55.090> be<00:02:55.270> devices<00:02:55.810> with

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
different they might be devices with

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.650 
different they might be devices with
this<00:02:56.170> kind<00:02:56.380> of<00:02:56.470> took<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.710> couple<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.250> bbqs<00:02:57.880> or

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
this kind of took a couple of bbqs or

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.200 
this kind of took a couple of bbqs or
they<00:02:59.320> might<00:02:59.500> be<00:02:59.680> advanced<00:03:00.040> devices<00:03:00.490> with<00:03:00.940> him

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
they might be advanced devices with him

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.840 
they might be advanced devices with him
better<00:03:01.450> than<00:03:01.570> equal<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.140> 0<00:03:02.410> V<00:03:02.680> t9<00:03:03.100> keyboard<00:03:03.130> and

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
better than equal to 0 V t9 keyboard and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.270 
better than equal to 0 V t9 keyboard and
so<00:03:04.030> on
