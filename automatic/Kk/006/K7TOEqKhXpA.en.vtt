 true story dating series stalker this 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.349
 was 2007 it was a period of life when 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.719
 young girls loved tokio hotel 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.240
 although, incidentally, I myself am fooled by them 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.480
 once when we were returning with homer 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.769
 Well, like the type of freedom davalka bandits and the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.950
 a similar genius came to my mind 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.880
 the idea is that if you make your grouping 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 the school 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 even said nothing in response and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.469

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.050
 however at the end of our country dialogue i 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.860
 said 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.560
 dialogue physics began to evolve and somehow 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.860
 day by day we started to support 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
