00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.890
 normally those that are already there 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.170
 without peel they are toasted then 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.079
 not suitable for raw food 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.199

 one tablespoon of sultanas already has 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.479
 let go of a pinch of sea salt 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.200

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.890

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.180
 half cucumber and ground pepper 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.400
 fresh a pinch we cut into pieces the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.610
 pepper too coarse because so much 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.689
 then we'll close everything that's enough 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.270
 for now we must do nothing but 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.680
 put all the ingredients in the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.680
 mix container 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.040

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.870
 fresh and flies some pumpkin seeds 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.970
 we divide the half cucumber into two 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.820
 we deprive the cucumber of internal seeds 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:40.920
 with the help maybe with auditor just for 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.560
 we decided to make us a cucumber and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.730
 but you can very well accompany it with 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:04.140
 other types of vegetables and we have it 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.140
 so called for the green color for 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:10.829
 this intensity reminded us of the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.840
 skin of the incredible hulk and then for the 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.000
 taste that is very strong 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.200
