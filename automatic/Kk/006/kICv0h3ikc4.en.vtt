now this is pretty simple and pretty

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.850 
now this is pretty simple and pretty
straightforward<00:03:28.629> and<00:03:28.810> sometimes<00:03:29.439> takes<00:03:29.739> a

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
straightforward and sometimes takes a

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.130 
straightforward and sometimes takes a

couple of tries just follow the
on-screen<00:03:32.319> instructions<00:03:33.099> and<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.819> will<00:03:34.000> work

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
on-screen instructions and it will work

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:44.789 
on-screen instructions and it will work

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
time and sometimes it takes computers

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.720 
time and sometimes it takes computers
