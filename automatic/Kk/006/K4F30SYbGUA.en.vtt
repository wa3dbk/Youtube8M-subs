00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
you did it it might be similar to look

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.469 
you did it it might be similar to look
but<00:01:26.560> what<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.740> have<00:01:27.009> is<00:01:27.039> different<00:01:27.940> settings

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
but what I have is different settings

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.940 
but what I have is different settings
and<00:01:28.570> they're<00:01:28.750> all<00:01:28.899> right<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.320> same<00:01:29.560> blocks

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
and they're all right the same blocks

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.230 
and they're all right the same blocks

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
basically it's five areas so and they

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.430 
basically it's five areas so and they
get<00:01:34.390> progressively<00:01:34.570> harder

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
get progressively harder

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:49.149 
get progressively harder
oh<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.920> healthy<00:01:42.280> running<00:01:42.490> drop
