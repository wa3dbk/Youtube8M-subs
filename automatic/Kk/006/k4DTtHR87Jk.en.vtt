00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
it coming out and guys in my honest

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.890 
it coming out and guys in my honest
opinion<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.830> definitely<00:00:58.340> think<00:00:59.000> we<00:00:59.300> will<00:00:59.690> be

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
opinion I definitely think we will be

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.590 
opinion I definitely think we will be
seeing<00:01:00.230> some<00:01:00.740> type<00:01:01.040> of<00:01:01.070> information<00:01:01.600> this

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
seeing some type of information this

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.069 
seeing some type of information this
year<00:01:03.080> at<00:01:03.230> e3<00:01:03.850> now<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.909> reason<00:01:05.150> I<00:01:05.449> say<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.810> is

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
year at e3 now the reason I say that is

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:08.919 
year at e3 now the reason I say that is
because<00:01:06.289> at<00:01:06.829> e3<00:01:07.189> that's<00:01:07.969> where<00:01:08.240> most<00:01:08.479> game

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929 
because at e3 that's where most game

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.200 
because at e3 that's where most game
publishers<00:01:09.590> go<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.249> that<00:01:10.490> they<00:01:10.579> can<00:01:10.759> show<00:01:10.999> off

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
publishers go so that they can show off

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.300 
publishers go so that they can show off
what<00:01:11.539> they've<00:01:11.780> been<00:01:12.020> working<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.649> now<00:01:13.070> while

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
what they've been working on now while

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.060 
what they've been working on now while
this<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.729> not<00:01:13.969> absolutely<00:01:14.780> confirmed<00:01:15.409> from<00:01:15.710> 4j

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
this is not absolutely confirmed from 4j

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.239 
this is not absolutely confirmed from 4j
studios<00:01:16.490> or<00:01:16.759> from<00:01:17.149> e3<00:01:17.359> just<00:01:18.229> by<00:01:18.439> looking<00:01:19.039> at

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
studios or from e3 just by looking at

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:21.760 
studios or from e3 just by looking at
the<00:01:19.490> time<00:01:19.819> frame<00:01:20.210> if<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.869> next<00:01:21.170> big<00:01:21.350> update

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
the time frame if the next big update

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.340 
the time frame if the next big update
does<00:01:22.100> not<00:01:22.340> come<00:01:22.670> out<00:01:22.700> sometime<00:01:23.630> within<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
does not come out sometime within the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.950 
does not come out sometime within the
next<00:01:24.439> week<00:01:24.950> or<00:01:25.219> week<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:25.939> half<00:01:25.969> then<00:01:26.630> that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
next week or week and a half then that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.319 
next week or week and a half then that
means<00:01:27.229> it<00:01:27.499> will<00:01:27.619> be<00:01:27.770> lined<00:01:28.100> up<00:01:28.329> absolutely

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
means it will be lined up absolutely

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.459 
means it will be lined up absolutely
perfectly<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:30.530> be<00:01:30.710> showcased<00:01:31.399> at<00:01:31.639> e3<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.139> again

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
perfectly to be showcased at e3 so again

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.609 
perfectly to be showcased at e3 so again
this<00:01:33.679> is<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.460> speculation<00:01:34.719> but<00:01:35.719> III<00:01:36.319> is

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
this is just speculation but III is

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.279 
this is just speculation but III is
happening<00:01:37.249> between<00:01:37.460> june<00:01:38.030> sixteenth<00:01:38.630> through

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
happening between june sixteenth through

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.340 
happening between june sixteenth through
the<00:01:39.439> 18th<00:01:39.920> so<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:40.579> my<00:01:40.850> opinion<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:41.749> my

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the 18th so in my opinion that's my

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.739 
the 18th so in my opinion that's my
prediction<00:01:42.710> for<00:01:43.340> when<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:44.030> will<00:01:44.179> either<00:01:44.329> get

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
prediction for when we will either get

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.959 
prediction for when we will either get
the<00:01:44.929> next<00:01:45.170> big<00:01:45.319> update<00:01:45.649> or<00:01:46.009> get<00:01:46.399> like<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.759> new
