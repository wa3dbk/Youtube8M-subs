00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.070
 mob 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.200
 had to bring the bill to devastating 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.409
 but unfortunately more goals scored in 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.479
 this match, the spectators did not see we 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.760
 here with the leaders we play well 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.940
 middling we have problems like a ghetto 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.039
 it was a little alarming 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.440
 additionally talked with the guys 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.870
 despise and asked for as much as possible 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.870
 tuned and of course I wanted 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.599
 to score at normal in the scenario to score 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.890
 longer somewhere tired 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.200
 because of this fatigue 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.080
 we have errors which do not 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.380
 should be well and tired because we 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.870
 almost 12 people 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.660
 you dragged yourself to the championship should be 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.290
 think already future and search somewhere 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.600
 equivalent to the replacement could have been 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.240
 and competition was interchangeability 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.640
 so if something work already in 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.920
 next saturday in Odessa mfc nikolaev 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.420
