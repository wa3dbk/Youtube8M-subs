desktop use so we are checking out the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.060 
desktop use so we are checking out the
g5<00:00:16.109> 10s<00:00:16.650> which<00:00:17.550> retails<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.350> $120<00:00:19.350> which<00:00:19.890> is

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
g5 10s which retails for $120 which is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.820 
g5 10s which retails for $120 which is
the<00:00:20.189> same<00:00:20.400> price<00:00:20.670> tag<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.449> original<00:00:21.960> g5<00:00:22.439> 10

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the same price tag as the original g5 10

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
the same price tag as the original g5 10
so<00:00:23.550> let's<00:00:23.580> check<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.090> exactly<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.960> has

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
here and there the keyboards physical

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
here and there the keyboards physical
characteristics<00:00:56.160> haven't<00:00:56.430> changed<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:57.210> the

non<00:01:08.790> mechanical<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.170> do<00:01:10.320> have<00:01:10.500> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
non mechanical so we do have this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
non mechanical so we do have this
general<00:01:11.220> membrane<00:01:11.820> switches<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
general membrane switches and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
general membrane switches and
considering<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> direction<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.280> most<00:01:14.490> gaming

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
considering the direction of most gaming

they're<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.780> easy<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.409> program<00:02:01.619> with<00:02:01.979> a

this<00:02:09.149> very<00:02:09.450> useful<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.140> gaming<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
this very useful for gaming but for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460 
this very useful for gaming but for

just<00:02:14.069> have<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> remember<00:02:14.490> what<00:02:14.910> key<00:02:15.209> does<00:02:15.540> what

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
just have to remember what key does what

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.050 
just have to remember what key does what
now<00:02:16.620> we<00:02:16.739> do<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.860> three<00:02:17.400> different<00:02:17.640> modes

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
now we do have three different modes

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.840 
now we do have three different modes
choose<00:02:18.630> from<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.260> each<00:02:19.739> profile<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.670> register

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

keys<00:02:24.420> now<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.350> may<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.770> little<00:02:26.069> overkill<00:02:26.700> but

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
