00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.990
 although I'll show you how I bleach 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.860
 or if it's called the half-baked form 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.050
 the broccoli 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.620
 and there is the boiling water only you 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.039
 put a little salt I'm going to add the 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.939
 broccoli 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.939
 ah 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.820
 and I'll leave it a minute 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 and it turned off immediately afterwards what 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.830
 let's drain and pass in a stop 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.310
 that we have prepared or refractory with 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:52.590
 water with ice to pay for cooking 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:54.610
 that is already draining this is good 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.000
 Quick 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.400
 and I'm going to pass it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.930
 before I would try that I already have water 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.100
 knowledge because you do not owe 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.140
 to be so many children but firm 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.600
 sights 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.400
 you can try it can penetrate the nail well 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.370
 since that one that is already then there is 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.130
 to start the cooking so that it does not 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.220
 they have as well-known as squares 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.440
 they do not want to be firm 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.990
 the broccoli ok then we left it there 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.660
 a while after they finish cooling 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 good look today I wanted to share with you 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.770
 the way I prepare the salad 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.030
 of pasta is a screw that calls 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.600
 this pasta is good you have to 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.050
 cooking according as said gives the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.370
 box or the package where it divides the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:54.340
 Pasta is approximately 79 minutes 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.320
 the cooking time and good after 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.760
 that drains it is that it does not happen to you 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.090
 cooked because it must also be 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.800
 sign the drained if you leave the stop 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.860
 to cool it down and put cold water on 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.479
 rinse with cold water as cold as 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.870
 you can and 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.170
 to the drain and after having 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.670
 bleached our broccoli 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.670
 this as 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.020
 because everything else is this, go integrating 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.060
 all the ingredients look I put 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.820

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.650
 to cut but well more or less I 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.650
 I cut a can of corn kernels 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.960
 in spinach, because here I have some 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.100

 the tomato 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.180

 let me go back a little 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.109

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.160
 Well, our salad has already been left 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.830
