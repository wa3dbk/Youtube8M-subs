legato and Samba land Avicii cellos I'll
start<00:00:30.829> with<00:00:30.919> the<00:00:31.039> ensemble<00:00:31.369> as<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:32.270> mentioned

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
start with the ensemble as I mentioned

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.720 
start with the ensemble as I mentioned
in<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.020> violins<00:00:33.530> videos<00:00:33.890> these<00:00:34.430> instruments

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
in the violins videos these instruments

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.880 
in the violins videos these instruments
are<00:00:34.970> designed<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.420> be<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:35.930> expressive<00:00:36.590> and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
are designed to be really expressive and

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.770 
are designed to be really expressive and
also<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.309> play<00:00:37.610> really<00:00:37.820> fast<00:00:37.940> we're<00:00:38.600> getting

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
also to play really fast we're getting

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.079 
also to play really fast we're getting
away<00:00:38.870> from<00:00:38.989> the<00:00:39.379> sluggishness<00:00:39.830> and<00:00:40.220> suction

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:41.089

that you find in a lot of gato
instruments<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.940> we're<00:00:44.059> also<00:00:44.180> keeping

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
instruments but we're also keeping

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.390
