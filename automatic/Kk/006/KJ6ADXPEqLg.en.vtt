00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.020 
got I'm not so fond of and they're not
too<00:00:43.359> bad<00:00:43.510> I<00:00:43.780> suppose<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:45.219> I<00:00:45.370> think<00:00:45.789> the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
too bad I suppose really I think the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.669 
too bad I suppose really I think the
only<00:00:46.269> good<00:00:46.389> thing<00:00:46.569> about<00:00:46.600> these<00:00:46.959> is<00:00:47.199> I<00:00:47.319> can<00:00:47.469> see

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
only good thing about these is I can see

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.079 
only good thing about these is I can see
through<00:00:47.920> them<00:00:48.039> well<00:00:48.249> no<00:00:48.399> that's<00:00:48.579> quite<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.879> good

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
through them well no that's quite a good

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:52.079 
through them well no that's quite a good
thing<00:00:49.120> really<00:00:49.499> but<00:00:50.499> these<00:00:51.339> are<00:00:51.519> the<00:00:51.579> glasses<00:00:51.819> I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
thing really but these are the glasses I

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.180 
thing really but these are the glasses I
had<00:00:52.299> when<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.539> was<00:00:52.690> about<00:00:52.899> 15<00:00:53.109> and<00:00:53.469> 16<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.010> might

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
had when I was about 15 and 16 you might

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.049 
had when I was about 15 and 16 you might
have<00:00:54.309> seen<00:00:54.489> them<00:00:54.699> before

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
have seen them before

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.129 
have seen them before
if<00:00:55.539> you've<00:00:55.780> seen<00:00:55.959> my<00:00:56.079> videos<00:00:56.499> specific<00:00:57.339> videos

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:58.139 
if you've seen my videos specific videos

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:01.889 
if you've seen my videos specific videos
so<00:00:59.139> I<00:00:59.170> think<00:00:59.409> all<00:00:59.799> in<00:00:59.829> all<00:01:00.069> probably<00:01:00.899> these

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
so I think all in all probably these

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.410 
so I think all in all probably these
ones<00:01:02.199> are<00:01:02.499> an<00:01:02.949> improvement<00:01:03.339> on<00:01:03.609> that<00:01:03.639> anyway

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
ones are an improvement on that anyway

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.110 
ones are an improvement on that anyway
I'm<00:01:05.409> not<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.950> big<00:01:06.310> fan<00:01:06.549> of<00:01:06.609> glasses<00:01:06.939> but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.520 

but<00:01:11.120> they're<00:01:11.330> better<00:01:11.479> than<00:01:11.720> nothing<00:01:12.140> so

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
but they're better than nothing so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.300 
but they're better than nothing so
that's<00:01:12.860> quite<00:01:13.100> good

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
that's quite good

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.440 
that's quite good
another<00:01:13.610> thing<00:01:13.790> I've<00:01:13.909> been<00:01:13.940> doing<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.420> last

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
another thing I've been doing the last

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.560 
another thing I've been doing the last
couple<00:01:14.870> of<00:01:14.900> days<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.530> um<00:01:16.430> I've<00:01:16.820> been<00:01:16.880> walking<00:01:17.510> a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
couple of days is um I've been walking a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.450 
couple of days is um I've been walking a
lot<00:01:17.690> because<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.140> felt<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:18.800> I<00:01:18.890> put<00:01:19.190> on<00:01:19.280> some

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
lot because I felt like I put on some

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.109 
lot because I felt like I put on some
weight<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.720> really<00:01:21.470> wanted<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:21.830> not<00:01:22.670> be

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
weight and I really wanted to not be

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:25.330 
weight and I really wanted to not be
quite<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.100> weighty

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
quite so weighty

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.490 
quite so weighty
it<00:01:25.970> wasn't<00:01:26.330> a<00:01:26.360> great<00:01:26.750> danger<00:01:26.990> play<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:27.440> I

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
it wasn't a great danger play but I

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.380 
it wasn't a great danger play but I
think<00:01:27.710> it's<00:01:27.830> hay<00:01:27.979> fever<00:01:28.340> season<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.090> had

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
think it's hay fever season and I had

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.590 
think it's hay fever season and I had
I've<00:01:30.020> been<00:01:30.320> trying<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.650> take<00:01:30.830> antihistamines

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
I've been trying to take antihistamines

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.170 
I've been trying to take antihistamines
to<00:01:32.600> make<00:01:32.780> myself<00:01:32.960> feel<00:01:33.830> less<00:01:34.130> hay<00:01:34.340> fever<00:01:34.729> and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
to make myself feel less hay fever and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
to make myself feel less hay fever and
they<00:01:35.270> weren't<00:01:35.509> really<00:01:35.660> working<00:01:36.080> as

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
they weren't really working as

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.930 
they weren't really working as
antihistamines<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.220> they<00:01:37.340> did<00:01:37.490> make<00:01:37.640> me<00:01:37.790> very

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
antihistamines but they did make me very

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.120 
antihistamines but they did make me very
very<00:01:38.119> hungry<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.900> put<00:01:39.140> on<00:01:39.259> quite<00:01:39.770> a<00:01:39.890> lot<00:01:39.979> of

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
very hungry and put on quite a lot of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.520 
very hungry and put on quite a lot of
weight<00:01:40.310> quite<00:01:40.550> quickly<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.270> I<00:01:42.170> didn't

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
weight quite quickly and I didn't

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.620 
weight quite quickly and I didn't
realize<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:42.950> was<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.130> side<00:01:43.640> effect<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.240> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
realize that was a side effect but I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.330 
realize that was a side effect but I
looked<00:01:44.960> them<00:01:45.080> up<00:01:45.170> online<00:01:45.350> after<00:01:45.950> I<00:01:45.979> thought<00:01:46.160> I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
looked them up online after I thought I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.100 
looked them up online after I thought I
thought<00:01:46.610> up<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:47.119> there's<00:01:47.509> something<00:01:47.750> going

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
thought up this there's something going

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.380 
thought up this there's something going
on<00:01:48.200> here<00:01:48.380> what's<00:01:48.590> going<00:01:48.830> on<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.100> it<00:01:49.850> was<00:01:50.030> I

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
on here what's going on and it was I

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.060 
on here what's going on and it was I
think<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.990> antihistamines<00:01:51.740> for<00:01:51.830> that's

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
think the antihistamines for that's

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.389 
think the antihistamines for that's
alright<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.020> back<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.289> normal<00:01:54.740> more<00:01:55.009> or<00:01:55.220> less

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
alright so back to normal more or less

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.160 
alright so back to normal more or less
still<00:01:55.789> a<00:01:55.850> bit<00:01:56.090> more<00:01:56.830> big<00:01:57.830> than<00:01:58.130> usual<00:01:59.170> not

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
still a bit more big than usual not

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.570

around<00:02:00.380> there<00:02:00.560> that's<00:02:00.920> one<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.369> places

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
around there that's one of the places

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.850

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.670 

that's<00:02:59.480> really<00:02:59.750> weird<00:02:59.960> because<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.350> can<00:03:00.500> just

two of them have got glass and better

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.530 
two of them have got glass and better
than<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.520> see<00:03:07.700> without<00:03:08.000> them<00:03:08.209> because<00:03:08.420> I've

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
than I can see without them because I've

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.510 
than I can see without them because I've
got<00:03:08.720> very<00:03:08.990> bad<00:03:09.260> eyes<00:03:09.530> I've<00:03:09.860> got<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> stigmatism

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
got very bad eyes I've got a stigmatism

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.790 
got very bad eyes I've got a stigmatism
in<00:03:10.819> that<00:03:11.810> one<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.840> they're<00:03:14.840> really<00:03:15.200> really<00:03:15.560> bad

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
in that one so they're really really bad

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.830 
in that one so they're really really bad
I<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> would<00:03:16.520> cost<00:03:16.640> millions<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.600> pounds

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
I think it would cost millions of pounds

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.230 
I think it would cost millions of pounds
to<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.410> laser<00:03:18.650> surgery<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:19.550> really

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
to have laser surgery I don't really

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.300 
to have laser surgery I don't really
trust<00:03:20.750> that<00:03:20.900> sort<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.350> sticking<00:03:21.860> things<00:03:22.100> in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
trust that sort of sticking things in

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.610 
trust that sort of sticking things in
your<00:03:22.459> eyes<00:03:22.610> things<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:23.270> contact<00:03:24.170> lenses<00:03:24.560> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
your eyes things so contact lenses and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.590 
your eyes things so contact lenses and
glasses<00:03:25.160> for<00:03:25.310> me<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:25.670> these<00:03:26.270> were<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
glasses for me and these were the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.630 
glasses for me and these were the
cheapest<00:03:26.989> frames<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.440> could<00:03:27.650> find<00:03:27.950> for

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
cheapest frames that I could find for

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.060 
cheapest frames that I could find for
the<00:03:29.030> lenses<00:03:29.480> because<00:03:29.900> I've<00:03:30.290> got<00:03:30.560> very<00:03:30.770> thick

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
the lenses because I've got very thick

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.460 
the lenses because I've got very thick
lenses<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.730> if<00:03:32.150> they're<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.930> big<00:03:33.080> as<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.320> ones

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
lenses and if they're as big as the ones

I had when I was 16 my eyes are worse
than<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.600> then<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:37.250> lenses<00:03:37.730> will<00:03:37.880> probably

just<00:03:41.090> be<00:03:41.180> impossible<00:03:41.330> anyway<00:03:42.080> that's<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:42.650> cool

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
just be impossible anyway that's a cool

just be impossible anyway that's a cool
that's<00:03:43.370> all<00:03:43.550> I'm<00:03:43.700> going<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.880> say<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.510> was<00:03:44.630> a
