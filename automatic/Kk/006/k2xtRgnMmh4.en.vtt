00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
components to look at here the first one

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.170 
components to look at here the first one
is<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.480> keywords<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.350> you're<00:03:11.560> using<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
is the keywords that you're using you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.539 
is the keywords that you're using you
need<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.480> identify<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.680> best<00:03:14.950> search

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
need to identify the best search

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.310 
need to identify the best search

potential customers who are actually

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.410 
potential customers who are actually
ready<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:20.109> buy<00:03:20.410> your<00:03:20.709> products<00:03:21.670> or<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.120> engage

ready to buy your products or to engage
your<00:03:22.900> services<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.489> may<00:03:24.940> not<00:03:25.090> always<00:03:25.150> be

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
your services so that may not always be

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.740 
your services so that may not always be
the<00:03:25.750> most<00:03:26.200> obvious<00:03:26.470> keywords<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.390> may

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
the most obvious keywords that you may

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.280 
the most obvious keywords that you may
think<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.880> once<00:03:30.880> you've<00:03:31.120> identified<00:03:31.390> these

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
think of so once you've identified these

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.060 
think of so once you've identified these
expressions<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:34.120> next<00:03:34.510> component<00:03:34.690> is<00:03:35.290> to

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
expressions the next component is to

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.690 
expressions the next component is to
optimize<00:03:36.900> those<00:03:37.900> key<00:03:38.260> words<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.400> pages

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
optimize those key words on the pages

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.300 
optimize those key words on the pages
themselves<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:41.019> this<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.350> called<00:03:41.530> on-page

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
themselves so this is called on-page

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430 
themselves so this is called on-page
optimization<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:43.720> want<00:03:43.959> to<00:03:44.109> use<00:03:44.230> those

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
optimization you want to use those

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.310 
optimization you want to use those

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
web pages themselves this means that

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.650

proprietary backlinking strategy and for
local<00:04:31.610> business<00:04:32.150> sites<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:33.280> probably<00:04:34.280> would

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
local business sites this probably would

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.090 
local business sites this probably would
have<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:34.850> much<00:04:35.150> more<00:04:35.600> simplified<00:04:36.080> version<00:04:36.980> of

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
have a much more simplified version of

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.280 
have a much more simplified version of
this<00:04:37.310> but<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.060> principle<00:04:38.510> certainly<00:04:38.960> remains

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
this but the principle certainly remains

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.230 
this but the principle certainly remains
the<00:04:39.500> same<00:04:39.710> if<00:04:39.890> you<00:04:40.010> imagine<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.760> is<00:04:41.030> your

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
the same if you imagine this is your

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.790 
the same if you imagine this is your
main<00:04:41.510> website<00:04:41.830> here<00:04:43.000> you<00:04:44.000> have<00:04:44.800> peripheral

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
main website here you have peripheral

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.940 
main website here you have peripheral
websites<00:04:46.580> pointing<00:04:47.330> in<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.350> site<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
websites pointing in to that site and

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.930 
websites pointing in to that site and
the<00:04:49.850> idea<00:04:50.270> is<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.420> get<00:04:50.660> as<00:04:50.810> many<00:04:51.080> different

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
the idea is to get as many different

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.060 
the idea is to get as many different
types<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.300> links<00:04:54.020> going<00:04:54.440> in<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:54.890> you'd<00:04:55.010> have

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
types of links going in so you'd have

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.360 
types of links going in so you'd have
