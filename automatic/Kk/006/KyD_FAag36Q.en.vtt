confirmed<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.660> pizza<00:02:52.989> kit<00:02:53.170> with<00:02:53.680> some<00:02:53.920> of

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
confirmed in this pizza kit with some of

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.660 
confirmed in this pizza kit with some of
the<00:02:54.100> gummies

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
the gummies

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.050 
the gummies
so<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.360> gummies<00:02:55.690> are<00:02:55.930> Goonies<00:02:56.850> one<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.940> them

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
so the gummies are Goonies one of them

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.790 
so the gummies are Goonies one of them
is<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.330> green<00:02:58.810> thing<00:02:59.080> and<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.470> don't<00:02:59.680> know<00:02:59.739> if

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
is this green thing and I don't know if

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.080 
is this green thing and I don't know if
you<00:02:59.890> can<00:03:00.040> see<00:03:00.250> it<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.700> shaped<00:03:00.790> like<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
you can see it but it's shaped like a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.880 
you can see it but it's shaped like a
leaf<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.140> think<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.530> supposed<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.830> be

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
leaf so I think that's supposed to be

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.290 
leaf so I think that's supposed to be
like<00:03:03.070> basil<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.930> uncommon<00:03:05.290> pizza<00:03:05.890> Mago<00:03:06.160> mm<00:03:06.730> as

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
like basil not uncommon pizza Mago mm as

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.910 
like basil not uncommon pizza Mago mm as
basil<00:03:07.630> etc<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.850> in<00:03:09.970> this<00:03:10.090> case<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.680> green

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
basil etc but in this case it's a green

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
basil etc but in this case it's a green
gummy<00:03:12.190> now<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.330> other<00:03:13.510> ingredient<00:03:14.050> is

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
gummy now but the other ingredient is

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.500 
gummy now but the other ingredient is
very<00:03:14.200> unique<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.800> Japan<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.190> think<00:03:15.370> um<00:03:16.209> it's

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
very unique to Japan I think um it's

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.500 
very unique to Japan I think um it's
this<00:03:17.230> you<00:03:18.070> see<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.400> it's<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.030> little<00:03:19.180> shrimp

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
this you see that it's a little shrimp

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.930 
this you see that it's a little shrimp
so<00:03:20.500> it's<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.829> pink<00:03:21.010> shrimp<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.760> very

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
so it's a pink shrimp so it's very

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.729 
so it's a pink shrimp so it's very
common<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.450> have<00:03:22.570> pizza<00:03:23.049> at<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.290> head<00:03:23.470> shrimp

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
common to have pizza at the head shrimp

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.410 
common to have pizza at the head shrimp
on<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.090> go<00:03:25.090> figure

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
on it go figure

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.600 
on it go figure

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.499 
so you've got the height you you've got
this<00:04:25.030> kind<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.360> sourness<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.850> it's<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:28.000> bit<00:04:28.150> wet

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
this kind of sourness and it's a bit wet

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:35.270 
this kind of sourness and it's a bit wet
so<00:04:28.780> it's<00:04:29.050> very<00:04:29.229> interesting<00:04:32.820> hmm

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
so it's very interesting hmm

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.480 
so it's very interesting hmm
but<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.430> me<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.669> really<00:04:36.910> makes<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.340> it

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
but to me this really makes it it is it

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.360 
but to me this really makes it it is it
a<00:04:39.520> real<00:04:39.759> punch<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.599> citric<00:04:41.020> acid<00:04:41.440> or<00:04:41.560> whatever

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
a real punch of citric acid or whatever

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.800 
a real punch of citric acid or whatever
they<00:04:42.610> put<00:04:42.789> in<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.330> make<00:04:43.449> it<00:04:43.570> release

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
they put in that to make it release

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.839 
they put in that to make it release
heart<00:04:44.080> knob<00:04:44.440> some<00:04:44.680> enough<00:04:44.919> cheese<00:04:46.380> hmm<00:04:47.440> yeah

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
heart knob some enough cheese hmm yeah

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.490 
heart knob some enough cheese hmm yeah
really<00:04:48.849> it's<00:04:49.090> hard<00:04:50.190> but<00:04:51.190> very<00:04:51.520> very<00:04:52.270> great<00:04:52.840> and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500
