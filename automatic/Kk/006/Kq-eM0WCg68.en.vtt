00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
to a custom game 20 or 15 I made at 20

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.700 
to a custom game 20 or 15 I made at 20
because<00:00:16.619> I'm<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.240> really<00:00:18.240> good<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.600> that

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
because I'm just really good like that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
reason why is because you start out with

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.759

I<00:00:23.340> don't<00:00:23.820> know<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.269> points<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.410> i<00:00:25.439> could<00:00:25.680> get

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I don't know more points so i could get

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.450 
I don't know more points so i could get
juggernog<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.519> quick<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.439> grab<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
more you could keep on going but as soon

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510
