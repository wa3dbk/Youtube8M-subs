00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.119
 undoubtedly the best-known myth of the century 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 Last is the monster of Loch Ness 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.640
 we leave until europe 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.110
 inquire and the existence of next and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.669
 as the locals call it 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.500
 simply a myth or it is a 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.310
 prehistoric animal that shares this 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.470
 was with us 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.449
 maybe you heard about 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.859
 mythical marine monsters that from time to time 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.689
 when they come to the surface to 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.879
 surprise of the human being the 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.710
 Cryptozoology is responsible for studying 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.170
 this kind of beings that are sometimes 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 mutations of some species but of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.620
 have a classic in regards to this 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.140
 phenomenon is referred to is the legendary 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.940
 ness lake monster in scotland a 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.980
 gigantic animal that has been calling the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.870
 attention for hundreds of years and it 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.570
 hide in this site more than 37 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.120
 kilometers of extension and 226 meters of 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.040
 depth a perfect place so that 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.040
 an unknown species can hide 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.280
 in 1936 this image came to light 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 It was captured in an old camera 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.899
 cinema there you get to see something that emerges 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.000
 of the water as if it were a 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.000
 gigantic snake observe 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.030
 not long ago in that same place 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.860
 again he was caught on video another 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.689
 possible appearance of nes hma as they have 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.420
 called in that locality to this monster 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.130
 marine observe is something that alerted by 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.509
 complete to the people who 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 they found in boats 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 Y 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.490
 time later another boat will 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.429
 I found in Loch Ness and again 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.530
 this strange being appeared in 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.599
 this time the fearful person who 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.459
 had the video camera tried to call 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.050
 the attention of his classmates so that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.769
 they will witness what was under the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.959
 water but nobody listens to him he follows 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.810
 recording and left for posterity this 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.760
 video unfortunately though clearly 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.620
 you see that there is something under the water is not 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.940
 can assure that it really is 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.940
 of the so-called ness lake monster 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.319
 chance will be the same creature 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.540
 of which was spoken during so much 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.610
 time or it is simply a kind 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.010
 unknown marine that comes out in some 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.950
 season of the year and maybe it's not 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.720
 only one but several the human being 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.340
 has always been questioned about the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.370
 existence of life beyond what 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.590
 know space is one of them but 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.780
 equally exciting is the depth 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.489
 from the sea there are scientists who 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.290
 prefer to study our planet from 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.079
 the atmosphere down to the deep ones and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.519
 abysmal oceans is right there where 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.379
 they assure that there is an infinity of 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.620
 strange and unknown marine species 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.599
 there are some of those that are presumed only 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.519
 they are seen when they are watching as a 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.609
 terrible misfortune related to 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.230
 Tsunamis floods or tsunamis 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:20.349
 supposed sea monsters with shapes 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.379
 demonic there are several things that we give 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.989
 a connotation to the image similar to 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.260
 the humans or some figures there 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.629
 a kind of streak that when dried 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.640
 the at the same time below it looks as if 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.829
 was a demon talking about these 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.660
 unknown species recently a 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.790
 amazing case on the beaches 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.710
 in colima mexico where the waves 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.680
 they dragged to the shore what 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.030
 It seems to be a giant manta ray 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.530
 look at the size compared to 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.470
 people who are on the beach 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.390
 this case can give us the idea of ​​everything 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.310
 what is hidden and what can still be 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.100
 for discovering oneself in the depths of 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.080
 ocean huge animals that maybe because 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.200
 not be categorized in some species 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.310
 people see them as sea monsters 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.600
 currently circulating through the network 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.880
 images of a strange marine species 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.400
 similar to what could be the mixture of 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.140
 a human being with a fish people 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.780
 impacted by seeing this being on the shores of 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.490
 campeche a fact that proved to the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.620
 believers their ancient legends of 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.150
 sirens counted hundreds of years ago 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.550
 by sailors and pirates 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.020
 we are in the middle of the ocean and it is 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.729
 precisely here where some 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.340
 people have seen strangers' beings at 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.350
 who have called sirens tonight here 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.009
 in the middle of the ocean is where it starts 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.689
 our research 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:36.789
 just think of a light 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.400
 probability of the existence of sirens 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.199
 It was fascinating and that is that ancient stories 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.749
 suggest that seafarers who have 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.699
 surrendered before its beauty and sometimes 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:47.860
 they were in love for them when listening 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.259
 its songs but according to the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.729
 descriptions of these beings 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.710
 could hardly resemble what 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.900
 It was found on the coast 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.360
 with this it is not ruled out that in some 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.850
 There are living beings in the vast sea 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.100
 of which little is known beings that such 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.840
 They are similar to us 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.910
 suitable adaptations to live in the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.090
 abyss of the sea in the middle of a darkness 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.100
 impressive and very low temperatures 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.970
 right there where the human being never 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.970
 I could arrive
