00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.260 
very much disagree with that sentiment I
hope<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.650> not<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.400> norm<00:02:30.640> among

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
hope that that is not the norm among

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.700 
hope that that is not the norm among
taxpayers<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.020> don't<00:02:32.170> think<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.680> is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
taxpayers and I don't think that it is

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.790 
taxpayers and I don't think that it is
