00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.789 
cheaper but um I wanted to make sure to
get<00:02:42.250> all<00:02:42.430> natural<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:44.109> was<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.379> little

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
get all natural and this was a little

get all natural and this was a little
bit<00:02:44.950> cheaper<00:02:45.340> than<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.609> hormel<00:02:46.209> all<00:02:46.540> no<00:02:46.750> smell

bit cheaper than the hormel all no smell
bacon<00:02:47.230> but<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.799> think<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:49.269> is<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.599> smaller

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
bacon but I think this is a smaller

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.280 
bacon but I think this is a smaller
package<00:02:50.560> size<00:02:51.129> so<00:02:51.579> i<00:02:51.910> don't<00:02:52.690> know<00:02:52.780> if<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.109> was<00:02:53.260> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
package size so i don't know if it was a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.720 
package size so i don't know if it was a
better<00:02:53.530> deal<00:02:53.739> but<00:02:53.920> i<00:02:53.980> didn't<00:02:54.310> need<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.459> ton

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730

to record that I got some Greek yogurt

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.439 
to record that I got some Greek yogurt
because<00:03:44.949> it<00:03:45.220> was<00:03:45.340> on<00:03:45.459> sale<00:03:45.639> for<00:03:45.699> a<00:03:45.970> dollar<00:03:46.180> each

because it was on sale for a dollar each
and<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.440> thought<00:03:47.680> it<00:03:47.799> was<00:03:47.889> grabbing<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.430> plane<00:03:48.940> it

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
was packed around the yogurt because it

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.879 
was packed around the yogurt because it

the area but I was kind of bummed

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:43.420

because<00:06:42.410> they<00:06:42.560> really<00:06:42.830> wanted<00:06:43.069> to<00:06:43.130> try<00:06:43.400> that
