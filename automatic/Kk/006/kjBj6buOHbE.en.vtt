something<00:02:05.950> like<00:02:06.130> 50<00:02:06.460> products<00:02:06.819> fresh<00:02:07.030> every

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
something like 50 products fresh every

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:07.499 
something like 50 products fresh every
day

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
day

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.300 
day
and<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.259> biggest<00:02:08.530> challenge<00:02:08.860> was<00:02:09.009> the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
and and the biggest challenge was the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220 
and and the biggest challenge was the
local<00:02:09.580> ingredients<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:10.270> would<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.479> insane<00:02:10.899> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
local ingredients it would be insane to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.010 
local ingredients it would be insane to

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
Russia is one of the biggest flour

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.620 
Russia is one of the biggest flour
exporters<00:02:15.520> in<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.670> world<00:02:15.850> we<00:02:16.150> were<00:02:16.270> very<00:02:16.480> very

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
exporters in the world we were very very

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.140 
exporters in the world we were very very
lucky<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:17.290> did<00:02:17.470> this<00:02:17.590> because<00:02:18.090> by<00:02:19.090> the

lucky that we did this because by the

for the main ingredients like sugar like
flour<00:02:44.040> were<00:02:44.760> using<00:02:44.910> locally<00:02:45.600> made<00:02:45.780> products

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
flour were using locally made products

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.340 
flour were using locally made products
it's<00:02:47.580> still<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> lot<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.390> things<00:02:48.630> happens<00:02:49.050> in

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
it's still a lot of things happens in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.230 
it's still a lot of things happens in
Russia<00:02:49.530> mechanically<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.910> service

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
Russia mechanically in the service

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.630 
Russia mechanically in the service
industry<00:02:51.720> they<00:02:52.170> have<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> hard<00:02:52.890> time<00:02:52.950> mingling

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
industry they have a hard time mingling

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.950 
industry they have a hard time mingling
they<00:02:54.060> either<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:55.010> follow<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.250> rules<00:02:56.490> or

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
they either they follow the rules or

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.480 
they either they follow the rules or
then<00:02:57.960> they<00:02:58.320> have<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> problem

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
then they have a problem

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.760 
then they have a problem
so<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> difficulty<00:03:01.500> in<00:03:01.530> Russia

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
so this is the difficulty in Russia

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.340 
so this is the difficulty in Russia
which<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.550> United<00:03:02.970> States<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:03.690> Europe<00:03:03.720> it's

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
which in United States or in Europe it's

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.780 
which in United States or in Europe it's
a<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.680> bit<00:03:04.800> easier<00:03:05.190> because<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.700> have

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
a little bit easier because they have

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.370 
a little bit easier because they have
been<00:03:05.970> used<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.620> Virginia<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:10.080> need<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
been used to it Virginia you need to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.620 
been used to it Virginia you need to
empty<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.980> garbage<00:03:11.010> can<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.850> need<00:03:12.270> to<00:03:12.360> clean

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
empty the garbage can you need to clean

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.020 
empty the garbage can you need to clean
up<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.810> place<00:03:13.200> what<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.740> cart<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.820> there

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
up that place what is that cart on there

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.410 
up that place what is that cart on there
however<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.380> other<00:03:16.410> hand<00:03:16.890> if<00:03:17.340> they<00:03:17.910> see

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
however on the other hand if they see

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.110 
however on the other hand if they see
that<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:19.140> working<00:03:19.440> hard<00:03:19.950> they<00:03:20.520> take<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.970> to

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that you're working hard they take it to

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.620 
that you're working hard they take it to
heart<00:03:21.770> in<00:03:22.770> other<00:03:23.130> cultures<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.180> may<00:03:24.450> be<00:03:24.510> a

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
heart in other cultures that may be a

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.560 
heart in other cultures that may be a
little<00:03:24.900> bit<00:03:25.020> more<00:03:25.380> difficult<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.910> idea<00:03:27.270> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
little bit more difficult the idea to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.030 
little bit more difficult the idea to
build<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:28.020> bakery<00:03:28.320> business<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.680> Russia<00:03:28.800> was

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
build a bakery business in Russia was

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.100 
build a bakery business in Russia was
exactly<00:03:29.400> right<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> idea<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.390> the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
exactly right and the idea that the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.420 
exactly right and the idea that the
competition<00:03:31.620> wasn't<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.040> high<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.280> this

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
competition wasn't so high in this

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.880 
competition wasn't so high in this
sector<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.880> would<00:03:33.060> do<00:03:33.150> again<00:03:33.360> but<00:03:34.020> I<00:03:34.260> think<00:03:34.650> I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
sector I would do again but I think I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.080 
sector I would do again but I think I
would<00:03:35.100> make<00:03:35.250> sure<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.430> we've<00:03:35.670> raised<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.970> bit

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
would make sure that we've raised a bit

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.460 
would make sure that we've raised a bit
more<00:03:36.239> capital<00:03:36.600> up<00:03:36.660> front<00:03:36.720> than<00:03:37.020> we<00:03:37.080> did<00:03:37.230> I

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
more capital up front than we did I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.530 
more capital up front than we did I
would<00:03:37.890> also<00:03:38.010> make<00:03:38.220> sure<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.459> think<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.970> we

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
would also make sure I think that we

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.420 
would also make sure I think that we
invest<00:03:39.810> at<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.050> beginning<00:03:40.410> far<00:03:40.830> more<00:03:41.130> in

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
invest at the beginning far more in

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.130 
invest at the beginning far more in
training<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.180> production<00:03:42.660> people<00:03:42.810> than<00:03:43.050> we

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
training of production people than we

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.430 
training of production people than we
did

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
did

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.740 
did
we<00:03:43.530> should<00:03:43.739> have<00:03:43.860> out<00:03:44.730> sourced<00:03:45.270> much<00:03:45.480> less

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
we should have out sourced much less

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.120 
we should have out sourced much less
than<00:03:45.900> we<00:03:46.020> did<00:03:46.170> four<00:03:46.500> years<00:03:46.530> ago<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.980> should

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
than we did four years ago we should

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
than we did four years ago we should
have<00:03:47.220> made<00:03:47.340> much<00:03:47.520> many<00:03:47.760> more<00:03:47.910> products

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
have made much many more products
