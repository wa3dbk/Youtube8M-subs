00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
here's something I've learned about

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.480 
here's something I've learned about
fixing<00:00:01.979> my<00:00:02.190> pond<00:00:02.520> pump<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.179> filter<00:00:03.899> system<00:00:04.490> so

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
fixing my pond pump and filter system so

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730 
fixing my pond pump and filter system so
my<00:00:05.609> pump<00:00:05.940> started<00:00:06.930> just<00:00:07.200> putting<00:00:07.589> out<00:00:07.710> a

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
my pump started just putting out a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.770 
my pump started just putting out a
dribble<00:00:08.250> it's<00:00:08.400> been<00:00:08.610> slowing<00:00:08.910> down<00:00:09.210> over<00:00:09.269> time

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
dribble it's been slowing down over time

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.799 
dribble it's been slowing down over time
and<00:00:10.170> I've<00:00:10.590> cleaned<00:00:10.980> off<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.460> cage<00:00:11.759> there<00:00:12.660> was

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
and I've cleaned off the cage there was

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.310 
and I've cleaned off the cage there was
a<00:00:12.840> bunch<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> gunk<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:14.450> it<00:00:15.450> still<00:00:15.780> is

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
a bunch of gunk on it but it still is

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.260 
a bunch of gunk on it but it still is
not<00:00:17.070> flowing<00:00:17.850> properly<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.750> we're<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
not flowing properly so we're going to

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.910 
not flowing properly so we're going to
take<00:00:21.270> off<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.490> cage<00:00:23.900> we<00:00:24.900> tested<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
take off the cage we tested it it is

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.109 
take off the cage we tested it it is
spinning<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.750> can<00:00:27.750> see<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> fins<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.529> there

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
spinning you can see the fins in there

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.500 
spinning you can see the fins in there
we're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> take<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> screws<00:00:30.929> off

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.210 

and<00:00:37.510> we're<00:00:37.870> going<00:00:37.990> to<00:00:38.050> check<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.530> impeller

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.860 

see<00:00:42.220> if<00:00:42.310> there's<00:00:42.460> anything<00:00:42.700> stuck<00:00:43.120> behind<00:00:43.360> it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
see if there's anything stuck behind it

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:55.340 
see if there's anything stuck behind it
to<00:00:44.860> stop<00:00:45.580> the<00:00:45.820> water<00:00:46.030> from<00:00:46.300> flowing<00:00:53.970> there<00:00:54.970> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to stop the water from flowing there is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.470 
to stop the water from flowing there is
look<00:00:56.350> going<00:00:56.560> up<00:00:56.740> the<00:00:56.830> hose<00:00:57.010> there<00:00:57.390> there's<00:00:58.390> a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
look going up the hose there there's a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.210 
look going up the hose there there's a
big<00:00:58.720> clot<00:00:59.080> of<00:00:59.290> stuff<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.770> might<00:01:03.010> have<00:01:03.130> been

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
big clot of stuff that might have been

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:14.200 
big clot of stuff that might have been
the<00:01:03.310> problem<00:01:03.960> right<00:01:04.960> there<00:01:07.800> having<00:01:08.800> a<00:01:08.860> pardon

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.010 

I've<00:01:14.690> had<00:01:14.870> this<00:01:15.020> pump<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:15.470> going<00:01:16.100> on<00:01:16.840> two<00:01:17.840> or

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
I've had this pump now going on two or

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.890 
I've had this pump now going on two or
three<00:01:18.050> years<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.580> run<00:01:19.940> non-stop<00:01:20.270> through

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
three years it's run non-stop through

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.040 
three years it's run non-stop through
the<00:01:20.990> winter<00:01:21.290> and<00:01:21.320> everything

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
the winter and everything

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.099 
the winter and everything
so<00:01:24.050> now<00:01:24.230> we'll<00:01:24.470> stick<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.980> front<00:01:25.340> back<00:01:25.580> on

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.999 

to<00:01:31.109> screw<00:01:31.469> these<00:01:31.619> three<00:01:32.069> screws<00:01:32.429> back<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:34.009> look

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to screw these three screws back in look

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.120 
to screw these three screws back in look
at<00:01:35.130> another<00:01:35.460> test

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.760 

so<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.490> bottom<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.119> my<00:01:40.150> pond<00:01:40.799> looks<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:46.770> just

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
so the bottom of my pond looks that just

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.170 
so the bottom of my pond looks that just
this<00:01:48.009> fine<00:01:49.140> silty<00:01:50.140> fish<00:01:50.979> poop<00:01:51.460> decayed<00:01:52.149> leaf

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
this fine silty fish poop decayed leaf

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.719 
this fine silty fish poop decayed leaf
disgusting<00:01:55.180> mess<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.740> I<00:02:00.070> used<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.399> take<00:02:00.520> out

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
disgusting mess and I used to take out

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.249 
disgusting mess and I used to take out
all<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> rocks<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.420> clean<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:01.780> out<00:02:01.960> every

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
all the rocks and clean this out every

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.410 
all the rocks and clean this out every
year<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.740> I've<00:02:03.100> decided<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.789> wasn't<00:02:03.970> worth<00:02:04.240> it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
year and I've decided it wasn't worth it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.270 
year and I've decided it wasn't worth it
my<00:02:04.630> fish<00:02:04.899> do<00:02:05.140> great<00:02:05.409> without<00:02:05.590> me<00:02:05.890> doing<00:02:06.039> that

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
my fish do great without me doing that

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.460 
my fish do great without me doing that
so<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.119> typically<00:02:07.539> just<00:02:07.750> keep<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> filter

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
so I typically just keep the filter

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.460 
so I typically just keep the filter
clean<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:09.190> I'm<00:02:09.340> ready<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:09.670> go<00:02:10.260> this<00:02:11.260> does

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
clean and I'm ready to go this does

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.660 
clean and I'm ready to go this does

couple years ago and I have some
volcanic<00:02:24.459> pumice<00:02:24.640> rock<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.870> I

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
volcanic pumice rock in there so I

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.660 
volcanic pumice rock in there so I
always<00:02:26.410> make<00:02:26.590> sure<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> pumice<00:02:27.400> rock

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
always make sure that that pumice rock

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.620 
always make sure that that pumice rock
is<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.690> closest<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.290> around<00:02:30.030> the
