you reduce the flame to low so that it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.350 
you reduce the flame to low so that it
will<00:02:25.690> be<00:02:25.840> very<00:02:25.870> easy<00:02:26.140> for<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.360> incorporate

will be very easy for you to incorporate

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.000 
will be very easy for you to incorporate
the<00:02:28.780> rice<00:02:28.959> flour<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.290> am<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.769> go<00:02:29.920> ahead

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the rice flour I am going to go ahead

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.100 
the rice flour I am going to go ahead
and<00:02:30.280> add<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:31.030> rice<00:02:31.180> flour<00:02:31.510> into<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.080> just

and add the rice flour into it and just
carefully<00:02:32.769> mix<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.629> because<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:35.440> don't<00:02:35.650> want

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
carefully mix it because we don't want

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.619 
carefully mix it because we don't want
any<00:02:36.069> lumps<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.519> here<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.849> just<00:02:39.849> mix<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.420> really

very<00:02:41.050> well

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.640 

and<00:02:44.610> try<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.909> incorporate<00:02:45.390> very<00:02:46.319> well

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
and try to incorporate very well

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.009 
and try to incorporate very well
otherwise<00:02:47.310> if<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.819> dough<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.150> very<00:02:48.390> loose<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
otherwise if the dough is very loose you

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.580 
otherwise if the dough is very loose you
cannot<00:02:49.409> shape<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.069> che<00:02:50.280> gory<00:02:50.489> loop<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:52.170> now<00:02:52.349> as

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
cannot shape the che gory loop so now as

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.680 
cannot shape the che gory loop so now as
you<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:53.099> it<00:02:53.220> has<00:02:53.370> all<00:02:53.640> come<00:02:54.030> together<00:02:54.209> really

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
you see it has all come together really

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.330 
you see it has all come together really
nice<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:55.290> good<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.799> should<00:02:56.010> be<00:02:56.099> very

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
nice and good and you should be very

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.789 
nice and good and you should be very
fast<00:02:56.730> while<00:02:57.510> mixing<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.140> don't<00:02:58.440> want<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
fast while mixing it you don't want a

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.369 
fast while mixing it you don't want a
loose<00:02:59.040> dough<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.720> how<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.900> want<00:03:01.260> it

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
loose dough so this is how you want it

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.059 
loose dough so this is how you want it
very<00:03:01.739> tight<00:03:02.599> at<00:03:03.599> the<00:03:03.720> same<00:03:03.930> time<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.409> there<00:03:04.950> is

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
very tight at the same time and there is

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.580 
very tight at the same time and there is
no<00:03:05.430> dry<00:03:05.700> flour<00:03:06.030> left<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.379> how<00:03:07.530> you

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
no dry flour left so this is how you

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.339 
no dry flour left so this is how you
want<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.129> just<00:03:08.849> going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.209> cover<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.840> cool

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
want it just going to cover it and cool

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.949 
want it just going to cover it and cool
it<00:03:10.379> completely<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.940> actually<00:03:12.450> continues

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
it completely this actually continues

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.199 
it completely this actually continues
the<00:03:13.110> cooking<00:03:13.409> process<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.099> make<00:03:14.879> sure<00:03:15.060> that

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the cooking process and make sure that

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.569 
the cooking process and make sure that
you<00:03:15.329> follow<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.810> step<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:17.040> need<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.340> cool

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
you follow this step you need to cool

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.610 
you follow this step you need to cool
down<00:03:17.849> this<00:03:18.060> mixture<00:03:18.359> completely<00:03:18.810> otherwise

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
down this mixture completely otherwise

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.490 
down this mixture completely otherwise
they<00:03:20.609> may<00:03:20.819> splash<00:03:21.569> in<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> oil<00:03:22.079> when<00:03:22.470> you

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
they may splash in the oil when you

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.869 
they may splash in the oil when you
deep-fry<00:03:23.010> them<00:03:23.160> immediately

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
deep-fry them immediately

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.000 
deep-fry them immediately
so<00:03:24.390> for<00:03:24.569> cooling<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.019> mixture<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.560> may<00:03:25.739> take

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
so for cooling this mixture it may take

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.890 
so for cooling this mixture it may take
around<00:03:26.370> half<00:03:26.700> an<00:03:26.819> hour<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.269> hour<00:03:27.299> I'm<00:03:27.720> just

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
around half an hour to one hour I'm just

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.220 
around half an hour to one hour I'm just
going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.170> leave<00:03:28.379> it<00:03:28.530> for<00:03:28.560> 1<00:03:28.980> hour<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.870> mixture

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
going to leave it for 1 hour the mixture

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.660 
going to leave it for 1 hour the mixture
has<00:03:31.379> cooled<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:31.769> completely<00:03:32.220> I'm<00:03:32.459> just

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
has cooled down completely I'm just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.819 
has cooled down completely I'm just
going<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:32.970> transform<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.900> rolling<00:03:34.349> surface

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
going to transform to a rolling surface

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.410 
going to transform to a rolling surface

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.550 
you need to do this after the dough is
completely<00:03:58.769> cooled<00:03:58.980> down<00:03:59.160> now<00:03:59.959> let's<00:04:00.959> start

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
completely cooled down now let's start

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.259 
completely cooled down now let's start
shaping<00:04:02.010> then<00:04:02.160> I'm<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.430> going<00:04:02.669> to<00:04:02.819> take<00:04:03.030> a

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
shaping then I'm just going to take a

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.020

small<00:04:03.599> portion<00:04:03.870> out<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> dough<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.030> I'm

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
small portion out of the dough and I'm

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.809

going on medium heat I'm just going to
keep<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:14.090> on<00:05:14.210> high<00:05:14.509> right<00:05:14.840> now<00:05:15.080> before<00:05:15.380> adding

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
keep it on high right now before adding

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.730 
keep it on high right now before adding
the<00:05:16.070> chigau<00:05:16.400> riilu<00:05:16.669> into<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.150> oil<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:18.590> have

the chigau riilu into the oil and I have

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.980 
the chigau riilu into the oil and I have
done<00:05:19.009> shaping<00:05:19.490> all<00:05:19.699> these<00:05:20.000> and<00:05:20.270> make<00:05:20.810> sure

done shaping all these and make sure
that<00:05:21.139> you<00:05:21.289> have<00:05:21.470> somebody<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:22.400> do<00:05:22.550> this

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
that you have somebody to do this

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.490 
that you have somebody to do this
because<00:05:22.970> it<00:05:23.630> is<00:05:23.780> going<00:05:23.960> to<00:05:24.080> take<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.259> lot<00:05:24.470> of

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
because it is going to take a lot of

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.890 
because it is going to take a lot of
time<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.039> this<00:05:25.580> step<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.180> going<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.569> be<00:05:26.690> the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
time and this step is going to be the

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.310 
time and this step is going to be the
time-consuming<00:05:27.169> step<00:05:27.889> and<00:05:28.130> accept<00:05:29.060> this

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
time-consuming step and accept this

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.570 
time-consuming step and accept this
everything<00:05:30.320> else<00:05:30.440> is<00:05:30.650> super<00:05:30.949> simple<00:05:31.250> the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
everything else is super simple the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.700 
everything else is super simple the
dough<00:05:31.759> was<00:05:32.060> very<00:05:32.479> easy<00:05:32.720> as<00:05:32.930> you<00:05:33.080> have<00:05:33.229> seen<00:05:33.500> and

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
dough was very easy as you have seen and

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.710 
dough was very easy as you have seen and
while<00:05:34.400> dropping<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.940> check<00:05:35.150> or<00:05:35.300> raloo<00:05:35.509> into

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
while dropping the check or raloo into

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.439 
while dropping the check or raloo into
the<00:05:35.810> oil<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.199> should<00:05:36.259> not<00:05:36.710> handle<00:05:37.699> from<00:05:38.389> the

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:38.449 
the oil you should not handle from the

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.399 
the oil you should not handle from the
end<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.380> is<00:05:40.219> sealed<00:05:40.639> you<00:05:40.969> need<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.020> have<00:05:42.229> it

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
end that is sealed you need to have it

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.439 
end that is sealed you need to have it
from<00:05:42.560> other<00:05:42.770> end<00:05:43.070> and<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:43.370> can<00:05:44.000> choose<00:05:44.270> your

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
from other end and you can choose your

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.020 
from other end and you can choose your
own<00:05:44.690> size<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.259> don't<00:05:45.979> have<00:05:46.130> much<00:05:46.340> patience<00:05:46.820> so<00:05:47.000> I

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
own size I don't have much patience so I

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.170 
own size I don't have much patience so I
have<00:05:47.270> made<00:05:47.509> big<00:05:48.199> spirals<00:05:48.770> big<00:05:49.490> chigorin<00:05:50.060> loop

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
have made big spirals big chigorin loop
