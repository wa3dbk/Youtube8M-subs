00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
here you hear that noise I took this

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.730

entire<00:03:59.430> unit<00:03:59.940> off<00:04:00.120> but<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.660> never<00:04:00.870> came<00:04:01.170> out<00:04:01.440> I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
entire unit off but it never came out I

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.310 
entire unit off but it never came out I
sent<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.730> off<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.060> side<00:04:03.390> and<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:03.840> look<00:04:04.080> very

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
sent it off to the side and I look very

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.850 
sent it off to the side and I look very
closely<00:04:04.980> inside<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.000> there's<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.240> broken

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
closely inside and there's a broken

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.280 
closely inside and there's a broken
bearing<00:04:07.860> housing<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.950> was<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:12.630> was<00:04:12.690> broken

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
bearing housing and it was it was broken

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.030 
bearing housing and it was it was broken
so<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:14.300> guess<00:04:15.300> dad<00:04:15.810> has<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.200> take<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.620> apart

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
so I guess dad has to take this apart

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.140 
so I guess dad has to take this apart
and<00:04:17.190> see<00:04:17.670> where<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.690> other<00:04:18.810> piece<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:20.150> well

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
and see where the other piece is well

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.300 
and see where the other piece is well
just<00:04:21.420> this<00:04:21.570> back<00:04:22.170> plate<00:04:22.470> off<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.070> I'll<00:04:23.160> be

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
just this back plate off and I'll be

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.400 
just this back plate off and I'll be
good<00:04:23.580> it'll<00:04:24.150> be<00:04:24.270> fixable<00:04:24.890> if<00:04:25.890> it's<00:04:26.250> there

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
good it'll be fixable if it's there

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.880 
good it'll be fixable if it's there
anyway<00:04:28.410> well<00:04:29.070> that's<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.760> today<00:04:30.890> that's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
anyway well that's it for today that's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.840 
anyway well that's it for today that's
how<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.400> start<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.240> John<00:04:33.720> Deere<00:04:33.900> H<00:04:34.230> by<00:04:35.100> hand<00:04:35.490> by

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
how you start a John Deere H by hand by

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.480 
how you start a John Deere H by hand by
using<00:04:35.910> the<00:04:36.600> clutch<00:04:37.440> wheel<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:40.650> believe<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
using the clutch wheel and I believe the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.790 
using the clutch wheel and I believe the
electric<00:04:41.880> start<00:04:42.180> will<00:04:42.330> turn<00:04:42.660> over<00:04:43.130> nope<00:04:45.800> of

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
electric start will turn over nope of

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.140 
electric start will turn over nope of
course<00:04:47.100> I<00:04:47.280> left<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.640> damn<00:04:47.850> lights<00:04:48.240> on<00:04:48.480> -<00:04:48.810> OH
