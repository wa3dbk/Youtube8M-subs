00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.529
 heusel managing director martin to 19 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.110
 places in Lustenau are mined 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.630
 what are the reasons now we had to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 this sad news today 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.500
 our on our plant collection the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.859
 open employees 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 the reasons for that are that we 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.240
 Three essentials for the coming year 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 System orders no longer in kind 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 and wisely can do like that until 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.099
 today was the case 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.130
 we have a very happy new year 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.230
 Comprehensive waste paper collecting order 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.020
 lost in Vorarlberg 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.690
 it's about the municipal wastepaper of all 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 96 communities we in the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.370
 past for which we in the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.649
 past had an order and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.449
 some vehicles have used it 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.039
 We have this order to you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.710
 German competitor lost 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 in addition, it is so that we 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.559
 for the plastic sorting system 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.019
 a partial order or an order 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.960
 have to do without the one to date 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 second sorted layer has been busy 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 this one comes out of the layer with only in the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.340
 January also gone and the third 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.159
 reason may third reason lies in it 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.070
 that we have been working at our location in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.530
 king meadows around 35,000 tons 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.540
 processed municipal waste 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.780
 dried to have beaten 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 by a change in vorarlberg the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.060
 so-called catchment area regulation the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.030
 We can only fell in the future 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.579
 more 15.000 tons of the vorarlberger of the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.939
 rubbish at our site 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.180
 The remaining amount is directly from 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.340
 decentralized takeover by truck 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.130
 the waste incineration plants in the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 switzerland 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 why this message right now two 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.390
 weeks before Christmas 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 the reason for that is simply we have 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.000
 the order until 31.12 of this year 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.409
 and we need these services 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.720
 and do it too 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.300
 to the best of my knowledge and certain 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.720
 That means we have the work 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.100
 until New Year's Eve and from New Year 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.740
 the work is not there anymore 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.740
 that means we need these employees 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.020
 until the end of this year and have 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.490
 then next year unfortunately the god 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.760
 Orders no longer and no 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.050
 Employment in which areas 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.810
 there is notice everywhere 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.490
 There are terminations in the company 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.400
 area in all the course, of course 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.120
 plastic sorting plant in the area of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 waste in the envelope but also in the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.350
 Plastic sorting system hits it 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.070
 but also employees in the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.980
 because we, of course, 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.190
 through this disappearance of these great ones 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 orders associated with it 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.650
 administrative activities, too 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.110
 You must have to perform at the employee 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.080
 hÃ¤usler angst have about their job there 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.700
 even more savings for the future 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.930
 the order for the next two 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.350
 three years is very very stable and it 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.760
 is not to be expected that more 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.030
 Order losses come we are 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.560
 currently not in further 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 tendering procedure and we are 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.250
 very confident and good things that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.100
 we the remaining employees the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.430
 Steadily occupy next year too 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.430
 can
