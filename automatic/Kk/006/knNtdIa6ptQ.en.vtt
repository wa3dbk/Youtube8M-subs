00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.360
 that the US Marines Jurgens Euro um 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.930
 I want to pursue 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.009
 the Brit Mark Lester 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.559
 GM would 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.710
 yes and currencies Romances and Solothurn bit so splashes Green 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.810
 Flushed Bullocks 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.220
 and 4 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.240
 2 Klimowicz set new and rewarded use as long as you worry 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.329
 in the 2 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.719
 So my first impression as if he knew of him so the first Bully source 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.090
 Concerns too short 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.570
 I thought so first word shit now it is completely different somehow too 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.450
 "It's always the goal 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.130
 from Joerg to somewhere the same year was everything 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.480
 is is somehow different it goes in the first break went 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.910
 This is 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.870
 to have 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 yes, also unusual 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.860
 but then I made second go I thought so yes is quite cool 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.750
 of course, around the nets 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.750
 From my side, I think that's not much bigger 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.770
 be cool made percent be 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.739
 many many 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.430
 who more hiding 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.220
 around 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.220
 how can you build his nooks and crannies 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 still fight back 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 As a precaution, in the morning Volkswagen was expressing his words in the morning 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.060
 Brunner should 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.630
 he was not disputing what he wants 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.930
 so i do not know it's not the fat of idiots percent but me 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.090
 Also do not know the book-to-bill who made the game so central to 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.200
 me more about the topics of darkness 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.150
 that's the way it is 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.020
 while 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.469
 i would say i was i wanted to know i am pretty late 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.820
 you have to say that 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.760
 what was 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.120
 but Black Ops already no not right in the starting blocks but I feel 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.340
 that I can still do it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 I do not believe Bonhoeffer for half a year or so 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.800
 but as I said, I liked the fact that earlier I was here 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.330
 few of the shooter cases 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.930
 Nearly I had more so in the heart to supplement something so begotten 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.000
 adult focus on the console extremely shitty by the controller 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.859
 in front 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.129
 Do not match 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.919
 Arnheim gets used to it all with the controller 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.469
 in function 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.469
 to center should be set up 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.399
 Euro and special BlueMotion slipped he has 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.219
 and around 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:34.259
 Water is spiked to Spindleruv Mlyn and Paris and hoster and around 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.619
 Dr 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:41.199
 the distance was sung or excerpt yes definitely one so me 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.239
 Definitely I'll wait and now wait 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.979
 in order to have followed in the footsteps of the driver it is located the same sweat percent 

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:50.170
 finally he became 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.810
 he has really changed something and improved and I think that's it 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.359
 definitely the case 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.849
 the speeders were fled and left there is already first chip exchange though is 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.849
 the PlayStation immediately to 50 9 percent 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.959
 followed press 14 clock that is long since found 1 so its the largest 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.599
 Get water wheels 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.819
 So, even though it does not say a resignation solved that is no different 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.699
 Word but I think it's shit 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.899
 because of recent resolutions in word or something in the fall because 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:25.289
 what is the whole as to be allowed then it will be there no complete fastest 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:26.829
 percent 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.949
 no competition idea was arrested yet still a gap 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:34.819
 Sack to be what the next free to the finish and Pröll of mine 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.380
 Page does not make it fun 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.220
 it is not fun for us to be dredged dfb president dr 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.529
 APA 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.929
 something that really annoys me 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:50.109
 so Jagger Celle are for me the titles are Fr KERS is for a boss 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:50.930
 to hope 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.220
 correctly set sentence the interest is so again and I find it a pity 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.419
 that one 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.419
 in such people the game then only a croak 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.159
 that's the way it is 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.989
 we 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.799
 So, yes, we can see returned actually taken pretty well 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.969
 for watching the games 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:12.080
 maybe half an hour 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.929
 Euro so related death I've got used to it as I said 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.239
 I'm actually doing quite well around in the area 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.259
 as you can see so I find the way down for those who still 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
 did not notice Markus Rogan 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.800
 There he looks like I've got a good dredged and we 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.999
 but of course we got the knife again 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.999
 it can be open quite quickly 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:40.169
 so life is euro on 4 percent blackout 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.800
 was 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 Jahns just too long SK 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.229
 then it would also make sense to use stylish and get us 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.129
 when one wanted to know about him what Parnassus and not counted on it 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.250
 that for one thing the e3 will stop 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.680
 79 such words 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.740
 Not 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.259
 now times as high as the limit 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.639
 Details should last 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.669
 been 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.319
 Abysses m 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.490
 what was there because what you want to know is healthy gameplay or 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.340
 so, so I could do that to people mainly for the OSO percent 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.480
 only votes at the moment and of course to go is the geese 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.759
 turning on certain videos is the rating 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:32.590
 that means I will but on 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.669
 Percent does not always say everything nice there will be games of the 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.339
 king 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.599
 we already have a chat about it, Christine Stanzel soon 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.469
 a possible come I do not want to betray which play but 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.550
 I will this game 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.620
 Definitely sorry to drag God into the muck, Volvo must have praised it and 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.360
 yes, it was exactly a very Euro expected game 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.150
 and in my opinion it really is not what it promised 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.259
 that was 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.199
 definitely got bad 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.940
 So I will give it a very tough rating 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.140
 yes and as I said otherwise I would also do a couple of films like «That said in the 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.460
 Movie of course 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.760
 The outside may be I also want the woman who we do it 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.580
 if you have a tip from Special Editions out there and around on moving and 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.659
 will 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.779
 and yes of course also current trailer and very hot anticipated movie 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.779
 like Preetz has been about speculators lately 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:28.469
 Of course you could do it now 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:30.919
 yes, by the way, we wanted and get the work done 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.659
 They should help us with the fruits 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:39.029
 The Fridge is known by the way today and Derek Hough the Internet 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.110
 is the five rounds could come fit that new demo and get the paint 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.919
 because not yet call post 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.830
 while the pulses are needed 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.199
 The problem now is to get next time next to the biblical 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.770
 Shadow of the solar system and cheap captcha Katsoulis Ziegler was once 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.879
 gained 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.169
 but I just wanted to test it 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:03.460
 as the whole thing is going to start now that means it's bound to work fine 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.240
 if I'm probably also ali-t fire 

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:11.680
 To finally get rid of her HTG will also get more 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.390
 Well, not that I do not have to be that way either 

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.169
 and we went so fast and powerful 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:23.340
 Of course we know each other 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.910
 their mission because the score was assigned 23 percent blame 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.699
 Yes and 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.729
 Nobody say a nice thank you for being one percent more 

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.350
 bad conclusion camera and sound what now follow Euro until soon people 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.330
 seem to be examined 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.990
 Thumbs up on the 7th 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.089
 Forests superb 

00:07:42.089 --> 00:07:43.719
 Euro a burden 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:44.819
 Create jobs
