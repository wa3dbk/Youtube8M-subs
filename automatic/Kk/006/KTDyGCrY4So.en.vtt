00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.629
 and now we're going right there 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.950
 By train, we want to go to Bremen 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.080
 Let's get the boy werder 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 take a closer look at the team and 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.850
 join their keeper sebastian mielitz 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 out of the shadow of tim meadow 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.150
 the new number one in Bremen gate like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 does it feel to Mr felix is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.990
 Of course every game is a highlight 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.270
 that one can you can already see me 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.680
 many little boys think they are happy 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.030
 or would be glad if you ever 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 play in the Bundesliga 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 I may say that every weekend was already 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.050
 my dream would be someday 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.909
 It was a very early start 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.329
 and yes I am glad that I am here today 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.949
 may sit on underneath stadium 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 until now all dreams are fulfilled why 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.760
 because, of all things, it's burning 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.309
 was actually a very strange one 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.889
 story a friend then too 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.159
 still today before Werder fan and I wait 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:04.890
 still no affiliation and a club 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.810
 then I thought human green-white 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
 so beautiful color I like that and there 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.710
 I just join in 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.820
 the little sebastian in green-white 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.040
 big fan 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.980
 He grew up in brandenburg on new 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.520
 lionberg 350 souls north of 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.320
 Berlin 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.720
 on the village square the first flugeinlage 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.350
 at the age of 16 change to boarding school 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.730
 Bremen 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.510
 Four years later, the first 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.980
 bundesliga insert medicine to zero 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.820
 but meadow still waits for the number one 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.140
 militia remained replacement 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.030
 As a second goalkeeper you always have to 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.650
 be prepared for it may from time to time 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.460
 what happened that was the last years 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.240
 was that so tim was off and on maybe 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 one injured or has a red one 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.620
 card traded as second goalkeeper 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.210
 Of course you burn those too 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.340
 Such a situation you want it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.160
 not but you have to be prepared for everything 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.210
 if at the beginning the fed were not 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.010
 safe in bremen 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.020
 the young militia as successor of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.260
 Leitwolf Tim meadow Now you are 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 quite satisfied 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.170
 great backflip little bit 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.220
 solid goalkeeper certainly not 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.450
 necessarily world class but want to do 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.540
 certainly a great future for 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.610
 he is still young and there still can 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.010
 even more can develop from it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.590
 who still setbacks from those 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.810
 I have not ran so much to me 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.140
 let's try to get up 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.610
 who romped to help the team 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.600
 Patience is also a very important topic 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.790
 I think I have one now 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.740
 Well, but I 'm just happy now 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.480
 every game I do what I do 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.150
 may and it was as good as here 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.220
 patience is possible at the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.709
 Weser currently anyway asked the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.440
 golden years are over 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.010
 In 2004 and bremen the double 2009 still the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.709
 cup 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.140
 This is followed by the median last season 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.760
 place nine 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.710
 manager klaus allofs had the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.020
 Team upside down and straight 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.770
 Record minus of almost 14 million euros 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.720
 proclaim 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.880
 also the sympathetic image of the bremer 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.860
 got scratch the jersey sponsor 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 Wiesenhof a controversial poultry 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.450
 Manufacturer provides for criticism 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.920
 but in the square so it seems growing 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.980
 just something together again 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.530
 bundesliga- returner eljero elia der 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.260
 belgian kevin de bruyne and the again 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.070
 strengthened appointed the new boy the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.170
 makes hope 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.720
 Why is that at Werder now 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.020
 but slowly uphill is yes 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.459
 Part of it was high quality shopped it 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.180
 I think that is also very important 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.940
 component 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.700
 but also the people around it 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.459
 Fans are looking forward to the new team 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.560
 The trainer does a great job and we 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.140
 within the group also work 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.780
 Well then we see Werder bremen again 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.030
 international, of course, one 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.380
 we also ask exciting questions frequently 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.180
 get asked but we need too 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.510
 still some time 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.239
 that's just how it is with the young team 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.040
 I have to consolidate everything even more 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.459
 even more constant are the benefits 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.930
 and then in the end you will see how far 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.500
 we came and that's what I think 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.500
 also exciting enough
