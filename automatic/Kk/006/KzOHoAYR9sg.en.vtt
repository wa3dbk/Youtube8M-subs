 first august 2014 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.580
 Today we are doing a training block 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.349
 For 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.800
 and first 13 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.950
 47 flown off 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.540
 direction northwest so 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.880
 flensburg and maybe another one 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:30.050
 bit to denmark the curve now 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 sees the end of the mowing lake that is the 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.730
 first was with one and a half meters so far 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.730
 we flew straight ahead 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.800
 furthermore, that's just right 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.260
 live here 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.660
 We have been almost two months 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:55.580
 not flown 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.580
 to only 20 west here 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.860
 he knew 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.860
 40 30 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.800
 about the middle of schleswig holstein should 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.440
 base to go on 2000 meters 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.470
 the clouds have no clear sunset 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.470
 and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.149
 went loud 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.300
 almost the worst 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.300
 105 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.360
 you can also see the würzburger 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 prosecuting attorney 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.670
 may from just 1000 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.890
 and 20 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.890
 3 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.790
 in a nutshell 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.910
 all lie 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.910
 180 km 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.080
 we will now 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.080
 immediately turn around 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.500
 but everything ran wide 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.800
 there is still going on in this 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 Soup 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.630
 several times to shoot quite nicely 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.630
 high 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:35.860
 supporting lines sometimes find there goes 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.860
 it's easy but only sometimes 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.530
 we're back at the moment 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:50.560
 German Danish border at once in 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:55.530
 a big blue still flensburg im 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.530
 west of us the peninsula north beach 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:06.580
 on the horizon on the window 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.580
 better pictures but also a lot of noise 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.450
 the straight flight is never quite a map 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.610
 are and we always fly light 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.680
 serpentine lines towards the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:30.950
 felt appointment could be raised 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:35.570
 Duty we are here of course 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.570
 short of north Baltic Sea canal again 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.190
 The Eckernförder bay 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.360
 a bit can now 90 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.180
 but maybe fingers a bit 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.180
 continue 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.939
 to leave it to her 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.469
 very good off at was the 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.469
 northeast of Neumünster 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.940
 said 50 years ago at that time 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.580
 regional president professor 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.490
 Buchloe's engine is very much flying 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.199
 more demanding than sail-flying we 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.810
 For example, we also get sparkles 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.270
 engine curse has been well in the 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.759
 in the meantime a whole lot changed 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.169
 and I flipped sign up now a 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.169
 control zone lübeck 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.810
 180 through the area is natural 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.810
 a great thing 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.680
 according to his with 4g this is a good one 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.860
 day today 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.770
 So we are now 400 meters above one 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:11.180
 dress and make quick connection 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:15.289
 in the square we fly with the 200 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:19.570
 km / h motor sailers and rich aircraft 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.570
 we would easily fly away today 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.100
 league 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.490
 under the left area the 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.490
 Old town island off the lane 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.620
 120 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.400
 There was no ball this morning and it was 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.940
 too hot we like to fly in clouds 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.879
 shadow 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.159
 then top media eu said for the 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.680
 afternoon wanted in 2000 meters over 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.560
 Schleswig-Holstein predicts that 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.409
 then the 116 km / h for the 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:16.840
 Afternoon trip over 400 13 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:20.300
 kilometers above 1,500 meters 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.720
 This is very important for the old man 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.000
 Well 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.180
 but younger people could get away too 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.180
 benefit 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:35.290
 so beautiful etr flights for the stop 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.290
 Hard but it is still quite good
