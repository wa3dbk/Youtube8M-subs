blowing in the wind with Sun glare this

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.369 
blowing in the wind with Sun glare this
long<00:00:59.010> one<00:01:00.770> once<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.949> speed<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:03.229> let's<00:01:04.229> go

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
long one once you speed it up let's go

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.260 
long one once you speed it up let's go
four<00:01:04.769> times

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.760 

maybe<00:01:10.810> eight<00:01:11.850> till<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.380> okay<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:14.440> there<00:01:14.710> it

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
maybe eight till it okay so there it

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.260 
maybe eight till it okay so there it
goes<00:01:14.920> and<00:01:15.130> matches<00:01:15.460> up<00:01:15.640> with<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.940> other<00:01:15.970> one

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
goes and matches up with the other one

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.770 
goes and matches up with the other one
so<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:19.030> you're<00:01:19.180> going<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.330> want<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.570> let<00:01:19.659> it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
so then you're going to want to let it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.570 
so then you're going to want to let it
render<00:01:20.020> out<00:01:20.320> which<00:01:20.619> is<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:20.950> here<00:01:20.979> once<00:01:21.460> it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
render out which is right here once it

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.210 
render out which is right here once it
reaches<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.940> hundred<00:01:22.119> percent<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:24.070> can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
reaches a hundred percent and you can

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
reaches a hundred percent and you can
start<00:01:24.460> editing<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:29.020> you're<00:01:29.140> going<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> want

for<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:17.980> tutorial<00:02:18.220> I'm<00:02:18.790> gonna

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
for this for this tutorial I'm gonna

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.610 
for this for this tutorial I'm gonna
leave<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.209> up<00:02:19.299> full<00:02:19.570> opacity<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:23.470> do

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
leave it up full opacity and you do

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:31.320 
leave it up full opacity and you do
linear<00:02:23.920> light

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.380 

we'll<00:02:31.810> stick<00:02:31.990> with<00:02:32.020> soft<00:02:32.440> light<00:02:32.950> that'll<00:02:33.910> that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
we'll stick with soft light that'll that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.180 
we'll stick with soft light that'll that
allows<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.170> cool<00:02:35.440> effect<00:02:35.590> but

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
allows it to have a cool effect but

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.800 
allows it to have a cool effect but
doesn't<00:02:36.520> have<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.690> overlay<00:02:38.440> dark<00:02:38.770> effect<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
doesn't have this overlay dark effect so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.370 
doesn't have this overlay dark effect so
we'll<00:02:40.930> use<00:02:41.080> soft<00:02:41.380> light<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:43.020> gonna<00:02:44.020> go<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
we'll use soft light and gonna go to the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.430 
we'll use soft light and gonna go to the
beginning<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.920> clip<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:46.900> trim

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
beginning of the clip so you can trim

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:56.110 
beginning of the clip so you can trim
out<00:02:48.120> if<00:02:49.120> you're<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.260> clip

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.890 

you<00:02:56.690> want<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.959> make<00:02:57.080> sure<00:02:57.319> that<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.900> under

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you want to make sure that this is under

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.890 
you want to make sure that this is under
so<00:03:00.769> when<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.069> do<00:03:01.220> delete<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:03.200> doesn't<00:03:04.900> delete

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
so when you do delete it doesn't delete

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.089 
so when you do delete it doesn't delete
with<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.349> so<00:03:07.220> put<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.560> little<00:03:09.739> bar

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
with it so put this that little bar

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.890 
with it so put this that little bar
right<00:03:10.129> there<00:03:10.610> now<00:03:10.879> it<00:03:10.940> shows<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.569> where<00:03:11.750> it's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
right there now it shows you where it's

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.350 
right there now it shows you where it's
pinned<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:13.360> which<00:03:15.250> zoom<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.489> here<00:03:19.269> move<00:03:20.269> it

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
pinned to which zoom in here move it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.030 
pinned to which zoom in here move it
over<00:03:20.629> here<00:03:21.019> then<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.310> delete<00:03:22.640> this<00:03:22.879> and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
over here then you can delete this and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.229 
over here then you can delete this and
you<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.250> line<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:25.909> back<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.629> now<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.290> have

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
you can line it back up so now you have

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.410 
you can line it back up so now you have
now<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.299> have<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.810> overlay<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:32.209> can

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
now you have the overlay and you can

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.130 
now you have the overlay and you can
clear<00:03:32.780> out<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:35.180> can<00:03:35.390> line<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.629> up<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:35.930> make

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
clear out you can line it up to make

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.240 
clear out you can line it up to make
sure<00:03:36.290> they're<00:03:36.650> going<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.799> be<00:03:36.950> even<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.920> over

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
sure they're going to be even so over

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:49.140 
sure they're going to be even so over
here<00:03:41.560> make<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.739> little<00:03:42.950> bit<00:03:43.129> shorter

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.180 

and<00:03:49.690> once<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.989> get<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.319> effect<00:03:50.680> down<00:03:50.920> it's

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
and once you get this effect down it's

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.410 
and once you get this effect down it's
takes<00:03:51.940> seconds<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.540> do<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:54.010> okay<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.120> now<00:03:55.239> it's

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
takes seconds to do so okay so now it's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:05.789 
takes seconds to do so okay so now it's
overlaid<00:04:02.550> just<00:04:03.550> cleaning<00:04:04.120> this<00:04:04.269> out<00:04:04.799> looks

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
overlaid just cleaning this out looks

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:15.539 
overlaid just cleaning this out looks
better<00:04:06.069> you<00:04:06.790> can<00:04:07.000> move<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.450> back<00:04:07.720> over<00:04:07.959> here

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.640 

okay<00:04:16.549> so<00:04:17.450> now<00:04:17.570> you<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.870> it<00:04:17.900> overlaid<00:04:18.410> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
okay so now you have it overlaid and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:32.990 
okay so now you have it overlaid and
this<00:04:19.100> is<00:04:19.250> what<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:19.519> going<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.730> look<00:04:19.790> like

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.860 

you

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.730 

so<00:04:39.870> it's<00:04:40.050> cool<00:04:40.230> about

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
so it's cool about

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.890 
so it's cool about
the<00:04:41.860> background<00:04:42.310> moving<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.389> have<00:04:43.569> the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
the background moving and you have the

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.499 
the background moving and you have the
flag<00:04:44.259> with<00:04:45.009> the<00:04:45.039> with<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.880> wind<00:04:46.090> moving

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 
flag with the with the wind moving

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.900 
flag with the with the wind moving
really<00:04:46.810> fast<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.860> it's<00:04:48.130> sped<00:04:48.370> up<00:04:48.520> and

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
really fast because it's sped up and

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.100 
really fast because it's sped up and
then<00:04:49.750> you<00:04:50.560> have<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:52.270> thing<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.630> isn't<00:04:52.750> sped

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
then you have the thing that isn't sped

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.140 
then you have the thing that isn't sped
up<00:04:53.259> the<00:04:53.710> foot<00:04:53.979> you<00:04:54.130> can't<00:04:54.370> see<00:04:54.759> the<00:04:54.910> clouds

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
up the foot you can't see the clouds

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.080 
up the foot you can't see the clouds
moving<00:04:55.449> and<00:04:55.810> the<00:04:56.229> flag<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.919> still<00:04:57.669> moving

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
moving and the flag is still moving

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.820 
moving and the flag is still moving
pretty<00:04:58.120> fast<00:04:58.389> but<00:04:58.900> not<00:04:58.930> as<00:04:59.050> fast<00:04:59.199> as<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.710> other

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
pretty fast but not as fast as the other

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.950 
pretty fast but not as fast as the other
