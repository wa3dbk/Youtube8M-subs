00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.850 
easier for you and it a stopped when the
chain<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.520> broken<00:01:56.659> unless<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> two<00:01:58.200> colors<00:01:58.710> on

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
chain is broken unless the two colors on

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.649 
chain is broken unless the two colors on
each<00:01:59.070> side<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> chain<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> same<00:02:00.450> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
each side of the chain is the same that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.580 
each side of the chain is the same that
it<00:02:00.810> like<00:02:01.670> magnetically<00:02:02.670> pull<00:02:03.030> together<00:02:03.590> and

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it like magnetically pull together and

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.170 
it like magnetically pull together and
you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.070> gauge<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> top<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
you can see that gauge at the top that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.440 
you can see that gauge at the top that
goes<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.630> every<00:02:06.780> time<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.259> crack<00:02:08.129> that's<00:02:09.119> like<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
goes up every time I crack that's like a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.109 
goes up every time I crack that's like a
little

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
little

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.330 
little
special<00:02:10.569> thing<00:02:10.780> or<00:02:10.959> whatever<00:02:11.049> and<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.129> makes

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
special thing or whatever and it makes

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
special thing or whatever and it makes
everything<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.879> start<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.209> go<00:02:13.330> backwards

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
everything to start to go backwards

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.550 
everything to start to go backwards
instead<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.530> going<00:02:14.769> forward<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.849> give<00:02:16.120> and

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
instead of going forward and give and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.930 
instead of going forward and give and
take<00:02:17.560> out<00:02:17.739> all<00:02:17.769> the<00:02:18.099> things<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> same

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
take out all the things of the same

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.890 
take out all the things of the same
color<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:19.540> that's<00:02:20.200> pretty<00:02:20.379> good<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:21.040> power

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
color so that's pretty good the power

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.690 
color so that's pretty good the power
you<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.019> upgrades<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.680> go<00:02:23.860> that's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
you get upgrades as you go that's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.339 
you get upgrades as you go that's
probably<00:02:25.030> why<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.659> the<00:02:25.810> time<00:02:26.080> in<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
probably why it and get the time in the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.940 
probably why it and get the time in the
first<00:02:26.500> time<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.159> why<00:02:27.370> I'm<00:02:27.579> all<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.120> start<00:02:29.049> this

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
first time and why I'm all to start this

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.839 
first time and why I'm all to start this
particular<00:02:30.129> time<00:02:31.019> because<00:02:32.019> I'm<00:02:32.620> much<00:02:33.519> more

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
particular time because I'm much more

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.759 
particular time because I'm much more

the more points you getting BAM
obliterated<00:03:13.840> my<00:03:13.870> first<00:03:14.260> time<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.940> yeah<00:03:16.900> let

see<00:03:37.389> right<00:03:37.810> there<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.049> took<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.470> away<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.560> ten

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
see right there I took it away and ten

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.900 
see right there I took it away and ten
is<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.799> max<00:03:42.010> level<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.400> get<00:03:42.489> an<00:03:42.609> achievement

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
is the max level you get an achievement

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.360 
is the max level you get an achievement
for<00:03:43.150> max<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:43.510> all<00:03:43.690> four<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.319> them<00:03:44.530> oh<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.220> it's

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
for max and all four of them oh but it's

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.189 
for max and all four of them oh but it's
extremely<00:03:45.790> hard<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.180> get<00:03:46.419> all<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:46.870> medals

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
extremely hard to get all the medals

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.629 
extremely hard to get all the medals
because<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.829> beat<00:03:47.949> all<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.370> time

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
because you have to beat all the time

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.430 
because you have to beat all the time
things<00:03:49.000> and<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:49.449> stuff<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.870> basically

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
things and all that stuff you basically

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.699 
things and all that stuff you basically
have<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.889> have<00:03:50.919> like<00:03:51.430> 95%<00:03:52.389> of<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.139> medals<00:03:53.500> to

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
have to have like 95% of the medals to

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.520 
have to have like 95% of the medals to
avoid<00:03:54.040> all<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.819> upgrades<00:03:55.139> which<00:03:56.139> I<00:03:56.290> think

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
avoid all of the upgrades which I think

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.960 
avoid all of the upgrades which I think
I<00:03:56.590> can<00:03:56.769> do<00:03:56.919> but<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.190> would<00:03:57.310> be<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.699> little

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
I can do but it would be a little

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.860 
I can do but it would be a little
difficult<00:03:58.150> because<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.660> have<00:03:58.780> 147<00:03:59.709> out<00:03:59.829> of<00:04:00.010> 189

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
difficult because I have 147 out of 189
