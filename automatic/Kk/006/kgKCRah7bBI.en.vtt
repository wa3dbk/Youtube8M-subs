00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.620
 Hatch crowd serenaded speaks okay 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.690
 that the name was Joseph 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.420
 I'm an expert in the sports sector. 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.789
 serenade savassi and today we are going to 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
 some tips on the first guitar 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.230
 nor on the purchase of the first is the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 consuming aspects are important is the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 first fact is that as the person goes 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.039
 to start playing stock is dating 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.129
 in few it will be natural and even the 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:38.730
 garden shacks enough for you 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.360
 feel even that your children are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.520
 prepared to play the instrument is 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 we have some models also help 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.410
 a lot of that, okay? 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 It's more the main detail than looking at 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 Who is not even previously evacuated? 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.230
 because some guitars have 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 little more 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.090
 it's a little more time in container to leave 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.620
 of a charge the cold arrives here in Brazil 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.440
 a tropical climate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.960
 so it's interesting to note a little 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.400
 the height of the strings but also a 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.369
 very easy question right? 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 I like for example the knowledge I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.790
 I like to get shot 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.780
 the option is to make with my clients that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.160
 always asked me and look at this letter okay 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.259
 Malta 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.840
 this is normal after all we are talking about 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.479
 way she suffers interference 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.320
 is to avoid you have an arm a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.820
 little wider that is what this curve 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.910
 behind the traffic is one or more broader 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.500
 in shorter so where it is then 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 has details that already have more arm 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 comfortable of course this is super 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.580
 also important to assess in relation to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.280
 bearers we have species brands in 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.990
 different styles of scavengers 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.899
 Single tasters called tasters 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.750
 singles and we have a bank and the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.479
 state section there is a double queue for 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.929
 who wants more or his expulsion in the 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.250
 your drive with less noise is that too 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.240
 it's very interesting 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.520
 is one of the styles is also often the 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.840
 have a quality style by the captures 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.990
 to captions that tend to have more gains 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.120
 more aggressive to the fans more regret is 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.430
 temers that are more deeply connected than 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 what we are seeking is a matter 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.180
 It is also important to evaluate the guitar 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.170
 for themes chosen today that are 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.200
 in the market with a line for who 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.030
 wants to start touching my knowing how 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.820
 enough for these issues even the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:50.820
 for example we have models 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.709
 extract is we Romanian its expulsion 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.190
 semi-acoustic we have several mutations 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.250
 it is important to note that no tip 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.080
 It is also very important to have a 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.160
 reference of the sound you have released 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.739
 style you like 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.530
 you often lead to shopping 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.239
 and that's how important each car is 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.030
 sometimes customers usually 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.600
 ask myself 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.660
 is the guitarist who the woods on days 2 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.610
 3 thousand cars a show is ones arrived at 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.440
 cite until it is a matter of seeing the 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.790
 man has several steps I want to show more 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.620
 that's not it 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.880
 are questions of tinga and ricardo guitar 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 of your team 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.950
 is its characteristic and already has the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.770
 styles some guitars apply 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.180
 better than the others 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.920
 then this will also depend on the style 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.690
 You want to cause rain with 70 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.730
 holiday boxes 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.560
 It's cool to always have a 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.470
 reference to fine-tuning pain is a 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.570
 very important accessory for those who 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.700
 to start playing does not usually say too 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.390
 by your customers who always ask me 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.880
 was the tuner is interesting and I do not 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.810
 I am at risk of becoming dependent on 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.450
 pointed out 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.870
 I usually give a tip very 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:09.930
 interesting, and this tip is as follows. 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:14.550
 I usually talk about glasses, too. 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.519
 who is the tuner he is great and even 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.989
 Why are you going to educate in your book with 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.400
 every note looks this is a beak you eat 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:28.400
 It's ala nothing to assume this is home 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.460
 It's not cool, this is you, and you? 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.550
 knowing the notes of tello sounds 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.590
 the choice of quality cables that 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.380
 A mesh is very cool. 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.259
 the clubs are cool is the metal 11 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.720
 When is this plastic better? 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.569
 so these details are also good 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.199
 significant upstream by end to 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.199
 be at the end 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.749
 That's it folks, I hope it 's the 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.330
 last the tips 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:15.819
 'in search of viable encounters with 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.110
