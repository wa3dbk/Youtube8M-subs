00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:13.809
 And there , everyone, beauty, rafael roque and everyone. 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.019
 Here you are a box in my new microphone. 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.000
 People, I'll try to open here for you. 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.070
 I can also open business here 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.880
 I'm recording here obviously if someone 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.439
 here on mobile 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.740
 But you can open here using my 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.489
 farc I'm going to loose here fast and already 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 take it back and you're done 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:43.829
 box and you can see a microphone 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 studio arcane 01 usb 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:56.430
 in it I had already taken a look at boxes and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.430
 microphone he denied that he had to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:02:07.530
 down a usb microphone cable 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:02:10.890
 here in the microphone soon there already 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.890
 using it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.940
 and let's do the test 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.310
 good people though here with the microphone 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.470
 already installed on your computer and such 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.080
 What do you want to know about yourself? 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.700
 audio quality and is as follows 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.769
 There are some things to test here. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.959
 so I'm still testing some 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.299
 settings on it I have to see 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.940
 exactly what will be the volume all 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.950
 but it's basically a test for you to 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.019
 can give me feedback already though 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.700
 How is the audio right now ? 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.260
 I need to change something if it 's too 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.170
 low if it's too loud 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.700
 I do not know that I want to know you and I 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.099
 I have some problems here that I use 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.690
 to modify the audio and one of the 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.720
 problems I use here is the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.180
 city ​​that I use enough to take away 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.470
 of the background noise and such may be that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.970
 Let's have a background noise from my 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.489
 computer and such because that microphone is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.739
 very sensitive was for those who did not call 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.609
 still in the video is a microphone his name 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.890
 Arcane Black is the Arcane USB Black 10 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.599
 friend songs in his name and he is a 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.579
 cool microphone and cost dearly 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.919
 because the high dollar then pay I think 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.840
 with three hundred reais but neither he nor 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:22.060
 it was much cheaper among them 150 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.579
 but as the dollar goes up and 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.569
 such and ended up getting this price 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.799
 I believe it 's because of the dollar but 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.519
 it seems that the audio I got 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.489
 test 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.989
 - here I listen to my audi ps that stayed 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.230
 much better than before but also 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.700
 by the very clear effect of the sound and 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.430
 obviously have something that is not 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.500
 I need to change, I'm late. Here it is. 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.419
 For you and I want to see how it goes. 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.940
 be when it was recorded live English 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:52.870
 because I'm going to test the settings 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.639
 his still nuno sound recorder 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.230
 nvidia shadowplay to see if I'm going 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.269
 able to record for finding it was 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.489
 even if you are going to have to record when 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.319
 was to record live I record I start to 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.269
 burn with audacity and start recording 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.129
 also by the judge to record the normal game only 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.129
 the game closing the play and then 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:11.889
 simply play along with the audio to the 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.720
 has already had a better quality and 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.910
 Bet you have to do 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.970
 assists still on the basic thing yet 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.030
 I think it's the most complicated part and 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.460
 that was to get a mike I already did 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.710
 So now it's just joy, just test it. 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.150
 get feedback from you on this video and 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.430
 People, I really like it. 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.139
 that you all know the feedback there 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.830
 in the description of how the quality is 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.889
 all of you not only one not only the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.180
 everyone else because I get the 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.370
 feedback also when I got the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.900
 There was only one microphone on my 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.440
 heard of the network which is the reflection in 7.1 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.970
 kraken process with tone and gave a scold 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.699
 From the father of the galley I told you never 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.389
 It was was not one thing but giving to 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.620
 to endure 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.660
 so I want to know how it is 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.560
 this microphone but agent david beckham 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.460
 once I enjoyed having a feedback 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.250
 everybody is back there in this microphone 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.100
 to know if it's really good if 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.860
 it was worth it and that and I stayed 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.449
 there are days holding me to not 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.180
 record some of the things she's going to 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:18.039
 for you some tips and such to the end 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.780
 four hours on end to speak 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.479
 the truth is not 24 that works 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.270
 three work force in the online radar are 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.800
 in towers and are some tips there that already 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.690
 Do you have or not I said I want 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.729
 17 to the channel I'll do will 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.650
 post all those old tips that 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.139
 proves that you will find more there 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.870
 both the video that was over I go 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.520
 bet they will try to recreate them go 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.199
 pass you guys there guys is on 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.180
 being the personal game is already more advanced 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.320
 We have things that we do not know. 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.550
 What do you mean, I do not know either? 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.210
 which are basic can you me 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.830
 pass 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.840
 But that's the one thing you know, you know. 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.449
 something useful in some of the tips 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.889
 that I'm going to post you leaving 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.610
 during the scheme making more 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.440
 front 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.970
 but now an audio quality 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.830
 I think it will give a quality to the 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.860
 further down the canal 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.479
 so mine was basically this I want 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.610
 know of your feedback there in the 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.460
 I will not get tired of asking for a 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.560
 feedback I want to ask beck ours 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.690
 feedback that was good I want green beck 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.940
 How's that guy there talk to me? 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.710
 of flex that was half becks and I did not 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.409
 I'm using the pop filter then 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.760
 really can stay a little bit in 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:26.020
 A little stressed and when I say 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.940
 Paulo because they turn around the microphone 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.229
 but I do not think it's going to be so so 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.060
 Bad I do not think I 'll stay 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.099
 I think it's cool not being able to get the 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.539
 own at the moment who knows I do 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.450
 a one-time story because it was giving 

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:38.860
 a look 150 in 150 dilma that was by 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.639
 a guess is what you can do with the sock 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.529
 nylon 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.839
 if I have how is even the business 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.899
 the round business can then do the 

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:48.279
 boy got to spend 150 dilma 160 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.019
 Dilma I do not know is not exactly what 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:53.259
 I want, that's it guys I hope 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.669
 You liked it and as I said it happens 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.619
 the feedback people want to know from the feedback 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.089
 you go out in the description if you do not 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.829
 is on the microphone but stayed on 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:02.979
 increased the sounds have to decrease a 

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:04.509
 little sound and so on, so that's it 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:09.389
 people, I hope you have enjoyed a 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.389
 hug you and say hi
