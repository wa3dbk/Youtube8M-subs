00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
called hunted this right here is

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.139 
called hunted this right here is
definitely<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.649> high-traffic<00:01:18.130> spot<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.119> you

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
definitely a high-traffic spot and you

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.460 
definitely a high-traffic spot and you
can<00:01:19.360> go<00:01:19.509> in<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.690> water<00:01:19.869> as<00:01:20.020> well<00:01:20.200> obviously

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
can go in the water as well obviously

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.170 
can go in the water as well obviously
smoke<00:01:20.770> unless<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.310> guys<00:01:21.399> probably<00:01:21.640> know<00:01:21.850> but

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
smoke unless you guys probably know but

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.820 
smoke unless you guys probably know but
you<00:01:22.270> can<00:01:22.420> also<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:23.050> wall<00:01:23.289> run<00:01:23.470> right<00:01:23.680> through

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
you can also just wall run right through

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.109 
you can also just wall run right through
the<00:01:23.979> waterfall<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.610> get<00:01:24.759> through<00:01:24.970> there

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
the waterfall to get through there

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.310 
the waterfall to get through there
quicker<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:26.229> I<00:01:26.649> think<00:01:27.220> that's<00:01:27.399> actually

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
quicker and I I think that's actually

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.210 
quicker and I I think that's actually
under<00:01:29.320> used<00:01:29.530> spot<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.800> don't<00:01:29.950> think<00:01:30.100> many

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
under used spot I don't think many

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.469 
under used spot I don't think many
people<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.729> that<00:01:30.759> you<00:01:30.940> can<00:01:31.060> actually<00:01:31.210> just

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
people know that you can actually just

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.540 
people know that you can actually just
wall<00:01:31.660> run<00:01:31.840> through<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.200> waterfall<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:33.009> some

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
wall run through the waterfall so some

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.620 
wall run through the waterfall so some
of<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.670> guys<00:01:33.759> may<00:01:33.940> think<00:01:34.149> that's<00:01:34.330> kind<00:01:34.570> of

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
of you guys may think that's kind of

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.900 
of you guys may think that's kind of
obvious<00:01:34.810> but<00:01:35.320> i<00:01:35.860> don't<00:01:36.460> know<00:01:36.490> i<00:01:36.550> just<00:01:36.610> wanted

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
obvious but i don't know i just wanted

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.010 
obvious but i don't know i just wanted

know i just wanted to show you guys how
far<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.060> can<00:01:40.210> actually<00:01:40.450> wall<00:01:41.020> run<00:01:41.320> across

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
far you can actually wall run across

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.219 
far you can actually wall run across
this<00:01:42.009> map<00:01:42.280> it's<00:01:42.550> pretty<00:01:42.820> insane<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:43.869> can<00:01:44.050> get

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
this map it's pretty insane you can get

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.460 
this map it's pretty insane you can get
almost<00:01:44.410> all<00:01:44.830> the<00:01:45.250> way<00:01:45.369> around<00:01:45.580> this<00:01:45.970> entire

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
almost all the way around this entire

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.020 
almost all the way around this entire
house<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.950> i<00:01:48.039> wish<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.369> could<00:01:48.610> go<00:01:48.729> up<00:01:48.819> there

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
house and i wish you could go up there

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.339 
house and i wish you could go up there
that<00:01:49.240> would<00:01:49.360> have<00:01:49.450> been<00:01:49.509> awesome<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.899> get<00:01:50.259> on

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:50.349 
that would have been awesome to get on

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:53.010 
that would have been awesome to get on
that<00:01:50.670> little<00:01:51.670> roof<00:01:51.940> right<00:01:52.179> there<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.539> well<00:01:52.780> but

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
that little roof right there as well but

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.510 
that little roof right there as well but
now<00:01:53.560> i'm<00:01:53.649> going<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.830> show<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.920> guys<00:01:54.039> this<00:01:54.340> is

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
now i'm going to show you guys this is

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.760 
now i'm going to show you guys this is
the<00:01:54.670> bridges<00:01:54.940> where<00:01:55.300> be<00:01:55.509> dom<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.990> i<00:01:56.229> think<00:01:56.259> and

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
the bridges where be dom is i think and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.059 
the bridges where be dom is i think and
a<00:01:57.369> demolition<00:01:58.270> bomb<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:58.840> right<00:01:59.590> there<00:01:59.800> getting

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
a demolition bomb so right there getting

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.680 
a demolition bomb so right there getting
across<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.459> bridge<00:02:00.640> fest<00:02:00.910> w<00:02:01.090> school<00:02:01.509> as<00:02:01.630> well

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
across the bridge fest w school as well

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.419 
across the bridge fest w school as well
because<00:02:01.989> you<00:02:02.080> can't<00:02:02.319> just<00:02:02.500> jump<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:02.920> across

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
because you can't just jump right across

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.609 
because you can't just jump right across
also<00:02:04.270> there's<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:04.569> little<00:02:04.810> rock<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.530> go

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
also there's this little rock you can go

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.870 
also there's this little rock you can go
on<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:05.800> outside<00:02:06.190> too<00:02:06.429> if<00:02:06.489> you're<00:02:06.670> trying<00:02:06.789> to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
on the outside too if you're trying to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.639 
on the outside too if you're trying to
be<00:02:07.000> extra<00:02:07.149> sneaky<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.929> back<00:02:08.170> over<00:02:08.410> there

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
be extra sneaky in the back over there

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.830 
be extra sneaky in the back over there
but<00:02:08.950> i<00:02:09.399> don't<00:02:09.670> know<00:02:09.729> how<00:02:09.789> often<00:02:10.330> you'll<00:02:10.690> use

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
but i don't know how often you'll use

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.510 
but i don't know how often you'll use
that<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:11.349> i<00:02:11.380> don't<00:02:11.620> think<00:02:11.680> many<00:02:12.010> people<00:02:12.130> know

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
that but i don't think many people know

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.729 
that but i don't think many people know
about<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:13.000> either<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:14.319> right<00:02:14.500> here<00:02:14.650> i'm

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
about that either this right here i'm

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.199 
about that either this right here i'm
just<00:02:14.770> showing<00:02:15.099> you<00:02:15.220> guys<00:02:15.310> again<00:02:15.849> how<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.120> can

just showing you guys again how you can
go<00:02:16.569> all<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.840> way<00:02:16.930> across<00:02:17.110> from<00:02:17.709> both<00:02:17.920> sides<00:02:18.250> so

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
go all the way across from both sides so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.240 
go all the way across from both sides so
i<00:02:18.900> hope<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.930> guys<00:02:20.110> learn<00:02:20.470> something<00:02:20.830> here<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
let's get right into the next map so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.449 
let's get right into the next map so
this<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.530> second<00:02:23.920> map<00:02:24.069> i'm<00:02:24.220> going<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> be

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
this is the second map i'm going to be

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.640 
this is the second map i'm going to be
showing<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.790> guys<00:02:24.849> called<00:02:25.330> evac<00:02:26.050> from<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
showing you guys called evac from the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.460 
showing you guys called evac from the
beta<00:02:26.860> obviously<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.270> map<00:02:28.569> is<00:02:28.599> probably

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
beta obviously and this map is probably

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.070 
beta obviously and this map is probably
the<00:02:29.950> best<00:02:30.220> map<00:02:30.489> for<00:02:30.730> wall<00:02:30.910> running<00:02:31.180> out<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.569> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
the best map for wall running out of the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.660 
the best map for wall running out of the
three<00:02:32.290> maps<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.739> beta<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.160> guys<00:02:33.310> will<00:02:33.459> see

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
three maps in the beta you guys will see

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.190 
three maps in the beta you guys will see
all<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> crazy<00:02:34.060> little<00:02:34.330> spots<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.810> can<00:02:34.840> go<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
all the crazy little spots you can go to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500 
all the crazy little spots you can go to
you<00:02:35.830> can<00:02:35.860> almost<00:02:36.160> won't<00:02:36.610> run<00:02:36.819> on<00:02:36.849> anything<00:02:37.300> in

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you can almost won't run on anything in

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.449 
you can almost won't run on anything in
this<00:02:37.599> map<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.260> super<00:02:38.650> fun<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.220> do

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
this map and it's super fun just to do

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.100 
this map and it's super fun just to do
like<00:02:39.760> when<00:02:39.940> i<00:02:39.970> was<00:02:40.180> first<00:02:40.629> trying<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.020> get

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
like when i was first trying to get

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.170 
like when i was first trying to get
footage<00:02:41.349> for<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.709> video<00:02:42.069> i<00:02:42.370> was<00:02:42.879> literally

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
footage for this video i was literally

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.880 
footage for this video i was literally
just<00:02:43.390> running<00:02:43.930> around<00:02:44.020> trying<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.709> all

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
just running around trying to have all

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.010 
just running around trying to have all
run<00:02:45.040> on<00:02:45.129> everything<00:02:45.610> and<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.849> pretty<00:02:46.180> fun<00:02:46.569> so

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
run on everything and it's pretty fun so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.750 
run on everything and it's pretty fun so
you<00:02:47.650> guys<00:02:47.800> will<00:02:47.950> see<00:02:47.980> like<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.520> stuff<00:02:48.700> like

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
you guys will see like little stuff like

that like

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.410 
that like
people<00:02:50.530> don't<00:02:50.920> expect<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.610> especially<00:02:52.210> it

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
people don't expect that especially it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.600 
people don't expect that especially it
this<00:02:52.960> is<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.170> good<00:02:53.380> maneuver<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.070> like<00:02:54.280> even

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
this is a good maneuver if like even

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
this is a good maneuver if like even
they<00:02:54.760> have<00:02:54.880> UAV<00:02:55.570> because<00:02:55.960> they're<00:02:56.110> not<00:02:56.260> really

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they have UAV because they're not really

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.020 
they have UAV because they're not really
going<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.740> expect<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.220> be<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.370> high<00:02:57.670> up<00:02:57.850> on

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
going to expect you to be a high up on

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.270 
going to expect you to be a high up on
the<00:02:58.060> wall<00:02:58.360> or<00:02:58.540> anything<00:02:58.570> like<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.990> so<00:02:59.410> like

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
the wall or anything like that so like

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.130 
the wall or anything like that so like
stuff<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:01.000> although<00:03:01.450> it<00:03:01.570> not<00:03:01.840> might

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
stuff like this although it not might

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.730 
stuff like this although it not might
not<00:03:02.350> be<00:03:02.650> that<00:03:03.090> useful<00:03:04.090> like<00:03:04.750> all<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.260> time<00:03:05.530> you

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
not be that useful like all the time you

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.770 
not be that useful like all the time you
just<00:03:05.770> never<00:03:06.220> know<00:03:06.460> maybe<00:03:06.790> UAV<00:03:07.330> or<00:03:07.450> something

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
just never know maybe UAV or something

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.270 
just never know maybe UAV or something
and<00:03:07.870> they<00:03:07.960> see<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.140> red<00:03:08.440> dot<00:03:08.710> down<00:03:09.040> there

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
and they see a red dot down there

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.530 
and they see a red dot down there
they're<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.520> gonna<00:03:09.670> expect<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.300> all

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
they're not gonna expect you to be all

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.500 
they're not gonna expect you to be all
the<00:03:10.690> way<00:03:10.780> up<00:03:10.900> top<00:03:11.080> in<00:03:11.320> the<00:03:11.410> wall<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.210> honestly<00:03:13.210> I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the way up top in the wall so honestly I

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.870 
the way up top in the wall so honestly I
think<00:03:14.020> when<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.740> game<00:03:15.040> comes<00:03:15.280> out<00:03:15.490> as<00:03:15.730> the

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
think when this game comes out as the

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.640 
think when this game comes out as the
game<00:03:16.060> gets<00:03:16.210> older<00:03:16.600> you're<00:03:16.720> gonna<00:03:16.780> see<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.170> ton

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
game gets older you're gonna see a ton

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.470 
game gets older you're gonna see a ton
more<00:03:17.890> people<00:03:17.950> wall<00:03:18.490> running<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.330> is<00:03:19.450> a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
more people wall running and this is a

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.760 
more people wall running and this is a
good<00:03:19.750> way<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.110> ahead<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.530> curve

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
good way to get ahead of the curve

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.680 
good way to get ahead of the curve
because<00:03:21.130> right<00:03:21.400> now<00:03:21.430> people<00:03:21.910> aren't<00:03:22.330> used<00:03:22.510> to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
because right now people aren't used to

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.120 
because right now people aren't used to
it<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.050> they're<00:03:23.200> not<00:03:23.350> going<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.680> expecting

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
it so they're not going to be expecting

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.700 
it so they're not going to be expecting
to<00:03:24.280> be<00:03:24.310> up<00:03:24.520> in<00:03:24.640> these<00:03:24.790> places<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:25.630> next<00:03:26.230> up<00:03:26.440> I'm

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
can see here I'm getting around i wish i

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.660 
can see here I'm getting around i wish i
would<00:04:11.709> have<00:04:11.739> made<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.070> perfectly<00:04:12.519> we

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
would have made this perfectly we

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.070 
would have made this perfectly we
shouldn't<00:04:12.910> have<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.120> climb<00:04:13.360> right<00:04:13.540> there<00:04:13.780> but

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
shouldn't have to climb right there but

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.860 
shouldn't have to climb right there but
i<00:04:14.560> think<00:04:15.459> it's<00:04:15.580> insane<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.030> you<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.480> run<00:04:16.690> all

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
i think it's insane that you can run all

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.690 
i think it's insane that you can run all
the<00:04:17.200> way<00:04:17.230> around<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.830> outside<00:04:17.859> of<00:04:18.280> this<00:04:18.400> map

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
the way around the outside of this map

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.280 
the way around the outside of this map
and<00:04:18.880> actually<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.269> behind<00:04:19.600> people<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.049> that

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
and actually get behind people like that

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.110 
and actually get behind people like that
so<00:04:20.890> you<00:04:20.950> could<00:04:21.160> even<00:04:21.310> got<00:04:21.549> on<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.760> other<00:04:21.910> wall

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
so you could even got on the other wall

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.940 
so you could even got on the other wall
to<00:04:22.270> my<00:04:22.419> left<00:04:22.690> right<00:04:23.140> there<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.650> could<00:04:23.860> have

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
to my left right there you could have

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.560 
to my left right there you could have
even<00:04:24.160> wall<00:04:24.460> run<00:04:24.640> further<00:04:24.970> on<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.240> but

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
even wall run further on that but

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.180 
even wall run further on that but
decided<00:04:25.900> just<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.080> go<00:04:26.169> right<00:04:26.500> there<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:26.980> what

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
decided just to go right there and what

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.590 
decided just to go right there and what
do<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.340> know<00:04:27.460> I<00:04:27.490> caught<00:04:27.970> something<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.419> back

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
off guard so hopefully you guys enjoyed

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.110 
off guard so hopefully you guys enjoyed
that<00:04:32.080> now<00:04:32.680> let's<00:04:32.919> move<00:04:33.070> into<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> final<00:04:33.700> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
that now let's move into the final and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.600 
that now let's move into the final and
third<00:04:34.419> map<00:04:34.690> which<00:04:34.960> is<00:04:35.140> combine<00:04:35.740> this<00:04:36.340> map

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
third map which is combine this map

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.730 
third map which is combine this map
doesn't<00:04:36.850> have<00:04:37.090> too<00:04:37.479> many<00:04:37.510> spots<00:04:38.110> for<00:04:38.350> morning

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
doesn't have too many spots for morning

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.320 
doesn't have too many spots for morning
I<00:04:38.830> mean<00:04:38.979> I<00:04:39.010> guess<00:04:39.070> it<00:04:39.340> does<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.729> has<00:04:40.150> is

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
I mean I guess it does this has is

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.670 
I mean I guess it does this has is
dedicated<00:04:40.900> wall<00:04:41.080> right<00:04:41.260> here<00:04:41.290> which<00:04:41.560> is

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
dedicated wall right here which is

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.010 
dedicated wall right here which is
pretty<00:04:41.979> much<00:04:42.220> just<00:04:42.520> for<00:04:42.790> wall<00:04:43.060> running<00:04:43.300> but

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
pretty much just for wall running but

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.780 
pretty much just for wall running but
than<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.470> there's<00:04:44.680> not<00:04:44.800> too<00:04:45.130> many<00:04:45.280> unique

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
than that there's not too many unique

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.510 
than that there's not too many unique
spots<00:04:46.210> i<00:04:46.390> say<00:04:46.740> i'll<00:04:47.740> show<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.040> guys<00:04:48.190> a<00:04:48.250> little

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
spots i say i'll show you guys a little

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.250 
spots i say i'll show you guys a little
bit<00:04:48.669> of<00:04:48.910> something<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:49.360> gameplay<00:04:49.960> where<00:04:50.200> i

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
bit of something like gameplay where i

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.710 
bit of something like gameplay where i
was<00:04:51.010> able<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.310> catch<00:04:51.820> a<00:04:51.940> few<00:04:52.210> people<00:04:52.510> off<00:04:52.690> guard

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
was able to catch a few people off guard

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.840 
was able to catch a few people off guard
but<00:04:53.320> obviously<00:04:53.979> i'm<00:04:54.160> sure<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:54.460> guys<00:04:54.520> knew

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
but obviously i'm sure you guys knew

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.450 
but obviously i'm sure you guys knew
about<00:04:55.060> all<00:04:55.300> this<00:04:55.680> be<00:04:56.680> dominating<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.250> middle

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
about all this be dominating the middle

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.130 
about all this be dominating the middle
here<00:04:57.640> so<00:04:57.850> that<00:04:58.030> can<00:04:58.270> be<00:04:58.300> a<00:04:58.450> good<00:04:58.510> way<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.840> cut

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
here so that can be a good way to cut

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.900 
here so that can be a good way to cut
through<00:04:59.380> and

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
through and

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.340 
through and
catch<00:05:00.000> him<00:05:00.120> off<00:05:00.300> guard<00:05:00.330> sometimes<00:05:00.810> it's<00:05:01.260> not

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
catch him off guard sometimes it's not

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.450 
catch him off guard sometimes it's not
too<00:05:01.500> many<00:05:01.620> people<00:05:01.800> like<00:05:01.890> so<00:05:02.010> if<00:05:02.100> he<00:05:02.160> comes<00:05:02.340> in

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
too many people like so if he comes in

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.000 
too many people like so if he comes in
the<00:05:02.520> middle<00:05:02.760> like<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:02.960> but<00:05:03.960> even<00:05:04.620> right<00:05:04.770> here

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
the middle like that but even right here

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.470 
the middle like that but even right here
like<00:05:05.160> while<00:05:05.430> running<00:05:05.550> across<00:05:05.880> these<00:05:06.150> walls

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
like while running across these walls

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.750 
like while running across these walls
and<00:05:06.690> jumping<00:05:07.140> over<00:05:07.350> people<00:05:07.530> people<00:05:08.520> are<00:05:08.610> not

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
and jumping over people people are not

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.790 
and jumping over people people are not
used<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:09.150> looking<00:05:09.330> above<00:05:10.110> them<00:05:10.410> they're<00:05:10.680> used

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
used to looking above them they're used

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.500 
used to looking above them they're used
to<00:05:10.860> looking<00:05:11.160> just<00:05:11.370> straightforward<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.270> a<00:05:12.300> lot

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
to looking just straightforward so a lot

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.850 
to looking just straightforward so a lot
of<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.690> times<00:05:12.930> we<00:05:13.110> may<00:05:13.260> catch<00:05:13.440> people<00:05:13.740> off

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
of the times we may catch people off

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.260 
of the times we may catch people off
guard<00:05:13.890> especially<00:05:14.430> in<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.820> beginning<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
guard especially in the beginning of the

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.090 
guard especially in the beginning of the
game<00:05:15.420> people<00:05:15.870> may<00:05:16.020> become<00:05:16.380> more<00:05:16.590> privy<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.980> it

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
game people may become more privy to it

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.730 
game people may become more privy to it
later<00:05:17.310> on<00:05:17.400> but<00:05:17.880> good<00:05:18.870> to<00:05:18.990> see<00:05:19.140> right<00:05:19.320> here<00:05:19.530> also
