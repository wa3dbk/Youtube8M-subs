00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.350
 rapanelli spa leader in the production of extra virgin olive oil from 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.499
 quality is pleased to present the latest generation decanter 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.600
 the copper model decanters between patented radiators made over 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.180
 fifty years are characterized by a constant search for innovation and 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 technological refinement 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.000
 the need to produce machines conditions not to produce having it 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.740
 disposing has led to the creation of the latest generation machines 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.110
 from the total flexibility that allows to adapt the working system 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.110
 to the type of product you want to obtain 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.580
 alongside the traditional decanter with three-phase operation is currently 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.700
 on the market the ecological decanter that allows to work without water 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.830
 process 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.950
 the scientific research developed by the most advanced university in the field 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.060
 but in fact determined the emergence of the technology that allows the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.360
 processing without process water elcom models 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.150
 the ecological decanter initially born as a solution to the problem of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.420
 replica production 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.040
 is now definitely established as it allows you to get today with a 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.190
 maximum content of natural antioxidants polyphenols 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.050
 which guarantee maximum resistance to oxidation than stability 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.860
 oil over time 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.160
 the ecological decanter then depending on the by-products you want to keep 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.700
 can work according to two options 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.520
 in two-phase processes with all the vegetation water discharged together 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.720
 to the olive pomace perfectly clean 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.430
 and two and a half phase processing with the recovery of 5 to 15% of water 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.710
 vegetation in case you want to get a room grown paladins 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.640
 in parallel with the technology of ecological decanters the research carried out 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.660
 forward in collaboration with the specialized universities of the sector has 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.420
 brought to the realization of decanter ag have ecological high yield 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.160
 enhanced that strong of the acquired patrimony in the processing without water 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.199
 of process 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:30.119
 have brought industrial productivity to the highest levels today 

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:34.709
 obtainable by guaranteeing the exaltation of other names or rendered quality 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 industrial environmental impact 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:44.519
 finally the latest generation cage model decanters are the gifts for the 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.739
 processing of pitted pastes 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.840
 the trend that is emerging today on the market proves the production of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.599
 walking oil and hazelnut you 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.860
 and the patented rapanche cage decanter models 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.190
 meet this need by ensuring maximum functionality 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.709
 and effectiveness 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.849
 technological level now reached by these equipments unthinkable up to 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.219
 10 years ago 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.609
 is pushing the search towards a new goal of using the alternative 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.479
 by-product without 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.169
 in this sense the possibility of proceeding to the 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.999
 separation of the stone from the pulp 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.779
 core can thus be reused as invariant as the pulp from 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.009
 recycle as a feed oh as a soil additive
