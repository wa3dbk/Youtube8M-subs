look like we're going to reveal the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.990 
look like we're going to reveal the
microphone<00:03:40.070> okay<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.130> as<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.580> can<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.880> in

microphone okay so as you can see in

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.870 
microphone okay so as you can see in
here<00:03:42.269> just<00:03:42.900> lay<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.080> down<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.860> get<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.340> MXL

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
here just lay that down you get a MXL

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.370 
here just lay that down you get a MXL
cloth<00:03:45.209> which<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.570> get<00:03:45.720> with<00:03:45.870> most<00:03:46.080> of<00:03:46.260> their

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
cloth which you get with most of their

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.479 
cloth which you get with most of their
microphones<00:03:48.140> then<00:03:49.140> you<00:03:49.260> get<00:03:49.440> your<00:03:49.470> USB<00:03:50.070> cable

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
microphones then you get your USB cable

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:51.800 
microphones then you get your USB cable
and<00:03:50.519> actually<00:03:50.940> looks<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.540> actually

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
and actually looks like this is actually

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.270 
and actually looks like this is actually
pretty<00:03:52.050> damn<00:03:52.290> long<00:03:52.590> I'd<00:03:52.769> say<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.130> is

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
pretty damn long I'd say this is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.229 
pretty damn long I'd say this is
probably<00:03:53.430> around<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.820> meter<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.209> half

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
probably around the meter and a half

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.509 
probably around the meter and a half
long<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:54.870> that's<00:03:55.019> good<00:03:55.230> they've<00:03:55.830> included<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
long so that's good they've included a

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.449 
long so that's good they've included a
satisfactory<00:03:57.150> link<00:03:57.510> cable<00:03:58.130> then<00:03:59.130> here<00:03:59.370> you

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
satisfactory link cable then here you

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.640
