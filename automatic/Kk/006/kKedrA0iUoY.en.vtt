best<00:01:57.800> way<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.040> making<00:01:58.550> yourself<00:01:58.909> top<00:01:59.240> dog

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
best way of making yourself top dog

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.260 
best way of making yourself top dog
without<00:01:59.780> being<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.409> me<00:02:01.060> people<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.150> think

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
without being to me people I think

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.230 
without being to me people I think
training<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:02.720> very<00:02:02.810> important<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:04.070> need<00:02:04.100> to

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
training is very important we need to

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.430 
training is very important we need to
teach<00:02:05.240> them<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.659> we're<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.990> ones<00:02:06.080> giving

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
teach them that we're the ones giving

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.800 
teach them that we're the ones giving
them<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.649> commands<00:02:07.119> so<00:02:08.119> those<00:02:08.239> commands<00:02:08.690> have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
them the commands so those commands have

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.800 
them the commands so those commands have
to<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:09.160> fairly<00:02:10.160> short<00:02:10.520> words<00:02:10.789> fairly<00:02:11.569> sharp

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
to be fairly short words fairly sharp

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.590 
to be fairly short words fairly sharp
now<00:02:12.470> they<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.800> be<00:02:12.860> consistent<00:02:13.220> sets<00:02:14.150> they

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
now they have to be consistent sets they

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.809 
now they have to be consistent sets they
you<00:02:15.080> know<00:02:15.140> simple<00:02:15.530> one<00:02:15.800> one<00:02:16.250> word<00:02:16.430> sort<00:02:16.760> of

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
you know simple one one word sort of

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.090 
you know simple one one word sort of
commands<00:02:17.180> okay<00:02:17.600> now<00:02:18.230> when<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:18.800> comes<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
commands okay now when it comes to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.860 
commands okay now when it comes to
teaching<00:02:19.280> your<00:02:19.550> dog<00:02:19.700> tricks<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.420> don't<00:02:20.810> know

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
teaching your dog tricks I don't know

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.449 
teaching your dog tricks I don't know
it's<00:02:21.019> best<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.530> when<00:02:22.010> they're<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.220> puppy

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
it's best to do it when they're a puppy

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.860 
it's best to do it when they're a puppy
but<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:22.940> there<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.120> chance<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.510> when<00:02:23.720> they're

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
but is there a chance that when they're

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.090 
but is there a chance that when they're
a<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.050> bit<00:02:24.230> older<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.739> still<00:02:24.920> teach

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
a little bit older you can still teach

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.370 
a little bit older you can still teach
them<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.400> thing<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.610> two<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.030> can<00:02:26.300> no<00:02:26.630> dogs<00:02:26.870> too

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
them a thing or two you can no dogs too

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.009 
them a thing or two you can no dogs too
old<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.709> learn<00:02:27.830> new<00:02:28.010> tricks<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.810> being

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
old to learn new tricks but just being

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.920 
old to learn new tricks but just being
consistent<00:02:30.340> doing<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> training<00:02:31.930> praising

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
consistent doing the training praising

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.090 
consistent doing the training praising
them<00:02:33.050> when<00:02:33.200> they<00:02:33.260> do<00:02:33.320> something<00:02:33.410> right<00:02:33.830> it's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
them when they do something right it's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.610 
them when they do something right it's
really<00:02:34.370> important<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.080> then<00:02:36.080> being

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
really important and then being

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.600 
really important and then being
consistent<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.250> really<00:02:37.610> really<00:02:37.760> important<00:02:39.610> of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
consistent is really really important of

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.820 
consistent is really really important of
course<00:02:41.000> while<00:02:41.330> we<00:02:41.510> want<00:02:41.810> our<00:02:42.050> dogs<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.500> behave

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
course while we want our dogs to behave

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.040 
course while we want our dogs to behave
it's<00:02:43.220> still<00:02:43.730> important<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.450> make<00:02:44.660> them<00:02:44.840> feel

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
it's still important to make them feel

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.920 
it's still important to make them feel
special<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:46.459> probably<00:02:46.880> not<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.540> good

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
special but it's probably not a good

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.140 
special but it's probably not a good
idea<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.650> give<00:02:48.860> your<00:02:48.980> dogs<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.519> same<00:02:49.760> treats

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
idea to give your dogs the same treats

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.949 
idea to give your dogs the same treats
that<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:50.840> enjoy<00:02:51.970> pip<00:02:52.970> some<00:02:53.329> human<00:02:53.660> foods<00:02:53.840> are

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
that you enjoy pip some human foods are

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.300 
that you enjoy pip some human foods are
actually<00:02:54.170> poisonous<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> dogs<00:02:54.680> such<00:02:55.190> as

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
actually poisonous to dogs such as

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.160 
actually poisonous to dogs such as
chocolate<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.060> actually<00:02:56.180> poisonous<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:57.019> is

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
chocolate it's actually poisonous it is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.810 
chocolate it's actually poisonous it is
and<00:02:57.500> why<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.100> think<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.400> we're<00:02:58.489> giving<00:02:58.579> them

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
and why we think that we're giving them

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.610 
and why we think that we're giving them
a<00:02:58.940> treat<00:02:59.360> we<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.840> actually<00:03:00.049> be<00:03:00.110> causing<00:03:00.530> them

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620
