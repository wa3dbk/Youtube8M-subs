00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
they're like what I'm doing or what

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.910 
they're like what I'm doing or what
they're<00:01:48.240> doing<00:01:48.509> individually<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
they're doing individually is right and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.490 
they're doing individually is right and
they're<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.350> think

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
if people were more humble and listened

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.270 
if people were more humble and listened
to<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.930> other<00:01:55.049> people<00:01:55.140> had<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.439> say<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.890> see
