00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
condition drugs that we've ever seen

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.730 
condition drugs that we've ever seen
it's<00:01:52.820> beyond<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:53.330> matting<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.260> mean<00:01:54.440> it's

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's beyond just matting I mean it's

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.210 
it's beyond just matting I mean it's
almost<00:01:55.280> like<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.520> helmet<00:01:55.880> on<00:01:56.090> their<00:01:56.300> bodies<00:01:56.750> and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
almost like a helmet on their bodies and

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.430 
almost like a helmet on their bodies and
the<00:01:58.220> skin<00:01:58.550> underneath<00:01:58.930> hasn't<00:01:59.930> had<00:02:00.050> any<00:02:00.260> air

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the skin underneath hasn't had any air

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.850 
the skin underneath hasn't had any air
so<00:02:00.710> there's<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.980> lot<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:02.170> more<00:02:03.170> skin<00:02:03.560> under

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
so there's a lot of more skin under

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.570 
so there's a lot of more skin under
there<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.560> people<00:02:09.740> don't<00:02:09.950> realize<00:02:10.340> when<00:02:10.490> they

around<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.590> little<00:02:46.680> docks<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.219> it<00:02:47.310> was<00:02:47.489> like

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
around a little docks and it was like

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.819 
around a little docks and it was like
free<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:48.450> somebody's<00:02:49.260> been<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.379> prisoner

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
free and somebody's been a prisoner

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.410 
free and somebody's been a prisoner
which<00:02:50.099> he<00:02:50.219> probably<00:02:50.459> has<00:02:50.700> been<00:02:50.939> all<00:02:51.090> his<00:02:51.180> life

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
which he probably has been all his life

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.629 
which he probably has been all his life
but<00:02:52.049> he<00:02:52.139> was<00:02:52.260> doing<00:02:52.560> circles<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.249> if<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.549> can

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
but he was doing circles and if we can

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.339 
but he was doing circles and if we can
get<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.120> majority<00:02:54.239> than<00:02:54.719> to<00:02:54.840> end<00:02:54.989> up<00:02:55.139> like

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
get the majority than to end up like

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.449 
get the majority than to end up like
that<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.590> don't<00:02:55.859> think<00:02:56.159> we'll<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.310> any

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
