00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello and welcome to hard parat in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.870
 this video the update of the 700 euro 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 gaming computers july 2013 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 as the processor of the Intel Core i5 35 70 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 with four times 3.4 gigahertz 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.449
 The process has a turbo day of 3.8 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 ghz 77 , tdp was an integrated 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.100
 graphics unit intel hd 2500 is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.630
 handy for people who have a second 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 monitor want to connect or for 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.740
 Video editing or will be in the box 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.210
 version delivered that means one 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 cooler is already there 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
 the processor should to gamble the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.700
 next three to four years loose 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.540
 then suffice as a mainboard 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.090
 ice block b 75 per 3 m with the intel b75 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.340
 chips better the latest standards usb 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:50.430
 3 usa 34 ddr3 ram banks pci express 3.0 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:54.840
 a 7.1 sound card and the europe 0 4 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.719
 usb 2 ps2 vga dvi and hdmi for the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.680
 integrated graphics unit twice usb 3 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.539
 a lan socket and 5 35 mm latches 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 as well as an optical output for the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.770
 sound card then as a working memory 8gb 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 scale and e series ddr3 1333 cl9 dult 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.560
 ddr3 1333 and count nine is right 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 afloat 8gb are enough for the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.640
 next few years to gamble and 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.500
 it is one that means you can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 run in dual channel mode 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.960
 each one is connected with 64 bit 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.700
 So that's a total of 128 bits 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 whole a bit faster than 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.380
 hard drive a 1000 gigabyte seagate 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 barracuda 7200 points 10 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.770
 it is a very fast hard disk it 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 is one of the fastest hard drives 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.670
 on the desktop market and 1000 gb 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.740
 for most of you loose 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.149
 suffice if that is not the case 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 you can practically a hard drive 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.909
 which then buy this than graphics card 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.070
 a 2 gigabyte gb geforce gtx 760 with 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.920
 the windforce 3x cooler like that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 geforce gtx 460 and get in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.829
 performance-related between the hd 79 50th 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.750
 and gtx 670 1 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.640
 and by that the gigabyte again 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.250
 I should overclock it a bit 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.569
 to be something as fast as the 670's 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.819
 means most players like 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.000
 Battlefield 3 is supposed to be meter map on the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.190
 highest settings 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.100
 open and linda cells blacklist's out there 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.680
 for free and as a power supply 1 400 watts 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.020
 be quiet straight power e9 module with 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.510
 80plus gold 400 watt 3 and for the pc 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.610
 and for future updates slack off 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.430
 and 80 plus gold is very energy efficient 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.350
 then another dvd burner from samsung 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.240
 and as housing a sa-man since nine 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.590
 Plus this housing has a very good one 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.000
 price-performance ratio 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.890
 but as always you should do it yourself 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.630
 decide which want to take yes 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.130
 then I thank you for watching me 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.350
 hope you liked the video 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.730
 if the video is in part two months 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.320
