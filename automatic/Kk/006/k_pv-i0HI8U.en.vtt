 First of all, the left hand finger has a burner. 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:37.430

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:49.810
 I can easily tell the first one I unconditionally 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:56.799
 By doing this way, according to the numbers in the third column per plate after the last period 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:03.639

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.610
 [music] 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.820

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.780

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:18.410
 Even so, the thumb is back

 This is now in the latter half 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:27.949
 Let's take a look at each of the above scales while doing it, 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.160
 In the left fingernail, 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:36.289
 You're starting up at number six and coming up at the top. 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.710

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.710
 body 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.640
 If you do not come with your thumb, why not beginners? 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.840
 This space is sustained so I do throw like because power is off 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.760
 You do not. 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:59.310
 For those who sustain because the space normally now classic play now 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:03.870
 See hasineunde in a state that does not move a finger or the sound quality intact umjjal 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:06.440

 And you'll need to score 100% match 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:30.060
 What about that part? 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:34.620
 If this is not memorized, we can not get out of wrath 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:38.310
 Because the score would start right now with the song. 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.370
 If you get sick and confused and you get confused 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.460
 I can not be a class at all. 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.980
 So that you can understand and 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.360

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.590
 Since you can follow the next steps, always stick to the score 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:04.140

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.280
 After practice , please follow the progress so that you can read every day. 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.370

 Starting characters who have real time track 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:15.890
