00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 and a band like it's so good we're going 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.320
 I'm going to show you how to get this historic 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.320
 of the alien but your fucking michael 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 bloomberg 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.060
 this we are going to put that imparted we are going 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 to put you here in the prologue mission 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 let's repeat the mission the first 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.540
 to see this someone is not from 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.309
 someone who is out there is a mystery 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.920
 and nothing else I do not know if I do something in lalin 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.530
 later I 've seen it coming back to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.110
 this part of the map is already in now because 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.449
 the prologue is 19 years back 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 this part of the map now comes something 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.130
 not when we have to spend all these 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 kids 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.680
 well we go out we try we will try to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.780
 out of here 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.830
 well let's move on to this part of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.830
 eliminate all the police 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.250
 although since to you the car that already 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.340
 we have the van we have to go 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.979
 down the bridge that is there forward 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.360
 makes us get off carefully underneath 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.690
 that bridge that you can see there 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.690
 or 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.110
 now let's take 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.310
 and I'll follow him again 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.310
 and I'm supposed to be here 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 l 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.120
 to this inheritance they saw it 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.630
 or down but the mission is over 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 there is the alien 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.850
 what but what do you do if you are still here after 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.860
 I do not know is in this part of the map to ear 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.590
 check 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.789
 I can not do further 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.789
 that because 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.740
 it does not let me move more expensive 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.740
 we are not up here 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.590
 well I do not know if I can come already after 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.850
 why in this part of the map where 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.810
 is the breath 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.069
 and there it is good 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.810
 photos to the good alien I hope you have them 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.810
