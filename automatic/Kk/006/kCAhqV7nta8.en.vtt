designed<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.309> Google<00:00:12.030> Sketchup

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
designed this one on Google Sketchup

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.450 
designed this one on Google Sketchup
first<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.519> first<00:00:14.519> version<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.480> it

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
first this is my first version of it

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.650 
first this is my first version of it
basically<00:00:17.460> I've<00:00:18.029> got<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:20.580> solid<00:00:21.270> block<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> wood

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
basically I've got a solid block of wood

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.990 
basically I've got a solid block of wood
through<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> middle<00:00:22.230> I've<00:00:23.039> drilled<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.640> hole

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
through the middle I've drilled a hole

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.769 
through the middle I've drilled a hole
through<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.930> center<00:00:26.119> I've<00:00:27.119> got<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> plane

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
through the center I've got a plane

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.109 
through the center I've got a plane
blade<00:00:28.109> I've<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.890> drilled<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.519> few<00:00:29.550> holes<00:00:29.760> in

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
blade I've just drilled a few holes in

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.250 
blade I've just drilled a few holes in
the<00:00:30.240> plane<00:00:30.480> blade<00:00:30.810> where<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:33.260> adjust

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the plane blade where you can adjust

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.030 
the plane blade where you can adjust
that<00:00:34.620> blade<00:00:35.460> I've<00:00:36.450> got<00:00:36.630> an<00:00:36.719> inlet<00:00:37.140> hole<00:00:37.559> that's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that blade I've got an inlet hole that's

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.440 
that blade I've got an inlet hole that's
big<00:00:38.219> enough<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.760> 12<00:00:39.420> mil<00:00:40.250> square

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
big enough for that 12 mil square

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
at 8 mil on the other side it goes

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.410 
at 8 mil on the other side it goes

through the inlet hole the blade tapers

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.599 
through the inlet hole the blade tapers
most<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.739> timber<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:59.190> outside

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
most of that timber off and the outside

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.130 
most of that timber off and the outside
bit<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> aluminium<00:01:00.590> just<00:01:01.590> pushes<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:03.140> pushes

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
bit of aluminium just pushes it pushes

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
bit of aluminium just pushes it pushes

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
good thing about this exit plate is that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.179 
good thing about this exit plate is that
it<00:01:13.380> ensures<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> your<00:01:14.430> timber<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:16.189> exactly

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it ensures that your timber is exactly

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
it ensures that your timber is exactly
the<00:01:17.310> size<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.880> want<00:01:18.320> also<00:01:19.320> helps

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the size that you want also helps

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.340 
the size that you want also helps
setting<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> blade<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:22.040> its<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:24.350> particular

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
setting the blade up its very particular

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.510 
setting the blade up its very particular
about<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> placement<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> blade<00:01:27.750> just

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
about the placement of the blade just

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.179 
about the placement of the blade just
the<00:01:29.520> tiniest<00:01:30.000> adjustment<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:31.350> mean<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.979> works

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the tiniest adjustment can mean it works

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.310 
the tiniest adjustment can mean it works
well<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:33.450> mean<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.909> comes<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.990> poor

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
well will mean that comes out very poor

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
well will mean that comes out very poor
sip<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.890> cut<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> timber<00:01:41.430> into<00:01:41.790> 12<00:01:42.600> mil

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
sip one is to cut the timber into 12 mil

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.149 
sip one is to cut the timber into 12 mil
square<00:01:43.590> sections<00:01:44.329> the<00:01:45.329> timber<00:01:45.659> I've<00:01:45.780> got<00:01:46.159> is

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
square sections the timber I've got is

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.330 
square sections the timber I've got is
12<00:01:47.549> mil<00:01:47.820> already<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> cut<00:01:49.439> 12

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
12 mil already so I just have to cut 12

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:17.059 
12 mil already so I just have to cut 12
mil<00:01:50.579> strips

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.440 

step<00:02:18.069> two<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.730> round<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.090> end<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.360> your

step two is to round the end of your

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.660 
step two is to round the end of your
timber<00:02:19.840> off<00:02:19.989> enough<00:02:20.319> so<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> fits<00:02:21.280> into<00:02:21.520> your

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
timber off enough so it fits into your

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.000 
timber off enough so it fits into your
hand<00:02:21.970> drill<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.910> round<00:02:25.150> off<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:26.010> entry
