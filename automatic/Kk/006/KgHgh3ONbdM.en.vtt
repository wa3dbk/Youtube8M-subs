another<00:00:00.960> way<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> improve<00:00:01.530> your<00:00:01.560> groom<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.070> to

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
another way to improve your groom is to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.360 
another way to improve your groom is to
take<00:00:02.399> one<00:00:02.730> tempo<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.419> single<00:00:04.020> tempo<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.680> see

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
take one tempo a single tempo and see

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.800 
take one tempo a single tempo and see
how<00:00:05.549> many<00:00:05.730> other<00:00:05.970> tempos<00:00:06.509> you<00:00:06.629> can

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
how many other tempos you can

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.830 
how many other tempos you can
superimpose<00:00:07.200> over<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.420> so<00:00:09.420> here's<00:00:09.719> an

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
superimpose over it so here's an

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.140 
superimpose over it so here's an
exercise<00:00:10.139> where<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.650> start<00:00:10.980> in<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.370> slow<00:00:11.730> four

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
exercise where you start in a slow four

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.379 
exercise where you start in a slow four
tempo<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.960> then<00:00:13.830> modulate<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.000> quarter

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
tempo and then modulate to the quarter

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.510 
tempo and then modulate to the quarter
note<00:00:15.570> triplet<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.289> then<00:00:16.949> modulate<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
note triplet and then modulate to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.150 
note triplet and then modulate to
double-time<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.600> then<00:00:19.289> double-time<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
double-time and then double-time the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.490 
double-time and then double-time the
triplet<00:00:20.580> rate<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> finally<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.170> crud

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
triplet rate and finally to crud

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.179 
triplet rate and finally to crud
quadruple<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.640> original<00:00:24.090> tempo<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> I'm

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
quadruple the original tempo so I'm

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
quadruple the original tempo so I'm
thinking<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.880> as<00:00:27.090> being<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.630> four<00:00:28.429> one

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.990 

this<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> really<00:03:12.190> good<00:03:12.340> exercise<00:03:12.459> to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
this is a really good exercise to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.030 
this is a really good exercise to
strengthen<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.569> time<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.650> take<00:03:14.800> it<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
strengthen your time you can take it a

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.650 
strengthen your time you can take it a
step<00:03:15.220> further<00:03:15.280> by<00:03:15.730> having<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.390> feet

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
step further by having the feet

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.470 
step further by having the feet
accelerate<00:03:17.530> along<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.910> cymbal<00:03:19.330> and

accelerate along with the cymbal and

00:03:19.480 --> 00:05:03.690 
accelerate along with the cymbal and
that<00:03:20.230> sounds<00:03:20.590> like<00:03:20.620> this
