00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.390 
dark so that way you can see just how
reflective<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.860> actually<00:02:29.160> are<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.560> free

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
reflective they actually are the free

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.520 
reflective they actually are the free
glow-in-the-dark<00:02:32.940> tag<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.750> attaches<00:02:34.140> onto

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
glow-in-the-dark tag that attaches onto

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010 
glow-in-the-dark tag that attaches onto
the<00:02:34.770> collar<00:02:35.040> takes<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:36.150> little<00:02:36.390> light<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the collar takes very little light to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.710 
the collar takes very little light to
make<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.770> glow<00:02:38.130> so<00:02:38.850> I'm<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.060> taking<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.510> light

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
make it glow so I'm just taking a light

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.229 
make it glow so I'm just taking a light
little<00:02:40.019> bit<00:02:40.260> right<00:02:40.440> here<00:02:40.760> turning<00:02:41.760> it<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
little bit right here turning it on and

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.820 
little bit right here turning it on and
as<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.870> see<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.410> retains<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:45.630> color<00:02:46.440> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
as you can see it retains the color and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.729 
as you can see it retains the color and
light<00:02:47.280> from<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.850> immediately<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.410> retains

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
light from it immediately and it retains

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.490 
light from it immediately and it retains
it<00:02:49.980> for<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> really<00:02:50.670> long<00:02:50.790> time<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.570> as<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.410> can

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
it for a really long time so as you can

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.790 
it for a really long time so as you can
see<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.310> bit<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.459> light<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> they<00:02:54.959> work

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
see a little bit of light and they work

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.120 
see a little bit of light and they work
right<00:02:56.160> away<00:02:56.480> finally<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.690> am<00:02:58.290> conducting<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
right away finally I am conducting a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.630 
right away finally I am conducting a
test<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.790> complete<00:03:00.660> darkness<00:03:01.230> in<00:03:01.709> our<00:03:02.340> room

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
test in complete darkness in our room

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.220 
test in complete darkness in our room
and<00:03:02.880> what<00:03:03.239> you're<00:03:03.450> seeing<00:03:03.690> right<00:03:03.780> there<00:03:03.930> is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
and what you're seeing right there is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.259 
and what you're seeing right there is
the<00:03:04.440> three<00:03:04.769> glow-in-the-dark<00:03:05.340> tags<00:03:05.880> that

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the three glow-in-the-dark tags that

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.960 
the three glow-in-the-dark tags that
come<00:03:06.330> free<00:03:07.080> with<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.890> vedanta<00:03:08.340> collar<00:03:08.640> and

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
come free with the vedanta collar and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.930 
come free with the vedanta collar and
you<00:03:09.630> can<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:10.019> how<00:03:10.739> well<00:03:11.040> they<00:03:11.250> actually<00:03:11.730> work

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
you can see how well they actually work

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.750 
you can see how well they actually work
in<00:03:12.150> complete<00:03:12.660> darkness<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:14.010> second<00:03:14.400> part<00:03:14.640> of

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
in complete darkness the second part of

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.580 
in complete darkness the second part of
the<00:03:14.850> test<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.360> i'm<00:03:15.510> going<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.690> turn<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:16.079> an<00:03:16.230> LED

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
the test is i'm going to turn on an LED

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.370 
the test is i'm going to turn on an LED
flashlight<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.340> reflect<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.390> onto<00:03:18.630> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
flashlight and reflect it onto the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.770 
flashlight and reflect it onto the
collar<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.250> see<00:03:20.549> how<00:03:20.790> reflectively

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
collar so you can see how reflectively

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.500 
collar so you can see how reflectively
bright<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.290> they<00:03:22.500> are<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.180> used

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
bright that they are and this is used

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.400 
bright that they are and this is used
basically<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.739> like<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:27.410> simulate

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
basically just like this to simulate

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.890 
basically just like this to simulate
what<00:03:28.620> may<00:03:28.799> be<00:03:28.860> like<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.220> headlight<00:03:29.880> would<00:03:30.510> be<00:03:30.720> on

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
what may be like a headlight would be on

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.240 
what may be like a headlight would be on
a<00:03:30.930> car<00:03:31.290> driving<00:03:31.620> by<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.190> as<00:03:32.310> i<00:03:32.340> quickly<00:03:32.760> move

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
a car driving by and as i quickly move

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.850 
a car driving by and as i quickly move
backward<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.489> shine<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.600> light<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.799> see

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
backward and shine the light you can see

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.880 
backward and shine the light you can see
that<00:03:38.310> even<00:03:38.489> from<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.120> good<00:03:39.450> distance<00:03:39.860> that<00:03:40.860> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
that even from a good distance that the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.550 
that even from a good distance that the
collar<00:03:41.430> really<00:03:41.970> reflects<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.320> quite

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
collar really reflects and is quite

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.360 
collar really reflects and is quite
noticeable<00:03:45.410> which<00:03:46.410> will<00:03:46.680> be<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> good

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
noticeable which will be a good

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.280 
noticeable which will be a good
protection<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:48.090> your<00:03:48.120> kitty<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.930> good
