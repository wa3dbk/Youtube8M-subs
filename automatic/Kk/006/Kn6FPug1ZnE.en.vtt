from the 23rd of July on I knew that we

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.369 
from the 23rd of July on I knew that we

back to Washington in my usual

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.560 
back to Washington in my usual
methodical<00:00:51.550> way<00:00:51.730> people<00:00:52.210> think<00:00:52.360> it's

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
methodical way people think it's

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.740

methodical<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.320> guess<00:00:53.470> it<00:00:53.620> is<00:00:53.770> I<00:00:54.640> decided<00:00:55.540> I

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
methodical and I guess it is I decided I

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.810 
methodical and I guess it is I decided I
should<00:00:56.080> put<00:00:56.260> down<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.769> pros<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.250> cons<00:00:57.489> of

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
should put down the pros and cons of

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
paper on that which refresh my memory

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.630 
paper on that which refresh my memory
rather<00:01:05.410> interesting<00:01:05.979> when<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.190> read<00:01:06.400> it<00:01:06.520> today

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
rather interesting when I read it today

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.330 
rather interesting when I read it today
so<00:01:06.790> many<00:01:07.150> years<00:01:07.390> later<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.530> indicated<00:01:09.040> one<00:01:09.310> I

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
so many years later it indicated one I

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.410 
so many years later it indicated one I
could<00:01:09.670> resign<00:01:10.060> now<00:01:11.160> two<00:01:12.160> I<00:01:12.460> could<00:01:13.060> wait<00:01:13.240> until

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
could resign now two I could wait until

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.359 
could resign now two I could wait until
the<00:01:13.539> House<00:01:13.780> voted<00:01:14.140> impeachment<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:14.950> resign

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
despite the house voting impeachment go

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.830 
despite the house voting impeachment go
to<00:01:20.140> trial<00:01:20.470> in<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.680> Senate<00:01:21.509> which<00:01:22.509> would<00:01:22.690> take

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
to trial in the Senate which would take

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.160 
to trial in the Senate which would take
about<00:01:23.020> six<00:01:23.410> months<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:25.030> resigning<00:01:25.660> now<00:01:25.840> was

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
about six months our resigning now was

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.080 
about six months our resigning now was
the<00:01:26.320> option<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.830> didn't<00:01:27.130> want<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.369> do<00:01:27.490> above

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
the option I didn't want to do above

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.169 
the option I didn't want to do above
everything<00:01:28.360> else<00:01:28.710> personally<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.789> fighter

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
everything else personally I'm a fighter

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.560 
everything else personally I'm a fighter
I<00:01:31.479> just<00:01:32.200> didn't<00:01:32.500> want<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.979> quit<00:01:33.539> also<00:01:34.539> I

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
I just didn't want to quit also I

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.999 
I just didn't want to quit also I
thought<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.229> would<00:01:35.320> be<00:01:35.440> an<00:01:35.530> admission<00:01:35.920> of

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
thought it would be an admission of

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.150 
thought it would be an admission of
guilt<00:01:36.070> which<00:01:36.460> of<00:01:36.610> course<00:01:36.640> was<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.380> also<00:01:38.890> I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
guilt which of course was and also I

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.120 
guilt which of course was and also I
felt<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.080> would<00:01:41.170> set<00:01:41.410> a<00:01:41.440> terribly<00:01:41.950> bad

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
felt that it would set a terribly bad

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.309 
felt that it would set a terribly bad
precedent<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> future<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.720> hope<00:01:43.990> no<00:01:44.289> other

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
precedent for the future I hope no other

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.080 
precedent for the future I hope no other
president<00:01:45.009> ever<00:01:45.130> resigns<00:01:45.610> under<00:01:45.910> any

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
president ever resigns under any

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.350 
president ever resigns under any
circumstances<00:01:47.099> the<00:01:48.099> second<00:01:48.520> option<00:01:48.759> was<00:01:49.179> no

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
circumstances the second option was no

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.180 
circumstances the second option was no
option<00:01:49.750> at<00:01:49.840> all<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.500> wait<00:01:50.679> until<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.009> House

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
option at all to wait until the House

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.800 
option at all to wait until the House
voted<00:01:51.490> impeachment<00:01:52.119> because<00:01:52.209> what<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.539> would

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
voted impeachment because what I would

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.020 
voted impeachment because what I would
do<00:01:52.959> then<00:01:53.229> would<00:01:53.920> be<00:01:54.069> to<00:01:54.190> put<00:01:54.369> all<00:01:54.489> of<00:01:54.520> my<00:01:54.670> good

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
do then would be to put all of my good

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.300 
do then would be to put all of my good

I recalled that in 1973 when things

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.089 
I recalled that in 1973 when things
weren't<00:02:25.239> as<00:02:25.599> bad<00:02:25.780> as<00:02:25.959> they<00:02:26.080> were<00:02:26.110> now<00:02:26.500> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
weren't as bad as they were now the

weren't as bad as they were now the
Soviet<00:02:27.550> Union<00:02:27.910> at<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.239> time<00:02:28.540> was<00:02:29.020> very

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
Soviet Union at that time was very

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.440 
Soviet Union at that time was very
difficult<00:02:29.500> during<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.190> 73<00:02:30.700> war<00:02:30.940> in<00:02:31.300> the

Mideast
I<00:02:32.050> just<00:02:32.680> couldn't<00:02:33.040> risk<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.489> felt<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.480> well

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
I just couldn't risk it I felt so well

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.050 
I just couldn't risk it I felt so well
after<00:02:34.900> making<00:02:35.110> those<00:02:35.379> notes<00:02:35.709> I<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.700> my<00:02:36.879> own

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
after making those notes I and my own

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.360 
after making those notes I and my own
mind<00:02:37.390> decided<00:02:37.870> well<00:02:38.170> there's<00:02:38.590> no<00:02:38.800> choice<00:02:39.069> and
