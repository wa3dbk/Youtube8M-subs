00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.920 
you do then is reverse the fire steel
and<00:01:46.740> screw<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.520> back<00:01:47.700> into<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.120> housing<00:01:50.930> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and screw it back into the housing and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.420 
and screw it back into the housing and
there<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.260> go<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.740> have<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.920> full<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.250> fire

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
there you go you have a full of fire

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:02.120 
there you go you have a full of fire
steel<00:01:53.760> in<00:01:54.150> your<00:01:54.770> pocket<00:01:56.930> no<00:01:57.930> striker<00:02:00.980> no<00:02:01.980> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
steel in your pocket no striker no the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.790 
steel in your pocket no striker no the
striker<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:05.160> sort<00:02:05.400> of<00:02:05.460> right<00:02:05.700> angles

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.910 

so<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.860> makes<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.190> very<00:02:11.430> easy<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.970> strike<00:02:12.510> from

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
so it makes it very easy to strike from

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.510 
so it makes it very easy to strike from
now<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.430> magnesium<00:02:15.000> fire<00:02:15.620> steel<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
now this is a magnesium fire steel so

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.270 
now this is a magnesium fire steel so
you<00:02:18.450> can't<00:02:18.750> ask<00:02:18.930> rip<00:02:19.260> back<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> magnesium

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
you can't ask rip back to the magnesium

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.930 
you can't ask rip back to the magnesium
off<00:02:20.670> first<00:02:21.270> sort<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.930> mix<00:02:22.550> script<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.850> all

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
off first sort of a mix script at all

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.910 
off first sort of a mix script at all
first<00:02:24.270> until<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.600> pile<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.200> help<00:02:25.410> get<00:02:25.800> your

first until we pile to help get your
fire<00:02:26.310> going<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:28.440> we're<00:02:28.590> hopefully<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.070> demo

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
fire going but we're hopefully just demo

00:02:29.340 --> 00:03:00.380 
fire going but we're hopefully just demo
just<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> forest<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.600> itself<00:02:59.209> so<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.330> can

what<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.459> would<00:03:20.580> do<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:21.090> I'm<00:03:21.239> lighting<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.540> fire

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
what I would do if I'm lighting the fire

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:42.560 
what I would do if I'm lighting the fire
I<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.920> skip<00:03:23.160> them<00:03:23.340> off

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.580 

no<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.580> sharp<00:03:45.850> edges<00:03:46.060> on<00:03:46.330> here<00:03:46.660> you

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
no because of sharp edges on here you

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.700 
no because of sharp edges on here you
can<00:03:47.860> actually<00:03:48.310> do<00:03:48.550> a<00:03:50.160> scrape<00:03:51.160> off<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> small

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
can actually do a scrape off a small

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:59.250 
can actually do a scrape off a small
sliver<00:03:53.710> of<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:56.170> magnesium<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:58.690> our<00:03:58.900> nut

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
sliver of the magnesium and our nut

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:10.100 
sliver of the magnesium and our nut
strikes<00:04:02.460> at<00:04:03.460> well<00:04:04.090> burnt<00:04:05.020> out<00:04:05.530> of<00:04:05.800> battery

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.370 

now<00:04:11.110> if<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.320> wish<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:13.690> you<00:04:13.780> have<00:04:13.930> an<00:04:14.050> iPhone

you<00:04:14.410> as<00:04:14.650> well<00:04:14.940> you<00:04:15.940> can<00:04:16.209> use<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.720> to<00:04:16.959> scrape

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
you as well you can use that to scrape

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.380 
you as well you can use that to scrape
this<00:04:17.410> off<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:18.780> then<00:04:19.780> use<00:04:19.989> your<00:04:20.020> knife<00:04:20.350> blade

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
this off and then use your knife blade

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.930 
this off and then use your knife blade
if<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.630> wish<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:24.300> get<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.360> more<00:04:25.600> directional

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
if you wish to get a more directional

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:36.120 
if you wish to get a more directional
spark<00:04:30.690> but<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:31.960> see<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:34.920> will<00:04:35.920> ask

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
spark but you can see I I will ask

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:45.960 
spark but you can see I I will ask
strikes<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.130> both<00:04:45.340> ways<00:04:45.520> we've<00:04:45.850> been

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
strikes to do both ways we've been

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.180 
strikes to do both ways we've been
harder<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.300> get<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.510> directional<00:04:47.200> spark<00:04:47.620> when

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
harder to get a directional spark when

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.150 
harder to get a directional spark when
you've<00:04:48.310> got<00:04:48.460> such<00:04:48.670> a<00:04:48.700> small<00:04:48.910> tool<00:04:49.560> here<00:04:50.560> for

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
you've got such a small tool here for

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.370 
you've got such a small tool here for
the<00:04:51.250> striker<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.270> say<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:52.630> can<00:04:52.900> use<00:04:53.170> that

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
the striker but you say you can use that

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.110 
the striker but you say you can use that
just<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.770> scrape<00:04:54.040> ass<00:04:54.220> leather<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.000> an

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
just to scrape ass leather off and an

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.300 
just to scrape ass leather off and an
emergency<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:55.840> can<00:04:56.080> get<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:56.530> might<00:04:57.010> take<00:04:57.190> a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
emergency you can get it might take a

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.010 
emergency you can get it might take a
bit<00:04:57.340> longer<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.450> probably<00:04:58.630> be<00:04:58.810> able<00:04:58.900> to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
bit longer but you probably be able to

bit longer but you probably be able to
get<00:04:59.169> out<00:04:59.320> up
