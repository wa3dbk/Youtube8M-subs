00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.340
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.540
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.639
 video and is that they have updated the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.309
 pp server with the splash artear is 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.590
 look for hearts here we are seeing 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.449
 You have to say things as they are 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.820
 when there is something wrong it is said when there 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.130
 something good too and this is the case of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.530
 that riot is getting better and better 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.840
 The splash art is improving a lot 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.970
 and the truth is that the skin can 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.280
 like you may like it more or less 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.890
 but what they are squared us is squares 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 lately they are amazing here we are 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.670
 watching the ace looks for hearts to the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.500
 right we have the image of the screen 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.300
 load and to the left the splash ar 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.040
 that we also see that trim appears 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.760
 dammert to note that it is below the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.010
 spell 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.530
 we already know that in the I achieved in the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.050
 history ago is dammert train couple 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.840
 that therefore is your queen go is the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.430
 king for his queen then good then 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.829
 we see how he is as a lover he has a 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.620
 arrow pinned and on the chest and such and 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.879
 Well the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.369
 as only there is this news like this 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.290
 important there are some other little things 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.880
 as changes in champions and such but already 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.400
 you know that many times they do not reach 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.660
 see inside the main server like this 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.610
 until we are safe with the 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.950
 patch notes let's set aside 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.930
 those things since then they can be a 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.480
 little confused 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.160
 so let's see what it does inside 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.290
 of the game so that we remember a little 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.780
 it has also been modified very little in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.250
 about the particles and for the people 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.860
 I have not seen what the champion is 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.880
 the part to displace in this same 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.490
 video we are also going to make a small 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.110
 review to what is the skin of assen 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.790
 good one of the reasons why you 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 I teach again is that it has been 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.450
 modified slightly certain 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.610
 particles as we are seeing the passive 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.300
 when it is loaded, the arch lights up 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.070
 a pink glow before was like a 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.900
 kind of rainbow the one that 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.720
 it went through like we're seeing here 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.210
 but with different colors also if 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.330
 we apply the cv we see how it receives a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.100
 kind of glitters what is the arch well 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.200
 let's see the skills 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 quickly first of all tell you that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.720
 for me the best of the corner is this 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.370
 there we have it, the base turn style 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.630
 since lately they are taking several 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.090
 as well as it could be relecto pool party 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.340
 the secondary of lucian that also 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.600
 sits on a chair and such me that is 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.220
 quite good because it's a new approach 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.550
 that we give to the exquisite ones we are going to 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.920
 spend the massive we see as now 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.830
 no longer has the arch lighting 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.830
 we are also going to see the w 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.770
 there we have it the truth is that it is 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.180
 pretty handsome what is the particles 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.730
 now let's see the little bird of this 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.130
 that is very handsome I raised it so that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.590
 see a little how to increase the range and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.740
 so and see what trace leaves here of 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.270
 petals will be interesting by 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.650
 last let's see the ultimate no os 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.910
 worry because I'm going to you too 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.470
 slow down as I did in the previous 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.810
 video tell you that you have also received a 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.850
 small change in color and a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.890
 little particles and now when it's over 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.020
 here this row of aggressive minions 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.020
 we are going to give let's move on to see ultimate 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.950
 there we have it fixed and you worry them 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.950
 clear it slowed 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.830
 finally let's see the death of ase 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.830
 there we have it 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.879
 well after seeing the splash I left 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.069
 review the skin of us sincerely mind 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.840
 is one without that I like my opinion 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.519
 staff I like I do not know if until the 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.019
 point of buying me the but is not good 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.599
 nothing bad about everything I like the most 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.430
 they're ironing like lately almost 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.989
 all the corners that come out what more 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.090
 I like the displacement I do not know why 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.769
 but well let's hope that soon 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.480
 start to take out beautiful handsome skins there 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.129
 and well what I said, I hope that I have 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.540
