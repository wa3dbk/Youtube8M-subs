00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.500
 the people with you are also well 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.430
 coming to another channel video operate 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.410
 a lightning 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.720
 I'm super hero looks and in the video of 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.430
 today we will do some tests with the 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.749
 new features that accompany the 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.900
 1980 970 plate budget in the series 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:26.769
 max wilson so we'll test the dsr 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 the vx gee and the mf a through examples 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.539
 I've been here in my gtx 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.390
 970 beauty 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.250
 so let's go with the tests first 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.110
 place here on the channel already has a study 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.600
 more in depth about the architecture 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.370
 maxwell and its new technologies 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.620
 I'll leave a link in the case description 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.170
 follow the first test will be 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.260
 a new mode before it with multi 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.790
 frame 5 before him yes or simply and 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.490
 mfa 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.180
 the idea of ​​it is very simple to offer 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.100
 visual quality of the ms but less 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.690
 performance impact 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.960
 you can have for example the quality 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.020
 visual ms x 4 contest 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.650
 ms performance to 2 x 1 and so on 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.120
 against 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:19.330
 see the following good table just activate the 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.110
 mf a in nvidia driver start a game 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.630
 compatible with mf and enable ms to 2 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.820
 x or higher the list of games 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.979
 the full article in the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.450
 website first hardware the link too 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.820
 is in the description 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.220
 we have the two tests side by side 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.590
 ems 4x and ems 2x with mf active we can 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.229
 note two interesting points here 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.780
 visually speaking we have the same 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.070
 image quality in both tests and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.270
 in the ms test at 2 x with mf we have more 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.549
 performance 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.790
 therefore in this example we have the quality 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:03.840
 of the MS to 4 x 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.840
 performance of ms to 2 x in the mf test 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.550
 The second technology I'm going to test is 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.590
 super resolution dynamic or 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.810
 simply from sr 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.930
 with this technology we can be the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.900
 resolution quality even in 4k 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.510
 monitors full hd for example enough 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.430
 activate there in the drive dani video by choosing 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.900
 the resolutions you want available 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.730
 for 4k mark resolution 4,100 x 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.430
 below you can also choose a 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.560
 level of smoothness high numbers 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.290
 mean a blurring sensation in the 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.710
 low numbers mean more 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.709
 serrated the standard is 33% 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.480
 after this when entering the game you will have 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.320
 available the resolutions you have chosen 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 driver 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.600
 It is worth remembering that when activating for 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.300
 4k resolution to gpu will hold the game 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400
 this resolution and will be made to always 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.150
 is automatic for native resolution of 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.300
 monitor 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.790
 therefore we will have a higher quality 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.970
 but with the same performance course 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.120
 of the resolution performed in this example 4k 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.989
 we have two images the first one in full hd 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.250
 ms at 2 x 1 and the second at another hd 4k with 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.260
 sma 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.560
 note that certain image details 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.769
 get sharper in 4k with a gun and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.330
 Character's love and of course the performance 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.580
 in 4 falls much smaller 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.470
 beyond the use of larger video memory already 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.350
 that we are performing the images in a 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.459
 much higher resolution the dsr also 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.250
 is available for generations 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.989
 previous break and ferm and the last 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.150
 technology that I'm testing this video is 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.269
 to vox the globe and light chu or 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.230
 simply vx gee 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.080
 basically is a new engine of 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.880
 real-time global illumination that is already 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.830
 often used in the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.410
 cinema for the production of scenes in 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.239
 with this new engine 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.709
 developers can create scenes 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.489
 more realistic 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.170
 where the light contrasts the shadows 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.170
 realistically interact with an environment 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.510
 game for the test I used the program 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.940
 demonstration apollo 11 provided 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.580
 free by the individual for testing 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.470
 with the global illumination of you I see 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.810
 some parts of the demonstration and 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.810
 real time dx gee application 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.380
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.600
 liked this video if you'd like. 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.580
 enjoy the video share with your 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.250
 friends and do not forget to write in 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.170
 channel so we do not lose the news we 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.410
 we also have a fanpage on facebook or 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.610
 the two students look for appa blog and 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.050
 radio br 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.940
 so short fan page too so that 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.010
 Do not miss the news because I 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.000
 always coast articles on the site you do not see 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.800
 what youtube 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.200
 I only post there on the fan page 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.880
 Beauty, is this a big hug? 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.880
 and see you later
