think<00:01:23.360> big<00:01:24.250> we<00:01:25.250> realized<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:26.479> the

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570

think big we realized that with the
enterprise<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.550> then<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.640> enterprise<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.270> and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
enterprise and then the enterprise a and

then the B and the C and then finally

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.210

the<00:01:31.399> D<00:01:32.080> these<00:01:33.080> ships<00:01:33.350> kept<00:01:33.770> getting<00:01:34.009> bigger

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
the D these ships kept getting bigger

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.499 
the D these ships kept getting bigger
and<00:01:34.460> bigger<00:01:34.729> and<00:01:34.970> bigger

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
and bigger and bigger

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.160 
and bigger and bigger
and<00:01:36.020> we<00:01:36.170> thought<00:01:36.350> that<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:36.590> might<00:01:36.710> be<00:01:36.770> nice<00:01:37.039> to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
and we thought that it might be nice to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.930 
and we thought that it might be nice to
to<00:01:39.170> come<00:01:39.830> up<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.070> an<00:01:40.190> idea<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.640> ship<00:01:40.820> that

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
to come up with an idea of a ship that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.340 
to come up with an idea of a ship that
was<00:01:41.030> a<00:01:41.090> little<00:01:41.360> bit<00:01:41.479> smaller<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.930> little<00:01:42.229> bit

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
was a little bit smaller a little bit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.290 
was a little bit smaller a little bit
more<00:01:42.530> maneuverable<00:01:43.160> lay<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.820> course<00:01:44.000> toward

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
more maneuverable lay in a course toward

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.130 
more maneuverable lay in a course toward
the<00:01:44.360> rupture<00:01:44.720> and<00:01:45.310> take<00:01:46.310> us<00:01:46.460> out

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
the rupture and take us out

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.740 
the rupture and take us out
so<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> Voyager<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> ship<00:01:50.330> that's<00:01:50.510> built

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
so the Voyager is a ship that's built

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.570 
so the Voyager is a ship that's built
for<00:01:50.930> action<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.410> built<00:01:51.650> for<00:01:51.860> speed<00:01:51.950> we're

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
for action and built for speed we're

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.340 
for action and built for speed we're
taking<00:01:52.940> it<00:01:53.030> into<00:01:53.210> places<00:01:53.630> where<00:01:53.840> there<00:01:54.200> are

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
taking it into places where there are

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.220 
taking it into places where there are
problems<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:55.010> make<00:01:55.870> navigation<00:01:56.870> very

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
problems that make navigation very

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.620 
problems that make navigation very
difficult<00:01:57.740> where<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.730> enterprise<00:01:58.970> could<00:01:59.480> not

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
difficult where the enterprise could not

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.390 
difficult where the enterprise could not
comfortably<00:02:00.170> go<00:02:00.470> I've<00:02:00.860> never<00:02:01.130> seen<00:02:01.370> a

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
Federation starship that could maneuver
