 the Valencian team the new video and 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.960
 Well, first of all, thank you 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.310
 because two subscribers are missing for 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.410
 reaching 100,000 so good 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.360
 this subscribed action I would appreciate it if 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.460
 I did it and I'm watching the video 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.349
 when I'm uploading but good greetings 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.029
 and today I come to bring how to do farming 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.380
 I know I already have a video of this but I do not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.810
 I know how to do farming after 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.309
 East controller update 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
 air of the super eid since it has changed 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.660
 quite the age machine what what 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.820
 now you make us find us with 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.320
 people like our villages before 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.790
 it was only with people who were 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.500
 our league and now it's going to have a lot 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.960
 more in mind the theme of what village 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.120
 we have then all of you who are in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 high leagues joking with crystal go down 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.290
 bear gold silver me good lowered silver 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 because I'm trying and I recommend you 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.120
 that you may be all you get in 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 general all everywhere flans vais 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.879
 to form much better here since good 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 you will find which day of your 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 level in my case good here I have the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 other attacks and the last ones were not very 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.330
 attack well but let's go here we have to 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.250
 example with 176 all that then look 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.810
 here I found this team with 73 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.720
 sure you fuck me a lot 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.280
 I am and I do not have much and I have very little 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.049
 and good if it will be the repetitions 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.270
 but the fact is that it does not let me 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.570
 then you can check that we are going to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.539
 see here attack log this by 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.670
 example was a level 59 in general let's 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.170
 to see in defense 4 3 3 6 6 2 and the level 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.670
 6 is a 102 and is in the same decade 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.439
 put in a league less than me so 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.270
 imagine is to find a total amount 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.829
 of abandoned ones that is what most 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.200
 it's about worth everything he's going to find 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.390
 abandoned villages today we go with villages 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.770
 abandoned of your levels then 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.979
 for example in cases about all 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.590
 for so young 9 8 8 9 and 10 should count 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.689
 with boots of a caliber that come to us 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.039
 well for example 500 thousand six hundred thousand 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.349
 I could see them and I could not attack 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.330
 unfortunately the biggest attack was 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.090
 one of 500 thousand I was carrying just my 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.990
 as usual and it worked out well 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.990
 almost everything but good because as you will see 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.430
 with an update and lohan in addition 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.409
 he also intended to attack here when 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.510
 this huge rise in glasses and up 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:26.700
 teachers 2 and I planned to make him a 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.930
 attack towards a little friend that was was 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.640
 in champions but the problem is that it 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.290
 He has taken me away and I have not been able to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.209
 I tell you guys it 's very easy I know that 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.459
 It's a very short video but it's for 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.989
 explain more or less the matchmaking 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.629
 before it was always good in gold or 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.950
 going down depending on your town hall 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.360
 now the ideal is to stay in a league 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.950
 do not get violated by city councils anymore 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.110
 great to me bothers me little because 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 Well, there is only one tank of a cut 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.700
 of 9 maximized that can hurt me 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 to you which portion asks 1 and 7-5 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.049
 carme you will do much better in these leagues 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.459
 because we will see if you are in 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.720
 Christians will find a lot more 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.879
 probability because you will find 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.430
 so that's here in tanhuato 9 and 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.290
 although I'm a 6 17 instead if you 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.730
 you go down to these leagues is a lot less 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.519
 likely to be found as there are more 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.019
 of this and less of them and if you go up 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.400
 Well, let's meet with town halls 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.690
 very high since there will not be much 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.650
 probability that there are councils 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 like you 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 to see how it goes on twitter and so on 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.540
 say a thing like that of special ten 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.599
 thousand if you've got here I want to 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.099
 that you put a 10,000 and the comment and 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.230
 tell you thank you very much because 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.239
 I'm very happy I've been a year and a year 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.440
 and something on youtube and I think it's one of 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.090
 the best experiences that I have for 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.610
 now and I am very happy I have known 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 very nice people I would've had a good time 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.970
 what is important and I want it 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.739
 keep going so they closed the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.299
 classes and tell you that the special for 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.970
 have some some little thing and 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.170
 surprise and my face especially to my 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.970
 face that you are going to already have a video with 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.590
 her to see how I do it because it costs 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.140
 now that there is a lot of sun could present 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.819
 record and I intend to record is that later 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.160
 tell you to follow me on twitter and in 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.810
 twitter that I intend to make a draw for 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.519
 gems when we reach 100 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.349
 followers in tweets and it's simply 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.750
 this is valid and given that you already know like 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:10.489
 favorites to subscribe and see you in the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.489
 next video to another
