00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
would pretty much have to kind of place

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
would pretty much have to kind of place
your<00:01:36.060> finger<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.259> before<00:01:37.409> him<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
your finger there right before him and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060 
your finger there right before him and
turn<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> slow<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:40.020> go<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.710> slow

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
turn it slow and you know go really slow

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
with taking the picture you know it's a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.830 
with taking the picture you know it's a
nuisance<00:01:43.110> honestly<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> pretty<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.689> just

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
nuisance honestly but I pretty much just

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
nuisance honestly but I pretty much just
slide<00:01:46.259> out<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> keyboard<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.790> hit

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
slide out the keyboard and I just hit

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.429 
slide out the keyboard and I just hit
the<00:01:48.149> enter<00:01:48.420> key<00:01:48.540> when<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> need<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> take<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.990 
the enter key when I need to take a
picture<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.280> I'm<00:01:50.399> taking<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> picture<00:01:50.850> of

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
picture if I'm taking a picture of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
picture if I'm taking a picture of
myself<00:01:51.119> especially<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.320> slide<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> out

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
myself especially I just slide it out

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.319 
myself especially I just slide it out
and<00:01:52.979> then<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.220> take<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.670> myself<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then I just take it up myself or I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.539 
and then I just take it up myself or I
just<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.590> know<00:01:55.619> keep<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> close<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.520> that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
just you know keep it close like that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.080 
just you know keep it close like that
it's<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.509> easier<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> keyboard<00:01:58.259> open

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
it's just easier with the keyboard open

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.410 
it's just easier with the keyboard open
so<00:02:00.090> that's<00:02:00.270> pretty<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.810> camera

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so that's pretty much on the camera

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.240 
so that's pretty much on the camera

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
works just fine so i guess it really
