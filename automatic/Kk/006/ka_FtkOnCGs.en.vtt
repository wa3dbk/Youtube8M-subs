feel<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.439> more<00:00:28.619> optimal<00:00:29.039> than<00:00:29.220> any<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.550> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
feel it was more optimal than any of the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.479 
feel it was more optimal than any of the
other<00:00:29.730> starters<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.929> superior<00:00:31.349> red<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.250> lot

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
other starters the superior red is a lot

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.280 
other starters the superior red is a lot
more<00:00:32.520> important<00:00:33.120> because<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.989> puts<00:00:34.140> pressure

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
more important because it puts pressure

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.500 
more important because it puts pressure
on<00:00:34.469> your<00:00:34.620> punt<00:00:34.829> as<00:00:35.309> long<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:36.329> going

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
on your punt as long as you're going

first<00:00:36.809> your<00:00:37.770> opponent's<00:00:38.100> stuck<00:00:38.340> at<00:00:38.570> one<00:00:39.570> while

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
first your opponent's stuck at one while

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
first your opponent's stuck at one while
you're<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.110> three<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.250> feel<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.790> is

you're at three and I just feel this is

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.130 
you're at three and I just feel this is
a<00:00:41.969> lot<00:00:42.090> better<00:00:42.270> than<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.540> retiring<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a lot better than just retiring one of

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.360 
a lot better than just retiring one of
your<00:00:43.260> opponent's<00:00:43.559> regards<00:00:43.920> day<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.250> hit

their starter that's all fine and dandy

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
their starter that's all fine and dandy
with<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.800> stuff<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
with some of the other stuff but the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
with some of the other stuff but the
thing<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:49.170> superior<00:00:49.469> right<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> more

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
thing is the superior right is more

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
thing is the superior right is more
important<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.149> 5k<00:00:51.539> beater<00:00:51.719> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.619 
to sacrifice one of my potential good
rear<00:02:06.479> guards<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.160> kill<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.239> yours

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
rear guards to just kill one of yours

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.370 
rear guards to just kill one of yours
now<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.849> only<00:02:12.030> reason<00:02:12.180> I'm<00:02:12.360> saying<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
now the only reason I'm saying that is

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.580 
now the only reason I'm saying that is
also<00:02:13.650> chachos<00:02:14.070> only<00:02:14.400> 9k<00:02:14.990> when<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.050> was<00:02:16.200> testing

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
also chachos only 9k when I was testing

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.380 
also chachos only 9k when I was testing
around<00:02:16.770> with<00:02:17.340> some<00:02:17.460> of<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> guys<00:02:17.730> locals<00:02:18.180> I

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
around with some of the guys locals I

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.580 
around with some of the guys locals I
found<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.290> 10k<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:21.180> early<00:02:21.600> game<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.990> just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
found that the 10k for early game I just

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.470 
found that the 10k for early game I just
seem<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:22.950> much<00:02:23.190> more<00:02:23.550> relevant<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.360> way

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
seem to be much more relevant that way

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.820 
seem to be much more relevant that way
you<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.750> have<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> dedicate<00:02:25.200> certain

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you don't have to dedicate certain

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.570 
you don't have to dedicate certain

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
boosters and things to it so it's just

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.250 
boosters and things to it so it's just
