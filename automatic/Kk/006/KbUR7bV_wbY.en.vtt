within<00:00:17.880> months<00:00:18.119> 16<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> pretty<00:00:19.500> much

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
within months 16 and this is pretty much

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.550 
within months 16 and this is pretty much
a<00:00:20.010> simple<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.689> tedious<00:00:22.289> way

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a simple way but it is a tedious way

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.950 
a simple way but it is a tedious way
it's<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.859> gonna<00:00:22.949> take<00:00:23.039> Tom<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.600> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
it's just gonna take Tom but it's I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.570 
it's just gonna take Tom but it's I
think<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.140> better<00:00:25.350> than<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
think it's better than going in and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.769 
think it's better than going in and

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that's actually really good if you have

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130

a<00:01:59.250> lot<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.640> coins<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> take<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
a lot of coins and you want to take a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.130 
a lot of coins and you want to take a
big<00:02:01.380> risk<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.729> further<00:02:03.119> down<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.719> get

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
big risk you can go further down and get

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.859 
big risk you can go further down and get
these<00:02:04.290> ones<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:04.979> going<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.399> 30<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
these ones that are going for 30 to
50,000<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.590> bigger<00:02:07.770> risk<00:02:08.039> because

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
50,000 but that's a bigger risk because

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.070 
50,000 but that's a bigger risk because
you<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:09.030> know<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> box<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
somebody bid on I actually I think I ran

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.759 
somebody bid on I actually I think I ran
out<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.480> coins<00:02:40.870> at<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.290> time<00:02:41.470> because<00:02:41.560> i<00:02:41.680> had

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
out of coins at that time because i had

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.949 
out of coins at that time because i had
bought<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.220> many<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.910> i<00:02:42.940> actually<00:02:43.150> was<00:02:43.540> able<00:02:43.750> to

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
bought so many so i actually was able to

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.690 
bought so many so i actually was able to
keep<00:02:44.050> those<00:02:44.230> going<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.280> i<00:02:45.310> don't<00:02:45.430> know<00:02:45.489> if<00:02:45.549> it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
keep those going but i don't know if it

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.130 
keep those going but i don't know if it
actually<00:02:45.850> goes<00:02:46.269> back<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.660> far<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:46.900> go<00:02:47.080> to

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
actually goes back that far just go to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.559 
actually goes back that far just go to
the<00:02:47.260> bottom<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:47.739> we<00:02:48.340> bought<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.549> one<00:02:48.819> for<00:02:48.850> 16

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
the bottom so we bought that one for 16

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.479 
the bottom so we bought that one for 16
i<00:02:49.720> think<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.959> ended<00:02:50.140> up<00:02:50.230> selling<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.590> for<00:02:50.769> 25<00:02:51.280> so

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
i think it ended up selling it for 25 so

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.130 
i think it ended up selling it for 25 so
that<00:02:51.610> was<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> pretty<00:02:51.940> good<00:02:52.180> turnaround<00:02:52.510> profit

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
that was a pretty good turnaround profit

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.890 
that was a pretty good turnaround profit
