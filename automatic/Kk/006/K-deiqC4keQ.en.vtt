this one is the original notice it says

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160 
this one is the original notice it says
it's<00:03:40.110> 1.5<00:03:40.950> nine<00:03:41.250> megabytes<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.810> look<00:03:42.989> over

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
it's 1.5 nine megabytes if I look over

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.380 
it's 1.5 nine megabytes if I look over
here<00:03:43.620> at<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.860> new<00:03:44.070> one<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.850> says<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:45.300> a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390

hundred<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.080> nine<00:03:46.320> k<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.300> can<00:03:48.450> see<00:03:48.600> it's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
hundred and nine k so you can see it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.550 
hundred and nine k so you can see it's

been considerably reduced in size so if

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.229 
been considerably reduced in size so if
we<00:03:52.620> want<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:52.980> work<00:03:53.100> from<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> thumbnail<00:03:53.880> area

we can do that as well I can right click

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.479 
we can do that as well I can right click
on<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.950> go<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:58.980> resize<00:03:59.640> pictures<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:01.489> then

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489

sometimes<00:04:10.060> if<00:04:10.210> you<00:04:10.300> find<00:04:10.510> it's<00:04:10.660> not<00:04:10.720> making<00:04:10.990> a

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
sometimes if you find it's not making a

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.020 
sometimes if you find it's not making a
duplicate<00:04:11.710> then<00:04:11.890> perhaps<00:04:12.160> it's<00:04:12.550> already<00:04:12.850> been

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
duplicate then perhaps it's already been

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.730 
duplicate then perhaps it's already been
resized<00:04:15.630> let's<00:04:16.630> try<00:04:16.840> another<00:04:17.050> one<00:04:17.290> then<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.620> do

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:17.740 
resized let's try another one then to do

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.130 
resized let's try another one then to do
this<00:04:17.860> one<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.050> one<00:04:20.580> together<00:04:21.840> I'm<00:04:22.840> going

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
this one and this one together I'm going

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.900 
this one and this one together I'm going
to<00:04:23.230> go<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.710> can<00:04:23.950> click<00:04:24.100> on<00:04:24.220> as<00:04:24.400> many<00:04:24.580> as<00:04:24.760> I'd
