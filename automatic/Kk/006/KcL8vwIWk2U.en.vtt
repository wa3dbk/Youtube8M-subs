also<00:00:06.229> include<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:06.710> width<00:00:07.960> basically<00:00:08.960> if

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
also include the width basically if

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.289 
also include the width basically if
you're<00:00:09.170> an<00:00:09.230> average<00:00:09.620> weight<00:00:09.799> person<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:11.150> can

you're an average weight person you can

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.390 
you're an average weight person you can
pretty<00:00:11.660> much<00:00:11.750> just<00:00:11.900> judge<00:00:12.469> how<00:00:12.889> the<00:00:12.950> board

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
pretty much just judge how the board

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.350 
pretty much just judge how the board
will<00:00:13.610> sit<00:00:13.969> in<00:00:14.809> relation<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.320> your<00:00:15.530> body<00:00:15.740> for

jump<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:59.660> know<00:00:59.750> that<00:00:59.990> crowd<00:01:00.260> you<00:01:00.830> know<00:01:00.860> can<00:01:01.280> be

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
jump you know that crowd you know can be

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.880 
jump you know that crowd you know can be
somewhere<00:01:02.030> maybe<00:01:02.330> about<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.200> nose<00:01:03.410> level

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
somewhere maybe about the the nose level

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.120 
somewhere maybe about the the nose level
as<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.820> get<00:01:05.059> more<00:01:05.500> experienced<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:06.890> go<00:01:07.070> to

maybe city rails then you can definitely

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.209 
maybe city rails then you can definitely
go<00:01:14.869> shorter<00:01:15.289> on<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.530> board<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.920> can<00:01:15.950> see

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
go shorter on the board you can see

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.639 
go shorter on the board you can see
something<00:01:16.460> maybe<00:01:16.729> in<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.149> shoulder<00:01:18.140> to<00:01:18.409> chin
