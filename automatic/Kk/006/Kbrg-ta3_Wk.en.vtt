00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
these things aren't supposed to last

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.479 
these things aren't supposed to last
long<00:01:01.409> I<00:01:01.499> think<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.769> just<00:01:01.920> kind<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.100> like<00:01:02.159> if

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
long I think that just kind of like if

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.799 
long I think that just kind of like if
you're<00:01:02.640> going<00:01:02.789> out<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> evening<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.690> your

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you're going out in the evening and your

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.660 
you're going out in the evening and your
nails<00:01:03.960> are<00:01:04.110> complete<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.980> you<00:01:05.519> want

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
nails are complete you know and you want

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.130 
nails are complete you know and you want
some<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.909> keep<00:01:06.060> doing<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> want

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
some what I keep doing this and you want

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.359 
some what I keep doing this and you want
something<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.560> nice<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.220> that's

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
something to look nice I think that's

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.800 
something to look nice I think that's
the<00:01:08.520> whole<00:01:08.670> point<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.600> watch

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
the whole point of it but watch

00:01:09.810 --> 00:03:11.880 
the whole point of it but watch
demonstration<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> I'll<00:01:10.680> come<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.009> you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.500 

so<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:12.920> have<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.280> admit<00:03:13.340> two<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:14.120> these<00:03:14.269> nails

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so I have to admit two of these nails

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.660 
so I have to admit two of these nails
did<00:03:14.780> pop<00:03:15.110> off<00:03:15.290> or<00:03:15.530> why<00:03:15.739> I<00:03:15.769> was<00:03:15.980> putting<00:03:16.430> them<00:03:16.489> on

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
did pop off or why I was putting them on

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.720 
did pop off or why I was putting them on
but<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.180> think<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> was<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.379> didn't<00:03:18.709> put<00:03:18.950> glue<00:03:19.610> on

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
but I think it was I didn't put glue on

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.789 
but I think it was I didn't put glue on
it<00:03:19.849> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.299> I<00:03:20.629> could<00:03:20.840> hear<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.230> like<00:03:21.410> moving

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
it and then I could hear it like moving

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.410 
it and then I could hear it like moving
so<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.400> just<00:03:22.549> left<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.879> I<00:03:22.940> was<00:03:23.150> playing<00:03:23.329> around

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
so I just left it I was playing around

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.640 
so I just left it I was playing around
on<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:23.599> camera<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.079> just<00:03:24.200> kind<00:03:24.349> of<00:03:24.379> flicked

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
on my camera and it just kind of flicked

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.410 
on my camera and it just kind of flicked
off<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.340> had<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.610> do<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:25.849> back<00:03:25.970> on<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.150> think<00:03:26.299> it

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
off so I had to do it back on I think it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.819 
off so I had to do it back on I think it
happened<00:03:26.660> twice<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.049> since<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:27.470> nothing's

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
happened twice but since then nothing's

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.900 
happened twice but since then nothing's
happened<00:03:28.190> I've<00:03:28.400> been<00:03:28.519> doing<00:03:28.700> other<00:03:28.850> stuff

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
happened I've been doing other stuff

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.400 
happened I've been doing other stuff
like<00:03:29.359> going<00:03:29.569> through<00:03:29.750> my<00:03:29.840> bag<00:03:29.989> and<00:03:30.200> everything

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
like going through my bag and everything

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.280 
like going through my bag and everything
and<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.489> camera<00:03:31.819> in<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.420> 50s<00:03:33.049> that<00:03:33.170> you

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
and in the camera in the 50s that you

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.990 
and in the camera in the 50s that you
just<00:03:33.470> saw<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.859> could<00:03:34.010> see<00:03:34.160> me<00:03:34.310> putting<00:03:34.549> on<00:03:34.639> one

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
just saw you could see me putting on one

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.750 
just saw you could see me putting on one
hand<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.569> I<00:03:35.690> only<00:03:35.870> had<00:03:36.049> to<00:03:36.200> do<00:03:36.950> everyone<00:03:37.489> once

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
hand and I only had to do everyone once

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.879 
hand and I only had to do everyone once
push<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> out<00:03:38.269> in<00:03:38.480> its<00:03:38.630> duct<00:03:38.810> when<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.530> did<00:03:39.799> the

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
push it out in its duct when I did the

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.789 
push it out in its duct when I did the
other<00:03:40.040> hand<00:03:40.280> off-camera<00:03:40.849> about<00:03:41.530> fallout<00:03:42.530> five

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
other hand off-camera about fallout five

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.699 
other hand off-camera about fallout five
of<00:03:43.010> my<00:03:43.160> nails<00:03:43.400> I<00:03:43.670> had<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:44.319> restock<00:03:45.319> them<00:03:45.530> if

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
of my nails I had to restock them if

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:46.990 
of my nails I had to restock them if
that<00:03:45.829> makes<00:03:46.040> sense<00:03:46.280> so<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> just<00:03:46.639> come<00:03:46.970> down

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
that makes sense so I just come down

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.479 
that makes sense so I just come down
held<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.750> let<00:03:48.230> go<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.769> wasn't<00:03:48.950> stuck<00:03:49.310> at

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
held it let go and it wasn't stuck at

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.210 
held it let go and it wasn't stuck at
all<00:03:49.639> it<00:03:49.790> was<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.269> glue<00:03:50.690> has<00:03:50.959> dried

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
all it was like the glue has dried

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.379 
all it was like the glue has dried
before<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.340> stuck<00:03:52.549> it<00:03:52.700> down<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.090> maybe<00:03:53.269> I

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
before it stuck it down so maybe I

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.360 
before it stuck it down so maybe I
wasn't<00:03:53.660> being<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:54.260> bit<00:03:54.410> slow<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:55.040> don't<00:03:55.250> know

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
wasn't being a bit slow I don't know

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.620 
wasn't being a bit slow I don't know
I've<00:03:55.489> all<00:03:55.639> I<00:03:55.790> know<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.120> had<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.299> do<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:56.540> twice

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
I've all I know is I had to do it twice

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.170 
I've all I know is I had to do it twice
and<00:03:57.079> then<00:03:57.139> it<00:03:57.650> stuck<00:03:57.919> so<00:03:58.220> if<00:03:58.669> you<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.030> long

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
and then it stuck so if you have long

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.559 
and then it stuck so if you have long
nails

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
nails

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.030 
nails
I<00:03:59.630> would<00:03:59.840> suggest<00:04:00.019> cutting<00:04:00.410> them<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:00.859> don't

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
I would suggest cutting them I don't

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.339 
I would suggest cutting them I don't
really<00:04:01.250> have<00:04:01.400> long<00:04:01.609> nails<00:04:01.730> as<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.090> is<00:04:02.209> but<00:04:02.660> I've

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
really have long nails as it is but I've

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.940 
really have long nails as it is but I've
literally<00:04:03.919> got<00:04:04.040> about<00:04:04.569> two<00:04:05.569> millimeters<00:04:06.200> to

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
literally got about two millimeters to

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.039 
literally got about two millimeters to
three<00:04:07.130> millimeters<00:04:07.639> on<00:04:07.760> these<00:04:07.940> fingers<00:04:08.209> gap

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
three millimeters on these fingers gap

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.229 
three millimeters on these fingers gap
between<00:04:09.380> my<00:04:09.739> real<00:04:09.950> nail<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.819> fake<00:04:10.970> nails

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
between my real nail and the fake nails

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.940 
between my real nail and the fake nails
and<00:04:11.419> I<00:04:11.450> don't<00:04:11.510> have<00:04:11.750> long<00:04:11.959> nails<00:04:12.139> also<00:04:12.590> just

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
and I don't have long nails also just

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.500 
and I don't have long nails also just
make<00:04:13.099> sure<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> nail<00:04:13.579> isn't<00:04:13.970> upside<00:04:14.299> down

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
make sure the nail isn't upside down

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.620 
make sure the nail isn't upside down
because<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.169> curved<00:04:15.650> edge<00:04:15.859> and<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:17.150> top<00:04:17.389> edge

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
because the curved edge and the top edge

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.140 
because the curved edge and the top edge
look<00:04:18.019> very<00:04:18.320> very<00:04:18.410> similar<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.880> fits

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
look very very similar but it fits

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.610 
look very very similar but it fits
better<00:04:20.389> if<00:04:20.599> you<00:04:20.720> put<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.079> right<00:04:21.229> edge<00:04:21.380> at<00:04:21.530> the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
better if you put the right edge at the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.430 
better if you put the right edge at the
bottom<00:04:21.919> which<00:04:22.039> is<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.310> more<00:04:23.120> curved<00:04:23.510> edge<00:04:23.720> so

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
bottom which is the more curved edge so

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.390 
bottom which is the more curved edge so
I'm<00:04:24.500> going<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.740> go<00:04:24.800> where<00:04:24.950> I'm<00:04:25.099> going<00:04:25.280> to<00:04:25.340> go

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
I'm going to go where I'm going to go

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.680 
I'm going to go where I'm going to go

from the shelf then I lit some right now
and<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.640> was<00:05:13.730> completely<00:05:14.150> cool<00:05:14.450> I<00:05:14.750> couldn't

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
and it was completely cool I couldn't

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.450 
and it was completely cool I couldn't
feel<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:15.320> because<00:05:15.440> my<00:05:15.680> nails<00:05:15.890> like<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.280> same
