it and we're gonna go oh I forgot one

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.229 
it and we're gonna go oh I forgot one
thing<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.679> your<00:02:10.920> reamer<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> reamer

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
thing so your reamer this is the reamer

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.059 
thing so your reamer this is the reamer
here<00:02:12.450> let's<00:02:13.319> see<00:02:13.410> after<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.739> pull<00:02:13.890> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
here let's see after you pull the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.420 
here let's see after you pull the
bail<00:02:14.219> out<00:02:14.400> right<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.209> ring<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.629> out<00:02:16.430> really

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
bail out right you ring this out really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.780 
bail out right you ring this out really
good<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.939> you<00:02:18.299> actually<00:02:18.599> increase<00:02:18.749> the<00:02:19.319> hole

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
good and you actually increase the hole

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.979 
good and you actually increase the hole
increase<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.969> size<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.599> little<00:02:21.780> bit

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
increase the size of it a little bit

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.330 
increase the size of it a little bit
that's<00:02:22.349> okay<00:02:22.709> it's<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.219> hurt

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
that's okay it's not going to hurt

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.879 
that's okay it's not going to hurt
anything<00:02:23.579> just<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.689> ahead<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.019> run<00:02:25.680> that

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
anything just go ahead and run that

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.190 
anything just go ahead and run that
through<00:02:26.069> there<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.310> few<00:02:26.579> times<00:02:26.989> because<00:02:27.989> you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
through there a few times because you

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.059 
through there a few times because you
need<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.379> hole<00:02:28.889> big<00:02:29.099> enough<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.659> to<00:02:30.659> get<00:02:30.870> that

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
need a hole big enough to to get that

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.339 
need a hole big enough to to get that
this<00:02:32.069> goo<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.579> there<00:02:32.819> now<00:02:33.659> you<00:02:33.719> push<00:02:34.019> this<00:02:34.170> in

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
this goo in there now you push this in

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.199 
this goo in there now you push this in
there<00:02:34.530> too<00:02:34.560> kind<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.099> twisting<00:02:35.609> motion<00:02:38.209> take

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
there too kind of a twisting motion take

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.699 
there too kind of a twisting motion take
that<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:40.019> there<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.260> don't<00:02:40.379> go<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.680> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
that right there you don't go all the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.789 
that right there you don't go all the
way<00:02:40.799> through<00:02:41.599> just<00:02:42.599> like<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.469> a<00:02:43.560> little

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
way through just like that just a little

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.479 
way through just like that just a little
bit<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:45.030> about<00:02:45.209> halfway<00:02:45.719> or<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.310> pull<00:02:47.310> this

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
bit just about halfway or so pull this

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.610 
bit just about halfway or so pull this
out<00:02:47.669> and<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.959> reason<00:02:49.290> why<00:02:49.439> that's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
out and that's the reason why that's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.259 
out and that's the reason why that's
open<00:02:50.069> on<00:02:50.159> that<00:02:50.340> tip<00:02:50.549> right<00:02:50.579> there<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:51.090> see

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
open on that tip right there you see

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.670 
open on that tip right there you see
because<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.900> comes<00:02:52.109> slips<00:02:52.469> right<00:02:52.530> out

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
because it just comes slips right out

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.270 
because it just comes slips right out
there<00:02:53.069> and<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:54.060> now<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.689> patched<00:02:55.280> your

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
there and and now you're patched your

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.129 
there and and now you're patched your
patch<00:02:56.489> there<00:02:56.760> now<00:02:57.299> we'll<00:02:57.510> take<00:02:57.659> and<00:02:57.840> we'll<00:02:57.930> cut

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
patch there now we'll take and we'll cut

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.479 
patch there now we'll take and we'll cut
this<00:02:58.319> off<00:02:58.530> right<00:02:58.799> here<00:02:58.859> we<00:02:59.099> don't<00:02:59.159> need<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
this off right here we don't need that

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:00.800 
this off right here we don't need that
hanging<00:02:59.790> out<00:02:59.909> there<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:00.449> runs<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.719> risk

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
hanging out there and it runs the risk

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.379 
hanging out there and it runs the risk
of<00:03:00.989> pulling<00:03:01.319> everything<00:03:01.560> off<00:03:01.969> just<00:03:02.969> take<00:03:03.239> your

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
of pulling everything off just take your

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.920 
of pulling everything off just take your
knife<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:04.129> I<00:03:05.129> just<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:05.609> just<00:03:06.060> cut<00:03:06.389> it<00:03:06.510> flush<00:03:06.750> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
knife and I just I just cut it flush to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.610 
knife and I just I just cut it flush to
the<00:03:06.989> threads<00:03:08.719> that<00:03:09.719> last<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:10.079> long<00:03:10.260> time<00:03:10.469> now

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the threads that last a long time now

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.830 
the threads that last a long time now
they'll<00:03:10.799> tell<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.310> tire<00:03:11.489> store<00:03:11.840> and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
they'll tell you it's a tire store and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.050 
they'll tell you it's a tire store and
it's<00:03:13.139> probably<00:03:13.379> true<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.430> can't<00:03:14.730> repair

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
it's probably true that you can't repair

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.390 
it's probably true that you can't repair
a<00:03:15.090> sidewall<00:03:15.629> right<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.590> you've<00:03:17.040> all<00:03:17.219> been

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
a sidewall right that you've all been

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.099 
a sidewall right that you've all been
there<00:03:17.609> and<00:03:17.760> they<00:03:17.849> say<00:03:18.389> they<00:03:18.569> have<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.959> buy<00:03:19.079> a

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
there and they say they have to buy a

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.289 
there and they say they have to buy a
new<00:03:19.290> tire<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:20.129> probably<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.579> good<00:03:20.699> idea<00:03:20.759> for<00:03:21.239> a

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
new tire it's probably a good idea for a

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.300 
new tire it's probably a good idea for a
highway<00:03:21.629> car<00:03:21.900> but<00:03:22.560> if<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.769> need<00:03:22.919> to<00:03:22.979> get<00:03:23.129> back

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
highway car but if you need to get back

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.460 
highway car but if you need to get back
in<00:03:23.879> the<00:03:23.970> middle<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.269> nowhere<00:03:24.419> you<00:03:25.109> can<00:03:25.290> patch

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
in the middle of nowhere you can patch

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.770 
in the middle of nowhere you can patch
the<00:03:25.680> sidewall<00:03:26.159> I'd<00:03:26.819> probably<00:03:27.120> recommend<00:03:27.389> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
the sidewall I'd probably recommend you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.020 
the sidewall I'd probably recommend you
think<00:03:27.959> about<00:03:28.199> replacing<00:03:28.379> that<00:03:28.769> tire<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
think about replacing that tire but you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.249 
think about replacing that tire but you
could<00:03:30.180> certainly<00:03:30.389> replace<00:03:30.870> it<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.109> could

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:31.259 
could certainly replace it you could

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.559 
could certainly replace it you could
certainly<00:03:31.379> get<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.769> back<00:03:31.919> on<00:03:31.949> the<00:03:32.189> road<00:03:32.340> again

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
certainly get you back on the road again

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:41.130 
certainly get you back on the road again
so<00:03:33.569> if<00:03:33.659> we<00:03:33.750> pump<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.109> back<00:03:34.319> up

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.240 

then<00:03:42.140> we'll<00:03:42.350> look<00:03:42.470> around<00:03:42.770> here<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.100> can

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
then we'll look around here and we can

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.890 
then we'll look around here and we can
check<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.640> by<00:03:43.790> some<00:03:43.970> put<00:03:44.150> some<00:03:44.330> silk<00:03:44.540> on<00:03:44.720> there

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
check it by some put some silk on there

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.520 
check it by some put some silk on there
right<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:46.720> making<00:03:47.720> sure<00:03:47.840> that's<00:03:47.960> not<00:03:48.170> leaking

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
right and making sure that's not leaking

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.070 
right and making sure that's not leaking
you<00:03:49.340> know<00:03:49.460> it<00:03:49.580> might<00:03:49.790> leak<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.300> little<00:03:50.540> bit<00:03:50.900> but

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
you know it might leak a little bit but

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.240 
you know it might leak a little bit but
soon<00:03:51.230> as<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.350> roll<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.620> tire<00:03:51.830> around<00:03:51.950> put

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
soon as you roll that tire around put
