00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.820
 The month has gone by and I'm sending it. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.189
 It 's the different products for you. 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.980
 I clear that I used other products 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.020
 but I wanted to bring only the products that 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.419
 I used it differently so it does not get so 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.340
 repetitive okay then found himself 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.320
 interested in knowing what it is that I 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.340
 I used it in the meantime just continue 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.960
 watching this book 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.420
 Good, I 'll start by talking about the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.340
 skin care products 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.290
 and that through this month 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.350
 I used the products a little bit with a 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.700
 A little bit different, let's go to me. 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.510
 for my skin 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.790
 I used this product here, look who it is 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.950
 of a brand called there vertuan that I 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.950
 I bought there buffel know your brand 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.860
 lab faith since it is a lotion facial tonic 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:04.220
 which has aloe vera callendula thermal water 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:08.270
 tea I see in the formula I used enough 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.700
 he is very well dense well concentrated know 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.710
 I just did not like the cover of it that much 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.720
 he has this cap so I know 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.909
 I think it could be a lid with a 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.979
 but no problem not for one 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 waste as much product as it is 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.000
 very thick you can use enough to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.540
 put on the night I used enough 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.920
 simple here is a cream gel that you 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.299
 will you focus? 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.299
 I think she's very strong. 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.900
 is a cream gel with alpha hydroxy acids 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.300
 This is what a chemical peel is and he 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.810
 has a mixture of acids in formula 1 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.000
 so I use it every day at night is 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.009
 for it is stimulating collage of my 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 skin is also leaving my 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.990
 leg a little bit lighter with sun 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.200
 that I use this product is enough 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 to pass on my face everything is is a 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.300
 another product that I also acquired well 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.190
 at the end of August it was these 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.410
 You cook here that I'm crazy to do. 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.679
 the review for you is a choice 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.720
 which is very very much like a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.850
 imported light and sonic call 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 Only this one is from Bill Clinton who 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.920
 It's a brush that she has movements. 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.300
 bus comes 13 types of brush and this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.890
 here is the plus that is the largest size 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 so she comes two brushes her own 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.489
 would become normal and more 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.930
 and also a 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.480
 You do not have to carry it all the time. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.329
 charge once and you're ready to use 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.940
 It gives enough to use the toilet 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:47.510
 shower because it is waterproof it 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.700
 has the in three speeds 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.170
 This one is stronger. This is the weakest and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.600
 this is the fifth 'media' area and it is 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.390
 same as clarify sony is the same as if 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.670
 oil the sony clear housing that looks 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.030
 he here you think he's just the same 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:09.440
 that this is the one plínio sells there in the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.959
 beauty web site and sic was liked 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.630
 320 reais and a smaller one I think is 220 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.510
 I thought the bigger it's worth it 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.519
 so I use it every day at night to 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.620
 help me take off my makeup during the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.950

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.310
 areas 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.530

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.110

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.480
