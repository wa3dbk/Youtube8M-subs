00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 We often start together 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.839
 airport towards greece 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.700
 always the same appealing theme we have 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.309
 yes, we will have to recover together 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.590
 because again falls in rural part of the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.379
 other southern part trend actually 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.400
 about half an hour so big 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.310
 At least we had bielefeld klop 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.769
 then contact with lego and brain asked 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.670
 Do not we even have this heavy duty crane 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.309
 We want to build here and we have 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.910
 decided to turn that into a battle 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 who picks him up from the one who does the thing 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.930
 gets assembled the fastest 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.660
 I almost take his chauffeur away 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.920
 I think I won 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.920
 not deepen 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.769
 I came up with that and got it 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.300
 I called that said I think so 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.579
 reorganize now because we also mean so 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.579
 Although lots of stones 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.670
 everything was scared as the thing 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.030
 unpacked have one already at 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 cardboard for carton yes not signals 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.080
 huge cardboard and 2600 parts were that 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.030
 He makes felt in 50,000 bags 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.009
 distributed 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.369
 made discover so they have that 1 2 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.560
 and 3 was once on it and the handy 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.030
 the construction steps in principle marinades and 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.030
 I think the process said 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.080
 you really have a whole afterwards 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.880
 had table advantages whereby jan had 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.020
 you should give me the tip and that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 what have i done of course i have 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.230
 then sorted here by rods 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.550
 size of course not always in 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.400
 this little shit but that's exactly 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.600
 what stopped later 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.900
 really riddled everything 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.820
 bowl bowls and have both 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.220
 by color as well as by function 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.720
 sorted and for the first time to all 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.280
 first time I have this tupperware 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.170
 things the short description is not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.830
 damn it was great we have here 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830
 so bowl 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 then we started to build so 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.780
 jens we did not build at the same time 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.519
 on the one hand, a whole week earlier 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.200
 and then I have his individual 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.390
 followed and always thought 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.370
 so no opponent 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.590
 yes and i believe if i go through 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.300
 because I made mistakes and had to 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.280
 disassemble again and again as well 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.840
 beginner much so understanding mistake 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.880
 I would have done that, too 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.290
 times as short interim animal steps 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.569
 happy and I remember exactly as I do 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.230
 that the base frame was almost finished 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.300
 I thought to myself not so high and then 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.300
 I was also checked 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.370
 For me, the build was relaxed 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.920
 I would like to join the car again 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.540
 build my son together the must 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 I would have left out now otherwise 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.570
 I had a bigger advantage 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.160
 wanted to go out, the child does not 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.290
 just decided together 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.180
 children are not in the video exactly 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.800
 Nevertheless, I am looking forward to it 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.890
 because he always likes to go 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.450
 watched outside the video area 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.910
 is and since he's the vehicle of mine 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.080
 He will inherit others because of him 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.390
 I arranged that as fast as possible 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.390
 finished building my exhibition said 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.760
 the beautiful is it is probably only the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.400
 instructions for this heavy duty crane 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.630
 while a fireplace download and you can 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.850
 to download one more 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.140
 another model and so this now 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:36.050
 first disassembled very professional hope 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.060
 me and then while doing the second 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.390
 I would be determined to build a model 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.910
 Just show it again 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.130
 someday you will build a teaching and 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
 although to put the wheels straight and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.790
 this distraction and I thought why 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 The thing looks different now than in 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.010
 the drawing or how should be so funny 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.870
 and that the setting is like that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.250
 teaching is to stop that the wheels 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.380
 if you stand alone, you are almost standing straight 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.030
 provides good that I naturally to me at 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.709
 two pages on 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
 I was also a bit stinky there 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.760
 because I had the assembly already 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.030
 made sure that the morning is free 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.980
 well then I build a teaching in Sevilla 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.220
 okay I'm just leaving and he has the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:24.100
 Teach the chain to save five minutes 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:26.830
 We can on we have heavy duty crane 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.300
 who has a dip is 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 electronically controllable one can the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.590
 retract boom outside 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:38.860
 So I can go up and down 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.020
 The boom can not extend to it 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.330
 but go up and down because of me 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.490
 she can not continue or 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.320
 Extend I do not know why I think 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.400
 Both were about this clutch 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.400
 this little mistake 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.919
 so 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:01.009
 yes , one should never never say that we 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.779
 nothing after 15 of the stove once 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:08.539
 he can not turn on engines 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:09.919
 can still extend the engine and me 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.819
 of course I read 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.629
 you can turn beautiful by hand 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:18.610
 You can not do any more toys 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:22.669
 its pretty work piece that is 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.900
 definitely from the assemble here as well 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.400
 said yes about ten hours 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.460
 I needed the right one 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.819
 connoisseurs and can do it in six hours 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.819
 create 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.150
 i can also imagine her 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:37.009
 So 14 hours with 2000 can be all 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.279
 in my opinion a nice 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.659
 christmas present or just too 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:43.939
 birthday gift for engineering 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:47.449
 even changed a customer 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:50.449
 that 's what makes it like the head 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:52.580
 always the new big lego technic 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:56.270
 stories and then builds as 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.569
 role model and relax on when he did that 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.729
 first time I said a bit 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.899
 looked ok so you can do 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.529
 I can do it a bit more now 

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.270
 understand 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.460
 So I need a bit more 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.930
 more means that you are more like that 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.330
 a little pension is really 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.779
 especially with us the so much digital 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.599
 do 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:19.339
 tap and gentlemen so click again 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:27.949
 What to do with your hands 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:30.409
 that was a lot of fun and that was 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.839
 a completely different video of us anyway 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.050
 can you like to down times licon or 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:38.360
 neither but I would say 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.279
 Subscribe because it certainly is 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.120
 not the last attempt in another 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.389
 been world 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.360
 exactly and it will also be interesting what 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.240
 you keep it so commented today 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.589
 played lego or plays he plays here 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.389
 even a life is one 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:56.069
 which has not yet re-tighten the 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:59.169
 have built up technology 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.750
 he also counts times and other things 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:04.380
 used to be back in the next video soon 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.380
 clear
