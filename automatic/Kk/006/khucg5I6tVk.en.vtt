think about that dot that dots going to
grow<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.160> expand<00:04:12.470> whereas<00:04:13.470> uncoated<00:04:14.430> paper

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
grow and expand whereas uncoated paper

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.690 
grow and expand whereas uncoated paper
so<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.500> would<00:04:16.650> be<00:04:16.769> an<00:04:16.889> uncoated<00:04:17.280> sheet

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
so that would be an uncoated sheet

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.830 
so that would be an uncoated sheet
uncoated<00:04:18.690> paper<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.579> offset<00:04:20.579> printing<00:04:21.000> the

uncoated paper on offset printing the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.529 
uncoated paper on offset printing the
ink<00:04:22.079> will<00:04:22.410> act<00:04:22.620> like<00:04:22.770> wax<00:04:23.220> paper<00:04:23.580> so<00:04:23.910> if<00:04:24.270> at

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
ink will act like wax paper so if at

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
you the most detail and sharpness so

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.960 
the trend doesn't change then I see
digital<00:06:44.070> printing<00:06:44.520> in<00:06:44.700> the<00:06:44.730> future<00:06:45.920> becoming

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
digital printing in the future becoming

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.860 
digital printing in the future becoming
the<00:06:47.970> strongest<00:06:48.630> player

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
the strongest player

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.350 
the strongest player
of<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.050> two<00:06:50.370> so<00:06:51.370> in<00:06:51.520> the<00:06:51.640> end<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:52.030> looks<00:06:52.060> like

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
of the two so in the end it looks like

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.630 
of the two so in the end it looks like
both<00:06:52.630> methods<00:06:53.140> are<00:06:53.290> strong<00:06:53.650> contenders<00:06:53.920> for

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
both methods are strong contenders for

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.040 
both methods are strong contenders for
the<00:06:54.730> printing<00:06:55.000> industry<00:06:55.120> it'll<00:06:55.960> be

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
the printing industry it'll be

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.000 
the printing industry it'll be
