moment big problem with a naked short of
course<00:00:13.330> is<00:00:13.570> that<00:00:13.950> you're<00:00:14.950> fishing<00:00:15.400> on<00:00:15.520> to<00:00:15.730> one

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
course is that you're fishing on to one

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.030 
course is that you're fishing on to one
bit<00:00:16.090> of<00:00:16.209> line<00:00:16.450> and<00:00:17.260> that<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.560> swivel<00:00:17.890> can

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
bit of line and that the swivel can

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.760 
bit of line and that the swivel can
damage<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.490> line<00:00:18.700> and<00:00:19.260> also<00:00:20.260> if<00:00:20.619> you're

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
damage the line and also if you're

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.819 
damage the line and also if you're
fishing<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.189> water<00:00:21.430> where<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:22.029> law<00:00:22.829> dictates

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:23.829 
fishing a water where the law dictates

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.470 
fishing a water where the law dictates
that<00:00:24.009> you<00:00:24.070> have<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.369> have<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.520> drop<00:00:24.790> off<00:00:24.970> system

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
that you have to have a drop off system

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.290 
that you have to have a drop off system
then<00:00:26.050> obviously<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.400> naked<00:00:27.759> shot<00:00:27.970> doesn't

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
then obviously the naked shot doesn't

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.350 
then obviously the naked shot doesn't
facilitate<00:00:28.450> that<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:29.439> a<00:00:29.739> while<00:00:30.700> ago<00:00:30.730> I<00:00:31.060> was

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
facilitate that so a while ago I was

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.870 
facilitate that so a while ago I was
fishing<00:00:31.660> on<00:00:31.930> my<00:00:32.079> own<00:00:32.230> as<00:00:32.439> always<00:00:32.829> I<00:00:33.160> came<00:00:33.640> up

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
fishing on my own as always I came up

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.960 
fishing on my own as always I came up
with<00:00:33.910> a<00:00:34.920> sort<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.010> solution<00:00:36.579> to<00:00:36.700> all<00:00:36.790> those

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
with a sort of solution to all those

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.150 
with a sort of solution to all those
problems<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.870> we're<00:00:38.620> going<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.800> go<00:00:38.920> through

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
problems and we're going to go through

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.580 
problems and we're going to go through
that<00:00:39.340> now<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:42.280> simple<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:44.230> we<00:00:44.290> can

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
that now so very simple if we can

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.990 
that now so very simple if we can
imagine<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.070> this<00:00:45.220> is<00:00:45.400> the<00:00:45.520> main<00:00:45.730> line

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
imagine that this is the main line

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.870 
imagine that this is the main line
coming<00:00:46.330> off<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.630> rod<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.250> we've<00:00:48.490> just<00:00:48.700> done<00:00:48.850> a

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
coming off the rod and we've just done a

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.420 
coming off the rod and we've just done a
back-to-back<00:00:49.420> leader<00:00:49.750> not<00:00:50.080> there<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:50.980> we've

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
back-to-back leader not there and we've

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.160 
back-to-back leader not there and we've
attached<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.940> 24<00:00:52.480> pound<00:00:52.720> length<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.640> incognito

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
attached a 24 pound length of incognito

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.800 
attached a 24 pound length of incognito

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
minimalistic so going down to the leader

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.980 
minimalistic so going down to the leader
end<00:01:08.409> we<00:01:08.890> take<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> baiting<00:01:09.729> needle<00:01:09.759> and<00:01:10.390> we

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
end we take a baiting needle and we

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.209 
end we take a baiting needle and we
simply<00:01:11.439> thread<00:01:11.679> on<00:01:11.890> an<00:01:12.729> oval<00:01:13.240> bead<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.979> bring

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:15.219 
simply thread on an oval bead we bring

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.209 
simply thread on an oval bead we bring
that<00:01:15.399> up<00:01:15.579> the<00:01:15.729> leader<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.380> we<00:01:17.590> just<00:01:17.829> secure

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
that up the leader and we just secure

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.840 
that up the leader and we just secure
that<00:01:18.520> over<00:01:19.149> the<00:01:19.240> knot<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:21.159> that<00:01:21.249> it<00:01:21.310> can<00:01:21.490> easily

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
that over the knot so that it can easily

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.669 
that over the knot so that it can easily
just<00:01:22.090> flick<00:01:22.450> off<00:01:22.659> in<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.259> event<00:01:23.319> of<00:01:23.560> any

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
just flick off in the event of any

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.730 
just flick off in the event of any
blockages<00:01:24.369> so<00:01:24.819> we<00:01:25.719> just<00:01:25.899> knit<00:01:26.170> we're<00:01:26.469> set<00:01:26.710> on

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
blockages so we just knit we're set on

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.849 
blockages so we just knit we're set on
to<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.219> knot<00:01:27.429> and<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.119> gives<00:01:28.539> us<00:01:28.719> the<00:01:29.590> stop

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
to the knot and that gives us the stop

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.480 
to the knot and that gives us the stop
not<00:01:30.100> there<00:01:30.929> we<00:01:31.929> then<00:01:32.109> thread<00:01:32.409> on<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:33.189> chori

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
not there we then thread on the chori

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.190

the<00:02:21.360> fish<00:02:21.599> you're<00:02:22.560> always<00:02:22.709> playing<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.520> one

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the fish you're always playing it on one

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.150 
the fish you're always playing it on one
bit<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.970> line<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.709> swivel<00:02:25.709> can<00:02:25.890> always

bit of line and that swivel can always

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.770 
bit of line and that swivel can always
cut<00:02:26.459> through<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.000> line<00:02:27.239> doesn't<00:02:27.510> matter

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
cut through that line doesn't matter

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.740 
cut through that line doesn't matter
whether<00:02:27.930> using<00:02:28.260> fluo<00:02:28.650> carbon<00:02:29.459> or<00:02:29.610> any<00:02:30.420> other

whether using fluo carbon or any other
main<00:02:30.989> line<00:02:31.290> there's<00:02:31.830> always<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.220> chance<00:02:32.519> that

main line there's always a chance that

that<00:02:32.819> can<00:02:33.060> break<00:02:33.269> so<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.010> came<00:02:35.310> up<00:02:35.370> with

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
that can break so what I came up with

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.460 
that can break so what I came up with
was<00:02:35.970> quite<00:02:36.209> simply<00:02:37.099> double<00:02:38.099> up<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:39.209> line<00:02:39.470> and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
was quite simply double up the line and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.280 
was quite simply double up the line and
tie<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:43.910> nun<00:02:44.910> draw<00:02:45.150> over<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.870> depending<00:02:46.260> on

what way you tie it pull it down tight
and<00:02:50.549> trim<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:55.580> then<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:58.110> get<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.319> boom<00:02:58.650> shocka

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250

we<00:03:40.830> fed<00:03:41.069> that<00:03:41.099> through<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.959> actual<00:03:43.349> ring

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
we fed that through the the actual ring

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.750 
we fed that through the the actual ring
bit<00:03:45.590> afraid<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.709> swivel<00:03:47.069> back<00:03:47.250> through<00:03:47.579> the

loop and that then secures the bottom of
the<00:03:52.500> rig<00:03:52.709> we<00:03:53.370> then<00:03:53.519> take<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.970> lid<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:55.260> will

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
the rig we then take the lid we will

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:57.740 
the rig we then take the lid we will
always<00:03:55.590> use<00:03:55.950> an<00:03:56.099> inline<00:03:56.250> they<00:03:56.640> don't<00:03:57.030> use<00:03:57.299> a

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
always use an inline they don't use a

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.309 
always use an inline they don't use a
swivel<00:03:58.680> lid<00:03:59.180> because<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.540> two<00:04:00.690> weeks<00:04:00.959> are<00:04:01.140> you

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
swivel lid because the two weeks are you

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.170 
swivel lid because the two weeks are you
is<00:04:01.409> I've<00:04:01.560> official<00:04:02.040> helicopter<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
is I've official helicopter and the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.000 
is I've official helicopter and the
inline<00:04:03.450> will<00:04:03.629> do<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.110> as<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.379> drop<00:04:04.650> off<00:04:04.799> all

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
inline will do that as a drop off all

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.270 
inline will do that as a drop off all
the<00:04:05.159> time<00:04:05.510> or<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.569> use<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.409> as<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:07.799> in<00:04:07.950> inline

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
the time or I use it as a one in inline

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.770 
the time or I use it as a one in inline
so<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.579> never<00:04:08.670> ever<00:04:09.500> go<00:04:10.500> down<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.950> route<00:04:11.099> of

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so I never ever go down the route of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.809 
so I never ever go down the route of
buying<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.989> other<00:04:13.019> types<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.680> legs<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.549> just

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
buying the other types of legs so I just

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.420 
buying the other types of legs so I just
pushed<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.209> swiveling<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.250> insult<00:04:17.250> like

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
pushed that swiveling and insult like

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.949 
pushed that swiveling and insult like
the<00:04:17.549> true<00:04:17.729> drop<00:04:18.060> off<00:04:18.209> late<00:04:18.449> system<00:04:18.840> it's

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
the true drop off late system it's

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.050 
the true drop off late system it's
nothing<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:19.709> nothing<00:04:19.889> revolutionary<00:04:20.220> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
nothing it's nothing revolutionary I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.770 
nothing it's nothing revolutionary I

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.490 
what I don't end up with is a naked shot
like<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.639> nothing<00:04:48.479> revolutionary<00:04:48.660> when<00:04:49.380> you

actually look at the concept of the
naked<00:04:51.389> shot<00:04:51.630> until<00:04:52.349> you<00:04:52.440> actually<00:04:52.620> come<00:04:53.070> to

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
naked shot until you actually come to

naked shot until you actually come to
the<00:04:54.090> playing<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.080> fish<00:04:55.139> for<00:04:55.590> when<00:04:55.680> you

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
the playing of the fish for when you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320 
the playing of the fish for when you
hook<00:04:55.949> a<00:04:56.099> fish<00:04:56.130> and<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.610> start<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:57.060> play<00:04:57.270> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
hook a fish and you start to play the

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.870 
hook a fish and you start to play the
fish<00:04:57.660> what<00:04:58.440> happens<00:04:58.889> is<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.099> that<00:04:59.250> swivel

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
fish what happens is that that swivel

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.400 
fish what happens is that that swivel
pulls<00:05:00.750> that<00:05:01.020> bead<00:05:01.349> over<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.919> stop<00:05:02.190> not<00:05:03.410> and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
pulls that bead over to stop not and

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.439 
pulls that bead over to stop not and
goes<00:05:04.710> down<00:05:04.979> onto<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.400> double<00:05:05.699> bit<00:05:05.849> of<00:05:05.970> line<00:05:06.150> so

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
goes down onto the double bit of line so

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:07.640 
goes down onto the double bit of line so
when<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:06.630> actually<00:05:06.960> play<00:05:07.169> in<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.320> fish

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
when you actually play in the fish

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.070 
when you actually play in the fish
instead<00:05:08.400> of<00:05:08.550> playing<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.880> on<00:05:09.000> one<00:05:09.210> bit<00:05:09.449> of<00:05:09.599> line

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
instead of playing it on one bit of line

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.050 
instead of playing it on one bit of line
you're<00:05:10.680> playing<00:05:10.949> it<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.220> two<00:05:11.430> bits<00:05:11.760> the<00:05:11.910> line

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
you're playing it on two bits the line

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.089 
you're playing it on two bits the line
so<00:05:12.240> if<00:05:12.330> you've<00:05:12.419> got<00:05:12.630> sort<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.960> like<00:05:13.139> 24-pound

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
so if you've got sort of like 24-pound

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.580 
so if you've got sort of like 24-pound
incognito<00:05:14.820> like<00:05:15.030> I'm<00:05:15.210> using<00:05:15.479> here<00:05:15.630> you're<00:05:16.440> now

type i decided to call this seeing
children<00:06:32.240> ito<00:06:33.460> so<00:06:34.460> basically<00:06:34.849> what<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.180> does

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
children ito so basically what it does
