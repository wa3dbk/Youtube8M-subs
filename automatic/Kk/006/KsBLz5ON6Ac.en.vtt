00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
decent pulls out of those so I just

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.380 
decent pulls out of those so I just
wanted<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:35.890> kind<00:00:36.040> of<00:00:36.070> check<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.310> out<00:00:36.430> so<00:00:37.180> on<00:00:37.270> one

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
wanted to kind of check it out so on one

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.020 
wanted to kind of check it out so on one
side<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.630> can<00:00:37.990> see<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.530> pop<00:00:38.890> pack<00:00:39.160> i<00:00:39.370> think<00:00:39.550> the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
side you can see a pop pack i think the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.260 
side you can see a pop pack i think the
can't<00:00:40.270> really<00:00:40.420> tell<00:00:40.570> which<00:00:40.720> series<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.140> is<00:00:41.170> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
can't really tell which series it is and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.410 
can't really tell which series it is and
on<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.300> other<00:00:43.420> side<00:00:43.690> there's<00:00:44.080> a<00:00:44.410> reverse<00:00:45.010> how

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
on the other side there's a reverse how

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.270 
on the other side there's a reverse how
abideth<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.660> these<00:00:47.170> are<00:00:47.350> sealed<00:00:47.590> with<00:00:47.800> them<00:00:48.040> a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
abideth and these are sealed with them a

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.840 
abideth and these are sealed with them a
little<00:00:49.150> I<00:00:49.920> guess<00:00:50.920> circle<00:00:51.280> piece<00:00:51.460> of<00:00:51.579> tape<00:00:51.730> on

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
little I guess circle piece of tape on

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.310 
little I guess circle piece of tape on
both<00:00:52.030> sides<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.450> did<00:00:52.570> cut<00:00:52.750> through<00:00:52.990> it<00:00:53.020> just<00:00:53.260> so

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
both sides I did cut through it just so

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.340 
both sides I did cut through it just so
i<00:00:53.350> can<00:00:53.470> open<00:00:53.740> this<00:00:53.829> easier<00:00:54.190> here<00:00:54.990> and<00:00:55.990> I<00:00:56.110> open

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
i can open this easier here and I open

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.530 
i can open this easier here and I open
one<00:00:56.470> of<00:00:56.590> these<00:00:56.740> um<00:00:57.100> actually<00:00:58.030> three<00:00:58.360> of<00:00:58.450> these

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
one of these um actually three of these

00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:29.709 
actually one of the cards I pulled was a

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.059 
actually one of the cards I pulled was a
collector<00:01:30.369> with<00:01:30.759> from<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.299> trainer<00:01:32.170> kit<00:01:32.439> so<00:01:32.740> I

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
collector with from the trainer kit so I

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.099 
collector with from the trainer kit so I
thought<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:33.969> a<00:01:34.060> useful<00:01:34.389> card<00:01:34.600> then<00:01:34.899> some

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
thought that was a useful card then some

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.749 
thought that was a useful card then some
of<00:01:35.229> them<00:01:35.350> were<00:01:35.649> actually<00:01:36.039> rares<00:01:36.280> that<00:01:36.549> were<00:01:36.639> in

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
of them were actually rares that were in

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
of them were actually rares that were in
here<00:01:36.880> day<00:01:37.060> she's<00:01:37.209> more<00:01:37.359> in<00:01:37.420> holographic<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:39.209> oh

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
here day she's more in holographic so oh

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.599 
here day she's more in holographic so oh
and<00:01:41.530> yeah<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:41.829> think<00:01:42.189> there<00:01:42.280> was<00:01:42.369> also<00:01:42.490> plenty

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
and yeah I think there was also plenty

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.389 
and yeah I think there was also plenty
of<00:01:42.880> energy<00:01:43.029> so<00:01:43.779> should<00:01:44.439> pitbul<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.219> is

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
of energy so should pitbul and that is

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.789 
of energy so should pitbul and that is
from<00:01:45.729> a<00:01:45.909> trainer<00:01:46.149> kit<00:01:46.389> I'm<00:01:47.259> not<00:01:47.380> sure<00:01:47.439> which

three or four dollars online anyway so

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.300 
three or four dollars online anyway so
makes<00:03:45.200> getting<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.530> cube<00:03:45.800> like<00:03:45.950> that's<00:03:46.130> worth

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
makes getting a cube like that's worth

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.340 
makes getting a cube like that's worth
it<00:03:46.520> I<00:03:46.670> guess<00:03:46.910> plus<00:03:47.480> all<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> other<00:03:47.750> stuff<00:03:47.930> yet

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.460 
now it's from pop for not six so I about
that<00:04:40.039> and<00:04:40.810> there<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.440> sealed<00:04:43.400> um<00:04:44.259> card<00:04:45.259> here

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
that and there is a sealed um card here

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.610 
that and there is a sealed um card here
I<00:04:45.650> think<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.520> my<00:04:46.699> last<00:04:47.000> two<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.900> opened<00:04:48.440> it

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
I think in my last two that I opened it

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.400 
I think in my last two that I opened it
was<00:04:48.860> an<00:04:49.100> n-type<00:04:49.370> but<00:04:49.639> follows<00:04:50.060> in<00:04:50.210> this<00:04:50.330> one<00:04:50.509> I

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.260 

think<00:04:54.410> that's<00:04:54.680> what<00:04:54.919> they<00:04:55.400> just<00:04:55.610> tend<00:04:55.970> to<00:04:56.060> come

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
think that's what they just tend to come

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.730 
think that's what they just tend to come
with<00:04:57.729> yep<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.960> it's<00:05:00.199> a<00:05:00.410> promo<00:05:01.220> entei<00:05:02.620> with<00:05:03.620> the

with yep so it's a promo entei with the

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.800 
with yep so it's a promo entei with the
cards<00:05:03.979> for<00:05:04.550> trade<00:05:04.580> if<00:05:04.880> anybody's<00:05:05.389> interested

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
cards for trade if anybody's interested

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.469 
cards for trade if anybody's interested
in<00:05:06.259> that<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.560> I<00:05:06.620> do<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.190> sealed<00:05:07.580> one<00:05:07.759> and<00:05:08.000> i

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
in that and I do have a sealed one and i

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.930 
in that and I do have a sealed one and i
bought<00:05:08.690> at<00:05:09.620> least<00:05:09.860> two<00:05:10.039> more<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.400> these<00:05:10.550> of

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
bought at least two more of these of

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.520 
bought at least two more of these of
cubes<00:05:11.270> so<00:05:11.509> i'm<00:05:11.930> assuming<00:05:12.050> they<00:05:12.320> probably

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
cubes so i'm assuming they probably

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.650 
cubes so i'm assuming they probably
would<00:05:12.889> have<00:05:13.009> them<00:05:13.669> in<00:05:13.820> there<00:05:13.970> so<00:05:14.150> I<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.419> have

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
would have them in there so I I have

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.300 
would have them in there so I I have
sealed<00:05:14.960> ones<00:05:15.199> and<00:05:15.470> unsealed<00:05:15.979> ones<00:05:16.160> if

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
sealed ones and unsealed ones if

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.020 
sealed ones and unsealed ones if
anybody's<00:05:16.699> interested<00:05:16.820> in<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:19.030> that

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
anybody's interested in that and that

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.529 
anybody's interested in that and that

I'm really happy about that and energy
and<00:06:24.530> that's<00:06:25.220> just<00:06:25.370> an<00:06:25.550> energy<00:06:25.880> there's<00:06:26.060> no

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
and that's just an energy there's no

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.720 
and that's just an energy there's no
code<00:06:27.440> on<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:27.650> whatsoever<00:06:28.100> but<00:06:28.400> there<00:06:28.580> are

three<00:06:29.150> cards<00:06:29.480> in<00:06:29.630> here<00:06:29.810> rather<00:06:30.200> than<00:06:30.370> I'm

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
three cards in here rather than I'm

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.890 
three cards in here rather than I'm
sorry<00:06:31.640> it<00:06:31.730> does<00:06:31.880> say<00:06:32.030> to<00:06:32.090> primal<00:06:32.510> cards<00:06:32.690> at<00:06:32.810> one

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
sorry it does say to primal cards at one

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.610 
sorry it does say to primal cards at one
energy<00:06:33.260> so<00:06:33.470> that's<00:06:33.710> the<00:06:33.890> energy<00:06:35.110> nice<00:06:36.110> it's<00:06:36.470> a

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
energy so that's the energy nice it's a

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.610 
energy so that's the energy nice it's a
Garchomp<00:06:36.920> it's<00:06:37.400> a<00:06:37.580> rare<00:06:38.050> number<00:06:39.050> one<00:06:39.350> out<00:06:39.530> of

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
Garchomp it's a rare number one out of

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.480 
Garchomp it's a rare number one out of
17<00:06:39.950> so<00:06:40.730> all<00:06:41.030> awesome<00:06:41.510> poles<00:06:41.840> so<00:06:42.080> far<00:06:42.350> and<00:06:42.590> a

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
17 so all awesome poles so far and a

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.550 
17 so all awesome poles so far and a
piplup<00:06:43.790> number<00:06:44.150> 16<00:06:44.570> out<00:06:44.720> of<00:06:44.750> 17<00:06:44.870> that's<00:06:45.470> a

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 
piplup number 16 out of 17 that's a

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.520 
piplup number 16 out of 17 that's a
common<00:06:45.920> but<00:06:46.700> for<00:06:47.390> one<00:06:47.780> of<00:06:47.930> these<00:06:48.050> cubes

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.530 
common but for one of these cubes

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.280 
common but for one of these cubes
something<00:06:49.130> i<00:06:49.190> paid<00:06:49.370> around<00:06:49.490> six<00:06:49.820> dollars<00:06:50.180> for

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
something i paid around six dollars for

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
mean that really made this whole cube

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.130 
mean that really made this whole cube
completely<00:07:06.860> worth<00:07:07.040> it<00:07:07.340> I<00:07:07.880> absolutely<00:07:08.510> love

completely worth it I absolutely love

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.900 
completely worth it I absolutely love
these<00:07:09.260> poles<00:07:09.530> and<00:07:09.800> I'm<00:07:09.950> so<00:07:10.190> excited<00:07:10.310> I<00:07:10.640> wish<00:07:10.790> I

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:10.910
