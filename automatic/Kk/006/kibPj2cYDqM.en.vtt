been quite inspirational by tamia effect

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.200 
been quite inspirational by tamia effect
that<00:01:20.820> they<00:01:22.009> had<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.310> own<00:01:23.340> integrity<00:01:23.990> and

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
that they had their own integrity and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
that they had their own integrity and
been<00:01:27.210> very<00:01:27.240> compromise<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
been very compromise on that I think is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.249 
been very compromise on that I think is
fair<00:01:29.909> fight<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> work

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
fair fight all to have a work

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.499 
fair fight all to have a work
environment<00:01:31.500> where<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.490> surrounded<00:01:33.090> with<00:01:33.270> my

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
environment where I'm surrounded with my

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.429 
environment where I'm surrounded with my
my<00:01:34.290> artifacts<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.270> bit<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.840> tank<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
my artifacts a bit like a think tank I

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.330 
my artifacts a bit like a think tank I
think<00:01:38.100> if<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.790> all<00:01:39.950> artists<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
think if you look at all artists you

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.600 
think if you look at all artists you
look<00:01:41.549> at<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> environment<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:42.689> live<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
look at the environment they live in

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
look at the environment they live in
it's<00:01:44.610> particularly<00:01:45.360> clean<00:01:45.780> at<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.020> moment

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
it's particularly clean at the moment

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.450 
it's particularly clean at the moment
because<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:47.189> my<00:01:47.790> canvases<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.659> Blanco<00:01:49.460> but

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
because my my canvases are Blanco but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580 
because my my canvases are Blanco but
then<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> started<00:01:51.000> working<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.659> don't<00:01:51.930> tidy<00:01:52.290> up

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
then I started working I don't tidy up

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.810 
then I started working I don't tidy up
because<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> takes<00:01:53.340> away<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:55.610> essence<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
because it takes away the the essence of

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
because it takes away the the essence of
what<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.210> busy<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.110> went<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.770> an
