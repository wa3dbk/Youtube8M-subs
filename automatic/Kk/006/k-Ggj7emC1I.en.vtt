a quick rush over and now we'll make a
start<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.059> something<00:00:42.890> always<00:00:43.890> good<00:00:44.160> to

really<00:00:44.489> read<00:00:44.790> up<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> instructions<00:00:45.720> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
really read up on the instructions I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.280 
really read up on the instructions I
can't<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.710> floor<00:00:47.489> sander<00:00:47.989> we<00:00:48.989> found<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
can't use a floor sander we found a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.189 
can't use a floor sander we found a
fairly<00:00:49.800> straightforward<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> few<00:00:52.079> things

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
fairly straightforward and a few things

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.829 
fairly straightforward and a few things
to<00:00:52.379> bear<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.620> mind<00:00:52.909> things<00:00:53.909> like<00:00:54.150> make<00:00:54.690> sure

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
to bear in mind things like make sure

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.259 
to bear in mind things like make sure
you're<00:00:55.019> moving<00:00:55.230> at<00:00:55.920> 40<00:00:56.640> directions<00:00:57.059> actually

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
you're moving at 40 directions actually

cut<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.600> wood<00:01:01.280> how<00:01:02.280> also<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.640> found<00:01:02.879> we

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
cut down on wood how also we found we

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.719 
cut down on wood how also we found we
started<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.540> each<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.960> eighty<00:01:04.170> three<00:01:04.440> on<00:01:05.399> some

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
started on each and eighty three on some

of the other tools in the house for

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.520 
of the other tools in the house for
Fowler<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.610> quite<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.630> confidant<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
Fowler actually quite a confidant in the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.670 
Fowler actually quite a confidant in the
first<00:01:10.740> pass<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> level<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> board<00:01:13.380> time

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
first pass to the level the board time

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
first pass to the level the board time
so<00:01:14.130> we've<00:01:14.280> managed<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.640> get<00:01:14.850> obviously<00:01:15.420> their

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so we've managed to get obviously their

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.130 
so we've managed to get obviously their
40<00:01:16.500> grit<00:01:16.679> paper<00:01:17.149> so<00:01:18.149> we'll<00:01:18.300> make<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.539> start<00:01:18.810> at

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
40 grit paper so we'll make a start at

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.219 
40 grit paper so we'll make a start at
this<00:01:19.380> room<00:01:20.479> makes<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.780> really<00:01:22.050> good

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
this room makes you have a really good

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.900 
this room makes you have a really good
looking<00:01:22.649> for<00:01:23.039> any<00:01:23.160> of<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.369> analogous

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
looking for any of these analogous

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.240 
looking for any of these analogous
before<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> start<00:01:24.750> we're<00:01:25.649> just<00:01:25.770> using<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.070> nail

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
before you start we're just using a nail

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.669 
before you start we're just using a nail
punch<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.200> getting<00:01:28.380> nice<00:01:28.649> and

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
punch and just really getting nice and

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:38.490 
punch and just really getting nice and
low<00:01:29.009> below<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> surface<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> wood

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.740 

couple<00:01:39.100> more<00:01:39.219> things<00:01:39.399> before<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:40.119> start

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
couple more things before you start

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.149 
couple more things before you start
standing<00:01:40.990> make<00:01:41.350> sure<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.560> got<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.740> dust<00:01:41.920> mask

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
standing make sure you got a dust mask

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.459 
standing make sure you got a dust mask
on<00:01:42.490> make<00:01:43.479> sure<00:01:43.659> your<00:01:43.899> kids<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.320> they

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
on make sure your kids that they

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.380 
on make sure your kids that they
attended<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.369> standard<00:01:45.729> normally<00:01:46.000> come<00:01:46.210> as<00:01:46.329> a

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
attended the standard normally come as a

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.380 
attended the standard normally come as a
bag<00:01:46.630> which<00:01:47.380> connects<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:48.039> and<00:01:48.700> collects<00:01:49.090> most

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
bag which connects on and collects most

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.649 
bag which connects on and collects most
of<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.630> dust<00:01:49.869> or<00:01:50.340> separate<00:01:51.340> up<00:01:51.460> any<00:01:51.729> dust<00:01:52.060> but

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
of the dust or separate up any dust but

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.120 
of the dust or separate up any dust but
it<00:01:52.750> does<00:01:52.929> get<00:01:53.110> pretty<00:01:53.259> bad<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.740> here

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
it does get pretty bad in here

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.789 
it does get pretty bad in here
so<00:01:54.520> it's<00:01:54.670> situational<00:01:55.270> window<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:56.500> can

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
so it's situational window you can

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.760 
so it's situational window you can
connect<00:01:57.159> a<00:01:57.250> vacuum<00:01:57.399> on<00:01:57.850> which<00:01:58.630> has<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.049> dust

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
connect a vacuum on which has the dust

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.550 
connect a vacuum on which has the dust
extractor<00:02:00.189> on<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:01.569> be<00:02:01.689> honest<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.350> bag

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
extractor on in to be honest the bag

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:18.289 
extractor on in to be honest the bag
that's<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:03.039> fairly<00:02:03.490> good<00:02:03.700> job

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.880 

now<00:02:19.299> the<00:02:19.360> only<00:02:19.569> reason<00:02:19.840> why<00:02:20.080> we've<00:02:20.349> decided<00:02:20.530> to

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
now the only reason why we've decided to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.240 
now the only reason why we've decided to
sound<00:02:21.580> across<00:02:22.269> the<00:02:22.480> boards<00:02:22.780> initially<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
sound across the boards initially is the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.890 
sound across the boards initially is the
pussy's<00:02:24.610> boards<00:02:24.909> of<00:02:25.000> really<00:02:25.239> old<00:02:25.360> there's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
pussy's boards of really old there's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.509 
pussy's boards of really old there's
been<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:26.079> lot<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.349> movement<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.950> cutting<00:02:27.370> over

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
been a lot of movement and cutting over

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.869 
been a lot of movement and cutting over
the<00:02:27.670> years<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> it's<00:02:29.110> like<00:02:29.319> to<00:02:29.500> go<00:02:29.680> across<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
the years so it's like to go across the

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.600 
the years so it's like to go across the
boards<00:02:31.239> for<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.260> first<00:02:32.560> part<00:02:32.890> that's<00:02:33.430> with

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
boards for the first part that's with

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.000 
boards for the first part that's with
the<00:02:33.700> 40<00:02:34.060> grit<00:02:34.209> paper<00:02:34.620> once<00:02:35.620> we've<00:02:35.829> done<00:02:35.950> that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
the 40 grit paper once we've done that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.970 
the 40 grit paper once we've done that
we've<00:02:36.489> got<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.819> fairly<00:02:37.329> flat<00:02:37.599> surface<00:02:38.290> will

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
we've got a fairly flat surface will

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.039 
we've got a fairly flat surface will
then<00:02:39.129> start<00:02:39.489> properly<00:02:39.819> going<00:02:41.700> 1813<00:02:42.700> 20<00:02:43.239> across

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
then start properly going 1813 20 across

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.259 
then start properly going 1813 20 across
Oh<00:02:44.260> start<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:44.980> board's<00:02:45.310> keeping<00:02:46.090> with

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
Oh start with the board's keeping with

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.880 
Oh start with the board's keeping with
the<00:02:46.420> grain<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.930> keep<00:02:47.079> your<00:02:47.230> version<00:02:47.590> smooth

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
the grain to keep your version smooth

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.149 
the grain to keep your version smooth
this<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.849> edge<00:02:48.970> sander<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:50.500> use<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.859> to

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
this is the edge sander we use just to

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.490 
this is the edge sander we use just to
get<00:02:51.280> right<00:02:51.640> against<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.239> skirting<00:02:52.599> where<00:02:53.349> the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500
