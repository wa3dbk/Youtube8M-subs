00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
way back and that's basically with the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.690 
way back and that's basically with the
two<00:02:23.030> ways<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.239> do<00:02:23.720> i<00:02:23.930> prefer<00:02:24.739> dropping<00:02:25.550> it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
two ways you do i prefer dropping it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900 
two ways you do i prefer dropping it
because<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.930> saves<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.069> time<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.459> walking

all the way to the bank and it's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.460 
all the way to the bank and it's
basically<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.880> fastest<00:02:32.569> experience<00:02:33.290> that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
basically the fastest experience that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.830 
basically the fastest experience that

come<00:03:48.820> here<00:03:49.000> at<00:03:49.150> 40<00:03:49.480> well<00:03:50.910> it's<00:03:51.910> extremely<00:03:52.480> slow

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
come here at 40 well it's extremely slow

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.199 
come here at 40 well it's extremely slow
at<00:03:52.870> 40<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.950> i'd<00:03:54.040> recommend<00:03:54.070> doing<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.820> 50<00:03:55.120> or

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
at 40 so i'd recommend doing it 50 or

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.910 
at 40 so i'd recommend doing it 50 or
higher<00:03:55.239> so<00:03:55.959> you<00:03:56.080> just<00:03:56.230> catch<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.739> bit

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
higher so you just catch it a little bit

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.800 
higher so you just catch it a little bit
faster<00:03:57.070> because<00:03:57.520> you<00:03:58.120> really<00:03:58.360> don't<00:03:58.480> get<00:03:58.630> any

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
faster because you really don't get any

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.640 
faster because you really don't get any
experience<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.739> you<00:03:59.920> come<00:04:00.610> around<00:04:00.760> for<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.650> so

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
experience if you come around for you so

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.800 
experience if you come around for you so
after<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:03.010> catch<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.340> few<00:04:03.550> you<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.060> one<00:04:04.690> or

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
after you catch a few you can do one or

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.650 
after you catch a few you can do one or
two<00:04:04.840> things<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.400> either<00:04:06.520> go<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.420> the
