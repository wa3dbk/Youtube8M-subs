00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:16.390
 Well, it's time 4 video lessons in 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.300
 which I will show you how to fold 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.099
 the correct cross on the yellow layer is that 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.290
 are guys cross and you already only know 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.529
 on white it is the same cross current 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.509
 on a yellow net that's pulled out like this 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.610
 when here is a yellow cross and here 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.530
 you get a yellow cube yellow orange 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.540
 all yellow to yellow center orange 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.120
 karanji we are so with every pupils not 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.370
 can so yellow red red yellow 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.890
 yellow and here here is green green 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.030
 yellow to yellow in this this is called 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:53.150
 correct cross yellow green 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.690
 yellow yellow center that's how we 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.860
 collect first we have to put all 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.650
 cubes in yellow up that is here 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.040
 we have two dice they are not flipped 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:10.220
 if they stand next to 11 here another 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.500
 here it is good lucky you 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.920
 If you take it like that, he also does it 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.370
 one form is not very difficult 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 a formula like this is like my body 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.310
 a cube that will stand in yellow never have 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.150
 god we set so that one becomes with 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.180
 right side 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.390
 and the other was on the left side 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:43.040
 no, that's how it is, this is how we are doing 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:45.979
 such a form 1 1 2 3 4 8 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.369
 here they are already worth seeing 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.830
 beside 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.750
 that is, this is how we go form 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.510
 this cube is changing with this one 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.729
 in places 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.890
 it means only we put them side by side 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.670
 we have to put them yellow to yellow 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.979
 center we take one cube 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.100
 looked yellow colors have a different 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.420
 looked yellow up here yellow to 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.239
 us this yellow to up and do the most 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.219
 simple fours that we did then 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.250
 when still put here these corners 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:22.360
 here on this place 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.620
 do one four here one two three 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.410
 four we made 1 4 see that from here y 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.540
 we are gone a couple of white strong 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.870
 red she faded she red 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.940
 vault visibility in the lower right we 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.350
 take a garden cube after one four and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.160
 we turn it so that this white one 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.160
 the color was left again the fight 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:49.209
 it is white at the back and we do it again so you 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.790
 so here again is 4 couples have the right 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.680
 bottom corner and we again take and put in 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.050
 top left corner and so this white 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:02.260
 I looked to the left here and I'm so vyzhzhesh 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.290
 foursome so she became the place and we 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.880
 We look now at us all cubes look 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.520
 yellow up and white side 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.870
 ideally collected if you have a bellator 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.790
 they gather you did something 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.150
 wrong you can cube back 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.260
 knead thoroughly disassemble it and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.930
 try to put it all over again then what 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.480
 you will learn 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.870
 so on we need to put some cubes 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.730
 so they sat down here like these two here then 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.799
 have their center not been under 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.470
 yellow-green to yellow yellow center 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.390
 green green yellow red too 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.090
 all yellow to yellow center red 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.150
 paints left to put two on 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.280
 yellow-orange to its place and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.650
 yellow-blue that's it 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.480
 make this formula which we did 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.120
 he started back in excellent for memory here 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.209
 here we are to swap these 2 dice 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.480
 put them so that one was on the back 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.730
 on the back side here's another would be here 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.090
 sent to store and make this form 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:08.709
 asses here another here nothing 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:10.239
 make this form 1 to 3 here is the form they 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.579
 very complex formula that they 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.829
 seem the first time here I am 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.250
 taught their classmates did not speak 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.390
 that it seems like the form is remembered once 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.140
 Thank you all for your attention
