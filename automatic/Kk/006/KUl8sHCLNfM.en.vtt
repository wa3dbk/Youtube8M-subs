00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.919
 very good to everyone today against the fox in 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.450
 this video I'm going to show you the 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.399
 strategy that we have used to 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.070
 kill scola without harm since as 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.330
 you know this week have removed the 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.280
 modifiers or have changed the 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.320
 modifiers of schools and have deleted 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.910
 all kinds of burns we do not have 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.100
 sunburn we do not have that box of 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.840
 arch and we do not have vacuum burn with 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.400
 which is quite complicated to kill 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.920
 schools but well not so much 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.450
 we have taken two attempts the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.600
 first test and the second has already 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.340
 been the good and good because I teach you the 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.020
 strategy that we have followed the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.570
 modifiers that are currently in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.980
 because they are rowdy and that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.710
 increases the power the body attacks to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.720
 body and special juggler that we do not 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.610
 Give ammunition that we have equipped 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.200
 as we have done for metra 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.780
 choirs so good in what we have done 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.309
 is to go out to the arena of schools and once 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.170
 that we went out to the arena we killed 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.239
 servant directing us towards 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.620
 left as we normally did 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.899
 we shot a gala gala pair for 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.610
 try to make Scola stay still but 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.820
 well as you have seen, it does not stay 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.320
 too quiet then well in 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.949
 you can sitges for me with fuck no 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.600
 you can not shoot 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.329
 as you want if we have already removed 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.460
 quite a lot of life, so we better 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.469
 we have fired with a job here as 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 you have seen our companions killed 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.880
 then if they had not killed our 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.659
 fellow he also would have come to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.979
 this area and well as I have not been killed 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.110
 what we have to do is in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.819
 reanimate and re- regroup us in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.679
 this area because we come to this area 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.630
 Well, because we're going to have a good 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.340
 servant of those who give him the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 protection of escolas well over here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 close that we're going to have to destroy 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.090
 to start shooting the tails already a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.009
 little more seriously once as you go 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
 to see as he revived my partner and we 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.700
 we go to that area and the only thing 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.729
 we have to do what we are going to do 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 is to destroy the servant there is once 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.689
 we have destroyed the servant we started 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.799
 shoot schools and he kong to the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.780
 seriously young 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.659
 to destroy the links with the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.489
 sentinels and to try to kill what 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.860
 It's going to be good that good 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:05.310
 mine will always come out and apart from 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.200
 all the enemies these the acolytes of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.350
 schools in which, as you can see, they are 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 around here touching us the eggs and 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.860
 it's good that things are going to put us 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 a little difficult then that mind 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.599
 for it then once we break the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.940
 links with schools as you will see 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.340
 the mines are going to start 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.470
 the hunter always recommend that there 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.410
 a hunter later you have to go for 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.450
 the mines and once they start to come out 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.280
 the mines that the hunter leaves and the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.860
 rest of colleagues because we will be here 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.400
 let's throw it is gala horne to schools 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.650
 and well then surely not 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 let's get him killed the first time 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.239
 it's tails have enough life and like 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.190
 you see we do little damage then what 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.380
 we have is to understand the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.569
 colleagues to continue to exploit the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.720
 rest of mines and to pass us the poison 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.040
 as he does not have much more I prefer 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.930
 listen to the comments live 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.489

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.630

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.400
