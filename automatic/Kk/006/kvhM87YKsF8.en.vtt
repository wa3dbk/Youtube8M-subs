00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 my name is andrew this is my first video in 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 I will show my releases 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.840
 problems of technology and with their elimination well 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.480
 namely the technique this motorcycle machine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 moped impressive doing on 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.770
 today and pinned down from 5 to 50 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.480
 cubic centimeters push pull 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.300
 engine 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.269
 the owner complains that when he gives 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.769
 more turns on begin to stall 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.000
 Now we will check it provided 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.000
 would have to understand 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 even start up 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.790
 here's a mock gas thrown to you it starts 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:05.110
 so maybe first of all guys 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 always watch the fuel filter because 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.280
 that they are very often clogged and 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 then all sorts of different problems begin 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.479
 maybe clogged through a carburetor 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:23.650
 Now to understand this and so 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.200
 we looked at the fuel filter 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.899
 normal chistik that is this problem 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.430
 absolutely no fuel through for 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.440
 the problem may still be airborne 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.420
 filter or not enough 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.660
 air or here's how let's say a common 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.290
 broken this filter is configured here 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.759
 this bolt and that is at the institution 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.380
 motor start to twist 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.020
 but now the uterus is there again a little bit 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 another place we find such a suitable 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.119
 thin screwdriver and continue the video 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.600
 now and try to set up 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.080
 here is this bolt screwdriver such a tank 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 found therefore we then do scissors that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.799
 name is muted 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.770
 and 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.320
 we 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.370
 nobody was 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.849
 we made this bolt just close it 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:04:04.040
 on a few turns 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:06.230
 it was necessary to go to the service now and 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.180
 finish not even said how much like this 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.250
 but in principle, I also put on the eye that 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.310
 twist the end of the bolt and then a couple 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.709
 twisted and wanted on the radio like that again 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.370
 instituted allison will not start 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.900
 try to wind up little by little 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.800
 nothing this problem can be in 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.130
 air filter is desirable after which 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.139
 fuel filter may be clogged 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.570
 as I said in the form of the unit no 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.160
 fuel filter might have to 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.900
 now I can disassemble this puncher 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.600
 did without it thanks 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:47.419
 subscribe to my channel my channel 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:49.780
 will be called garage life and everything on 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.780
 Today
