the reactions are good has also a chance

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.039 
the reactions are good has also a chance
in<00:01:07.520> Europe<00:01:07.880> that's<00:01:08.890> in<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.100> future<00:01:10.490> yeah

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
from very very logic and the way the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.830 
from very very logic and the way the
lines<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.590> hood<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:12.190> bonnet<00:03:12.550> are

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
lines of the hood the bonnet are

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.990 
lines of the hood the bonnet are
combined<00:03:13.840> into<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.380> architecture<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
combined into the architecture of the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.120 
combined into the architecture of the
front<00:03:16.330> all<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:18.239> logic<00:03:19.239> grid<00:03:20.130> so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
front all of this is a logic grid so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.420 
front all of this is a logic grid so
this<00:03:21.820> gives<00:03:22.570> us<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:23.140> timeless<00:03:23.830> approach

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
this gives us a timeless approach

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.290 
this gives us a timeless approach
the<00:03:25.940> front<00:03:26.240> and<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.410> whole<00:03:27.590> car<00:03:27.860> all<00:03:28.819> lines

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
the front and the whole car all lines

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.540 
the front and the whole car all lines
have<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.920> reason<00:03:30.970> is<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.150> reason<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.630> exist<00:03:32.990> and
