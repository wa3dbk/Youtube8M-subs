this signal boost dt dual-band cellular
pcs<00:01:15.540> amplifier<00:01:16.470> system<00:01:17.060> so<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.960> i<00:01:19.049> was<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
pcs amplifier system so if i was a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.109 
pcs amplifier system so if i was a
mouthful<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> lengthy

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
mouthful but you can see the lengthy

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.289 
mouthful but you can see the lengthy
table<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> contents<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.670> i<00:01:23.670> guess<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.090> is

table of contents and i guess this is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.570 
table of contents and i guess this is
gonna<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.720> bible<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.770> i<00:01:25.890> go<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.159> set<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
gonna be my bible when i go to set this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
gonna be my bible when i go to set this
up<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> first<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.170> I've<00:01:28.380> actually

sets of coaxial cables pretty sure that
goes<00:01:49.530> into<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.540> signal<00:01:51.540> range<00:01:52.439> booster<00:01:53.009> unit

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
goes into the signal range booster unit

goes into the signal range booster unit
things<00:01:54.479> that's<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> lets<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:56.280> over

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
things that's you lets you can see over

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.060 
things that's you lets you can see over
there<00:01:56.990> which<00:01:57.990> we'll<00:01:58.229> look<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.860> minute

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
there which we'll look at in a minute

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.230 
there which we'll look at in a minute
but<00:01:59.219> set<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:01.880> inside<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.090> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
but set that to the side inside of here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.160 
but set that to the side inside of here
you<00:02:03.390> can<00:02:03.570> probably<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
you can probably see that

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.529 
you can probably see that
that<00:02:06.170> AC<00:02:06.500> adapter<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.820> then<00:02:07.970> some<00:02:08.270> kind<00:02:08.479> of

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
that AC adapter and then some kind of

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.389 
that AC adapter and then some kind of
shield<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.990> guess<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.560> looks<00:02:09.590> like<00:02:09.950> this<00:02:10.130> they

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
shield I guess it looks like this they

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.520 
shield I guess it looks like this they
want<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.880> set<00:02:11.090> this<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.420> outside<00:02:11.870> or<00:02:12.200> or

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
want you to set this up outside or or

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.260 
want you to set this up outside or or
mount<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.340> wall<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.610> something<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.209> I'm

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
mount it to a wall or something so I'm

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.309 
mount it to a wall or something so I'm
going<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.480> take<00:02:14.569> a<00:02:14.630> look<00:02:14.750> at<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:14.959> but<00:02:15.140> that's

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
going to take a look at that but that's

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.480 
going to take a look at that but that's
what<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.470> looks<00:02:15.650> like<00:02:15.770> you<00:02:15.890> could<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.040> to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
what it looks like you could have to

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.870 
what it looks like you could have to
shove<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.990> those<00:02:18.170> things<00:02:18.470> inside<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.640> here

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
shove one of those things inside of here

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.100 
shove one of those things inside of here
and<00:02:20.060> set<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.770> set<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.860> up<00:02:21.950> on<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> wall<00:02:22.310> so

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
and set it up to set it up on a wall so

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.750 
and set it up to set it up on a wall so
put<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.230> over<00:02:24.350> there<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.950> let's<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.430> take

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
put that over there and let's just take

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.590 
put that over there and let's just take
a<00:02:25.790> look<00:02:26.030> at<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.330> actual<00:02:26.690> boosters<00:02:27.680> real<00:02:28.310> quick

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
a look at the actual boosters real quick

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.530 
a look at the actual boosters real quick
one<00:02:29.600> is<00:02:29.750> bigger<00:02:30.110> mostly<00:02:31.010> bigger<00:02:31.489> than<00:02:31.730> any

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
one is bigger mostly bigger than any

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.050 
one is bigger mostly bigger than any
other<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.069> said<00:02:34.220> I'm<00:02:34.370> not<00:02:34.400> too<00:02:34.880> familiar

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
other like I said I'm not too familiar

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.620 
other like I said I'm not too familiar
with<00:02:35.390> stuff<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:36.050> this<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.000> definitely<00:02:38.000> gonna

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
with stuff like this so definitely gonna

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.270 
with stuff like this so definitely gonna
be<00:02:38.959> interesting<00:02:39.650> setting<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.459> in

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
be interesting setting this up in

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.160 
be interesting setting this up in
getting<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.459> work<00:02:43.930> because<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.110> do

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
getting it to work because I do

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.780 
getting it to work because I do
desperately<00:02:45.890> need<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.640> see<00:02:46.760> if

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
desperately need it and I want to see if

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.370 
desperately need it and I want to see if
it<00:02:47.030> does<00:02:47.209> work<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.660> look<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:47.900> about<00:02:48.080> two<00:02:48.260> or

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it does work you look at about two or

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.710 
it does work you look at about two or
three<00:02:48.560> bars<00:02:48.769> outside<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.310> house<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:50.000> if<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.569> can

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
three bars outside the house so if I can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.800 
three bars outside the house so if I can
get<00:02:50.810> that<00:02:50.959> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.319> range<00:02:51.530> extension<00:02:52.810> inside

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
get that kind of range extension inside

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.850 
get that kind of range extension inside
the<00:02:53.989> house<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.319> can<00:02:54.380> get<00:02:54.560> that<00:02:54.650> kind<00:02:54.830> of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
the house so I can get that kind of

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.500 
the house so I can get that kind of
signal<00:02:55.160> inside<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.519> house<00:02:55.640> that<00:02:56.239> will<00:02:56.360> be

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
signal inside the house that will be

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.559 
signal inside the house that will be
good<00:02:57.440> because<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:57.980> drop<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:58.730> of<00:02:58.940> course<00:02:59.180> and

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
good because I drop a lot of course and

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.900 
good because I drop a lot of course and
then<00:03:00.440> there's<00:03:00.680> this<00:03:00.980> thing<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.670> I'm<00:03:01.730> not
