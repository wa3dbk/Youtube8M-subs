00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that you're born with if you've got it

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.140 
that you're born with if you've got it
you've<00:00:32.369> got<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:33.449> you<00:00:33.600> don't<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.559> know

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
you've got it if you don't you know

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.020 
you've got it if you don't you know
however<00:00:36.150> I<00:00:36.480> don't<00:00:37.379> see<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:38.030> is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
however I don't see it that way is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.759 
however I don't see it that way is
everyone<00:00:39.300> capable<00:00:39.839> of<00:00:39.930> painting<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> Mona<00:00:40.470> Lisa

00:00:40.759 --> 00:00:40.769 
everyone capable of painting a Mona Lisa

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.229 
everyone capable of painting a Mona Lisa
or<00:00:40.949> designing<00:00:41.730> sports<00:00:42.120> car<00:00:42.680> probably<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.239> but

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
or designing sports car probably not but

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.520 
or designing sports car probably not but
I<00:00:45.330> think<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.690> everyone<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> capacity

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
I think that everyone has the capacity

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.530 
I think that everyone has the capacity
to<00:00:47.040> be<00:00:47.489> creative<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.000> some<00:00:48.239> way<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:51.420> official

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
to be creative in some way the official

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.630 
to be creative in some way the official
definition<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> creativity<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.460> ability

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
definition of creativity is the ability

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.810 
definition of creativity is the ability
to<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.570> new<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.050> or<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> new<00:00:56.670> ideas

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
to make new things or think of new ideas

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.680 
to make new things or think of new ideas
we<00:00:57.329> most<00:00:57.570> often<00:00:57.840> associate<00:00:58.530> creativity<00:00:59.250> with

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
we most often associate creativity with

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.040 
we most often associate creativity with
art<00:01:00.690> drawing<00:01:01.379> painting<00:01:01.739> etc<00:01:02.780> but<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.840> think

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
art drawing painting etc but I think

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.690 
art drawing painting etc but I think
that<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.289> can<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.500> found<00:01:04.649> in<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.160> of<00:01:05.309> areas

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
that it can be found in a lot of areas

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.330 
that it can be found in a lot of areas
besides<00:01:06.060> those<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:07.320> example<00:01:07.740> people<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.220> be

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
besides those for example people can be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190 
besides those for example people can be
creative<00:01:08.729> when<00:01:08.850> playing<00:01:09.180> music<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.780> writing

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
creative when playing music or writing

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
creative when playing music or writing
songs<00:01:10.640> people<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.850> be<00:01:11.880> creative<00:01:12.509> when

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
songs people can be creative when

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.950 
songs people can be creative when
writing<00:01:13.350> books<00:01:13.740> poetry<00:01:14.399> or<00:01:14.910> short<00:01:15.630> stories

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
writing books poetry or short stories

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560 
writing books poetry or short stories
crafts<00:01:16.619> scrapbooks<00:01:17.340> basically<00:01:18.240> anything

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
crafts scrapbooks basically anything

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.029 
crafts scrapbooks basically anything
which<00:01:19.050> you<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.289> creating<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:19.860> making

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
which you are creating or making

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.880 
which you are creating or making
something<00:01:20.429> is<00:01:20.759> an<00:01:20.880> outlet<00:01:21.149> for<00:01:21.179> creativity

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
something is an outlet for creativity

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.270 
something is an outlet for creativity
but<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.550> some<00:01:23.820> people<00:01:23.850> enjoy

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
but I think that some people enjoy

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
but I think that some people enjoy
certain<00:01:26.280> outlets<00:01:26.789> more<00:01:27.090> than<00:01:27.209> they<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.390> others

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
certain outlets more than they do others

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
certain outlets more than they do others
my<00:01:28.229> dad<00:01:28.470> for<00:01:28.740> example<00:01:29.190> even<00:01:29.700> though<00:01:29.880> he

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
my dad for example even though he

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.820 
my dad for example even though he
doesn't<00:01:30.149> do<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.660> art<00:01:30.990> stuff<00:01:31.349> like

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
doesn't do a lot of art stuff like

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.309 
doesn't do a lot of art stuff like
drawing<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:32.399> painting<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.209> he<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
drawing and painting and all that he is

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.930 
drawing and painting and all that he is
really<00:01:34.770> good<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.099> playing<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.459> piano<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
really good at playing the piano and

really good at playing the piano and
making<00:01:36.209> music<00:01:36.599> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.470> even<00:01:37.800> see<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.099> being

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
making music and I even see him being

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.279 
making music and I even see him being
creative<00:01:38.759> sometimes<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.450> how<00:01:39.539> he<00:01:39.599> builds<00:01:40.140> his

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
creative sometimes and how he builds his

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.320 
creative sometimes and how he builds his
software<00:01:40.619> programs<00:01:41.099> though<00:01:41.789> he<00:01:42.179> probably

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
software programs though he probably

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.260 
software programs though he probably
doesn't<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.989> it<00:01:43.140> exactly<00:01:43.800> like<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.270> I

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
doesn't think of it exactly like that I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.690 
doesn't think of it exactly like that I
think<00:01:45.899> he<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.140> sometimes<00:01:46.950> people<00:01:47.459> are<00:01:47.550> more

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
think he is sometimes people are more

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
think he is sometimes people are more
creative<00:01:47.940> than<00:01:48.149> they<00:01:48.360> give<00:01:48.479> themselves

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
creative than they give themselves

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.990 
creative than they give themselves
credit<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.410> so<00:01:49.950> how<00:01:50.069> do<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.369> become<00:01:50.550> creative

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
credit for so how do you become creative

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
credit for so how do you become creative
I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.289> just<00:01:52.440> have<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.709> try<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.550> might

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
I think you just have to try you might

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
I think you just have to try you might
not<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.179> best<00:01:54.390> artist<00:01:54.810> but<00:01:55.440> you<00:01:55.590> don't

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
not be the best artist but you don't

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.949 
not be the best artist but you don't
have<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> might<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.750> able<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
have to be and you might not be able to

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.550 
have to be and you might not be able to
have<00:01:58.709> a<00:01:58.739> job<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.610> doing<00:01:59.940> art<00:02:00.179> but<00:02:00.630> again<00:02:01.289> you
