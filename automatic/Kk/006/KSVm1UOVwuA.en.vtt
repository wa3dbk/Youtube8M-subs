00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
this point I was hoping that guy would
come<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.030> night<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:40.110> didn't<00:01:40.320> come

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
this is one of the most botched supers

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600 
this is one of the most botched supers
in<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> world<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.740> hard<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:53.009> anything<00:01:53.250> here

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
we need to start thinking about going

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.040 
we need to start thinking about going
inside<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.820> pretty<00:02:06.210> scary<00:02:06.840> area

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
inside because this is pretty scary area

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
inside because this is pretty scary area
staying<00:02:10.050> topside<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> map<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.340> blind

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
staying topside on a map like blind

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.840

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
watch you're not going to be in for good

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.460 
watch you're not going to be in for good
because<00:02:14.150> there's<00:02:14.300> way<00:02:14.450> too<00:02:14.480> many<00:02:14.690> angles<00:02:15.020> so

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
because there's way too many angles so

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.960 
because there's way too many angles so
right<00:02:15.620> here<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.860> gotta<00:02:16.070> slow<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.430> just<00:02:16.820> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
right here I gotta slow it down just a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.560 
right here I gotta slow it down just a
second<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.420> see<00:02:17.510> some<00:02:18.610> luck<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.850> place<00:02:20.210> right

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
second and see some luck in place right

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.150 
second and see some luck in place right
there<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.990> saw<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.620> there<00:02:21.770> was<00:02:21.860> actually

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
there I saw that there was actually

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.190 
there I saw that there was actually
someone<00:02:22.340> on<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.520> radar<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.940> my<00:02:23.000> left<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.960> took

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
someone on the radar on my left it took

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.660 
someone on the radar on my left it took
still<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> little<00:02:24.980> bit<00:02:25.130> of<00:02:25.160> time<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.520> me<00:02:25.580> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
still a little bit of time for me to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.980 
still a little bit of time for me to
react<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.090> but<00:02:26.270> I<00:02:26.300> got<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> hell<00:02:26.810> out<00:02:26.960> of

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
react to it but I got the hell out of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.810 
react to it but I got the hell out of
there<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.650> only<00:02:27.830> reason<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.280> survived<00:02:28.640> was

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
there and the only reason I survived was

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.790 
there and the only reason I survived was
because<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.150> guy<00:02:29.240> was<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.510> mid<00:02:29.690> sprint<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.230> he

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
because the guy was in mid sprint and he

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.020 
because the guy was in mid sprint and he
didn't<00:02:31.010> pull<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.220> trigger<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.580> that<00:02:31.670> shotgun

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
didn't pull the trigger on that shotgun

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.570 
didn't pull the trigger on that shotgun
that<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.690> extremely<00:02:33.170> fortunate<00:02:33.440> round<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
that was extremely fortunate round the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.430 
that was extremely fortunate round the
Run<00:02:35.060> was<00:02:35.240> almost<00:02:35.600> over<00:02:35.930> there<00:02:36.050> just<00:02:36.260> because

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
Run was almost over there just because

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.590 
Run was almost over there just because
of<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.710> it's<00:02:37.250> right<00:02:37.370> here<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.760> know<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.450> guys
