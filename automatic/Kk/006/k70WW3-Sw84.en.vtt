way<00:00:58.050> you're<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> saddle<00:00:59.100> is

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
way you're going to get a saddle is

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
way you're going to get a saddle is
going<00:01:01.199> dungeons<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.609> those<00:01:03.149> kind<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> saddles

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
going dungeons but those kind of saddles

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:14.350 
going dungeons but those kind of saddles
only<00:01:04.110> work<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:05.119> pigs<00:01:06.200> I'm<00:01:07.200> reckoning<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:10.939> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.240 

mo<00:01:15.360> creature<00:01:15.720> saddles<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.920> called<00:01:17.130> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
mo creature saddles which is called a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.270 
mo creature saddles which is called a
horse<00:01:17.490> saddle<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> works<00:01:20.100> on

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
horse saddle I think all it works on

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.450 
horse saddle I think all it works on
forces<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.049> guess<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> say<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
forces so I guess you can say this as a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.060 
forces so I guess you can say this as a
horse<00:01:23.790> saddle<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> need<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
horse saddle so what you need is the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
horse saddle so what you need is the
crafting<00:01:26.490> box<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.840> then<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.200> five

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
crafting box and then you get five

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
crafting box and then you get five
pieces<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.979> leather<00:01:29.250> leather<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.840> put<00:01:31.020> them

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pieces of leather leather and put them

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.770 
pieces of leather leather and put them
on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.409> outside<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.640> makes<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.210> helmet<00:01:33.600> or

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
on the outside which makes a helmet or

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.560 
on the outside which makes a helmet or
leather<00:01:34.470> cap<00:01:35.119> but<00:01:36.119> you're<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.420> put

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
leather cap but you're going to put

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.280 
leather cap but you're going to put
three<00:01:37.079> iron<00:01:37.380> ingots<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.689> makes<00:01:40.140> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
three iron ingots in here and makes a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.450 
three iron ingots in here and makes a
horse<00:01:40.650> saddle

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
horse saddle

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.030

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
horse and you got your books but your

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.369 
horse and you got your books but your
are<00:02:33.379> going<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.769> have<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.040> build<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.849> stable<00:02:35.510> type

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
are going to have to build a stable type

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.420 
are going to have to build a stable type
structure<00:02:37.690> for<00:02:38.690> your<00:02:38.720> horse<00:02:39.290> because<00:02:40.099> if<00:02:40.340> you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
structure for your horse because if you

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.199 
structure for your horse because if you
don't<00:02:40.610> it<00:02:41.120> will<00:02:42.049> wander<00:02:42.470> off<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.090> leave<00:02:44.090> you

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
don't it will wander off and leave you

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.680 
don't it will wander off and leave you
which<00:02:47.209> is<00:02:47.769> what<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.799> think<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> bad<00:02:49.489> part<00:02:49.849> but

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
which is what I think is a bad part but

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.250 
which is what I think is a bad part but
over<00:02:50.989> here<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.650> see

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.250 

I<00:02:59.150> found<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.360> horse<00:03:00.629> I<00:03:02.269> got<00:03:03.269> an<00:03:03.390> apple<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.930> fed

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
I found the horse I got an apple I fed

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.069 
I found the horse I got an apple I fed
him<00:03:04.379> named<00:03:05.099> them<00:03:05.310> brownie<00:03:05.629> not<00:03:06.629> a<00:03:06.659> really<00:03:06.930> good

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
him named them brownie not a really good

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.020 
him named them brownie not a really good
name<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.500> still<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.400> put<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.640> settle

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
name but still and then I put the settle

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.880 
name but still and then I put the settle
on<00:03:12.150> them<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.360> know<00:03:12.569> he<00:03:12.750> might

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.320 

that's<00:03:17.300> my<00:03:18.300> own<00:03:18.569> table<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:20.030> then<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.150> come

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
that's my own table for you then we come

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.780 
that's my own table for you then we come
over<00:03:21.480> here<00:03:21.959> there's<00:03:22.830> different<00:03:23.220> types<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
over here there's different types of

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.910 
over here there's different types of
courses<00:03:24.180> there's<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.720> kind<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.989> horse<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
courses there's that kind of horse and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.369 
courses there's that kind of horse and
then<00:03:26.040> there's<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.580> think<00:03:27.540> that's<00:03:27.750> not<00:03:28.110> there

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379

and then a unicorn and pegasus there

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.790 
and then a unicorn and pegasus there

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
might be a different kind of nightmare

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.100 
might be a different kind of nightmare
