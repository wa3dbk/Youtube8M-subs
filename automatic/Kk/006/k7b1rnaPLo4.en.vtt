00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
difference between snapping punches and

difference between snapping punches and
pushing<00:00:06.330> punches<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.870> think<00:00:07.410> many<00:00:07.620> people

pushing punches I think many people
don't<00:00:09.210> understand<00:00:09.690> how<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.870> throw<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.139> proper

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.259 
don't understand how to throw a proper
snapping<00:00:11.070> punch<00:00:11.309> that's<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.820> truth

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
snapping punch that's the truth

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.360 
snapping punch that's the truth
they<00:00:12.599> don't<00:00:12.719> understand<00:00:13.230> how<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.860> so

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
they don't understand how to do it so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.770 
they don't understand how to do it so
they<00:00:14.490> do<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.759> wrong<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.299> then<00:00:15.450> they<00:00:15.480> do<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
they do it wrong and then they do it

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
they do it wrong and then they do it
wrong<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.560> doesn't<00:00:16.619> work<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.460> then<00:00:17.670> when

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
wrong and it doesn't work and then when

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060 
wrong and it doesn't work and then when
it<00:00:17.910> doesn't<00:00:18.090> work<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:18.900> say<00:00:19.140> pushing<00:00:19.740> punches

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
it doesn't work they say pushing punches

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.759 
it doesn't work they say pushing punches
is<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.410> in<00:00:22.410> case<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> don't

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
is better and it's not in case you don't

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
is better and it's not in case you don't
know<00:00:22.949> about<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.279> debate<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.420> sides<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
know about the debate the two sides of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.490 
know about the debate the two sides of
the<00:00:24.869> discussion

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the discussion

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.650 
the discussion
some<00:00:25.859> people<00:00:26.099> think<00:00:26.189> pushing<00:00:26.550> punches<00:00:26.910> push

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
some people think pushing punches push

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.000 
some people think pushing punches push
all<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> way<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.260> there's<00:00:28.590> more<00:00:28.740> power

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
all the way through there's more power

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.609 
all the way through there's more power
when<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.699> push<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.449> let's<00:00:30.660> say<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> hit<00:00:31.439> my

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
when you push so let's say I hit my

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.220 
when you push so let's say I hit my
target<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.300> keep<00:00:33.300> forcing<00:00:33.630> my<00:00:34.200> hand

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
target and then keep forcing my hand

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
target and then keep forcing my hand
through<00:00:34.680> even<00:00:35.130> more<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.059> pushing<00:00:36.420> punch

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
through even more that's a pushing punch

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
through even more that's a pushing punch
because<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.020> pushing<00:00:37.559> through<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
because I'm pushing through it and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.360 
because I'm pushing through it and
snapping<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> here's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> target<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
snapping is when I here's a target and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.569 
snapping is when I here's a target and
I'm<00:00:41.550> fine<00:00:42.059> after<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> impact<00:00:43.469> my<00:00:44.160> hand<00:00:44.370> comes

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I'm fine after the impact my hand comes

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.490 
I'm fine after the impact my hand comes
back<00:00:44.789> by<00:00:45.289> okay

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
back by okay

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.560 
back by okay
then<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:46.920> say<00:00:47.370> snapping<00:00:48.120> because<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
then people say snapping because it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
then people say snapping because it
releases<00:00:48.960> more<00:00:49.289> energy<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.610> your

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
releases more energy and then and your

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880 
releases more energy and then and your
hand<00:00:51.270> comes<00:00:51.510> back<00:00:51.719> as<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> relax<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.620> but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
hand comes back as you relax more but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
hand comes back as you relax more but
people<00:00:53.760> who<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.059> pushing<00:00:54.420> punches<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.930> say

people who like pushing punches will say
that<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> snap<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> power<00:00:57.809> doesn't

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that when you snap it the power doesn't

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.360 
that when you snap it the power doesn't
transfer<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:58.829> pulling<00:00:59.039> your

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
transfer because you're pulling your

it doesn't hit with the same way you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.649 
it doesn't hit with the same way you
know<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:39.350> like<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.680> my<00:01:39.710> mind<00:01:40.510> okay

know it's just like in my mind okay
told<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.440> have<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.799> let<00:01:43.220> it<00:01:43.250> go<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.150> to

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
told you you have to let it go for it to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.420 
told you you have to let it go for it to
fully<00:01:44.659> impact<00:01:45.140> with<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.770> full<00:01:46.009> speed<00:01:46.310> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
fully impact with the full speed and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.120 
fully impact with the full speed and
power<00:01:46.670> when<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.030> release<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.750> has<00:01:48.500> more<00:01:48.799> speed

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
power when you release it has more speed

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.550 
power when you release it has more speed
when<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.030> release<00:01:50.420> you're<00:01:50.930> letting<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
when you release you're letting the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.130 
when you release you're letting the
energy<00:01:52.000> transfer<00:01:53.000> when<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.479> hang<00:01:53.720> on<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.050> it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
energy transfer when you hang on to it

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.749 
energy transfer when you hang on to it
all<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.590> tension<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:55.190> you're<00:01:55.369> hanging<00:01:55.520> on

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
all that tension that you're hanging on

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.790 
all that tension that you're hanging on
to<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.180> you're<00:01:56.630> keeping<00:01:57.050> within<00:01:57.259> yourself

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
to it you you're keeping within yourself

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.359 
to it you you're keeping within yourself
yes<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.610> are<00:01:58.759> applying<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.390> force<00:01:59.630> at<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
yes you are applying this force at the

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.740 
yes you are applying this force at the
object<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:01.820> yet<00:02:02.119> because<00:02:02.509> you're<00:02:02.630> not

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
object but yet because you're not

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.660 
object but yet because you're not
releasing<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.530> not<00:02:03.740> it's<00:02:04.369> not<00:02:04.520> an

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
releasing it's not it's not an

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.780 
releasing it's not it's not an
instantaneous<00:02:05.180> hit<00:02:05.570> it's<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:06.580> that's<00:02:07.580> what

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
instantaneous hit it's like that's what

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.999 
instantaneous hit it's like that's what
that's<00:02:07.970> what<00:02:08.090> you're<00:02:08.209> doing<00:02:08.330> okay<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.769> snap

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
that's what you're doing okay the snap

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.100 
that's what you're doing okay the snap
has<00:02:10.160> already<00:02:10.429> happened<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.910> now<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.750> extra

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
has already happened and now that extra

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.840 
has already happened and now that extra
push<00:02:12.350> that<00:02:12.560> you're<00:02:12.680> doing<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.160> you're<00:02:13.820> just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
push that you're doing is you're just

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.300 
push that you're doing is you're just
trying<00:02:14.269> to<00:02:14.390> push<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:15.019> further<00:02:15.200> that's<00:02:16.010> all<00:02:16.160> it

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
trying to push it further that's all it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.990 
trying to push it further that's all it
is<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:17.330> second<00:02:17.750> thing<00:02:17.959> is<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:19.489> snapping

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
is the second thing is the snapping

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.240 
is the second thing is the snapping
effect<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.900> many<00:02:21.110> people<00:02:21.170> think<00:02:21.530> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
effect you know many people think to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.160 
effect you know many people think to
snap<00:02:22.519> is<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.910> go<00:02:23.060> forwards<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.900> backwards

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
snap is to go forwards and backwards

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.930 
snap is to go forwards and backwards
they<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:24.680> snap<00:02:24.890> means<00:02:25.130> you're<00:02:25.220> going<00:02:25.400> good

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
they think snap means you're going good

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.240 
they think snap means you're going good
like<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:26.870> letting<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.290> go<00:02:27.440> for<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:27.890> pulling

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
like I'm letting it go for I'm pulling

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.309 
like I'm letting it go for I'm pulling
back<00:02:28.280> no<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.660> not<00:02:29.780> snapping<00:02:30.200> at

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
back no this is this is not snapping at

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.780 
back no this is this is not snapping at
it<00:02:30.440> if<00:02:30.530> you<00:02:30.620> have<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.860> pull<00:02:31.130> your<00:02:31.280> hands<00:02:31.519> back

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
it if you have to pull your hands back

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.750 
it if you have to pull your hands back
that's<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.630> snapping<00:02:33.050> punch<00:02:33.459> there's<00:02:34.459> only

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
that's not a snapping punch there's only

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.920 
that's not a snapping punch there's only
one<00:02:35.209> move

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
one move

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.600 
one move
okay<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.260> don't<00:02:36.500> even<00:02:36.620> think<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.400> just

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
okay I don't even think for it I just

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.740 
okay I don't even think for it I just
think<00:02:37.790> explode<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.860> hey<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:41.239> hand<00:02:41.480> comes

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
think explode just hey the hand comes

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.470 
think explode just hey the hand comes
back<00:02:42.079> because<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.709> exploded<00:02:43.310> my<00:02:43.610> hand<00:02:43.850> so<00:02:44.209> hard

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
back because I exploded my hand so hard

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.620 
back because I exploded my hand so hard
at<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.870> bag<00:02:45.079> that<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.920> or<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.880> object<00:02:47.360> that

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
at the bag that the or the object that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.170 
at the bag that the or the object that
the<00:02:47.780> object<00:02:48.230> bounces<00:02:48.500> my<00:02:49.010> hand<00:02:49.310> back<00:02:49.549> was

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
the object bounces my hand back was

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.690 
the object bounces my hand back was
whooshing<00:02:50.570> okay<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.709> one<00:02:51.739> movement<00:02:52.250> it's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
whooshing okay so it's one movement it's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000 
whooshing okay so it's one movement it's
not<00:02:52.970> two<00:02:53.360> movements<00:02:53.630> I'm<00:02:53.900> not<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.260> one<00:02:54.709> to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
not two movements I'm not going one to

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.250 
not two movements I'm not going one to
know<00:02:55.340> if<00:02:55.760> you're<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.299> have<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.510> pull<00:02:56.900> your<00:02:57.079> arm

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
know if you're you have to pull your arm

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.520 
know if you're you have to pull your arm
back

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
back

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190 
back
that<00:02:58.130> means<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.670> pulled<00:02:59.360> against<00:02:59.989> your

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
that means you pulled against your

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.590 
that means you pulled against your
momentum<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:01.100> forward<00:03:01.459> know<00:03:02.030> that<00:03:02.390> all

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
momentum going forward know that all

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.170 
momentum going forward know that all
your<00:03:02.959> momentum<00:03:03.290> before<00:03:03.650> release<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.610> then

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
your momentum before release and then

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.229 
your momentum before release and then
that<00:03:05.690> momentum<00:03:06.260> hits<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.890> object<00:03:07.239> transfers

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
that momentum hits the object transfers

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.440 
that momentum hits the object transfers
power<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.810> returns<00:03:09.680> your<00:03:10.010> hand<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.640> okay

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
power and returns your hand to you okay

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.620 
power and returns your hand to you okay
so<00:03:11.870> only<00:03:12.079> one<00:03:12.470> movement<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.299> is<00:03:14.450> what

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
so only one movement so this is what

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.259 
so only one movement so this is what
makes<00:03:14.870> me<00:03:15.079> faster<00:03:15.620> because<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.250> one<00:03:16.519> Batman

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
makes me faster because of one Batman

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.789 
makes me faster because of one Batman
right<00:03:18.230> right<00:03:18.730> okay<00:03:19.730> I<00:03:19.970> don't<00:03:20.420> need<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.019> go<00:03:21.140> pull

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
right right okay I don't need to go pull

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.280 
right right okay I don't need to go pull
it<00:03:21.950> back<00:03:22.100> pull<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.820> back<00:03:23.120> pull<00:03:23.359> it<00:03:23.660> back<00:03:23.930> that's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
it back pull it back pull it back that's

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.970 
it back pull it back pull it back that's
not<00:03:24.530> snapping<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:25.100> don't<00:03:25.370> even<00:03:25.430> know

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
not snapping I don't even know

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.339 
not snapping I don't even know
that's<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.780> pulling<00:03:27.780> back<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.080> early

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
that's just you pulling back to early

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.440 
that's just you pulling back to early
that's<00:03:28.739> just<00:03:28.950> not<00:03:29.129> good<00:03:29.280> technique<00:03:29.580> anyway<00:03:29.790> if

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
that's just not good technique anyway if

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.449 
that's just not good technique anyway if
you<00:03:30.599> step<00:03:30.870> hard<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.590> hand<00:03:31.799> will<00:03:31.920> return<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you step hard the hand will return to

to be literally center right here your

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.140 
to be literally center right here your
Center<00:04:22.380> could<00:04:22.530> be<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:22.919> or<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.340> send<00:04:23.550> me<00:04:23.880> here

but you're Brandon but to go like this
and<00:04:27.030> this<00:04:27.150> while<00:04:27.419> you're<00:04:27.600> punching<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.410> mean

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
and this while you're punching that mean

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.800 
and this while you're punching that mean
something<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.669> changing<00:04:30.120> your<00:04:30.210> balance<00:04:30.660> is

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
something is changing your balance is

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.080 
something is changing your balance is
being<00:04:30.990> affected<00:04:31.740> while<00:04:31.919> you're<00:04:32.130> moving<00:04:32.250> when

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
being affected while you're moving when

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.390 
being affected while you're moving when
it<00:04:33.240> doesn't<00:04:33.660> need<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.169> be<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:34.919> those<00:04:35.099> are<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
it doesn't need to be so those are the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.279 
it doesn't need to be so those are the
three<00:04:35.669> main<00:04:35.880> things<00:04:36.120> about<00:04:36.419> snapping<00:04:36.750> punches

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
three main things about snapping punches

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.860 
three main things about snapping punches
it's<00:04:37.889> about<00:04:38.160> releasing<00:04:38.760> on<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> impact<00:04:39.630> and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
it's about releasing on the impact and

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.080 
it's about releasing on the impact and
it's<00:04:40.229> about<00:04:40.380> having<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:41.039> explosion<00:04:41.700> one

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
it's about having one explosion one

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.700 
it's about having one explosion one
movement<00:04:42.660> when<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:42.960> throw<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.289> punch<00:04:43.440> it's

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
movement when you throw the punch it's

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.620 
movement when you throw the punch it's
not<00:04:43.830> about<00:04:44.010> punching<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.880> pulling<00:04:45.210> it's<00:04:45.450> not

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
not about punching and pulling it's not

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.159 
not about punching and pulling it's not
that<00:04:45.810> at<00:04:45.930> all

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
that at all

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.930 
that at all
and<00:04:46.260> the<00:04:46.590> third<00:04:46.800> thing<00:04:46.979> is<00:04:47.039> it's<00:04:47.490> about<00:04:47.760> your

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
and the third thing is it's about your

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.700 
and the third thing is it's about your
balance<00:04:48.360> how<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.570> look<00:04:48.900> at<00:04:49.080> balance<00:04:49.289> while

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
balance how you look at balance while

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.490 
balance how you look at balance while
moving<00:04:49.979> I<00:04:50.250> mean<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> balance<00:04:51.000> while<00:04:51.150> punching

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
moving I mean a balance while punching

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.129 
moving I mean a balance while punching
so<00:04:52.500> again<00:04:53.130> I'll<00:04:53.400> say<00:04:53.669> for<00:04:54.060> for<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.960> guys

so again I'll say for for you guys
snappy<00:04:55.950> punches<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.520> more<00:04:57.030> powerful<00:04:57.570> it's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
snappy punches is more powerful it's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.310 
snappy punches is more powerful it's
faster<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:01.130> saves<00:05:02.130> energy<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:03.870> gives<00:05:04.169> you

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
faster it saves energy it gives you

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.240 
faster it saves energy it gives you
better<00:05:04.590> balance<00:05:05.300> also<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:07.530> allows<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.130> to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
better balance also it allows you to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.460 
better balance also it allows you to
throw<00:05:08.430> faster<00:05:08.940> combinations<00:05:09.599> because<00:05:10.229> think

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
throw faster combinations because think

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.430 
throw faster combinations because think
about<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.800> when<00:05:11.610> you<00:05:11.729> punch<00:05:12.060> after<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.139> impact

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
about it when you punch after the impact

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.930 
about it when you punch after the impact
is<00:05:13.530> made<00:05:13.710> if<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.070> let<00:05:14.250> your<00:05:14.400> head<00:05:14.520> come<00:05:14.550> back

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
is made if you let your head come back

is made if you let your head come back
it's<00:05:15.450> ready<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.960> throw<00:05:16.139> more<00:05:16.380> combination

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
it's ready to throw more combination

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.540 
it's ready to throw more combination
whether<00:05:17.460> you're<00:05:17.669> still<00:05:17.940> after

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
whether you're still after

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.520

another two inches and other three

inches into your opponent you're

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.260 
inches into your opponent you're
essentially<00:05:24.070> slowing<00:05:24.730> down<00:05:24.910> on<00:05:25.120> your

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
essentially slowing down on your

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.090 
essentially slowing down on your

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
accommodations because you're not

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.830 
accommodations because you're not
letting<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.550> hand<00:05:27.760> return<00:05:28.120> you're<00:05:28.420> you're

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
letting the hand return you're you're

still trying to go more forward okay

so those are the main differences

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.390 
so those are the main differences
between<00:05:34.840> snapping<00:05:35.620> punches<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.100> pushing

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
between snapping punches and pushing

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.830 
between snapping punches and pushing
punches<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:36.880> then<00:05:37.270> some<00:05:37.450> people<00:05:37.570> are<00:05:37.720> going

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
punches and then some people are going

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.660 
punches and then some people are going
to<00:05:37.900> argue<00:05:37.960> like<00:05:38.170> no<00:05:38.470> no<00:05:38.740> no<00:05:38.770> pushing<00:05:39.340> clenches

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
to argue like no no no pushing clenches

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.700 
to argue like no no no pushing clenches
can<00:05:39.820> be<00:05:39.970> better<00:05:40.150> blah<00:05:40.540> blah<00:05:40.750> blah<00:05:40.990> it's<00:05:41.530> uh
