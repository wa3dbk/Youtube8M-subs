00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
 the tail 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.030
 Lucas the game that we can not imagine 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 associated new technologies 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.060
 two master 's thesis students 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.279
 university of algarve want to change 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.869
 this idea of the same neighborhood was to know 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.869
 the project problems 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 I want to play some more shots 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.899
 I want another months many, many years 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.680
 fred and more difficult and even when 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.000
 drugs have to come back and give 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.809
 a good white is this master himself is 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.299
 Thank you to see you go there to the bottom was 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.809
 provide with the east the goals 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:03.449
 inside a hole is really difficult not 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.289
 I know it will be a tool like Ricardo 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.950
 luiz just went to see this is a taco 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:15.050
 offer barely thrown over two 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.090
 cameras and a project time that the judge 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.659
 Comcast ball has to go for what it is 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:28.100
 put one of those balls in the hole 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.100
 even without knowing practically anything and juice 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.170
 care would be to move when 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.000
 started the challenge by reducing expenses we 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.680
 and started a camera of a 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.060
 electronics strategy does not know how to play 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.010
 and not as a computer vision camera 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.720
 according to thomas ap project result was 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.030
 so good that we have a contract with 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
 a company and if ucs and that meant 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.660
 to develop and improved the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.760
 use and also develop this in the 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.460
 our leisure and whenever 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.700
 have a sound to develop the contact 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.369
 electric co2 kinect the breaks used in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.640
 microsoft ground x box 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.880
 to see with digital ex ball and more 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.010
 end the angle or put the taboo in 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.090
 match that was going to count and calculate 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.970
 trajectory 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.520
 the result is projected onto the self 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.730
 and even the effect and for reasons only 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.560
 the closes has a governed shot and that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.540
 even with due care 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.540
 I needed to still have to be improved 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.460
 the brigade is still good 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.000
 I cry and love in me 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.170
 this is more for the goal of the experienced is 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.760
 A crazy night for professionals we 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.840
 we have not yet recorded effects on 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.040
 balls that the investment caps on the ball 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.840
 I wanna ball on the table 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.270
 we will develop later 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.330
 he is already on the conditional projects 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.310
 relationships to the complex 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.970
 then a log made we have trajectories 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.280
 and have been rumbling for a long time to improve 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.130
 innovative ideas with two 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.650
 systems so the positions of the balls 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.130
 can be transmitted remotely with 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.120
 high precision could be possible that 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.910
 one or two players 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.280
 thousands of years ago the substance 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.770
 to play a game as you do with the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.920
 online games for now the system is only 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.780
 shown and beasts as structural and as 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.540
 example of the work of 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.020
 master's degree at algarve university 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:44.370
 the concept in itself is also seven that already 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.580
 is hairstyle was expensive for this reason 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.700
 without having m 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.520
 bonetti professional quality already in 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.260
 three countries as far away as China 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:58.650
 and Russia for a professional in this 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.650
 age
