00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
you can use you all-purpose saddle but

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.780 
you can use you all-purpose saddle but
to<00:00:35.900> get<00:00:36.019> in<00:00:36.199> the<00:00:36.290> pole<00:00:36.500> position<00:00:36.530> it's<00:00:37.519> quite

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
to get in the pole position it's quite

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.270

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
no tongue straps or tongue ties so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.380 
no tongue straps or tongue ties so
tights<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.580> I<00:02:58.700> think<00:02:58.970> not<00:02:59.450> allowed<00:03:01.390> no

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
tights and I think not allowed no

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.170 
tights and I think not allowed no
prickers<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.830> would<00:03:04.040> go<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.150> a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
prickers so this would go if you have a

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.260 
prickers so this would go if you have a
pony<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.840> hangs<00:03:06.440> or<00:03:06.740> looks<00:03:06.980> out<00:03:07.220> some<00:03:07.760> people

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
pony that hangs or looks out some people

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.780 
pony that hangs or looks out some people
would<00:03:09.050> put<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.260> pricker<00:03:09.740> on<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.370> side<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.610> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
would put a pricker on the side of the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.900 
would put a pricker on the side of the
bit<00:03:11.680> which<00:03:12.680> touch<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.100> horse's<00:03:13.340> mouth<00:03:13.490> so<00:03:13.550> he

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
bit which touch the horse's mouth so he

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.140 
bit which touch the horse's mouth so he
doesn't<00:03:14.240> lean<00:03:15.040> if<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.430> horse<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.670> leaning<00:03:17.060> that

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
doesn't lean if a horse is leaning that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.210 
doesn't lean if a horse is leaning that
badly<00:03:17.390> that<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.780> requires<00:03:18.080> a<00:03:18.170> pricker<00:03:18.800> I'd

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
badly that it requires a pricker I'd

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.470 
badly that it requires a pricker I'd
suggest<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.700> get<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:19.910> checked<00:03:20.030> by<00:03:20.210> the<00:03:20.240> back

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
suggest to get it checked by the back

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.090 
suggest to get it checked by the back
because<00:03:20.780> it's<00:03:20.930> probably<00:03:21.530> it's<00:03:21.710> feeling

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
because it's probably it's feeling

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.380 
because it's probably it's feeling
something<00:03:22.490> there<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.060> no<00:03:23.750> prickers<00:03:25.390> no

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
something there so no prickers no

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.230 
something there so no prickers no

um<00:03:30.430> also<00:03:31.430> we<00:03:31.640> were<00:03:31.820> talking<00:03:32.060> about<00:03:32.120> for<00:03:32.480> using

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
um also we were talking about for using

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.680 
um also we were talking about for using
a<00:03:33.050> running<00:03:33.310> martingale<00:03:34.310> bit<00:03:34.880> more<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.209> go<00:03:35.330> or

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
a running martingale bit more to go or

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.660 
a running martingale bit more to go or
an<00:03:35.810> Irish<00:03:36.140> martingale<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.220> an<00:03:37.310> Irish

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
an Irish martingale so this is an Irish

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.820 
an Irish martingale so this is an Irish
martingale<00:03:38.330> so<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:39.530> just<00:03:39.920> runs<00:03:42.970> like<00:03:43.970> that

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
martingale so it just runs like that

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.680 
martingale so it just runs like that
so<00:03:45.830> holds<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.340> reins<00:03:46.520> together<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.510> then

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
so holds the reins together and then

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.310 
so holds the reins together and then
runs<00:03:47.959> freely<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:50.390> reins<00:03:50.600> aren't<00:03:50.870> separated

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
runs freely the reins aren't separated

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.670 
runs freely the reins aren't separated
so<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.910> use<00:03:53.270> an<00:03:53.540> Irish<00:03:53.900> martingale<00:03:54.500> as

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
so you can use an Irish martingale as

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:05.410 
so you can use an Irish martingale as
well<00:03:57.550> reins<00:03:59.410> must<00:04:00.410> be<00:04:00.700> buckled<00:04:04.090> onto<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.209> bit

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
well reins must be buckled onto the bit

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.920 
well reins must be buckled onto the bit
like<00:04:06.290> so<00:04:06.680> or<00:04:07.660> can<00:04:08.660> be<00:04:08.840> stitched<00:04:09.550> but<00:04:10.780> we're<00:04:11.780> not

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
like so or can be stitched but we're not

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.360 
like so or can be stitched but we're not
allowed<00:04:13.120> billeted<00:04:14.120> reins<00:04:14.560> so<00:04:15.560> these<00:04:16.130> are

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
allowed billeted reins so these are

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.780 
allowed billeted reins so these are
billeted<00:04:16.760> reins<00:04:17.030> here<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.709> you're<00:04:19.669> not

billeted reins here and you're not

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.379 
billeted reins here and you're not
allowed<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.480> use<00:04:20.690> them<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:22.000> they're<00:04:23.000> not<00:04:23.030> safe
