the second workout here in level three
is<00:00:07.570> going<00:00:07.900> to<00:00:07.960> ship<00:00:08.140> things<00:00:08.170> up<00:00:08.590> by<00:00:08.740> changing

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
is going to ship things up by changing

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:09.990 
is going to ship things up by changing
the<00:00:09.220> scales<00:00:09.460> that<00:00:09.520> we're<00:00:09.670> going<00:00:09.760> to<00:00:09.850> play

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.370 
the scales that we're going to play
through<00:00:10.210> so<00:00:10.570> the<00:00:10.660> two<00:00:10.809> scales<00:00:11.110> are<00:00:11.200> going<00:00:11.320> to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
through so the two scales are going to

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.510 
through so the two scales are going to
pit<00:00:11.500> against<00:00:11.770> each<00:00:11.860> other<00:00:12.040> are<00:00:12.219> from<00:00:12.430> the

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:12.520 
pit against each other are from the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.699 
pit against each other are from the
melodic<00:00:13.000> minor<00:00:13.209> modal<00:00:13.719> system<00:00:14.110> we're<00:00:14.590> going

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:14.709 
melodic minor modal system we're going

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.410 
melodic minor modal system we're going
to<00:00:14.770> play<00:00:14.860> the<00:00:14.980> parent<00:00:15.250> scale<00:00:15.459> melodic<00:00:16.270> minor

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
to play the parent scale melodic minor

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.090 
to play the parent scale melodic minor
and<00:00:16.720> we're<00:00:17.080> going<00:00:17.200> to<00:00:17.260> play<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.619> fourth<00:00:17.890> mode

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
and we're going to play the fourth mode

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.830 
and we're going to play the fourth mode
which<00:00:18.280> is<00:00:18.310> Lydian<00:00:18.730> dominant<00:00:19.210> so<00:00:19.600> let's<00:00:19.720> see

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
which is Lydian dominant so let's see

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.870 
which is Lydian dominant so let's see
how<00:00:19.930> these<00:00:20.050> things<00:00:20.110> roll<00:00:20.440> out<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:21.550> blonic

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
how these things roll out the blonic

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.550 
how these things roll out the blonic
minor<00:00:22.060> scale<00:00:22.420> is<00:00:22.630> going<00:00:22.840> to<00:00:23.050> start<00:00:23.230> off<00:00:23.349> with<00:00:23.500> a

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
minor scale is going to start off with a

minor scale is going to start off with a
flat<00:00:23.890> third<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.340> that's<00:00:24.460> all<00:00:24.699> you're<00:00:24.820> going

level three but the tricky part is for

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.189 
level three but the tricky part is for
instance<00:00:58.420> when<00:00:58.539> you<00:00:58.570> go<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.870> B<00:00:58.960> string

remember you have a sharp for in the
Lydian<00:01:00.789> dominant<00:01:01.120> scale<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.629> is<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.840> one<00:01:02.050> time

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230
