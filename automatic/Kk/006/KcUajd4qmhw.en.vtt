of a dwarven mine I think that's what
we're<00:00:23.720> gonna<00:00:23.810> call<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:24.230> yeah<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:26.360> we<00:00:27.200> were<00:00:27.770> in

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
we're gonna call it yeah and we were in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.760 
we're gonna call it yeah and we were in
a<00:00:27.950> normal<00:00:28.250> fresh<00:00:28.520> world<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.380> let's<00:00:30.380> begin<00:00:30.559> so

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
a normal fresh world and let's begin so

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.280 
a normal fresh world and let's begin so
we<00:00:31.430> started<00:00:31.790> off<00:00:31.849> by<00:00:32.119> using<00:00:32.570> world<00:00:32.989> they<00:00:33.170> let

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
we started off by using world they let

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.540 
we started off by using world they let
the<00:00:33.380> brush<00:00:33.649> tool<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.300> make<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.629> sort<00:00:36.530> of<00:00:36.590> spill<00:00:37.280> I

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
the brush tool to make a sort of spill I

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.599 
the brush tool to make a sort of spill I
guess<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:37.879> could<00:00:37.969> call<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:38.180> heel<00:00:41.320> just<00:00:42.609> tells

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
guess you could call it heel just tells

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.849 
guess you could call it heel just tells
me<00:00:43.879> sorry<00:00:44.649> so<00:00:45.649> we<00:00:46.609> wanted<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.260> try<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.379> give

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
me sorry so we wanted to try and give

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.470 
me sorry so we wanted to try and give
the<00:00:49.129> impression<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:51.339> basically<00:00:52.339> natural<00:00:53.030> and

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
the impression of basically natural and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.049 
the impression of basically natural and
cliff<00:00:54.199> forming<00:00:54.649> you<00:00:55.129> know<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.519> we<00:00:55.670> also<00:00:55.789> use

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
cliff forming you know so we also use

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.579 
cliff forming you know so we also use
the<00:00:56.269> smooth<00:00:56.960> brush<00:00:57.289> to<00:00:57.620> give<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.010> nice

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
the smooth brush to give it a nice

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.479 
the smooth brush to give it a nice
because<00:01:00.589> if<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:00.890> don't<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.890> are<00:01:04.010> using<00:01:04.220> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
because if you don't we are using the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.460 
because if you don't we are using the
shaders<00:01:05.059> mod<00:01:05.089> which<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.960> why<00:01:06.140> it<00:01:06.200> looks

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
shaders mod which is why it looks

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.810 
shaders mod which is why it looks
absolutely<00:01:06.650> just<00:01:07.630> yeah<00:01:09.370> now<00:01:10.370> it's<00:01:10.550> just<00:01:10.670> an

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
absolutely just yeah now it's just an

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.149 
absolutely just yeah now it's just an
inventory<00:01:11.060> don't<00:01:11.450> mind<00:01:11.630> that<00:01:14.860> I'm<00:01:15.860> using

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
inventory don't mind that I'm using

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.870 
inventory don't mind that I'm using
creative<00:01:16.579> skin<00:01:16.909> but<00:01:17.210> that's<00:01:17.540> fine<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.759> yeah<00:01:19.759> we

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
creative skin but that's fine so yeah we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760 
creative skin but that's fine so yeah we
we<00:01:20.479> didn't<00:01:20.719> know<00:01:20.780> where<00:01:20.990> to<00:01:21.020> put<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.350> entry

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770

but we we decided that we're gonna put
the<00:01:23.930> entrance<00:01:24.350> sort<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:24.920> on<00:01:25.039> a<00:01:25.070> bit<00:01:25.369> of<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.460> cliff

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.310 

and<00:01:30.680> we're<00:01:31.100> also<00:01:31.310> using<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.390> what's<00:01:33.079> that

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and we're also using the what's that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.999 
and we're also using the what's that
time<00:01:33.740> thingy<00:01:34.250> called<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.030> other<00:01:35.990> camps<00:01:36.890> do

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
time thingy called the other camps do

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.130 
time thingy called the other camps do
you<00:01:37.189> mod<00:01:37.399> yeah<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:41.570> sort<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
you mod yeah so that's sort of the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.499 
you mod yeah so that's sort of the
entrance<00:01:42.530> taking<00:01:42.890> shape<00:01:43.189> over<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.329> left

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
entrance taking shape over on the left

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.840 
entrance taking shape over on the left
of<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.719> screen<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:48.259> I'm<00:01:48.799> building<00:01:49.369> steps

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
of the screen and I'm building steps

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.109 
of the screen and I'm building steps
because<00:01:50.420> we<00:01:50.950> well<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.070> need<00:01:52.250> steps<00:01:52.609> obviously

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
fountain I made now it was a bit of a

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.839 
fountain I made now it was a bit of a
sketchy<00:03:39.260> idea<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.010> we<00:03:40.160> went<00:03:40.310> with<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.609> knee

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
sketchy idea but we went with the knee

sketchy idea but we went with the knee
and<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.180> kind<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:42.430> goes<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:43.639> closer<00:03:43.849> it<00:03:44.269> it

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
so these are the steps that I built

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.300 
so these are the steps that I built
leading<00:04:39.930> both<00:04:40.110> left<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.530> right<00:04:40.800> also<00:04:41.190> this

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310

the lava dripping down and then you're
putting<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.440> gate<00:04:46.890> around<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.550> for<00:04:47.940> safety

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600

beautiful<00:05:03.650> my<00:05:04.650> base<00:05:04.950> of<00:05:04.980> operations<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:05.970> guess

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
beautiful my base of operations I guess

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.830 
beautiful my base of operations I guess
where<00:05:07.440> they<00:05:07.590> get<00:05:07.770> their<00:05:07.920> equipment<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:09.750> know

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
where they get their equipment you know

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.330 
where they get their equipment you know
stuff<00:05:10.140> like<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.470> I<00:05:10.590> don't<00:05:10.770> know<00:05:10.830> why<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.010> put<00:05:11.160> a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
stuff like that I don't know why I put a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.420 
stuff like that I don't know why I put a
knee<00:05:11.400> there<00:05:14.840> so<00:05:15.840> there's<00:05:16.140> wooden<00:05:16.770> planks

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
knee there so there's wooden planks
