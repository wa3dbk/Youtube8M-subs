00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 let's make the room sign the ingredients 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 they are 200 g of semolina flour then 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.980
 we have 200 g of 00 flour 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 we have a new teaspoon of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.199
 extra virgin olive oil 120 ml of milk and salt 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.750
 this is for four I am now 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.449
 let's take our family 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:46.320
 remember started with 102 100 200 of 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:48.680
 symbola and 200 100 we make ours 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.309
 once in the center 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:00.089
 we feel we'll put it back 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:08.820
 come on let's say two pinches slam 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:10.229
 stand long and we are chosen then 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.740
 we will take all our feet 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.179
 so that it becomes less central then 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.140
 take our teaspoon of oil 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.140
 extra virgin 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.049
 here it is 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.049
 [Music] 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.350
 and our milk a little fight the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 others I recommend and begin a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 realize we usually left it kg 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.819
 we give or had the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.539
 articulate duck ragout type can be 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.539
 do it in a thousand ways 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.340
 It is a paste that was very well 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:13.280
 the opening and it is a pasta that being 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:22.310
 flooded must not be a pasta that 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:26.380
 it is a different but in short we say that 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:31.670
 what makes this pasta pretty 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:39.400
 hot and similar ground flour 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:43.000
 in short, we read about 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.989
 the amount we are doing inside 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.989
 four people 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.810
 we made ourselves 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:21.050
 now we work little and then wait 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.350
 figaro that do our calculations now 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.459
 we worked our pasta we have 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.810
 of life 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:34.770
 yes because we say that it must not come 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:40.800
 too long the schalke on TV we tend to 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:45.360
 to make a roof we say rectangular yes 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:51.980
 open to a maximum length of 18 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:53.970
 centini from 15 to 18 you choose how 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.300
 brace 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:02.910
 nothing of our pastry we say that 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:07.319
 it must be a little more double than Italians 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:11.250
 in the therefore not sure to see to have 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.980
 a slight thickness we do not stretch to 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.489
 make it as rectangular as possible in 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.040
 so that when we cut it there is more 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.040
 easy to give him the player in short 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.400
 working at work here 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:35.940
 will soften you will see if you had the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.560
 grandma duck a machine do the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.380
 history is this even the areas in thickness 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.400
 do however by hand 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.090
 I can assure you is another thing and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.460
 what also good I believed 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.500
 as it strips our musculature 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.660
 not very thick 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.010
 then let's say day by day facts of others 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:13.840
 targeting the money 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:17.300
 you will then see this clearly 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.310
 handmade they are not perfect 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.810
 the beauty of letting the common go 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:27.580
 that is, to see that it is a handmade pasta 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:37.090
 wrong by hand and if to that 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 typical intersection of I think how 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:49.300
 a brace 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:49.300
 okay he said 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:06:00.460
 a few edges now we put plenty of 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.789
 flour on one side 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.280
 we receive and abundantly nice from 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:16.810
 was the appeal that when then 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:19.389
 roll up we do so 1 center 1 al 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.150
 center very well now we take the 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.800
 our beautiful knife has paraded often 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.889
 we don't put it here 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.449
 do nothing and start cutting myself 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:40.690
 I recommend you don't do too much all not 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:43.270
 they are all too much like china I say 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.370
 they are not very fast at cutting a bit 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:51.849
 of patience 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:54.340
 we have triggered noodles if 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.169
 you put on a knife falls between the 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:07:02.380
 own memory scene her face 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:12.460
 text here is when they have them 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:15.180
 we all open again we don't put them to 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.180
 to dry 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.300
 you are not just all right there is 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:23.909
 someone more 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.860
 it hurts on TV in this case I don't have 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:30.390
 put the pecorino because I 'll make them with the 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:34.890
 fish, however, we must also add a 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:37.290
 a spoonful of pecorino let's say yes a 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.710
 more or less spoon is more than that 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.710
 enough
