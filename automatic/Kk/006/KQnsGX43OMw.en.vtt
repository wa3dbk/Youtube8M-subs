00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.379
 miguel zaine as you are trying to be sure 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:08.420
 that I know your father has not you already 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.210
 I had never written a thing not 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.460
 need to be a doctor to know who has it 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.250
 or not to the zaine 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.110
 alzayani is when a person forgets 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.400
 everything until people know each other 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.210
 any pregnant bag 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.580
 And twice know that you're still 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.010
 Oz cub was better people than 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:36.640
 you see that the engineer grew educated 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.640
 even though I missed the rude floor 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:51.500
 So what I can finish and maybe 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.579
 I can explain the excuse I hope 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.390
 so because I will not repeat 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.840
 already anne by chance 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 the director has already forgotten an issue of 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.680
 charge some warning some ticket 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.930
 signed on the agenda 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.440
 Unfortunately they do not try a person with 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.540
 alzheimer and these things get heated 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
 every time it will get worse 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.900
 that is why it must commit and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.549
 pumping mail is great for my mother hers 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.470
 because she never forgetting things 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.780
 I 've already seen that profit would be 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 explain that chanel time 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.390
 hosni is a dog discipline that does 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 the person forget everything pb until memory 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.539
 intelligence exactly j 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.820
 I think that this latin disease 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:58.409
 rest assured that the disease is only 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.360
 common among older people does not 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.970
 had I finally discovered the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.470
 Cure knows of my problems I think 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.799
 The Thing Of Your Program 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.290
 This is because when you want you have 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.739
 can take a ball in the race 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.510
 The problem I wanted because if I take 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.810
 a remedy who knows for intelligence 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.819
 It's a great thing, it 's nothing to study. 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.100
 unfortunately it's not all is so simple 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.989
 so on the sidewalk for example is a 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.730
 disease that has not yet been 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:39.510
 medicine 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:43.829
 then the director will die daughter who is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.049
 this is it for the young 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.120
 the following happens I think little 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.519
 likely that the director level have this 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.230
 disease was not even agreeing with 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.320
 I I made it clear at the hearing 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.600
 disease but you said that this disease 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.060
 most common 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.190
 but even right is a cool person is 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.600
 She is so old, though, she thinks I 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.310
 I could already talk to her for the daughters. 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.030
 and if I ever noticed any symptoms 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.030
 smell is that're talking 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.600
 But then why does she want one? 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.600
 medical analysis turning singing 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.110
 is
