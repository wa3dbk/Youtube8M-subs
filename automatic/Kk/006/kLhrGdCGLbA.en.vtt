00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 to take photos from iphoto on a cd or dvd 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.240
 to bring the displays on each computer 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.440
 an intermediate step is needed 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.599
 tempting is an iphoto the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.269
 Commands burning in the menu 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 but the final result would be only from iphoto 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.080
 readable only on macs so that the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.029
 Pictures in universal format on the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 You have to land the photos 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 first exported from iphoto and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.529
 then burned to cd 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.720
 I'm going now step by step 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 by first photos in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 correct order will be brought me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.540
 have in iphoto already several albums 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.880
 I put it in a folder 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.710
 summarized all the photos have this 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.629
 folders are now often cd perpetuated 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.059
 I will select the folder and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.950
 then go to the menu file here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 I export the entry 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.780
 the key combinations for that would be 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.780
 command boss on it open the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.300
 I can change the format and the dialog 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.130
 Determine the name of the files 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.980
 for the best possible result I choose 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.900
 current format from this gives the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.630
 Pictures in their current condition 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.220
 format and size would be preserved 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.940
 I will choose the original original 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.770
 state of the picture exports so all 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.230
 machining straightening 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.270
 Improvements etc were lost 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.220
 Of course, I could also be a specific one 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.910
 format and then choose a size 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.470
 prescribe 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.800
 I myself stay with it 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 current format then can still 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.170
 specify the sorting and naming 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.330
 the file name I leave by album name 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.430
 determine with the help of the counter 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.460
 photos in the order of the folder too 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.700
 bring in format for subfolders choose 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.750
 I event name because so are photos 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.640
 from different events 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.729
 separated from each other and in albums 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.369
 the alm order to place instead 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.610
 the events in their form exported 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.540
 I have to have each one individually for each one 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 to export themselves 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.710
 but later on choose more 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.850
 I in another dialog from where the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.259
 to land photos 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.780
 I lie down on the desk 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.640
 and create a new folder for it 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.319
 that lends itself to later the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.840
 to keep track now the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.340
 photos exported from iphoto and for the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.680
 Events become automatic 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.090
 subfolder created the label and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.370
 numbering depends on the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.990
 selected folder or album the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.420
 However, sorting corresponds to the 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.170
 events from which the pictures are taken 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.830
 The next step is rowling 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.690
 dvd blank was inserted here 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.069
 triggers the question what should the computer do 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.709
 to start with this rowling 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.540
 the standard answer is to open enemies 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.130
 Here are the right because all the photos are 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.770
 now available in fine de 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.420
 so ok with ok I can now 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.930
 the folders with the photos on the cd 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.180
 pull 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.790
 they are not fired directly but 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.380
 only reserved for it until everything 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.850
 is prepared and I have the order to do so 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.569
 The actual starts 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.459
 burning process I would like to have one more now 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.310
 add another album cd 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.200
 that's why I reopen iphoto and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.230
 voters another album and 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.320
 so repeated the export process 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.530
 again current is format album name 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.510
 counter 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.560
 and this time do not share after event 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:20.120
 create a new folder and name 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.090
 finished this folder I draw now 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.709
 also on the symbol of dvd r 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.220
 then lands on an equal footing with the 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.200
 other 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.819
 There are several ways to do that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.100
 to start actual burning 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.900
 first, in the opened fine window 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.209
 selected dvd is an additional 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.330
 dark gray strip at the top of me 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.290
 right click on burn 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.850
 Second, if I have the silverling 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.220
 wants to throw out and him in the direction of 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.030
 Trash goal is changing 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.830
 paper basket in apples brake mol 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.890
 third, in a finder window becomes 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.690
 the blank displayed here too appears 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.430
 The burning symbol in miniature form 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.780
 a final dialogue can still be mastered 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.390
 before it really starts 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.000
 how should the medium be called and how 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.440
 should be burned quickly 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.030
 that's done quickly max 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.190
 speed is perfect in 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.360
 order that only takes itself 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.430
 a few minutes and that check 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.579
 then so long again 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.040
 wanted to bring a little patience 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.990
 I could re-burn the dvd myself 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.550
 ensure with firing program 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.030
 that this burning project is secured 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.310
 becomes 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.280
 it stores which files where 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.080
 lie on this dvd do not belong 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.590
 The data itself will be so 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.419
 deleted 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.810
 they can not be burned again 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.840
 the result is a dvd with all images 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.120
 sorted in order the order of the 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 albums or events remain in iphoto 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.950
 get and these are on each 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.919
 calculator playable 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.530
 a small tip even if I have this cd 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.450
 amec inlay I can photos of 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.419
 Select folder and then open 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.240
 the program preview opens this in 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.570
 a window with several pictures in 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.890
 choose the drawer on the left side 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.660
 I now diashow in the menu presentation we 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.140
 have the pictures in full screen with change 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.479
 every five seconds displayed with show 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.250
 I can go up and down 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.130
 between the pictures back and forth 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.490
 change with escape I finish the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.490
 slideshow 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.970
 have fun burning
