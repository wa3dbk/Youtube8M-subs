impressions were solicited and with that

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.459 
impressions were solicited and with that
in<00:01:52.180> mind<00:01:52.210> they<00:01:52.600> thought<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.899> sent<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.259> picture

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
in mind they thought it sent a picture

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.249 
in mind they thought it sent a picture
of<00:01:53.710> who<00:01:53.920> he<00:01:54.100> really<00:01:54.250> was<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.899> company

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
of who he really was and the company

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.039 
of who he really was and the company
rejected<00:01:56.770> him<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.270> it's<00:01:58.450> very<00:01:58.600> important

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
rejected him and so it's very important

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.539 
rejected him and so it's very important
to<00:01:59.110> keep<00:01:59.259> in<00:01:59.380> mind<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.770> everyone<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.399> an
