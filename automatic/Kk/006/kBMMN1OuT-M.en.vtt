00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.560
 Called Chen 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.000
 and have played with mach fern sense because the programmer but if 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.410
 Let's take a closer look at something for the heart arrest puzzle and 9live 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.929
 to join in 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.280
 then it only shows 1 transparent very incomprehensible really seem 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.289
 Seat to be stretchable terms 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.410
 a title at 9 9 percent aired in July the supposedly simple task 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.789
 contact all numbers 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.050
 This appeals to Paul Trost from the vicinity of Limburg the learned 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.750
 Accountant was head of accounting in one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.989
 Midsize business numbers are its passion I have though 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.989
 The solution tried so Pinto 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.850
 but I do not believe b 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.020
 the result came 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.290
 I have go 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.170
 Ucar resolution 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.720
 closer to the video she is viewed recorded 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.480
 and firewall was also amazed r is not about what is far from mine 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.200
 Solutions conceivable none of the more than 200 by callers came also the 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.320
 9live solution 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.780
 of 6500 74 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.159
 The game ran for four hours 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.220
 no miracle apparently also Roman numbers were to be read backwards 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.189
 Numbers in the text 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.550
 even over line breaks and in others 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.980
 for comfort an absurdity 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.000
 the rather quirky with red 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.530
 if you do that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.480
 Percent the people 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.450
 to make the Torlinien councils and hid it unfortunately only in ca 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.280
 still coal-fired power plants 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.600
 to have any numbers that are too puzzling both have so 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 I think that's already no longer exists that is bordering on 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.690
 Silica of all 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 9live to choose absurd middle ground without recognizable solutions 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.870
 This opinion is also Ulrich Geiger from Berlin 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.360
 like Peter Trost, he failed a few months ago on a new live 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.979
 mystery 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.580
 and wondered about the strange dissolution 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.470
 Since then he has been dealing in detail with the self-proclaimed 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.760
 join countries 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.210
 makes computer pictures of all play and compares the results with the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.730
 Task that the backgrounds do not know with which 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.999
 nasty methods is developed 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.149
 and know what to consider for something not funny it just 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.649
 not transparent 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.009
 also in which we are not explained and about one day on the 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.869
 others changed today Tel 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.669
 it is not lacking 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.559
 In other games there are many different ones you can talk about when 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.790
 you suddenly change the rules that rule that one is playing out 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.999
 others applied and vice versa 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.619
 the audience in the foreground Dr 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:36.509
 ripped off 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:40.939
 Is it really true that 9live play its part without recognizable solutions 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:41.709
 earned 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.149
 to investigate this record as the program of a broadcast week 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.219
 a total of over 60 hours of material 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.319
 cutouts 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.319
 never 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.129
 the formula 1 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.239
 for a uniform whole 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.590
 they all actually 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.569
 none of the callers could solve these supposedly simple team games 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.939
 They ran for several hours 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.010
 Example of this riddle coming from the tenth of august they see all the animals like that 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:12.779
 is the simple question 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.239
 the supposed solution dubious 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.299
 Essien backwards read Aegerter over all punctuation marks like here 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.299
 ants 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.589
 Below in the text you will find after 9live in the editorial 89 Tiger Shark 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:36.869
 151 animals are one animal +51 animals plus 151 animals and still the word hers 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:39.239
 a total of 204 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.269
 and in addition to a team up, there are supposedly in addition to sixth 

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:49.229
 no word on this counting at the nine live resolution at 2 o'clock in the morning 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.179
 only a number is displayed 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.339
 9 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:57.539
 Example 2 aired on the thirteenth eighth 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:01.539
 If you draw all the letters, the task is who the text and the 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:04.880
 Keyboard crosses only comes on 99 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.230
 but the station mockingly presents a whole after three hours of playing time 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.360
 other result wat stays tight 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.669
 33 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.439
 because of that comes because of course, for example, synonymous with 3d see it too 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.439
 because the keyboard is the 3d with the off 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.590
 logical 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.969
 to the 99 come after 9live Gusto but two a3 d-4d 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:32.229
 but then you are still like 143 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.610
 in the word 9live 9 11 additional 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.830
 give 50 more because the money stands for Roman 50 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.580
 another display is here 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.190
 under Favre that is to say in Borsch to b allegedly still 108 too 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.190
 find a total of the 103 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.159
 for me the solution is already 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.999
 because it's only ten callers 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.839
 and that's why the solution is a part of their information wrong 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.520
 it is now important that the solution of 9live but not the solution agreed with the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 Question should be reached 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.920
 if the players are really that transparent they are a normal one 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.689
 TV viewers can solve 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:23.120
 Hopefully they will not call these profits 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.990
 in the sense of 9live 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.499
 the self-styled Christine in reality a turn away 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:32.849
 we want to wear in the Munich center why are the games like that 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.520
 intransparent and why the solutions are kept secret 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.669
 no answers in front of the camera the comments in writing 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.759
 you see yourself as an entertainment station 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.410
 the cells should be fun 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.999
 and further quote 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.399
 this includes the ability to solve and then find that 

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:50.759
 To prove solutions 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.099
 for example, Roman numerals or the reverse ddp are for the 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.740
 as found in every recipe 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.060
 we're just going to keep this up 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.550
 Supervision of 9live for the Bavarian state headquarters for new media here 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.659
 let's play the excerpts 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.699
 Everything is correct in the legal or on match days 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.230
 for sure it makes sense if you look at it which games in the 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.119
 Transmitter be made 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.210
 or because they do not matter 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.139
 I think so 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:24.050
 Accountant Paul Trost could not solve the calculation until today 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.240
 and Plusminus could not help him despite detailed research 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.819
 9live had from a television interview association club now back in 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.249
 Magazines because there he finds him the transparent solution
