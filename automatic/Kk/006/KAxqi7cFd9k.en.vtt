00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
angle but we pretty much needs only like

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.460 
angle but we pretty much needs only like
one<00:03:11.099> back<00:03:11.370> here<00:03:11.580> maybe<00:03:11.940> two<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:13.019> get<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.290> take<00:03:13.440> a

but<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.670> eight-minute<00:03:37.480> match<00:03:37.629> so<00:03:38.080> yeah

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
but like a eight-minute match so yeah

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.830 
but like a eight-minute match so yeah
like<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:39.730> might<00:03:39.879> see<00:03:40.000> some<00:03:40.180> early<00:03:40.299> kills<00:03:40.659> here

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
like we might see some early kills here

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.110 
like we might see some early kills here
it's<00:03:40.959> a<00:03:40.989> lower<00:03:41.140> ceiling<00:03:41.549> and<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:42.700> works<00:03:42.909> both

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
it's a lower ceiling and that works both

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.059 
it's a lower ceiling and that works both
ways<00:03:43.390> it's<00:03:43.930> interesting<00:03:44.260> how<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.560> can<00:03:44.799> generate

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
ways it's interesting how I can generate

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.350 
ways it's interesting how I can generate
metagame<00:03:45.459> of<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.610> globe<00:03:45.760> definitely<00:03:46.269> with

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
metagame of the globe definitely with

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.569 
metagame of the globe definitely with
Armada<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.019> what<00:03:47.170> the<00:03:47.260> power<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.620> in<00:03:48.340> a

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
Armada we see what the power is in a

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.190 
Armada we see what the power is in a
defensive<00:03:49.150> young<00:03:49.329> link<00:03:49.569> then<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:49.989> axe

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
defensive young link then you see axe

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.380 
defensive young link then you see axe
also<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> other<00:03:50.920> hand<00:03:51.159> my<00:03:51.640> lady<00:03:51.760> zomlings

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
also on the other hand my lady zomlings

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.009 
also on the other hand my lady zomlings
super<00:03:52.780> aggressive<00:03:53.200> that's<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.680> great<00:03:53.890> point

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
super aggressive that's a great point

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.619 
super aggressive that's a great point
what<00:03:56.019> makes<00:03:56.200> axes<00:03:56.739> yelling<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.549> aggressive<00:03:58.480> is

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
what makes axes yelling so aggressive is

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.390 
what makes axes yelling so aggressive is
all<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:58.840> she'll<00:03:59.079> drop<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.739> know<00:03:59.860> type<00:04:00.129> stuff

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
all the she'll drop you know type stuff

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.500 
all the she'll drop you know type stuff
but<00:04:00.610> we<00:04:00.700> don't<00:04:00.819> really<00:04:00.909> see<00:04:01.030> those<00:04:01.269> crazy

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
but we don't really see those crazy

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.140 
but we don't really see those crazy
movements<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.260> tricks<00:04:02.560> yeah<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:04.000> he's<00:04:04.090> also

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
movements and tricks yeah but he's also

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.280 
movements and tricks yeah but he's also
usually<00:04:04.569> basically<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.019> power<00:04:05.200> to

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
usually basically the power to

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.630 
usually basically the power to
neutralize<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:05.890> links<00:04:06.099> have<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.250> remaining

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
neutralize the links have a remaining

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.880 
neutralize the links have a remaining
neutral<00:04:06.819> air<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.989> just<00:04:08.230> using<00:04:08.379> this<00:04:08.530> x''k

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
neutral air so just using this x''k

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.960 
neutral air so just using this x''k

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.850 

I<00:04:27.990> wonder<00:04:28.990> if<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.110> yelling<00:04:29.259> knows<00:04:29.530> about<00:04:29.740> the

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
I wonder if the yelling knows about the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.320 
I wonder if the yelling knows about the
bomb<00:04:30.009> bomb<00:04:30.580> recovery

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
bomb bomb recovery

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:33.939 
uh yeah it's kind of hard to do though

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:42.570 
uh yeah it's kind of hard to do though
that<00:04:34.599> is<00:04:34.810> oh<00:04:40.500> there's<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:42.129> version

space animal or something
well<00:05:08.650> she<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.800> think<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:10.270> talk<00:05:10.990> about

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
well she I think this talk about

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.320 
well she I think this talk about
counterfeit<00:05:11.710> I<00:05:12.039> can't<00:05:12.520> see<00:05:12.759> this<00:05:12.909> being<00:05:13.120> fit

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
counterfeit I can't see this being fit

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.890 
counterfeit I can't see this being fit
because<00:05:14.289> it's<00:05:14.710> not<00:05:14.860> possible

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
because it's not possible

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.360 
because it's not possible
yeah<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.289> don't<00:05:17.409> know<00:05:17.680> how<00:05:17.860> he's<00:05:18.009> supposed<00:05:18.250> to

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
yeah I don't know how he's supposed to

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
guess the down air throwing it and this

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.070 
guess the down air throwing it and this
should<00:05:27.219> be<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.520> okay<00:05:28.270> it's<00:05:28.599> nice<00:05:28.719> to<00:05:28.870> get<00:05:28.960> the
