00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.140 
preference really so up to 250 on this
straight<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.240> look<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.140> 100-meter<00:01:14.150> breaking

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
straight I look for a 100-meter breaking

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.929 
straight I look for a 100-meter breaking
marker<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.560> accelerate

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
marker and then you can accelerate

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.929 
marker and then you can accelerate
nicely<00:01:17.939> through<00:01:18.330> there<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.009> coming<00:01:20.009> towards

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
high 103 a good place to break is as

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.420 
high 103 a good place to break is as
soon<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> see<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.930> curb<00:01:28.430> because

there's a dip in the track you can't see

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
there's a dip in the track you can't see
the<00:01:30.930> counter<00:01:31.350> yourself<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> top<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the counter yourself right on top of it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.710 
the counter yourself right on top of it
soon<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:34.110> 12<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:35.640> break<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.689> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
soon as you can that's 12 to break and I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
soon as you can that's 12 to break and I
keep<00:01:37.140> breaking<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> while<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> take<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
keep breaking for a while so I take a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
keep breaking for a while so I take a
different<00:01:38.880> line<00:01:39.180> through<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
different line through here this is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.990 
different line through here this is
another<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> doing<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> smoker<00:01:41.700> sort

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
another way of doing it the smoker sort

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.929 
another way of doing it the smoker sort
of<00:01:42.060> traditional<00:01:42.479> iphone<00:01:42.840> racing<00:01:43.320> line<00:01:43.939> didn't

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
of traditional iphone racing line didn't

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.490 
of traditional iphone racing line didn't
mean<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.149> hit<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> inside<00:01:45.630> curb<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
mean to hit the inside curb there was a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.560 
mean to hit the inside curb there was a
mistake<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.549> was<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.000> mistake<00:01:48.180> actually

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mistake that was the mistake actually

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.840 
mistake that was the mistake actually
which<00:01:48.840> cost<00:01:49.049> me<00:01:49.140> 180<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> this

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
which cost me 180 and this that so this

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
which cost me 180 and this that so this
is<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> better<00:01:54.299> line<00:01:54.509> through<00:01:54.810> here<00:01:55.140> try<00:01:55.829> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
is a better line through here try and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.730 
is a better line through here try and
mimic<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.340> line<00:01:56.990> that's<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> did<00:01:58.649> on

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
mimic that line that's the one I did on

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.310 
mimic that line that's the one I did on
the<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:59.009> lock<00:01:59.630> flat<00:02:00.630> out<00:02:00.750> through<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the first lock flat out through here and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.830 
the first lock flat out through here and
I<00:02:01.579> was<00:02:02.579> much<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:02.759> aggressive<00:02:03.270> through<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
I was much more aggressive through this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
I was much more aggressive through this
next<00:02:04.590> section<00:02:04.890> here

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
next section here

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
next section here
and<00:02:06.090> there's<00:02:06.600> quite<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.049> time<00:02:07.289> just

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
and there's quite a lot of time just

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.009 
and there's quite a lot of time just
then<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.789> crazy<00:02:09.060> through<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.720> or

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
then really going crazy through this or

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.809 
then really going crazy through this or
just<00:02:10.379> trying<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.039> carry<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.340> much<00:02:11.489> speed<00:02:11.760> as

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
just trying to carry as much speed as

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.660 
just trying to carry as much speed as
you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.269> and<00:02:12.750> was<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> little<00:02:13.980> bit<00:02:14.160> later<00:02:14.489> on

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
you can and was a little bit later on

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.619 
you can and was a little bit later on
the<00:02:14.940> brakes<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:15.480> time<00:02:16.430> which<00:02:17.599> didn't<00:02:18.599> really

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
the brakes this time which didn't really

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.869 
the brakes this time which didn't really
cost<00:02:18.959> me<00:02:19.110> too<00:02:19.230> much<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.310> cost<00:02:20.519> me<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> little

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
cost me too much but it cost me a little

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.140 
cost me too much but it cost me a little
bit<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.300> was<00:02:21.989> just<00:02:22.080> trying<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.380> make<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.739> for

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
bit I was just trying to make up for

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
bit I was just trying to make up for
past<00:02:24.200> mistake<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> desperately<00:02:26.010> trying<00:02:26.160> to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
past mistake and desperately trying to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
past mistake and desperately trying to
get<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> 180<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.780> here's<00:02:28.080> my<00:02:28.170> um<00:02:30.170> another<00:02:31.170> view

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
get a 180 so here's my um another view

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.490 
get a 180 so here's my um another view
here<00:02:31.739> at<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.220> same<00:02:32.430> luck<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> two<00:02:33.959> laps<00:02:34.200> even

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
here at the same luck so two laps even

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
here at the same luck so two laps even
so<00:02:35.069> just<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.000> few<00:02:36.030> things<00:02:36.299> I'd<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.720> point

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
so just a few things I'd like to point

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.960 
so just a few things I'd like to point
out<00:02:37.019> about<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.349> car<00:02:37.530> firstly<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.670> if<00:02:38.819> you

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
out about the car firstly that if you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.150 
out about the car firstly that if you
hit<00:02:39.180> curbs<00:02:39.450> sometimes<00:02:40.349> particularly<00:02:40.739> ones<00:02:41.040> on

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
hit curbs sometimes particularly ones on

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.089 
hit curbs sometimes particularly ones on
the<00:02:41.250> inside<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.920> destabilize<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
the inside do this to destabilize the

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.460 
the inside do this to destabilize the
car<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.519> bit<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.959> see<00:02:46.170> just

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
car a little bit as you can see just

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.289 
car a little bit as you can see just
going<00:02:46.950> over<00:02:47.069> there<00:02:47.340> simply<00:02:47.819> a<00:02:47.940> little<00:02:48.180> bit

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
going over there simply a little bit

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.199 
going over there simply a little bit
wider<00:02:48.480> than<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.840> would<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.019> liked<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:50.370> on

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
wider than I would have liked and on

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.080 
wider than I would have liked and on
this<00:02:51.840> corner<00:02:52.290> coming<00:02:52.470> up<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.610> second<00:02:53.970> map

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
this corner coming up and the second map

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.020 
this corner coming up and the second map
actually<00:02:54.540> make<00:02:54.720> that<00:02:54.989> mistake<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:56.190> well<00:02:56.400> just

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
actually make that mistake as well just

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.729 
actually make that mistake as well just
hitting<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.329> inside<00:02:57.720> care<00:02:58.019> which<00:02:58.290> cost<00:02:58.530> me<00:02:58.620> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
hitting the inside care which cost me a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.569 
hitting the inside care which cost me a
bit<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:58.980> time<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.750> well<00:03:01.079> that's<00:03:02.040> one<00:03:02.220> thing<00:03:02.430> to

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
bit of time so well that's one thing to

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.220 
bit of time so well that's one thing to
be<00:03:02.670> aware<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:03.000> another<00:03:03.450> thing<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:03.959> aware<00:03:04.049> of

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
be aware of another thing to be aware of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.229 
be aware of another thing to be aware of
is<00:03:04.440> just<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.709> cars<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.310> got<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.549> slowly<00:03:05.819> under

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
is just the cars I got a slowly under

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.360 
is just the cars I got a slowly under
steering<00:03:06.510> nature<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.530> seat<00:03:07.769> because<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
steering nature of a seat because it's a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.309 
steering nature of a seat because it's a
good<00:03:09.120> run<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.390> corner<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:09.810> fast<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.230> don't

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
good run the corner so fast you don't

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.470 
good run the corner so fast you don't
really<00:03:10.500> notice<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.489> mean<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.299> does

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
really notice it but I mean it does

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.680 
really notice it but I mean it does
happen<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:13.109> I<00:03:13.139> friend<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> good<00:03:14.690> cabrillo

happen so I friend that a good cabrillo

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.740 
happen so I friend that a good cabrillo
driving<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.910> kind<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.970> let<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
driving it is to kind of let the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.930 
driving it is to kind of let the
understeer<00:03:19.170> happen<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.310> try<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.670> get

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
understeer happen and then try and get

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.259 
understeer happen and then try and get
back<00:03:21.180> on<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.450> power<00:03:22.040> afterwards<00:03:23.040> I'm<00:03:23.730> not<00:03:23.970> not

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
back on the power afterwards I'm not not

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.699 
back on the power afterwards I'm not not
just<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:25.019> know<00:03:25.049> getting<00:03:25.319> on<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.530> power

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
just you know getting on the power

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.890 
just you know getting on the power
really<00:03:26.160> early<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:26.730> there's<00:03:26.970> cuz<00:03:27.569> then

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
really early and then there's cuz then

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.270 
really early and then there's cuz then
you<00:03:28.019> kind<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.290> under<00:03:28.560> steer<00:03:28.590> away<00:03:28.859> free<00:03:29.190> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
you kind of under steer away free to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.030 
you kind of under steer away free to
corner<00:03:29.609> and<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.850> doesn't<00:03:30.150> really<00:03:30.950> give<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
corner and it doesn't really give you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.180 
corner and it doesn't really give you
the<00:03:32.160> best<00:03:32.310> lap<00:03:32.519> times<00:03:33.260> so<00:03:34.260> that's<00:03:34.680> something

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
the best lap times so that's something

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.490 
the best lap times so that's something
I've<00:03:35.370> learnt<00:03:35.609> about<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.850> car<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:37.319> if<00:03:37.440> you're

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
I've learnt about the car so if you're

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.280 
I've learnt about the car so if you're
in<00:03:37.680> gold<00:03:38.130> nice<00:03:39.120> lap<00:03:39.359> time<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.630> try<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.930> get<00:03:40.079> is

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
in gold nice lap time to try and get is

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.009 
in gold nice lap time to try and get is
that<00:03:40.350> low<00:03:41.130> 10<00:03:41.310> 4<00:03:41.609> sets<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:42.690> up<00:03:42.720> quite<00:03:42.989> nicely

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
that low 10 4 sets you up quite nicely

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.479 
that low 10 4 sets you up quite nicely
and<00:03:43.859> you<00:03:43.889> have<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> do<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> similar<00:03:44.519> lap<00:03:45.079> on<00:03:46.079> the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
and you have to do a similar lap on the

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.979 
and you have to do a similar lap on the
second<00:03:47.489> lap<00:03:47.639> in<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:47.970> unseen<00:03:48.510> up<00:03:48.690> coming<00:03:48.900> out

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
second lap in the unseen up coming out

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.979 
second lap in the unseen up coming out
the<00:03:49.079> pit<00:03:49.260> lane<00:03:49.290> so<00:03:50.389> just<00:03:51.389> be<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.660> little<00:03:51.780> bit

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
the pit lane so just be that little bit

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.589 
the pit lane so just be that little bit
quicker<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:53.010> then<00:03:53.310> they<00:03:53.609> 104<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> find<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.480> by

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
quicker and then they 104 I find it by

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.520 
quicker and then they 104 I find it by
our<00:03:54.780> high<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.829> three<00:03:56.160> at<00:03:56.819> set<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.420> up<00:03:57.530> okay

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
our high on a three at set you up okay

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.099 
our high on a three at set you up okay
for<00:03:58.769> gold<00:04:00.349> but<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.859> can<00:04:02.040> manage<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.459> if<00:04:02.639> you

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
for gold but you can manage it if you

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.710 
for gold but you can manage it if you
don't<00:04:04.220> need<00:04:05.220> one<00:04:05.400> before<00:04:05.760> but<00:04:06.030> then<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.329> can

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
don't need one before but then you can

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.500 
don't need one before but then you can
after<00:04:07.400> well<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.550> puts<00:04:08.820> pressure<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.270> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
after well it puts pressure on the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.590 
after well it puts pressure on the
second<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.140> be<00:04:10.260> really<00:04:10.680> good<00:04:11.600> obviously

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
second that to be really good obviously

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.850 
second that to be really good obviously
a<00:04:12.630> highlight<00:04:13.050> that<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.320> have<00:04:13.470> made<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> few

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
a highlight that I have made a few

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.670 
a highlight that I have made a few
mistakes<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.690> I'll<00:04:15.690> actually<00:04:15.900> managed<00:04:16.650> to

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
mistakes and I'll actually managed to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.599 
mistakes and I'll actually managed to
get<00:04:16.920> a<00:04:16.980> 1<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.790> 2<00:04:17.880> on<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.720> opening<00:04:19.620> lap<00:04:19.680> before<00:04:20.130> so

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
get a 1 a 2 on the opening lap before so

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.310 
get a 1 a 2 on the opening lap before so
there's<00:04:21.030> not<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.180> much<00:04:21.510> difference<00:04:21.959> between

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
there's not that much difference between

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.270 
there's not that much difference between
the<00:04:22.440> times<00:04:22.710> of<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:24.830> first<00:04:25.830> lap<00:04:26.040> in<00:04:26.190> the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the times of the the first lap in the

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.650 
the times of the the first lap in the
second<00:04:26.610> lap<00:04:26.730> it's<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:27.090> where<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.240> come<00:04:27.600> out

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
second lap it's just where you come out

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.420 
second lap it's just where you come out
the<00:04:27.780> pits<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.290> maybe<00:04:28.800> cost<00:04:28.980> you<00:04:29.130> half<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
the pits that maybe cost you half a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120 
the pits that maybe cost you half a
