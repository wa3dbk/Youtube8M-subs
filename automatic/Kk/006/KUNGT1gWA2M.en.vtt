00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.470
 Damn how many times have you thought what 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.970
 I have to get the vacation 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.070
 true then what do you think if we talk 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.410
 a little about the amount of things 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 what can you do here in your 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.050
 favorite children's program the corner of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.460
 children 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.000
 we have already spoken in previous programs 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.980
 about dance lessons singing and singing 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 other things that have too much reception 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.540
 in the holidays women those athletes 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.730
 in power they love the exercise 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.699
 Well, do not worry, we also have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.589
 some fabulous courses for you we will act 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.720
 with gymnastics but first we go to 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.250
 talk with the teacher we are with the 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.470
 professor of artistic gymnastics and 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.780
 acrobatic william navarrete he leads 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.420
 as a teacher of this discipline 16 years 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.040
 for vueling nadal a very big greeting 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.899
 to the kids in the children's corner and 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.879
 explain why gymnastics is a 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.980
 excellent option for the 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.079
 good holiday before before anything 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.050
 I'm going to send greetings to all children of 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.899
 children's corner gymnastics is 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.360
 important because we develop 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.850
 many capacities the elasticity the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.830
 strength we also develop values 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.240
 like all sports we have a value 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.890
 of discipline honor loyalty companionship 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.690
 those kinds of things that help us 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.550
 form us as human beings 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.070
 now also gymnastics is going to 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.210
 help as a basis for making other 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.740
 activities in the future 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.810
 then later if you withdraw from that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.810
 gym can be climbing you can do 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.490
 ornamental sachs you can do basketball 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.680
 football and you're not going to have any with 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.659
 no complication because you have the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.159
 enough motor skills are you going to have the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.200
 control of the two sides the right side 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.400
 and the left side of your body you 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.040
 brain is going to develop better 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.229
 way you stop this blanket if 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.310
 We make a demonstration so that the 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.310
 children see all they can do 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.540
 jump and jump without stopping I love the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.850
 Trampoline is my favorite gives me the 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 feeling that in each jump I raise more 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.010
 and more and I can touch the sky 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.599
 what it costs me a little bit of work 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.269
 it's the way back but with sweat and 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.750
 effort I think I will achieve it and I believe in 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.750
 your 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.599
 and keep trying the floor again today 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.500
 they saw it like that until finally 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.720
 the need is an important factor in 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.690
 gymnastics and leaving little to prepare 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.730
 little since you can hurt yourself so not 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.520
 try it without having made a prior 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.840
 heating and of course under the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 supervision of a professional 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.970
 I say goodbye to my gymnastics exercises 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.320
 and I'm going to try my luck in other sports 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:50.020
 like acrobatics in cloth but 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:54.570
 I'm definitely bad for that but 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.570
 How about I try taekwondo 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.820
 I think I 'm not very good either 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.900
 and the same thing can happen to you, so 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:28.389
 Choose which sport you like the best and go 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.389
 and goodbye to boredom and train 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.379
 I am sam 'and reporting of entourage to 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.379
 the corner of children
