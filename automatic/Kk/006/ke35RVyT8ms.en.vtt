00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
so that's pretty useful if you're in the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.040 
so that's pretty useful if you're in the
middle<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.950> nowhere<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.520> you're<00:02:49.050> carrying

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
middle of nowhere and you're carrying

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.370 
middle of nowhere and you're carrying
too<00:02:50.140> much<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.500> able<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.709> run<00:02:51.660> and<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:53.200> you

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
too much to be able to run and as you

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.010 
too much to be able to run and as you
can<00:02:53.530> see<00:02:53.560> we're<00:02:53.920> now<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.400> Whiterun<00:02:55.150> we're

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
can see we're now in Whiterun we're

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.510 
can see we're now in Whiterun we're
still<00:02:56.260> over<00:02:56.380> encumbered<00:02:56.830> but<00:02:56.980> we're<00:02:57.100> not<00:02:57.250> too

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
still over encumbered but we're not too

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.210 
still over encumbered but we're not too
far<00:02:57.550> away<00:02:57.850> from<00:02:58.360> our<00:02:58.630> priests<00:02:59.170> own<00:02:59.350> house<00:02:59.590> or

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
far away from our priests own house or

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.410 
far away from our priests own house or
you<00:03:00.310> can<00:03:00.370> just<00:03:00.430> put<00:03:00.700> everything<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.180> chest

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
you can just put everything in a chest

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.360 
you can just put everything in a chest
for<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.410> fourth<00:03:02.650> trick<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.070> one's<00:03:03.250> actually

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
for the fourth trick this one's actually

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.390 
for the fourth trick this one's actually
really<00:03:03.850> useful<00:03:03.880> because<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:05.050> can<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.770> used<00:03:05.950> in

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
really useful because it can be used in

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000 
really useful because it can be used in
almost<00:03:06.820> any<00:03:07.090> situation<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.680> want<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.920> do

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
almost any situation what you want to do

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.130 
almost any situation what you want to do
is<00:03:09.160> like<00:03:09.370> let's<00:03:09.760> say<00:03:09.850> there's<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.209> silver

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
is like let's say there's this silver

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.510 
is like let's say there's this silver
necklace<00:03:11.440> right<00:03:11.620> here<00:03:11.830> that<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.010> want<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.250> steal

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
necklace right here that I want to steal

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.670 
necklace right here that I want to steal
I<00:03:12.760> can't<00:03:13.330> because<00:03:13.600> there's<00:03:13.720> tons<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.500> people

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
I can't because there's tons of people

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.040 
I can't because there's tons of people
watching<00:03:15.040> me<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:16.030> would<00:03:16.330> be<00:03:16.480> pretty<00:03:16.870> much

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
watching me it would be pretty much

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.630 
watching me it would be pretty much
impossible<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.770> me<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.890> steal<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:18.520> get

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640

50<00:04:02.349> 40<00:04:02.800> around<00:04:03.099> there<00:04:03.310> so<00:04:03.910> as<00:04:03.970> you<00:04:04.060> can<00:04:04.180> see

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
50 40 around there so as you can see

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.479 
50 40 around there so as you can see
none<00:04:04.510> of<00:04:04.569> these<00:04:04.690> books<00:04:04.870> have<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.260> but<00:04:05.530> this<00:04:06.430> one

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
none of these books have it but this one

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.119 
none of these books have it but this one
right<00:04:06.790> here<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.629> wolf<00:04:07.810> between<00:04:08.110> v6<00:04:08.680> has<00:04:08.769> value

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
of 30 so it's probably worth just

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.839 
of 30 so it's probably worth just
checking<00:04:10.870> out<00:04:11.280> unfortunately<00:04:12.280> no<00:04:12.519> this<00:04:12.700> one

something<00:05:26.500> I<00:05:26.560> made<00:05:26.740> up<00:05:26.770> it's<00:05:27.070> not<00:05:27.220> how<00:05:27.340> it

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
something I made up it's not how it

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.940 
something I made up it's not how it
works<00:05:27.729> but<00:05:28.210> it's<00:05:28.720> just<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.169> be<00:05:29.410> using<00:05:29.710> as<00:05:29.800> an

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
works but it's just to be using as an

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.250 
works but it's just to be using as an
example<00:05:30.280> alright<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.210> this<00:05:31.360> is<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.690> second<00:05:32.169> to

example alright so this is the second to

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.240 
example alright so this is the second to
last<00:05:32.289> tip<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.039> trick<00:05:33.930> basically<00:05:35.220> when<00:05:36.220> I

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
last tip and trick basically when I

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
273 out of 385 but when I go to level up

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.390 
273 out of 385 but when I go to level up
my<00:05:42.970> stamina<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:44.650> you<00:05:44.740> can<00:05:44.889> see<00:05:45.010> right<00:05:45.039> here

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
my stamina and you can see right here

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.339 
my stamina and you can see right here
I've<00:05:45.700> leveled<00:05:46.150> up<00:05:46.330> so<00:05:46.930> I'm<00:05:46.990> going<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.169> choose

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
I've leveled up so I'm going to choose

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.790 
I've leveled up so I'm going to choose
stamina<00:05:47.910> okay<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:49.139> go<00:05:50.139> back<00:05:50.289> to<00:05:50.349> my<00:05:50.470> inventory

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
stamina okay I go back to my inventory

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.300 
stamina okay I go back to my inventory
and<00:05:51.280> now<00:05:51.610> i'm<00:05:51.820> out<00:05:52.120> of<00:05:52.360> 390<00:05:53.080> instead<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.410> 385<00:05:54.039> so

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
and now i'm out of 390 instead of 385 so

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.520 
and now i'm out of 390 instead of 385 so
this<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.639> so<00:05:55.270> use<00:05:55.419> your<00:05:55.450> level<00:05:55.810> up<00:05:55.870> stamina<00:05:56.229> if

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
this is so use your level up stamina if

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.810 
this is so use your level up stamina if
you<00:05:56.650> always<00:05:56.800> find<00:05:57.010> yourself<00:05:57.340> being<00:05:57.550> over
