00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.670
 hi guys how are we going to make a 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.420
 self-massage in the interscapular zone with 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.310
 a little ball and then we will do a massage 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 in the whole gluteal area with a ball 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.550
 bigger as a tennis and harder 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.010
 since the musculature is deeper and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.240
 we will not work better with this first 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.480
 let's do 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.880
 the auto massage in the interscapular area 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.710
 what we will do is place a ball of 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.430
 you are soft 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.980
 in the interscapular area that is between 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.829
 the scapula and the vertebrae in the area 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.250
 for vertebral what will serve us is 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.989
 for trigger points and to relax 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.329
 a little bit this whole area that I've put 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.850
 let's have tense 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.540
 well yourselves you can take the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.750
 small ball 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.760
 and put what we said between the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.500
 scapula and the vertebrae in this 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.460
 little hole that there is the musculature for 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.400
 vertebrate the grapo 6 local banks 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.780
 in this point 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.460
 Y 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.030
 other endings 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.700
 it is important to put a cushion to be 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.850
 as comfortable as possible 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.170
 and here what we do is light 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.270
 movements with the arm 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.509
 you can make yourself light 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.810
 movements as if they will mix in a 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.810
 cooking pot 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.159
 says the movements 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.159
 OK 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.590
 to find that trigger point and 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.100
 when we stay when 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.380
 let's find then we work there on top 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.450
 we can also make movements of 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.450
 scapula how are we doing 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.960
 in the arm but the scapula to 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.960
 to work 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.689
 when the pain has subsided or 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.000
 we are with that area the relaxed we 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.270
 we put him back to his lateral decubitus position 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.710
 and we can climb ourselves or 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.710
 lower the ball na 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.710
 Now I'm doing it for 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.380
 explain what 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.990
 but as you can see you only have to change 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.140
 the location of the ball and do 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.500
 movements with the arms or with 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.500
 conches 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.220
 and this is all 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.370
 Mabel, guys, we made the car before 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.890
 massage of the interscapular area now 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.620
 we will do self - massage of massage 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.750
 the crucial area with the tennis ball 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.410
 that is not very hard preferably that 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.540
 be a bit soft we will put it the same 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.510
 patient can be put in the area 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.840
 gluteus which is a very powerful muscle that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.470
 we will easily find and look for a 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.480
 painful point we find it there and with 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.360
 movements 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.810
 Hip 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.830
 we can work that painful point 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.160
 we can also do it with 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.300
 movements the foot 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.300
 of the leg 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.040
 and the knee 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.420
 we found that painful point 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.620
 we can do it with movements of the 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.620
 hip 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.500
 slower 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.820
 where we will find the painful point and 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.140
 when we find the painful point 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.630
 we keep there for a while until 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.540
 decrease we can also perform 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.520
 leg movements 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.250
 with the leg open close 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.300
 with knee movements with 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.330
 flexion and extension to look for that 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.150
 painful point when it has already decreased 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.420
 the pain we put back in bed 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.420
 side 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.250
 and we change the location of the ball to 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.250
 another area of the gluteus 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.690
 and we do the same again 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.419
 procedure we look for the painful point 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.380
 and with hip or leg movements 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.840
 or knee 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.810
 we found the trigger point and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.810
 hold on until the pain subsides
