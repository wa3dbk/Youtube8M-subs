00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
we loved one to to travel and to have

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.019 
we loved one to to travel and to have
the<00:00:19.920> medical<00:00:21.080> weed<00:00:22.080> United<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.859> think<00:00:23.699> at

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the medical weed United I think at

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
the medical weed United I think at
Manchester<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.560> genetic<00:00:27.590> and<00:00:28.590> things

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
Manchester but with genetic and things

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.160 
Manchester but with genetic and things
are<00:00:29.580> really<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.300> into<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> good

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
are really going in into a good

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.850 
are really going in into a good
direction<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> think<00:00:33.260> sooner<00:00:34.260> rather<00:00:34.710> than

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
direction so I think sooner rather than

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.470 
direction so I think sooner rather than
later<00:00:35.059> seems<00:00:36.059> will<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:42.320> you<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:44.480> think

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
later seems will be you know I think

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
later seems will be you know I think
