answer and that tends to be our cure-all
for<00:00:43.350> anything<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.890> hurts<00:00:44.390> heat<00:00:45.390> increases

that<00:00:59.579> area<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.660> already<00:01:01.140> plenty<00:01:01.680> angry<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that area it's already plenty angry and

that area it's already plenty angry and
it<00:01:02.430> doesn't<00:01:02.760> need<00:01:02.879> any<00:01:03.239> help<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.780> heat<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> if

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it doesn't need any help from heat so if

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.429 
it doesn't need any help from heat so if
you<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> use<00:01:05.850> heat<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.450> recommend<00:01:07.049> using<00:01:07.200> ice

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
you do use heat I recommend using ice

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.250 
you do use heat I recommend using ice
after<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.520> fact<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:09.000> recommend<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.540> using<00:01:10.080> ice

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
after in fact I recommend just using ice

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.210 
after in fact I recommend just using ice
but<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.979> might<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.340> me<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.220> rather

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
but that just might be me and rather

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
but that just might be me and rather
than<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.520> throwing<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.630> cold<00:01:16.470> pack<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
than just throwing a cold pack on there

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.990 
than just throwing a cold pack on there
which<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.670> okay<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:19.280> convenient<00:01:20.280> that's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
which is okay it's convenient that's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.640 
which is okay it's convenient that's
about<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.750> good<00:01:22.020> thing<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.409> say

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
about the only good thing I can say

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 
about the only good thing I can say
about<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.939> does<00:01:24.119> promote

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
about it other than that it does promote

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.960 
about it other than that it does promote
community<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.650> they're<00:01:26.100> cumbersome<00:01:26.580> they

I'll link to some things about it but
let's<00:02:41.140> get<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:43.290> procedure<00:02:44.730> it's<00:02:45.730> pretty

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
let's get to the procedure it's pretty

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.280 
let's get to the procedure it's pretty
easy<00:02:46.570> all<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.710> is<00:02:48.780> applying<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.020> piece<00:02:50.200> of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
easy all of this is applying a piece of

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.130 
easy all of this is applying a piece of
ice<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.610> area<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.030> interest<00:02:52.390> let's<00:02:52.960> say

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
ice to the area of interest let's say

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.700 
ice to the area of interest let's say
I've<00:02:53.230> got<00:02:53.470> tennis<00:02:54.280> elbow<00:02:55.050> you<00:02:56.050> ice<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.470> area

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
I've got tennis elbow you ice the area

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.280 
I've got tennis elbow you ice the area
of<00:02:56.770> interest<00:02:57.100> then<00:02:57.460> you<00:02:57.580> wipe<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:58.510> ice<00:02:58.720> you

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
of interest then you wipe you ice you

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.170 
of interest then you wipe you ice you
wipe<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.460> I'm<00:03:00.550> going<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.760> show<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.970> how<00:03:01.060> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
and I'm going to work a little ways down

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.000 
and I'm going to work a little ways down
because<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.770> where<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.160> muscles<00:03:54.610> travel

quick<00:04:20.229> white<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.770> this<00:04:21.580> keeps<00:04:21.820> my<00:04:22.030> hand<00:04:22.210> from

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
quick white and this keeps my hand from

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.030 
quick white and this keeps my hand from
getting<00:04:22.630> cold<00:04:22.840> it's<00:04:23.800> just<00:04:23.979> Joe<00:04:24.220> a<00:04:24.250> good<00:04:24.460> time

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
getting cold it's just Joe a good time

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.430 
getting cold it's just Joe a good time
if<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.430> need<00:04:25.670> a<00:04:26.060> bigger<00:04:26.630> piece<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:26.870> ice<00:04:27.110> you

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
if you need a bigger piece of ice you

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.550 
if you need a bigger piece of ice you
can<00:04:27.710> freeze<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.940> Dixie<00:04:29.630> cup<00:04:29.660> full<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:29.990> water<00:04:30.230> you

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
can freeze a Dixie cup full of water you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.380 
can freeze a Dixie cup full of water you
could<00:04:31.010> use<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.790> could<00:04:31.970> tear<00:04:32.150> off<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> bottom

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
could use you could tear off the bottom

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.270 
could use you could tear off the bottom
and<00:04:32.780> use<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.020> top<00:04:33.200> as<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.380> handle<00:04:33.680> but<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:34.040> just

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
and use the top as a handle but I just

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.560 
and use the top as a handle but I just
like<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.300> works<00:04:35.420> well<00:04:36.190> and<00:04:37.190> ice<00:04:38.180> packs

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
like this it works well and ice packs

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.090 
like this it works well and ice packs
definitely<00:04:39.050> have<00:04:39.140> their<00:04:39.290> place<00:04:39.500> if<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.950> don't

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
definitely have their place if you don't

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.410 
definitely have their place if you don't
have<00:04:40.220> time<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.490> anything<00:04:40.820> else

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
have time for anything else

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.960 
have time for anything else
ice<00:04:41.660> packs<00:04:41.930> work<00:04:42.140> better<00:04:42.890> than<00:04:43.100> nothing<00:04:43.400> they

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
ice packs work better than nothing they

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.590 
ice packs work better than nothing they
do<00:04:44.030> promote<00:04:44.450> cleanly<00:04:44.810> but<00:04:46.300> how's<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.420> for

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
do promote cleanly but how's this for

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.170 
do promote cleanly but how's this for
fun<00:04:47.780> I'm<00:04:48.080> done<00:04:48.410> that's<00:04:48.950> that's<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.670> that's<00:04:50.000> all

is okay if I were having pain here it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.470 
is okay if I were having pain here it
would<00:04:56.420> be<00:04:56.540> greatly<00:04:56.870> lessened<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:58.240> yet<00:04:59.240> I'm

initial second is a little a little
shocking<00:05:05.720> but<00:05:06.050> after<00:05:06.650> that<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:07.130> fine

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
shocking but after that is fine

um and I do this on myself pretty much
every<00:05:10.160> day<00:05:10.190> because<00:05:11.090> I've<00:05:11.510> got<00:05:12.190> forearm

so<00:05:26.830> consider<00:05:27.850> trying<00:05:28.850> out<00:05:29.150> ice<00:05:29.360> massage<00:05:29.600> for

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
so consider trying out ice massage for

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.320 
so consider trying out ice massage for
your<00:05:30.080> next<00:05:30.290> injury<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:31.130> I<00:05:31.670> think<00:05:31.700> that<00:05:32.210> you'll

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
your next injury and I think that you'll

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.780 
your next injury and I think that you'll
find<00:05:32.360> that<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:33.350> way<00:05:33.830> less<00:05:34.070> unpleasant<00:05:34.670> than

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
find that it's way less unpleasant than

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.330 
find that it's way less unpleasant than
an<00:05:34.970> ice<00:05:35.120> pack<00:05:35.420> it's<00:05:35.960> way<00:05:36.140> more<00:05:36.170> effective<00:05:36.620> than

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
an ice pack it's way more effective than

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.000 
an ice pack it's way more effective than
heating<00:05:38.000> pad<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:39.200> the<00:05:39.380> results<00:05:39.890> are

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
heating pad and that the results are

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.420 
heating pad and that the results are
instantaneous<00:05:40.660> um<00:05:41.860> there's<00:05:42.860> something<00:05:43.190> else

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
instantaneous um there's something else

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:44.830 
instantaneous um there's something else
I<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.670> that<00:05:43.880> I'd<00:05:44.000> like<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.180> show<00:05:44.420> just<00:05:44.600> for

I like that I'd like to show just for
product<00:05:45.170> placement<00:05:45.230> purposes<00:05:46.010> but<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.340> is

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
product placement purposes but this is

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.860 
product placement purposes but this is
something<00:05:46.760> that<00:05:46.790> I<00:05:46.940> clearly<00:05:47.300> like<00:05:47.540> because

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
something that I clearly like because

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.470 
something that I clearly like because
I've<00:05:47.990> got<00:05:48.140> a<00:05:48.170> huge<00:05:49.040> friggin<00:05:49.430> bottle<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.850> it<00:05:49.970> but

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
I've got a huge friggin bottle of it but

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.080 
I've got a huge friggin bottle of it but
it's<00:05:50.660> Biofreeze<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.710> I'm<00:05:52.370> going<00:05:52.670> to<00:05:52.790> put<00:05:52.940> up<00:05:52.970> a

it's Biofreeze and I'm going to put up a

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.310 
it's Biofreeze and I'm going to put up a
link<00:05:53.270> of<00:05:53.480> it

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
link of it

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.560 
link of it
but<00:05:55.070> it's<00:05:56.000> not<00:05:56.510> a<00:05:56.900> replacement<00:05:57.350> for<00:05:57.950> ice<00:05:58.580> but

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
but it's not a replacement for ice but

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.830 
but it's not a replacement for ice but
it's<00:05:59.750> like<00:05:59.990> super<00:06:00.980> bengay<00:06:01.340> I'm<00:06:02.300> sure<00:06:02.510> that<00:06:02.750> you

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
it's like super bengay I'm sure that you

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.420 
it's like super bengay I'm sure that you
don't<00:06:03.020> have<00:06:03.350> that<00:06:03.470> on<00:06:03.650> their<00:06:03.800> label<00:06:04.100> anywhere

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
don't have that on their label anywhere

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.980 
don't have that on their label anywhere
but<00:06:04.670> that's<00:06:05.000> kind<00:06:05.240> of<00:06:05.270> what<00:06:05.420> it<00:06:05.540> is<00:06:05.690> it<00:06:05.840> absorbs

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
but that's kind of what it is it absorbs

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.080 
but that's kind of what it is it absorbs
very<00:06:06.350> well<00:06:06.830> it<00:06:07.160> makes<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:07.640> stink<00:06:07.940> like<00:06:08.030> a

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
very well it makes you stink like a

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.050 
very well it makes you stink like a
medicine<00:06:08.570> cabinet<00:06:08.720> but<00:06:09.590> whenever<00:06:10.460> I<00:06:10.610> use<00:06:10.790> it<00:06:10.970> I

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
medicine cabinet but whenever I use it I
