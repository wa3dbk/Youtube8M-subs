00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.789
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.890
 a new video today good nothing 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.529
 a week ago 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 I uploaded a photograph of how to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.550
 Install the menu of the Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.710
 what is this 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.800
 Many told me to make them a 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.379
 video and then here we are going to make the video 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.059
 the truth is that this personage remains 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.110
 perfect on our device gives you 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:41.180
 a new and improved appearance 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.090
 not only does this change, it's also going 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.920
 to change the shutdown menu no 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.620
 transform in this as you can see it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.980
 see a little better those icons that have 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.380
 colorful and in circles they look 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.820
 spectacular as well to download 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.520
 this application I recommend you 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.800
 download up many toy already recognize 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.330
 and I will not say what 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.580
 this application works 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.320
 this application what it does is download 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.100
 the payment applications totally 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.049
 free 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 as well as free applications 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.920
 but that's not going to work for us because 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.610
 We can download them directly from the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.290
 google page 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.080
 in this case I want to mark the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.750
 updates that I have available 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.430
 we can update them or leave them like this 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.740
 I do not recommend that you update all of them 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.540
 what 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.270
 here it tells me that I have an update 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.479
 of whatsapp and on google plane not the 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 I have can I cook faults or the 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.850
 device to slow 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.579
 well the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.289
 is to download rapture and once 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.640

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.369
 device we are going to look for a 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.060
 application called h 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060
 here you 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:59.650
 sorry chew that is this 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:03.690
 hk team manager had forgotten his name 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:08.100
 and well we are going to download it 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.580
 I'm from batoy, we're looking for help 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.580
 girl 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.870
 t 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.879
 a manager 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.580
 here is in case you do not get them 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.850
 no result what they have to do 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.220
 is to press the search button more 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.310
 and the neighborhoods redirect to a 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.570
 website on which you can 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.570
 the application is already 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.870
 as you can see here there are already several 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.870
 versions 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.600
 I recommend that you download the 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.880
 latest version in this case we can see 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.580
 that one is version 3 and the other is the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.130
 7 appears to them here he recommended that 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.670
 download version 7 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.290
 here after they proceed to give install them 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.170
 will request superuser's permission 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.140
 accept and install it well once 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.400
 installed we activate it in the expo module 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.590
 set 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.550
 we are going to expose ourselves we go to the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 module section 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.160
 and peace we send it once that's done 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.880
 I recommend that you restart the 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.880
 device 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.549
 and once on 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.549

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.939
 in once installed the h in the we are going to 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.620
 proceed to download a file that will 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:58.550
 I'm going to leave the description of the video that 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:02.900

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.970

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.729
 team manager 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:30.129
 and what they are going to do is activate the theme 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.999
 but apparently they are selected 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.999
 and they give him 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.650
 select this 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.120
 and then bounce 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.120
 I will not do it because I already have it 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.770

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.770
