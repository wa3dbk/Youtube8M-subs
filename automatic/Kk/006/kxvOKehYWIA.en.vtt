rushed in coming down the ridge to the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.020 
rushed in coming down the ridge to the
thicket

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.810 

but<00:01:35.030> once<00:01:35.330> he<00:01:35.630> reached<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.140> thicket<00:01:36.820> he
