00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 Hello and welcome to a new multiplayer 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.110
 Game around 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.520
 my first 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.439
 Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer game 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.119
 So the first round 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.799
 many wanted to do it 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.390
 "I really want to be the first player after all 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.249
 to be sold over professional 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.359
 For this software SAF competition that changed 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.759
 around 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.630
 I have to say 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.829
 Black Ops is a lot of fun for me 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.309
 to do this 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.319
 I'm definitely asking you better now than Modern Warfare 2 is easy 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.230
 again so 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.320
 it is as beautiful as Call of Duty 4 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.850
 Silver is this case is beautiful hike itself 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.990
 the submachine guns 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.020
 like the ORF bathing beach in a good mood 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.370
 further plans would not be so good 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.410
 not bad professions 2 which he simply loaded Euro pretty much every precipitation 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.780
 Percent abound is all very many balloons per cent 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.390
 Transplanted distance 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.880
 the stanzas finally celebrate the structures again as they are then 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.860
 just stupid the varied is I would be so you prefer short percent 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.130
 Bushido is made ono and rugged tone and it will 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 is it you can do that yes I want her judgment on Wednesday 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.060
 the tournament much improved Tan 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.230
 the wait 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.380
 Gampern percent all huge on IT pumping petting chairman Ben Bernanke 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.300
 and 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.800
 that would scarcely me want my Super Glandorf 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.760
 Hofbieber show the otherwise so reserved feeling yes 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760
 but still something to do Schedler 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.020
 be there 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 but somehow many videos on YouTube prove that you will get open 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.030
 "It's just so hard now 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 that is the way the coach appreciates 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.479
 Personally, I find it good because Modern Warfare 2 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.030
 that this whole horde of Beatrix structure made a good two-thirds per game 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.959
 Lights totally happy him and what ultimately but here was really focus be that 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.209
 Soon, the fit was not too difficult 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.360
 and that was just shit and then he was the best at all the people 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.359
 Hartges Doctor preserves or quite so far the Bonn nuggets 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029
 the right direction so pious 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.139
 I think that flows here the world economy 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.869
 otherwise 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.169
 the graphics I like 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:37.400
 and to be on Brauchitsch also so I have the feeling you need now 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.399
 more about 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.449
 Consumption is the hustle and bustle to bring order 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.289
 For this one has become delinquent Fox 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.699

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:06.959
 yes, three shots dead 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.980
 with her plane where flows without incident 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.569
 therefore has 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.959
 Being bypassed over the easy retirement age will be loving 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.369
