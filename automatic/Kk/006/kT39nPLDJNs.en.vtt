00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.519
 hobby 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 who already has another model does not know that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.410
 configure it does not know which arrowp 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080

 more specific much more advanced 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.840
 thing taken from formula 1 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.510
 adapted to discharge the model that does not 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 there are these techniques for the model is 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.099
 Who knows, it 's just another person. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.239
 since paul robb choose the model 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 buy scale from 1 to 10 1 for e 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340

 effectively someone has seen 111 traits 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:07.049
 make a curve like that there for you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.939
 start in the bigger curve hobby hobby 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.580
 everyone says that traffic does not 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.830
 curve 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 mainly this model that is the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.080
 14 tea with some special adjustments 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.160
 50 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.650
 It's good, where I usually send it. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.030
 the staff is also impressed with 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.890
 a stand 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.810
 So well it's so well calibrated 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.490
 start talking about who you want 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 get into the hobby 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.740
 Yesterday the way I want to enter the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.869
 I buy a branch that I do what I 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:48.110
 I have today with is in the market today it exists 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.130
 several models of some model 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.979
 this one is a 10 11 goals because a goal 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.580
 of own renê to walk in high 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.610
 speed is a lower car is a 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.850
 car that has canal place more 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.090
 specific 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.750
 an artist a parking lot that is 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.780
 good 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.030
 So you're in doubt and you can 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.610
 choose which buy to see what you 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.040
 Likes you like it and off road and 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.710
 those balls long bumper week 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.760
 where he will ride on the asphalt is not 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.130
 so cool 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.590
 so as soon as she on a grass a clue 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.410
 of land to walk at last is the car 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.500
 designed for this 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.500
 I will show and now some pictures of some 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 models have on the market today. 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.040
 the myriad of models that have 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.820
 for you to choose where you're going to walk 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.950
 What do you want for yourself? 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.640
 adapt the better way because you will 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:01.290
 use you will need to compose there 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.020
 a model album not all come with all 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.220
 the accessories that neither in my here by 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:13.160
 example mine he already has here match 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.960
 electric and has heating candle 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 when you press a button and 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.550
 he already on departure and heats favela 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.180
 alone is mine is a car a little more 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.820
 practice is a little bad that I go 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.950
 explain in the videos later on leave 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.750
 in high center of gravity but this 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.720
 here it is for those who are starting 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.090
 my time what others do not have and the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.060
 that you will need by buying a 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.660
 path that has no electric start 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.350
 has automatic knowledge 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.450
 he's coming or a string record for 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.800
 You're pulling and you're going to need 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.800
 a candle heater 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.650
 you put the candle heater in the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.130
 head and leaves beautiful well incandescent 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.920
 and stays here in the gasoline sports engine a 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.860
 Contact Us | 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.030
 the table you're pulling the quick stop him 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.920
 starts to run the fuel that goes 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.590
 here in the gas tank 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.470
 We put this here to facilitate 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.859
 the tank opening 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.470
 you open it up and put gas one 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.700
 driver that is a little bit that I 'm going to 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.700
 be dropping the picture there 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.509
 you put gasoline inside that 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:38.259
 container is in the tank is 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:46.830
 two ways to give to make way 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:49.389
 call is me blow here in the exhaust 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.819
 blowing in the exhaust has a 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:56.080
 hose that the fuel people of the 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.979
 tank by the carburetor and the one that makes 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.199
 the mixture 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.199
 You see the gasoline hose that is just 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.770
 give the normal start that more than you 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.770
 will need 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:09.159
 in my case I'm using a pack of 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.439
 Tadeu battery 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.800
 When you bought the model, it comes with 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.990
 a four- battery non-battery daughter kit 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.639
 I advise because it lasts a short time all the time. 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.520
 Do you have a car carrying this here? 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:24.039
 A long time, this is where it's from 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.279
 prepared to be the digital it consumes 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.349
 a lot of energy is what you are going 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:33.009
 be needing there to walk with your 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:36.729
 another model will need a radio 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.289
 radio transmitter that you have today. 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.319
 in the world 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.909
 there the staff is not much at all 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.939
 sophisticated but not all 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:48.809
 settings for you are hitting the 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:50.460
 fun setting acceleration the brake is 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:52.680
 brain extension 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.809
 all that will be talked about more forward 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.699
 This is just for you to know. 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:00.270
 You'll need it so you can walk. 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:05.039
 with your other model, people, thanks 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.960
 for now it is the boyacá developing the 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.849
 videos there that are trying to dictate 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.789
 The best way possible for you is 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.039
 understanding where I want to go 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.110
 just so you have an idea there nobody 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:22.860
 will talk about ballast in some model 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:26.129
 download the center of this here or download the 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.139
 center of gravity weight distribution 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.709
 Of car 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.899
 all this influences even more than 

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:37.409
 What are you hitting at? 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:39.610
 alignment of the well-balanced car 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.939
 Can you make a curve? 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.889
 kept stable on the straight come out excellent 

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:47.919
 today was more is that the people know the 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:51.310
 who is tall died how it works and the 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:54.460
 what do you need and where are you going? 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.229
 yesterday a lane near my house but 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.889
 I can move to a lane. 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:07:03.580
 next metal wants a car where a 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.800
 car unless you buy one 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.750
 car of this problem on the asphalt as in 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.199
 front of house gives a chance look 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:13.930
 How do you stay? 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:18.849
 he rips everything up here every time he picks up 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:21.849
 end is not very advisable is that there 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:25.469
 people until the next video sign up for 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:28.300
 channel of a rare jewel 

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:29.349
 accompanying the sister of doubts questions 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.580
 that people will be solving 

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:36.430
 riding videos 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.430
 It's good to leave, it 's just the basics for staff.
