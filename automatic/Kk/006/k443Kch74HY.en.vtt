00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
percent chance of getting my seed back

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
percent chance of getting my seed back
whilst<00:01:38.850> doing<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.720> farming<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.650> is

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
whilst doing you know farming which is

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.499 
whilst doing you know farming which is
definitely<00:01:40.950> something<00:01:41.310> I've<00:01:41.520> been<00:01:41.700> getting

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
definitely something I've been getting

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.030 
definitely something I've been getting
the<00:01:42.960> benefits<00:01:43.409> from<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> long<00:01:44.009> run

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the benefits from in the long run

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
the benefits from in the long run
because<00:01:44.820> ten<00:01:45.060> percent<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.659> definitely<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> huge

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
because ten percent is definitely a huge

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
because ten percent is definitely a huge
savings<00:01:47.040> along<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.520> which<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.270> much

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
savings along the way which pretty much

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
savings along the way which pretty much
means<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.840> making<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.350> extra<00:01:49.740> ten<00:01:50.040> percent

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
means are making an extra ten percent

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
means are making an extra ten percent
profit<00:01:50.640> which<00:01:51.600> we're<00:01:51.899> now<00:01:51.990> looking<00:01:52.110> at<00:01:52.380> over

worth using and also super compost it's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.429 
worth using and also super compost it's
great<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.509> gives<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.140> high
