00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
shows me what part of the map that isn't

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.890 
shows me what part of the map that isn't
an<00:02:52.489> actually<00:02:52.850> looking<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.750> can

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
an actually looking at and that can

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.009 
an actually looking at and that can
change<00:02:54.230> us<00:02:54.440> any<00:02:54.709> number<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.400> ways<00:02:55.750> but<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.840> I'm

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
change us any number of ways but if I'm

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.840 
change us any number of ways but if I'm
doing<00:02:57.049> this<00:02:57.530> cell<00:02:57.829> by<00:02:58.010> cell<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.700> always

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
doing this cell by cell I can always

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.090 
doing this cell by cell I can always
come<00:02:59.090> back<00:02:59.150> later<00:02:59.329> I<00:02:59.870> can<00:03:00.410> look<00:03:00.620> at<00:03:00.739> my<00:03:00.860> fuel

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
come back later I can look at my fuel

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.180 
come back later I can look at my fuel
graph<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.760> can<00:03:01.940> say<00:03:02.180> okay<00:03:02.829> what<00:03:03.829> do<00:03:03.890> we<00:03:03.950> have

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
graph and I can say okay what do we have

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.380 
graph and I can say okay what do we have
here<00:03:04.370> let's<00:03:04.549> make<00:03:04.760> sure<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.030> don't<00:03:05.180> have

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
here let's make sure I don't have

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.509 
here let's make sure I don't have
anything<00:03:05.660> crazy<00:03:06.019> in<00:03:06.200> there<00:03:06.410> now<00:03:07.130> you'll<00:03:07.310> see

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
anything crazy in there now you'll see

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.940 
anything crazy in there now you'll see
where<00:03:07.670> I<00:03:07.700> put<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:07.970> 1068<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:09.709> only<00:03:09.829> gonna

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
where I put that 1068 it's only gonna

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.830 
where I put that 1068 it's only gonna
pop<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> in<00:03:10.459> there<00:03:10.610> in<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.760> section<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.780> I

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
pop it in there in that section so I

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.539 
pop it in there in that section so I
want<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:12.140> go<00:03:12.230> back<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.829> want<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.100> smooth<00:03:13.370> out

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
want to go back and I want to smooth out

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.400 
want to go back and I want to smooth out
this<00:03:13.700> map<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.360> consistent<00:03:15.140> fuel

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
this map so I have a consistent fuel

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.800 
this map so I have a consistent fuel
strategy<00:03:15.890> throughout<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:16.880> run

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.860 

I<00:03:21.610> was<00:03:22.610> able<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.060> roll<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.300> car<00:03:23.599> on<00:03:23.840> the

I was able just to roll a car on the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.990 
I was able just to roll a car on the

dyno and just leave the learning feature

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.720 
dyno and just leave the learning feature
on<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:27.290> know<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.620> learned<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.310> basically

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
on and you know it learned it basically

table<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.330> can<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.660> go<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.870> apply<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.200> to

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
table you can just go and apply it to

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.530 
table you can just go and apply it to
the<00:03:36.470> base<00:03:36.620> table<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.190> automatically<00:03:38.150> correct

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
the base table and automatically correct

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.030 
the base table and automatically correct
and<00:03:38.720> all<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.019> takes<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.560> a<00:03:39.590> little<00:03:39.860> bit<00:03:39.950> of

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
and all it is takes is a little bit of

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.860 
and all it is takes is a little bit of
driving<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.940> know<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.360> know<00:03:41.450> five<00:03:41.690> ten

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
driving you know you know five ten

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.750 
driving you know you know five ten
minutes<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.230> driving<00:03:42.440> on<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.190> rollers<00:03:43.550> or

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
minutes of driving on the rollers or

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.339 
minutes of driving on the rollers or
even<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.150> street<00:03:44.450> car<00:03:44.569> on<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> street<00:03:45.140> and

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
even on a street car on the street and

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.780 
even on a street car on the street and
it'll<00:03:45.620> learn<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.250> take<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.610> learning

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
it'll learn it you take that learning

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.880 
it'll learn it you take that learning
table<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.330> apply<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.840> main<00:03:47.989> table<00:03:48.319> and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
table and apply it to the main table and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.680 
table and apply it to the main table and
it'll<00:03:49.099> just<00:03:49.280> basically<00:03:49.970> set<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.330> whole<00:03:50.480> car

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
it'll just basically set the whole car

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.710 
it'll just basically set the whole car

give you another sensor to it you can

give you another sensor to it you can
run<00:04:10.940> two<00:04:11.269> o2<00:04:11.420> sensors<00:04:12.110> so<00:04:12.500> we<00:04:12.590> can<00:04:12.709> actually

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
run two o2 sensors so we can actually

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.820 
run two o2 sensors so we can actually
see<00:04:13.310> bank-to-bank<00:04:14.410> especially<00:04:15.410> with<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.530> car

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
see bank-to-bank especially with a car

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.379 
see bank-to-bank especially with a car
where<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.130> exhaust<00:04:16.519> is<00:04:16.790> switch<00:04:17.090> and

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
where the exhaust is switch and

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.509 
where the exhaust is switch and
separated<00:04:18.380> out<00:04:18.530> now<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:19.070> can<00:04:19.190> see<00:04:19.340> what<00:04:19.430> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
separated out now you can see what the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.170 
separated out now you can see what the
right<00:04:19.760> bank<00:04:20.030> does<00:04:20.269> what<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.810> left<00:04:21.049> bank<00:04:21.320> does

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.460 

so<00:04:29.180> as<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.420> can<00:04:29.540> see<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> system<00:04:30.380> that

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
so as you can see this is a system that

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.110 
so as you can see this is a system that
can<00:04:30.560> control<00:04:30.920> at<00:04:31.040> nitrous<00:04:31.340> or<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.580> turbo<00:04:31.970> engine

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
can control at nitrous or a turbo engine

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.510
