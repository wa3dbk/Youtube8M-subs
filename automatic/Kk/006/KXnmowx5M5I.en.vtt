00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.320
 the calligraphy to one of the arts more 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.360
 ancient of history today goes through a 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.700
 difficult time because of the big 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.230
 graphic advances in technology 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.599
 we tell about the efforts that they make 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:44.379
 some latin artists to rescue 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:46.030
 this art the art of good writing 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.309
 it is one of the most 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.890
 representative of the culture example of 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.870
 it has been the Chinese who created their own 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.510
 alphabet based on beauty 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.040
 visual of the ideograms meanwhile the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.290
 western writing whose origins 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.900
 come from Latin today in 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.489
 scrolls continues to decorate and endow 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.489
 of singularity to each writing 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 currently artists seek to save 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.860
 this form of expression that for some is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.350
 a hobby and for others a profession 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.869
 they give importance and use in 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.330
 diverse applications from writing and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.840
 seal letters up to graph their graphs 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 in cars and digital programs 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 recognized houses and fashion firms the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.530
 they use not only as an ornament but as a means 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 of remembrance among users 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.130
 applying it on prints for 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.110
 different accessories the calligraphy is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.630
 a way to differentiate and give 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.030
 identity to brands so each one 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.030
 It has a letter shape and special style 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.520
 the elements that must take into account 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.460
 it is first to know to what public it has 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.580
 directed your work depending on 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.550
 Who goes the job you have to have 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:02.230
 consider the way you do it the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.420
 technical elements materials 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.710
 and above all have the concept have 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 clear what you are going to do 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.720
 Its essence is to differentiate whoever 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.520
 he writes although he has gone from the pens to 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 the printing press later by machines 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.280
 write and now by computers follows 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.280
 being the same 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.300
 are these features under construction that I 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 they complement me a good 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.010
 display 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.230
 to write well mainly what 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.159
 it has been lost from the calligraphy are these 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.290
 beautiful characteristic features of this 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:50.390
 patience in doing it has been lost this 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.579
 notion to transcribe these words 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.959
 to the paper technology although it has 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.209
 Faced some designers 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.579
 graphics and calligraphers have taken advantage 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.349
 to explore alternative fields such as 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.989
 digitization of writings in 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.989
 virtual media video games and logos 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.210
 technology is trying to overshadow the 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.280
 calligraphy art 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.160
 however, keep in mind that never 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.350
 is going to lose we need 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.500
 for the human being to always write 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.990
 always at hand the technology gives a 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.030
 good adaptation in terms of 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.680
 visualization that I can obtain but 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.530
 these characteristic features that leaves the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.980
 calligraphy are really beautiful the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.440
 manifestation more beautiful as soon as 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.410
 to the letter as far as typography is concerned 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.900
 It becomes really what is at hand 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.150
 know that it is made by a person who 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.530
 it's not something that you can digitize and what 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.830
 is going to have everyone who does 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.660
 own and original just for you gives a lot 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.080
 I'm very pleased with the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.080
 people 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.470
 the manual art of writing is reinvented 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.690
 to evolve this time next to the 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.650
 technology and the crusades of designers 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.650
 latin graphics
