am<00:03:05.799> at<00:03:06.069> the<00:03:06.129> moment<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.519> know<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> age<00:03:06.879> of<00:03:06.909> 15

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
am at the moment you know the age of 15

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.780 
am at the moment you know the age of 15
16<00:03:07.720> year<00:03:07.959> olds<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.260> so<00:03:08.440> on<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:09.159> should<00:03:09.670> be

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
16 year olds and so on you should be

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.059 
16 year olds and so on you should be
able<00:03:09.909> to<00:03:10.150> do<00:03:10.239> different<00:03:10.690> subjects<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.739> I<00:03:11.859> mean

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
able to do different subjects but I mean

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.470 
able to do different subjects but I mean
that<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.609> if<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.879> want<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.209> lawyer

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
that that is if you want to be a lawyer

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.599 
that that is if you want to be a lawyer
like<00:03:13.629> I<00:03:13.959> want<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:14.590> example<00:03:15.099> I'm<00:03:15.340> very

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
like I want to do for example I'm very

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.610 
like I want to do for example I'm very
good<00:03:15.819> at<00:03:15.849> English<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.569> history<00:03:16.840> already<00:03:17.530> I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
good at English and history already I

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.259 
good at English and history already I
mean<00:03:17.709> I'm<00:03:17.950> good<00:03:18.160> at<00:03:18.280> those<00:03:18.430> subjects<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.180> that

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
mean I'm good at those subjects and that

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.180 
mean I'm good at those subjects and that
obviously<00:03:19.450> comes<00:03:19.840> into<00:03:20.139> a<00:03:20.169> lot<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.440> use<00:03:20.799> at<00:03:21.010> law

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
obviously comes into a lot of use at law

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.069 
obviously comes into a lot of use at law
then<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.150> also<00:03:22.299> have<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.569> be<00:03:22.720> good<00:03:22.840> at<00:03:22.900> other

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
then you also have to be good at other

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.839 
then you also have to be good at other
things<00:03:23.200> like<00:03:23.590> debating<00:03:23.919> now<00:03:24.340> I'm<00:03:24.459> really<00:03:24.730> good

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
things like debating now I'm really good

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.390 
things like debating now I'm really good
at<00:03:24.880> debating<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.930> imagine<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:26.620> instead<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.220> a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
at debating it imagine if instead of a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.009 
at debating it imagine if instead of a
biology<00:03:28.000> lesson<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.359> week<00:03:28.510> because<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.959> know

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
biology lesson a week because I know

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.229 
biology lesson a week because I know
perfect<00:03:29.590> already<00:03:30.010> I'm<00:03:30.190> addict<00:03:30.579> I'm<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.940> data

perfect already I'm addict I'm a data

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.089 
perfect already I'm addict I'm a data
science<00:03:31.629> is<00:03:31.750> pretty<00:03:31.930> much<00:03:32.200> and<00:03:32.709> I'm<00:03:32.829> really

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099

some really boring shit like that where
it's<00:04:00.099> really<00:04:00.370> annoying<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.329> know<00:04:01.510> you're

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
it's really annoying you you know you're

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
never going to use it again imagine if

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.830 
never going to use it again imagine if
you<00:04:03.549> could<00:04:03.669> have<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.910> debating<00:04:04.389> lesson<00:04:04.660> for

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you could have the debating lesson for

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.259 
you could have the debating lesson for
example<00:04:05.319> if<00:04:05.799> you<00:04:05.919> wanted<00:04:06.040> to<00:04:06.340> be<00:04:06.519> at<00:04:06.879> an

and I want you to dar Adal school for
example<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.389> have<00:04:16.449> to<00:04:16.660> pick<00:04:16.840> four<00:04:17.079> subjects

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
example you have to pick four subjects

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.170 
example you have to pick four subjects
and<00:04:17.829> then<00:04:17.979> after<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.340> first<00:04:18.579> year<00:04:18.669> you<00:04:18.940> can

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
and then after the first year you can

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.240 
and then after the first year you can
drop<00:04:19.389> one<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.109> already<00:04:20.260> know<00:04:20.530> what<00:04:20.799> I<00:04:20.829> want<00:04:21.130> to

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
drop one so already know what I want to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.320 
drop one so already know what I want to
do<00:04:21.370> while<00:04:21.549> them<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.820> do<00:04:21.969> in

literature politics and history and then
obviously<00:04:25.629> for<00:04:26.080> a<00:04:26.259> fourth<00:04:26.530> one<00:04:26.770> I'm<00:04:26.949> going<00:04:27.099> to

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:27.189 
obviously for a fourth one I'm going to

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:28.409 
obviously for a fourth one I'm going to
choose<00:04:27.340> something<00:04:27.610> else<00:04:27.849> I<00:04:28.030> might<00:04:28.180> choose

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
choose something else I might choose

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.909 
choose something else I might choose
geography<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.960> might<00:04:29.229> choose<00:04:29.409> Spanish<00:04:29.620> for

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
geography I might choose Spanish for

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.350

they just can't graph if you look at a

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.610 
they just can't graph if you look at a
question<00:05:09.759> seven<00:05:10.270> hours<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:11.020> still<00:05:11.259> can't<00:05:11.409> get
