00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.880 

alright<00:00:03.540> Paul<00:00:03.720> let's<00:00:03.959> see<00:00:04.110> what<00:00:04.259> we<00:00:04.350> got<00:00:04.529> if<00:00:04.770> I

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
alright Paul let's see what we got if I

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.849 
alright Paul let's see what we got if I
put<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.250> level<00:00:05.520> across<00:00:05.879> this<00:00:06.270> hump

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:06.859 
put the level across this hump

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.339 
put the level across this hump
this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.040> heaved<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.580> almost<00:00:09.030> two<00:00:09.360> inches<00:00:09.660> is

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
this is heaved up almost two inches is

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.049 
this is heaved up almost two inches is
there<00:00:10.500> anything<00:00:10.679> we<00:00:10.860> can<00:00:10.980> do<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> fix<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.490> well

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there anything we can do to fix it well

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.209 
there anything we can do to fix it well
it's<00:00:12.210> an<00:00:12.360> asphalt<00:00:12.900> walkway<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.009> real

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it's an asphalt walkway and it's in real

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's an asphalt walkway and it's in real
good<00:00:14.429> condition<00:00:14.490> other<00:00:15.059> than<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.599> spot

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
good condition other than for this spot

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.609 
good condition other than for this spot
right<00:00:16.170> here

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
right here

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.490 
right here
so<00:00:17.010> asphalt<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.760> fairly<00:00:18.090> easy<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.539> patch<00:00:18.869> much

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
so asphalt is fairly easy to patch much

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.830 
so asphalt is fairly easy to patch much
easier<00:00:19.859> than<00:00:20.039> concrete<00:00:20.460> would<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
easier than concrete would be but the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.330 
easier than concrete would be but the
first<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> do<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.920> find<00:00:23.130> out

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
first thing we have to do is find out

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.310 
first thing we have to do is find out
just<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.850> big<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.269> root<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.930> get<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.109> out

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
just how big that root is and get it out

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
just how big that root is and get it out
of<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.640> now<00:00:26.640> if<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
of this now if you look here this is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
of this now if you look here this is
about<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:28.050> three<00:00:28.500> inch<00:00:28.710> diameter<00:00:28.980> root<00:00:29.640> that's

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
about a three inch diameter root that's

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.420 
about a three inch diameter root that's
not<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> major<00:00:30.660> root<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> tree<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.679> size<00:00:31.890> we

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
not a major root for a tree this size we

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.729 
not a major root for a tree this size we
cut<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:32.969> clean<00:00:33.270> it'll<00:00:33.750> heal<00:00:33.960> properly<00:00:34.290> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
cut it off clean it'll heal properly and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.470 
cut it off clean it'll heal properly and
this<00:00:34.800> tree<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.280> fine<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
this tree will be fine I'm just going to

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.850 
this tree will be fine I'm just going to
take<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.840> hand<00:00:37.140> saw<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.710> start<00:00:38.250> underneath

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
take my hand saw and start underneath

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.619 
take my hand saw and start underneath
now<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.219> root<00:00:41.430> cut<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.820> both<00:00:42.210> sides

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
now with that root cut on both sides

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.420 
now with that root cut on both sides
what<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> cut<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> asphalt

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
what I want to do is cut the asphalt

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.479 
what I want to do is cut the asphalt
right<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> cut<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
right here and we're going to cut it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.260 
right here and we're going to cut it
right<00:00:47.879> here

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
right here

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.410 
right here
that<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> dig<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.770> root<00:00:49.980> Oh

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.270 

Paul<00:00:56.200> we're<00:00:56.350> down<00:00:56.470> through<00:00:56.740> both<00:00:56.950> layers<00:00:57.160> of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
Paul we're down through both layers of

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.010 
Paul we're down through both layers of
asphalt<00:00:57.580> we<00:00:58.030> just<00:00:58.210> got<00:00:58.360> to<00:00:58.450> clean<00:00:58.720> up<00:00:58.900> these

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
asphalt we just got to clean up these

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.740 
asphalt we just got to clean up these
little<00:00:59.380> pieces<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.830> are<00:01:00.070> left<00:01:00.190> behind<00:01:00.750> what

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
little pieces that are left behind what

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.880 
little pieces that are left behind what
we're<00:01:01.870> going<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.080> do<00:01:02.170> is<00:01:02.290> we're<00:01:02.410> going<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.560> dig

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
we're going to do is we're going to dig

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.950 
we're going to do is we're going to dig
down<00:01:03.160> and<00:01:03.460> expose<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:04.150> root<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.600> we<00:01:04.629> can<00:01:04.839> get

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
down and expose this root so we can get

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.950 
down and expose this root so we can get
it<00:01:05.110> out<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:10.570> right

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
it out all right

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
it out all right
let's<00:01:11.200> see<00:01:11.320> if<00:01:11.410> it'll<00:01:11.560> come<00:01:11.710> out<00:01:16.050> look<00:01:17.050> at<00:01:17.200> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
let's see if it'll come out look at that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.510 
let's see if it'll come out look at that
all<00:01:20.350> right<00:01:20.380> now<00:01:20.500> what<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:21.010> need<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.220> do<00:01:21.400> is

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
all right now what we need to do is

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.280 
all right now what we need to do is
start<00:01:21.760> building<00:01:22.240> up<00:01:22.630> so<00:01:22.780> we<00:01:22.900> can<00:01:23.020> get<00:01:23.140> up<00:01:23.260> to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
start building up so we can get up to

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.840 
start building up so we can get up to
the<00:01:23.410> level<00:01:23.650> where<00:01:23.920> we'll<00:01:24.100> put<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.430> our<00:01:24.550> asphalt

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
the level where we'll put in our asphalt

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.170 
the level where we'll put in our asphalt
we<00:01:25.780> have<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.080> compact<00:01:26.740> all<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.250> soil<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.820> we<00:01:27.970> do

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
we have to compact all the soil as we do

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.630 
we have to compact all the soil as we do
that<00:01:28.390> usually<00:01:29.110> I'd<00:01:29.259> use<00:01:29.500> this<00:01:29.740> manual<00:01:30.369> plate

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
that usually I'd use this manual plate

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.249 
that usually I'd use this manual plate
compactor<00:01:30.910> where<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.570> just<00:01:31.780> come<00:01:31.930> in<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.170> you

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
compactor where you just come in and you

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.440 
compactor where you just come in and you
pack<00:01:32.530> everything<00:01:32.770> down<00:01:33.280> but<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:33.910> trench<00:01:34.270> is

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
pack everything down but this trench is

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.150 
pack everything down but this trench is
so<00:01:34.600> small<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:35.320> would<00:01:35.530> go<00:01:35.770> at<00:01:35.920> an<00:01:36.040> angle

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
so small that it would go at an angle

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.010 
so small that it would go at an angle
and<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.520> wouldn't<00:01:36.880> get<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.150> full<00:01:37.360> compaction

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
and we wouldn't get the full compaction

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.390 
and we wouldn't get the full compaction
we<00:01:38.140> wanted<00:01:38.530> so<00:01:38.950> if<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.130> grab<00:01:39.369> that

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
we wanted so if you grab that

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.920 
we wanted so if you grab that
sledgehammer<00:01:39.880> behind<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:40.690> I'm<00:01:40.780> going<00:01:40.899> to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
sledgehammer behind you and I'm going to

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.810 
sledgehammer behind you and I'm going to
grab<00:01:41.140> mine<00:01:41.380> we're<00:01:42.220> going<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.399> go<00:01:42.520> right<00:01:42.700> around

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
grab mine we're going to go right around

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.330 
grab mine we're going to go right around
this<00:01:43.149> trench<00:01:43.540> making<00:01:44.530> sure<00:01:44.680> everything's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
this trench making sure everything's

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.469 
this trench making sure everything's
completely<00:01:46.240> compact<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.759> is<00:01:51.910> called<00:01:52.149> pack

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
completely compact this is called pack

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.780 
completely compact this is called pack
it's<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.899> mixture<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.290> stone<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.070> stone<00:01:54.399> dust

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
it's a mixture of stone and stone dust

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.620 
it's a mixture of stone and stone dust
and<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.750> will<00:01:55.960> pack<00:01:56.290> up<00:01:56.560> hot<00:01:56.950> as<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.190> rock<00:02:00.630> Paul

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
and it will pack up hot as a rock Paul

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.910 
and it will pack up hot as a rock Paul
that<00:02:01.840> looks<00:02:02.020> pretty<00:02:02.200> good<00:02:02.320> you've<00:02:02.620> got<00:02:02.650> it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
that looks pretty good you've got it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.010 
that looks pretty good you've got it
really<00:02:03.370> compact<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.360> depth<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.990> just

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
really compact and the depth is just

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.930 
really compact and the depth is just
about<00:02:05.740> where<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.040> want<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.549> for<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.790> new

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
about where I want it for the new

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.000 
about where I want it for the new
asphalt<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:08.019> one<00:02:08.170> thing<00:02:08.320> I<00:02:08.410> wanted<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.769> show

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 
asphalt the one thing I wanted to show

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.620 
asphalt the one thing I wanted to show
you<00:02:09.070> see<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.549> edges<00:02:09.880> where<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:10.239> chipped<00:02:10.510> it

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
you see the edges where we chipped it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.870 
you see the edges where we chipped it
out<00:02:10.780> they're<00:02:11.380> really<00:02:11.799> ragged<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.670> makes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
out they're really ragged and it makes

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.090 
out they're really ragged and it makes
it<00:02:13.030> hard<00:02:13.239> for<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.510> new<00:02:13.720> asphalt<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.440> attach<00:02:14.799> to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
it hard for the new asphalt to attach to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.890 
it hard for the new asphalt to attach to
it<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.400> then<00:02:15.489> get<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.730> fully<00:02:16.030> compacted<00:02:16.750> there

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
it and then get it fully compacted there

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.810 
it and then get it fully compacted there
so<00:02:17.410> what<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.650> need<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.580> cut

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
so what we need to do is we need to cut

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.430 
so what we need to do is we need to cut
a<00:02:18.850> nice<00:02:19.120> straight<00:02:19.480> edge<00:02:19.510> we're<00:02:20.049> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.260> take

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
a nice straight edge we're going to take

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.210 
a nice straight edge we're going to take
the<00:02:20.760> level<00:02:21.840> run<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.959> across<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.650> I'm<00:02:23.769> holding

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the level run it across now I'm holding

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
the level run it across now I'm holding
it<00:02:24.340> back<00:02:24.549> because<00:02:24.760> look<00:02:25.090> here<00:02:25.360> there's<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
it back because look here there's a

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.990 
it back because look here there's a
little<00:02:26.049> rise<00:02:26.290> right<00:02:26.739> there<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.430> definite

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
little rise right there and a definite

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
little rise right there and a definite
flare<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.780> here<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> want<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.470> cut<00:02:29.680> those<00:02:29.860> off

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
flare right here I want to cut those off

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.530 
flare right here I want to cut those off
so<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.489> when<00:02:30.640> we<00:02:30.760> put<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> new<00:02:31.330> asphalt

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
so that when we put in the new asphalt

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.080 
so that when we put in the new asphalt
it's<00:02:32.049> nice<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.590> level<00:02:32.739> with<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> old<00:02:33.250> I'm

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it's nice and level with the old I'm

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.410 
it's nice and level with the old I'm
just<00:02:34.269> going<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.420> mock<00:02:34.660> out<00:02:34.900> that<00:02:35.110> line<00:02:36.420> is

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
just going to mock out that line is

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.449 
just going to mock out that line is
where<00:02:37.780> I<00:02:37.840> want<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.110> make<00:02:38.290> my<00:02:38.470> cut<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:39.040> order<00:02:39.370> to

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
where I want to make my cut in order to

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.640 
where I want to make my cut in order to
make<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.760> nice<00:02:40.060> clean<00:02:40.390> cut<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.590> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
make that nice clean cut I'm going to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.789 
make that nice clean cut I'm going to
use<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.250> worm<00:02:42.640> drive<00:02:42.970> saw<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.690> has<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> 7<00:02:44.620> inch

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
use this worm drive saw it has a 7 inch

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.740 
use this worm drive saw it has a 7 inch
diamond<00:02:45.250> blade<00:02:45.459> on<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> other

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
diamond blade on it and on the other

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.020 
diamond blade on it and on the other
side<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.440> has<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.620> water<00:02:48.040> attachment<00:02:48.459> where<00:02:48.910> it

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
side it has a water attachment where it

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.450 
side it has a water attachment where it
allowed<00:02:49.269> me<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.450> feed<00:02:49.810> water<00:02:50.170> rate<00:02:50.590> down<00:02:50.830> on

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
allowed me to feed water rate down on

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.040 
allowed me to feed water rate down on
we're<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.460> bad<00:02:54.670> cut<00:02:54.910> there<00:02:55.120> huh<00:02:55.300> not<00:02:55.750> bad<00:02:55.780> at

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
we're not a bad cut there huh not bad at

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.480 
we're not a bad cut there huh not bad at
all<00:02:56.140> now<00:02:56.350> let's<00:02:56.590> see<00:02:56.740> if<00:02:56.830> we<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:56.980> take<00:02:57.340> an

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
all now let's see if we just take an

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.640 
all now let's see if we just take an
easy<00:02:57.880> with<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:58.270> there<00:02:59.050> that's<00:02:59.290> coming<00:02:59.440> up

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
easy with this there that's coming up

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.920 
easy with this there that's coming up
lift<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.280> little<00:03:00.400> bit<00:03:00.640> we'll<00:03:01.420> slide<00:03:01.720> it

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
lift up a little bit we'll slide it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.820 
lift up a little bit we'll slide it
forward<00:03:02.340> there<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.430> go<00:03:04.380> now<00:03:05.380> we<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.710> these

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
forward there we go now we have these

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.560 
forward there we go now we have these
nice<00:03:06.190> clean<00:03:06.610> edges<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.210> they're<00:03:07.330> going<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
nice clean edges and they're going to

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.050 
nice clean edges and they're going to
act<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:08.050> a<00:03:08.110> great<00:03:08.740> spot<00:03:09.040> for<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.340> new<00:03:09.550> asphalt

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
act as a great spot for the new asphalt

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.970 
act as a great spot for the new asphalt
to<00:03:10.210> push<00:03:10.540> again<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.050> we<00:03:11.170> can<00:03:11.200> really<00:03:11.620> get<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
to push again so we can really get it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.920 
to push again so we can really get it
compacted<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.210> on<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.510> edge<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.900> have

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
compacted but on this edge we have

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.200 
compacted but on this edge we have
nothing<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.680> hold<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.070> asphalt<00:03:15.490> in<00:03:15.820> so<00:03:16.060> it'll

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
nothing to hold the asphalt in so it'll

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.850 
nothing to hold the asphalt in so it'll
just<00:03:16.480> spread<00:03:16.630> out<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:17.290> won't<00:03:17.440> get<00:03:17.650> good

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
just spread out and we won't get good

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.800 
just spread out and we won't get good
compaction<00:03:18.310> so<00:03:19.090> what<00:03:19.270> we're<00:03:19.360> going<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.510> do<00:03:19.690> is

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
compaction so what we're going to do is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.810 
compaction so what we're going to do is
construct<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.530> temporary<00:03:21.040> form<00:03:21.430> we're<00:03:21.700> going

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
construct a temporary form we're going

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.330 
construct a temporary form we're going
to<00:03:21.880> take<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.180> two<00:03:22.420> by<00:03:22.600> six<00:03:22.950> pull<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.130> from

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
to take this two by six pull that from

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.680 
to take this two by six pull that from
you<00:03:24.460> there<00:03:24.670> I'm<00:03:24.940> just<00:03:25.210> going<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.450> take<00:03:25.660> some

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
you there I'm just going to take some

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.170 
you there I'm just going to take some
pieces<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.260> reinforcement<00:03:27.220> rod<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.670> drive<00:03:28.030> it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
pieces of reinforcement rod and drive it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.430 
pieces of reinforcement rod and drive it
down<00:03:28.210> behind<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:29.410> hold<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.830> in<00:03:29.920> place<00:03:31.440> that

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
down behind to hold it in place that

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.290 
down behind to hold it in place that
looks<00:03:32.650> good<00:03:32.860> what<00:03:33.610> we're<00:03:33.760> going<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.910> use<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
looks good what we're going to use the
