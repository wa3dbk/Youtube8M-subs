00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
of here now I'm gonna use a little

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.650 
of here now I'm gonna use a little
acetone<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:29.780> get<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.110> locally<00:03:31.420> east<00:03:32.420> but

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
acetone to get this locally east but
