00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 Hello everyone, Alex and today we are 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.940
 look here are such wonderful 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.340
 headphones called audi technique these 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.170
 than 50 and in this video I will say that they 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.929
 finally can present itself and of course 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.240
 same as they sound let's not lose 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.010
 go time complete go yourself 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.080
 professional headphone adapter 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 connectors 6 3 mm and case and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.100
 carrying seeming you are a bag of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.869
 quality and enjoyable vinyl such 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.580
 the case is most compact and comfortable when 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.170
 constant use headphones 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.300
 mainly consist of plastic with 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.679
 small metal inserts 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.570
 The headbands are made of soft and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.100
 there is no pleasant to the touch leatherette 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.840
 some outstanding design 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.350
 items looks all utilitarian but with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.940
 by taste 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.590
 But Varna is more likely not only with 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.629
 headphones look like and how they sit on 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.640
 no problem in this case 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.590
 rotating in two planes of a cup 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 adjustable headband and not very strong 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.719
 head clamp provides high 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.460
 comfort 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 headphones sit very comfortable like 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 promised designs are closed so that already 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 with long-term use of headphones 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.199
 a little sweat but discomfort after an hour 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.300
 2 I did not notice because the design 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.809
 foldable headphones can be folded cups 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.910
 inside 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.710
 you can distinguish the left earpiece from the right 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.460
 cable that goes from the left cup to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 large inscriptions 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.720
 lr black on silver 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.520
 background cable is twisted so what is the length 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.140
 varies from a meter to three 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 cable can not be replaced without disassembling 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.770
 Headphone is a bit unpleasant but not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.900
 critical the wire itself is very reliable 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.790
 63 thick adapter kit 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 millimeter screw this very 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.360
 convenient let's talk about the very 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.180
 the main thing when it comes to headphones 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.310
 This is of course how they sound headphones 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 audio-technica these than 50 perhaps 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.520
 is the model that maximizes 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.530
 close to the golden mean 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.060
 they are so baldinas that 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 I want to listen and listen 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.740
 they have all deep fast 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.729
 distinct bass natural sounding 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.619
 legible mids 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.659
 as well as pronounced detailed 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.549
 high frequencies in general all that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.180
 must be present in the dream headphones 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.070
 audi technique these than 50 has int n 38 m 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 which is not much but again not so little 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.430
 as it may seem at first glance 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.259
 headphones sound good on the weak 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.180
 sources and in any case will produce 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.180
 you have a pretty good impression 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.679
 but if you have the opportunity then I would 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.480
 advised to get a device with 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.489
 a powerful source of how with her headphones 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.380
 play in a completely different colors 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.030
 I use headphones for about a year 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.370
 no complaints while using 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.110
 I did not have the same way I tried you 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 see the flaws of this model but come 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.580
 to the conclusion that they are simply not there 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.230
 insanely popular in our country as well 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.940
 and abroad and for many reasons 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.860
 starts reliability and ending 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.780
 sound quality and considering the price at 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.459
 where you can buy them I boldly 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.530
 I can say that these headphones are 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.000
 one of the best in its class 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.590
 and I have it all if you 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.239
 liked put your finger up if 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.650
 want to see more in the world of technology
