so here's the problem soft spot in the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.990 
so here's the problem soft spot in the
deck<00:00:03.410> cracks<00:00:04.410> here<00:00:04.680> that<00:00:04.830> actually<00:00:05.009> leak<00:00:08.000> so

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
deck cracks here that actually leak so

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.209 
deck cracks here that actually leak so
I'm<00:00:09.059> going<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.269> try<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> repair<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:13.099> so<00:00:14.099> here

scissors put it into a container we'll
put<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.779> some<00:00:25.730> epoxy<00:00:26.730> resin<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.449> hardener<00:00:28.019> and

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
put in some epoxy resin and hardener and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.849 
put in some epoxy resin and hardener and
I'm<00:00:29.609> going<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.849> use<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.630> cabo<00:00:31.349> SIL

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I'm going to use some of this cabo SIL

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
I'm going to use some of this cabo SIL
which<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> thickener<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.780> not

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
which is a thickener that's not

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.459 
which is a thickener that's not
necessary<00:00:34.620> I'll<00:00:35.430> mix<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.149> put<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.170> into

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
necessary I'll mix it up put it into

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.639 
necessary I'll mix it up put it into
this<00:00:37.620> small<00:00:37.980> cup<00:00:38.329> I'll<00:00:39.329> use<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.899> syringe<00:00:40.350> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this small cup I'll use this syringe to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.529 
this small cup I'll use this syringe to
suck<00:00:40.920> some<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.660> up<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> syringe<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
suck some of it up into the syringe I

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.540 
suck some of it up into the syringe I
will<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> hole<00:00:46.140> drilled<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:47.129> larger

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
will have a hole drilled just larger

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.670 
will have a hole drilled just larger
than<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> end<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> syringe<00:00:48.600> into<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
than the end of the syringe into the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.600 
than the end of the syringe into the
boat's<00:00:49.950> hull<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:51.320> will<00:00:52.320> escort<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.890> resin<00:00:53.489> up

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
boat's hull I will escort the resin up

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.790 
boat's hull I will escort the resin up
inside<00:00:54.030> there<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.840> tape<00:00:55.170> over<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> hole

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
inside there and then tape over the hole

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.180 
inside there and then tape over the hole
with<00:00:56.100> some<00:00:56.789> masking<00:00:57.180> tape<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.190> hopefully

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
with some masking tape and hopefully

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
with some masking tape and hopefully
it'll<00:00:59.340> settle<00:01:00.020> into<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.199> region<00:01:01.620> where<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
it'll settle into that region where the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.329 
it'll settle into that region where the
hull<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> soft<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> here<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.739> region

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
hull is soft so here I have the region

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.480 
hull is soft so here I have the region
of<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> soft<00:01:06.060> spot<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> hole<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.310> it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
of the soft spot of the hole so it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.740 
of the soft spot of the hole so it's
down<00:01:08.939> at<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> lowest<00:01:10.320> point<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> boat<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
down at the lowest point of the boat and

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.940 
down at the lowest point of the boat and
I'm<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> drill<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> hole<00:01:13.380> right<00:01:13.590> in

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I'm going to drill a hole right in

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.289 
I'm going to drill a hole right in
through<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.020> region<00:01:16.020> maybe<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:17.640> holes<00:01:17.939> one

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
through that region maybe two holes one

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.850 
through that region maybe two holes one
over<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.580> one<00:01:20.580> over<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.860> can

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
over on this side one over here I can

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.109 
over on this side one over here I can
squirt<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.610> couple<00:01:23.820> spots<00:01:26.030> figure<00:01:27.030> out

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
squirt it in a couple spots figure out

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.080 
squirt it in a couple spots figure out
where<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> softest<00:01:28.729> looks<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:29.880> right

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
where it's the softest looks like right

00:01:30.090 --> 00:02:44.910 
where it's the softest looks like right
along<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.540> Ridge<00:01:30.869> there

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.000 

now<00:02:45.920> suck<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.400> into<00:02:46.819> the<00:02:47.109> syringe<00:02:51.010> you're

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
now suck it up into the syringe you're

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.710 
now suck it up into the syringe you're
just<00:02:52.220> sucked<00:02:52.489> up<00:02:52.640> into<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:52.909> syringe<00:02:53.359> I'm<00:02:53.569> not

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
just sucked up into the syringe I'm not

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
just sucked up into the syringe I'm not
going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> put<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.230> piece<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> tape<00:02:54.709> over<00:02:55.129> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
going to put a piece of tape over the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:31.559 
going to put a piece of tape over the
hole<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.049> then<00:02:57.049> squirt<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.769> in<00:02:57.920> there

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.539 

now<00:03:32.569> for<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> unveiling<00:03:33.319> let's<00:03:33.769> see<00:03:34.040> how<00:03:34.430> it

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
now for the unveiling let's see how it

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:51.550 
now for the unveiling let's see how it
came<00:03:34.730> out<00:03:47.890> there<00:03:48.890> are<00:03:49.040> two<00:03:49.250> holes<00:03:50.290> now<00:03:51.290> this

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
came out there are two holes now this

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.970 
came out there are two holes now this
whole<00:03:51.769> area<00:03:52.099> is<00:03:52.129> nice<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.549> firm<00:03:53.739> let's<00:03:54.739> see<00:03:54.920> if

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
whole area is nice and firm let's see if

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.009 
whole area is nice and firm let's see if
your<00:03:55.159> where<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.609> hole<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.000> actually<00:03:56.540> softer

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
your where the hole is actually softer

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.740 
your where the hole is actually softer
than<00:03:57.140> this<00:03:57.379> here<00:03:59.650> so<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.709> looks<00:04:00.859> good<00:04:01.190> a<00:04:01.750> little

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
than this here so it looks good a little

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.560 
than this here so it looks good a little
sanding<00:04:04.840> bit<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.930> paint<00:04:08.260> good<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.379> go
