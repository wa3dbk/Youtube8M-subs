00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
definitely stronger in this one not as

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.110 
definitely stronger in this one not as
much<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.980> vegetable<00:04:59.220> feel<00:04:59.700> as<00:04:59.850> I<00:04:59.970> was

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
much of a vegetable feel as I was

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.420 
much of a vegetable feel as I was
getting<00:05:00.240> in<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.480> Plata

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.190 

but<00:05:08.030> right<00:05:08.240> behind<00:05:08.390> that<00:05:08.600> fresh<00:05:08.840> Chicago

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
but right behind that fresh Chicago

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.670 
but right behind that fresh Chicago
right<00:05:09.350> up<00:05:09.470> front<00:05:10.810> there's<00:05:11.810> also<00:05:12.020> some<00:05:12.320> fruits

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
right up front there's also some fruits

right up front there's also some fruits
in<00:05:12.860> there<00:05:13.040> so<00:05:14.050> kind<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.080> like<00:05:15.230> a<00:05:15.260> nectarine<00:05:15.710> or

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
in there so kind of like a nectarine or

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.160 
in there so kind of like a nectarine or
an<00:05:16.100> apricot<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:17.480> imagine<00:05:17.840> that's<00:05:17.930> the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
an apricot and I imagine that's the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.170 
an apricot and I imagine that's the
stone<00:05:18.860> fruit<00:05:19.280> flavors<00:05:19.670> that<00:05:19.790> are<00:05:19.850> coming

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
probably from the cognac cask or the

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.600 
probably from the cognac cask or the
sherry<00:05:23.420> casks<00:05:23.900> cuz<00:05:24.050> that's<00:05:24.650> contributing

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
sherry casks cuz that's contributing

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:33.520 
sherry casks cuz that's contributing
those<00:05:25.760> flavors<00:05:31.810> sweet<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:32.960> soft<00:05:33.170> they<00:05:33.320> never

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
those flavors sweet and soft they never

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.060
