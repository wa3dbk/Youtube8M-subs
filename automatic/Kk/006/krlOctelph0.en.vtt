00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.670
 let's talk about what we can do 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.000
 you make the future or how we look 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.230
 to the main television educator and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.940
 TV stand behind me 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 but he plays a completely different one 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.660
 That's what TV has to offer 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.150
 is originally a television set 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.230
 there receiver dvb t with cover completely 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 normal with look he stands in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.250
 living room today and that can do something 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 but that's not all 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.269
 why not you can also others 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.349
 Devices to take other procedures 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.480
 take now you just come here 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.969
 through the hardware I built up 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.550
 have 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.960
 do not look so shocked by the small one 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.899
 We already had it here that is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.170
 failing to burst so then we have here 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.590
 a notebook standing on the see one 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.140
 now a screen on the left 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.579
 side programs of the right side would be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.570
 the reception part is with wireless 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.270
 lan with this bread wtv from pctv systems 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.180
 connected 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.159
 they had the predecessor of those 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.580
 which is now built so he has two dvb 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.799
 T receivers in there can be wireless via LAN 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 So two separate programs a year 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.409
 parallel via wireless lan or with lan 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.049
 cable is integrated into the house network 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:25.110
 and then agrees the programs you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 selects either on the pc or and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.150
 come right now or on one 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.060
 check tray he streams because high 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.060
 again over wireless lan out but all 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.220
 its a bit fast and router for that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 So in two people TV 1 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.520
 2 are in two televisions 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.399
 there is also I suppose now this 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 zte light tab because we tell people 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.130
 shall we say dinger hot 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.130
 Well, we always only say the tray 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.049
 the tablets are running at the moment 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 a Bundestag debate will be so 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.950
 now from the here received over the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.409
 dvb t antenna here in dÃ¼sseldorf im 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.060
 studio good reception is via wireless 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.160
 Give us a call 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 netgear router of the last broadcast already 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.360
 had and from the netgear router for 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.959
 via wireless lan on the tray 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 streamed so the part here is one 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.500
 system 2 receiver brings only one time 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.709
 no this is a and client wireless lan 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.040
 client it no further lan router or 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.959
 server i'll call that once i have to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.800
 Cable will be with the at my 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.500
 network 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.720
 and when connected why the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.340
 wireless lan possibility not everywhere 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.860
 where I just want to look is good 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 antenna is routed 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.040
 complicated because I take the box if 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.769
 power is there that places somewhere and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.200
 but can still watch TV in the house 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.019
 but in size there are also dvb 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.180
 t receivers the cheaper ones are safe 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.650
 with whom I also look for then when 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.250
 the point where you have just received 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.720
 yes , I mean that he is similar 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.940
 philosophy again completely dressed what 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 they cost solution may I again 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.549
 after is lies around 200 euro 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.230
 I can say that exactly, that's us 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.410
 have forgotten so many prizes about it 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.930
 I like that even 200 euros one can 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.810
 via a service the pctv systems has 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.940
 the still accessible over the internet 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.410
 do 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.690
 the logs in there because the logs 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.670
 router at the service to similar 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.910
 thin dns and about the software too 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.840
 now here on the pcs or or the 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.030
 internet address the one fixed point 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.000
 tv stick comes on his router 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.359
 on it and can because the television program 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.519
 the home is being received somewhere over 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.519
 umts or how no chance from the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.780
 also operate around this 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.420
 program interface that we see here 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.150
 or just on the pad was the stands 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.359
 one then available 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.709
 It's still training television 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.090
 We have other philosophies here now 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.160
 Once I have such a one here 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.030
 small box stand where you train 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:12.630
 dessert radio is one 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.090
 an internet tv radio anything 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.989
 possible receiver also depends on 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.720
 wireless lan on the house network and can 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.030
 the things offered over the net 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.889
 are received 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.450
 to be offered in the net there we are 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.630
 namely at the next version of the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.400
 television of the future is necessarily 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.169
 what the broadcaster has become 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.840
 certain time one offers over 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.220
 if you have something else group internet 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.169
 Watching TV is a possibility 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.120
 TV stations are worldwide 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.270
 or if you serve as youtube or 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560
 something like that looks like it is now 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.040
 Of course, quite small 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.520
 besides, the albrecht people have one 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.600
 Software update must be underlined by me 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.680
 you say that is no longer true 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.500
 internet tv but luki tv radio 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.120
 that is to internet-tv hot are luki 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.970
 has closed to me the thing was 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.720
 I suddenly updated and did 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.010
 but scolds nothing 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.970
 He still has a mediaplayer in there 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.530
 they all have 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.240
 So you can watch movies because 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.440
 I just the small screen you can 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.000
 it indeed a big tv 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.560
 connect to the quality is gone then 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.270
 if you have nice quality that's me 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.770
 here can be a video output or less 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.160
 normal video and then I go 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.860
 here on mine but the bad one 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.450
 quality best quality you can not 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.979
 You can not really do that a good one 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.419
 We want quality for that 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.120
 now here have the tv standing there 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.090
 we have such media here if that 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.020
 display would be that's alright now 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.180
 stupid good 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.330
 So it could also be a hdmi over 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.970
 connected be something 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:58.680
 So this eminent 8102 is one 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.530
 mediaplayer the different 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.169
 possibility offers the most important says 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.070
 listen mass storage connection and man 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.180
 because the things you can locally 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.070
 a hard drive or openstack 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.479
 hardcover play what you are 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.580
 more important is when he comes for now 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:18.390
 You see , you have quite a lot 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.909
 stations are available so youtube man 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.260
 Football has TV stations 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.170
 the specific day 1 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.810
 offer or even artists here 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.660
 sebastian barth sk for example the 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.490
 offers parts from his television program 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.080
 which is free because of the internet 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.160
 can see that he is such a snack 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.180
 but I watch that it will not 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.740
 So I will not be registered on that 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.130
 I'm not dependent on what you do 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.410
 needs or no 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.760
 that will only be offered by the 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.230
 I want this transmitter I can here 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.610
 Of course, I'll get a piece 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.470
 not everything I get causes here 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.150
 has already been sent that is 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.380
 honestly I personally have one more 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.330
 other philosophy i have good 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.900
 VCR stand or plate stands 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.830
 Let's take the things I want 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.080
 So these are possibilities either 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.000
 sniping television or streaming the 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.080
 Whole goes of course also for the mobile phone and 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.080
 I believe in valdes now
