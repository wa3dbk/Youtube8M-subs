00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this is my third time through so I did

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.020 
this is my third time through so I did
remember<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.320> uh<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
remember it and this one uh it's got the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.500 
remember it and this one uh it's got the
spot<00:02:09.539> where<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.640> really<00:02:12.120> easy<00:02:12.300> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
spot where you like it's really easy to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.290 
spot where you like it's really easy to
pass<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.959> door

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
pass the door

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.560 
pass the door
into<00:02:13.510> oblivion<00:02:14.250> and/or<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.490> blog<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.850> caves

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
into oblivion and/or the blog in caves

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.250 
into oblivion and/or the blog in caves
and<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.550> walk<00:02:18.730> around<00:02:18.910> pretty<00:02:19.810> much<00:02:19.900> go

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
and you can walk around pretty much go

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.950 
and you can walk around pretty much go
completely<00:02:20.920> around<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.730> gate<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.240> mean<00:02:22.660> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
completely around the gate I mean the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.480 
completely around the gate I mean the
tower<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.320> mean<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:24.010> almost<00:02:24.220> walk

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
tower I mean you can almost walk

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.820 
tower I mean you can almost walk
completely<00:02:24.730> around<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.750> tower<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.290> then

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
completely around the tower and then

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.350 
completely around the tower and then
just<00:02:27.070> be<00:02:27.190> stuck<00:02:27.550> because<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.030> can't<00:02:28.210> go

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
just be stuck because you can't go

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.930 
just be stuck because you can't go
anywhere<00:02:28.690> but<00:02:29.290> really<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.400> have<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.790> do

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
anywhere but really what you have to do

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.640 
anywhere but really what you have to do
is<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.300> walk<00:02:31.480> back<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.050> about<00:02:32.230> half<00:02:32.440> way

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
is just walk back and about half way

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.960 
is just walk back and about half way
through<00:02:33.750> you'll<00:02:34.750> find<00:02:35.080> a<00:02:35.260> random<00:02:36.220> door<00:02:36.700> that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
through you'll find a random door that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.120 
through you'll find a random door that
leads<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.390> some<00:02:37.630> tunnels<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.380> that<00:02:38.620> threw<00:02:39.070> me

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
leads in some tunnels and that threw me

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.270 
leads in some tunnels and that threw me
off<00:02:39.250> but<00:02:39.550> through<00:02:39.730> my<00:02:39.820> friend<00:02:40.240> off<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:40.900> I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
off but through my friend off and it's I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.170 
off but through my friend off and it's I
think<00:02:42.280> they<00:02:42.370> just<00:02:42.550> put<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.940> there<00:02:43.150> for

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
think they just put that in there for

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.810 
think they just put that in there for
fun<00:02:43.510> actually<00:02:43.890> yeah<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.430> see<00:02:45.580> me<00:02:45.730> looking

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
fun actually yeah if you see me looking

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.980 
fun actually yeah if you see me looking
to<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> right<00:02:46.300> here<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.690> because<00:02:46.810> I'm

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
to the right here it's because I'm

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.310 
to the right here it's because I'm
looking<00:02:47.320> around<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.740> door<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:49.320> sadly

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
looking around for that door and I sadly

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.440 
looking around for that door and I sadly
I<00:02:50.350> can't<00:02:50.800> remember<00:02:51.040> if<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:51.760> right<00:02:52.030> into<00:02:52.270> the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
I can't remember if I go right into the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.450 
I can't remember if I go right into the
door<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> go<00:02:53.170> all<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> way<00:02:53.440> around<00:02:53.650> then

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
door if I go all the way around then

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.100 
door if I go all the way around then
come<00:02:54.760> back<00:02:54.790> into<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.330> door<00:02:55.510> or<00:02:55.630> something<00:02:55.990> I

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
come back into the door or something I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.490 
come back into the door or something I
don't<00:02:56.170> know<00:02:56.320> but<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:57.400> know<00:02:57.960> apparently<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.200> don't

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
don't know but I know apparently I don't

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.160 
don't know but I know apparently I don't
anyway<00:03:00.430> here's<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> door<00:03:01.000> if<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.750> need<00:03:01.810> to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
anyway here's the door if you need to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.150 
anyway here's the door if you need to
know<00:03:02.290> where<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.500> is<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.800> look<00:03:02.950> on<00:03:03.070> your

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
know where it is just look on your

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.270 
know where it is just look on your
mini-map<00:03:03.520> or<00:03:03.760> look<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.630> your<00:03:04.810> map<00:03:04.990> like<00:03:05.500> local

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
mini-map or look on your map like local

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.820 
mini-map or look on your map like local
map<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.640> guess<00:03:06.900> not<00:03:07.900> mini-map<00:03:08.290> look<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.650> your

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
map I guess not mini-map look on your

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.100 
map I guess not mini-map look on your
local<00:03:09.370> map<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.850> by<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.510> mean<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.930> map

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
local map and by that I mean the map

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.760 
local map and by that I mean the map
that<00:03:11.380> shows<00:03:12.280> where<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.610> are<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.770> magnified

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
that shows where you are and a magnified

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.160 
that shows where you are and a magnified
view<00:03:15.460> of<00:03:15.550> everywhere<00:03:16.360> around<00:03:16.510> you<00:03:16.840> not<00:03:17.050> the

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
view of everywhere around you not the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.900 
view of everywhere around you not the
world<00:03:17.320> map<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:18.100> right<00:03:18.250> next<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.640> world

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
world map it's right next to the world

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.010 
world map it's right next to the world
map<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.360> think<00:03:20.320> yeah<00:03:21.040> anyway<00:03:21.570> okay<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:22.600> that

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
map I think yeah anyway okay so that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.900 
map I think yeah anyway okay so that
these<00:03:23.320> tunnels<00:03:23.590> are<00:03:23.860> pretty<00:03:24.370> straightforward

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
these tunnels are pretty straightforward

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.490 
these tunnels are pretty straightforward
I<00:03:25.030> don't<00:03:25.209> speed<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.780> up<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.050> I'll<00:03:26.170> speed

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
I don't speed this one up but I'll speed

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.720 
I don't speed this one up but I'll speed
the<00:03:26.590> next<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.010> up

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
the next one up

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.460 
the next one up
well<00:03:28.090> speed<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.510> bunch<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.959> next<00:03:29.170> one<00:03:29.320> up

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
well speed a bunch of the next one up

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.390 
well speed a bunch of the next one up
just<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:31.170> go<00:03:32.170> through<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.709> any<00:03:32.890> other<00:03:33.100> tunnel

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
just to go through like any other tunnel

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
just to go through like any other tunnel
pretty<00:03:33.580> much<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.900> should<00:03:35.140> be<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.410> last

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
pretty much I this should be the last

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.250 
pretty much I this should be the last
Oblivion<00:03:36.370> tunnel<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.910> will<00:03:37.060> need<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.480> do<00:03:37.630> that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
Oblivion tunnel you will need to do that

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.550 
Oblivion tunnel you will need to do that
I<00:03:38.290> can<00:03:38.950> think<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:39.489> now<00:03:39.550> but<00:03:40.390> uh<00:03:40.560> because

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
I can think of right now but uh because

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.910 
I can think of right now but uh because
like<00:03:41.950> these<00:03:42.160> are<00:03:42.280> only<00:03:42.400> in<00:03:42.520> oblivion<00:03:42.940> gates<00:03:43.150> so

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
like these are only in oblivion gates so

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.710 
like these are only in oblivion gates so
you're<00:03:44.920> gonna<00:03:45.070> be<00:03:45.340> going<00:03:45.489> through<00:03:45.760> tons<00:03:46.300> and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
you're gonna be going through tons and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.440 
you're gonna be going through tons and
tons<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.170> tons<00:03:47.200> of<00:03:47.530> tunnels<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:48.790> caves<00:03:49.060> later

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
tons and tons of tunnels and caves later

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.590 
tons and tons of tunnels and caves later
on<00:03:49.750> but<00:03:50.670> for<00:03:51.670> oblivion<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.270> should<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.480> the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600
