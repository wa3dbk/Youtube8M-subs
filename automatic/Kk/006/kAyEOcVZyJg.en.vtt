00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
see these four channels the first is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.380 
see these four channels the first is
pulse<00:00:51.230> 1<00:00:51.590> the<00:00:51.890> second<00:00:52.309> pulse<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:53.120> third

wave and the fourth is the noise so I'm
going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.050> create<00:00:57.410> a<00:00:57.500> chain<00:00:58.039> in<00:00:58.370> pulse<00:00:58.850> 1<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.510> I

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
going to create a chain in pulse 1 and I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.170 
going to create a chain in pulse 1 and I
will<00:01:00.589> have<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:00.829> loop<00:01:01.489> four<00:01:01.879> times<00:01:02.210> in<00:01:03.519> phrase<00:01:04.519> 0

1 in phrase 1 this is where I enter my

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.999 
1 in phrase 1 this is where I enter my

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
you can change the envelope the wave the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:45.219 
you can change the envelope the wave the
output<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.149> length<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> note<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.920> sweep

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
want the notes to be so here's the chain

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
want the notes to be so here's the chain
again<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:11.330> want<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.780> match<00:03:12.160> what<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.190> did

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
again and I want it to match what I did

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.880 
again and I want it to match what I did
in<00:03:13.760> pulse<00:03:14.300> one<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.720> up<00:03:18.020> three<00:03:18.820> five<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:19.850> two

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
in pulse one so up three five and two

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.509 
in pulse one so up three five and two
starting<00:03:21.890> at<00:03:22.040> zero

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.520 

so<00:03:30.519> we're<00:03:30.700> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.879> create<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.330> drum<00:03:31.870> track<00:03:32.110> in

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
so we're going to create a drum track in

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.039 
so we're going to create a drum track in
the<00:03:32.680> wave<00:03:32.860> channel<00:03:33.510> we're<00:03:34.510> going<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.750> create

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
the wave channel we're going to create

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:50.789 
the wave channel we're going to create
another<00:03:36.390> chain<00:03:37.390> in<00:03:37.780> phrase<00:03:38.769> 3<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.680> I've

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
another chain in phrase 3 so I've

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.380 
another chain in phrase 3 so I've
entered<00:03:50.950> my<00:03:51.190> note<00:03:51.519> but<00:03:51.790> I'm<00:03:51.910> going<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.120> change

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.009 
entered my note but I'm going to change
that<00:03:52.720> instrument<00:03:53.590> which<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.099> 0-2<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:55.510> be<00:03:55.720> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
that instrument which is 0-2 to be the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.520 
that instrument which is 0-2 to be the
drum<00:03:56.349> kit<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.360> here<00:03:58.360> you<00:03:58.540> can<00:03:58.690> change<00:03:59.019> which

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
drum kit and here you can change which

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.350

the 808 I'll use that for this and you

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.319 
the 808 I'll use that for this and you
can<00:04:05.230> tweak<00:04:05.530> the<00:04:05.560> drum<00:04:06.010> kit<00:04:06.280> too<00:04:06.549> but<00:04:06.879> it's<00:04:07.120> just

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
here's where you're going to place where

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.849 
here's where you're going to place where
you<00:04:11.200> want<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.739> bass<00:04:12.040> drum<00:04:12.459> which<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.730> beading

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
you want the bass drum which is beading

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:24.360 
you want the bass drum which is beading
and<00:04:15.900> clap<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.049> hi-hat<00:04:20.320> or<00:04:23.370> closed

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370

and clap and then the hi-hat or closed
hi-hat<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:25.570> CH<00:04:25.960> H<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:31.229> that's<00:04:32.229> what

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
hi-hat is what CH H is and that's what

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:40.230 
hi-hat is what CH H is and that's what
it<00:04:32.620> sounds<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.070> put<00:04:33.580> together<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:39.060> now<00:04:40.060> I'm

it sounds like put together so now I'm
going<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.630> create<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.560> noise<00:04:41.740> channel<00:04:42.430> which

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
going to create the noise channel which

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:53.670 
going to create the noise channel which
I'm<00:04:43.630> going<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.900> use<00:04:44.380> for<00:04:44.830> high<00:04:45.370> hats<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.560> you

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
I'm going to use for high hats so you

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.760 
I'm going to use for high hats so you
can<00:04:53.860> build<00:04:54.610> your<00:04:54.910> instrument<00:04:55.690> here<00:04:56.050> changing

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
can build your instrument here changing

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.710 
can build your instrument here changing
the<00:04:56.860> envelope<00:04:57.430> just<00:04:59.940> really<00:05:00.940> simple<00:05:01.360> for<00:05:01.599> this

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
the envelope just really simple for this

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:10.279 
the envelope just really simple for this
video

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.769 

this<00:05:11.279> is<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.610> also<00:05:11.879> the<00:05:12.240> channel<00:05:12.479> where<00:05:12.689> you

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:12.779 
this is it also the channel where you

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.409 
this is it also the channel where you
can<00:05:12.960> create<00:05:13.169> explosions<00:05:14.009> or<00:05:14.580> sound<00:05:14.969> effects

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
can create explosions or sound effects

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.320 
can create explosions or sound effects
or<00:05:15.779> a<00:05:16.229> lot<00:05:16.409> of<00:05:16.529> people<00:05:16.770> build<00:05:17.039> drums<00:05:17.639> in<00:05:17.939> the

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
or a lot of people build drums in the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.980 
or a lot of people build drums in the
noise<00:05:18.539> channel<00:05:19.729> now<00:05:20.729> this<00:05:20.939> is<00:05:21.119> what<00:05:21.300> it<00:05:21.629> sounds

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
noise channel now this is what it sounds

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.629 
noise channel now this is what it sounds
like<00:05:22.050> altogether<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:22.979> this<00:05:23.099> is<00:05:23.249> just<00:05:23.520> the

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
like altogether and this is just the

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:33.940 
like altogether and this is just the
beginning<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:24.149> a<00:05:24.779> song

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.250 

you<00:05:34.670> can<00:05:34.880> loop<00:05:35.150> these<00:05:35.360> over<00:05:35.750> and<00:05:35.900> over<00:05:36.140> again

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
you can loop these over and over again

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.820 
you can loop these over and over again
as<00:05:36.710> many<00:05:37.610> times<00:05:37.880> as<00:05:38.030> you<00:05:38.210> want<00:05:38.620> here's<00:05:39.620> the
