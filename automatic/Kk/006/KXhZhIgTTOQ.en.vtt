00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
all it just kind of stopped I don't tend

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.140 
all it just kind of stopped I don't tend
to<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:12.159> that<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.099> you<00:03:15.730> know<00:03:15.849> essence

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
to do that but in the you know essence

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.580 
to do that but in the you know essence
of<00:03:16.299> regression<00:03:16.750> they<00:03:16.810> look<00:03:16.959> I'll<00:03:17.140> just<00:03:17.379> I'll

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
of regression they look I'll just I'll

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.619 
of regression they look I'll just I'll
just<00:03:17.620> do<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:18.010> so<00:03:18.069> it<00:03:18.250> was<00:03:18.430> pretty<00:03:18.519> simple<00:03:18.970> it
