a string down on you get a different
notes<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.909> let's<00:01:42.299> say<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.750> example<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.579> play

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
notes so let's say for example I play

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429

if<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.280> play<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> sixth<00:01:51.030> string<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.360> most<00:01:51.540> base

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
if I play the sixth string the most base

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.660
