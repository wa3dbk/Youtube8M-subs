see

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.109 

my<00:01:51.869> side<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:53.869> going<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.700> side

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
my side for going up and down and side

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.039 
my side for going up and down and side
to<00:01:57.149> side<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.369> basically<00:01:59.970> look<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
to side so you basically look at the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.960 
to side so you basically look at the
numbers<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.920> how<00:02:02.159> many<00:02:02.220> shades<00:02:02.759> you

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
numbers and see how many shades you

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.960 
numbers and see how many shades you
shade<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.250> comma<00:02:05.580> that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
shade in so if there's a comma that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.910 
shade in so if there's a comma that
means<00:02:06.180> you're<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.479> space<00:02:06.810> or<00:02:07.110> two<00:02:07.649> between

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
means you're just space or two between

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
means you're just space or two between
them<00:02:08.420> doesn't<00:02:09.420> necessarily<00:02:10.019> mean<00:02:10.170> only<00:02:10.440> one

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
them doesn't necessarily mean only one

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
them doesn't necessarily mean only one
space<00:02:11.009> between<00:02:11.370> them<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.480> you'll<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.620> about

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
space between them so you'll see about

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.120 
space between them so you'll see about
that<00:02:14.540> when<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.630> gets<00:02:15.720> harder<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.069> can

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
that when it gets harder so as you can

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.130 
that when it gets harder so as you can
see<00:02:17.310> there's<00:02:17.519> three<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.450> means<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.870> shade

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
see there's three that means you shade

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.110 
see there's three that means you shade
in<00:02:19.290> three<00:02:19.940> spots<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.519> if<00:02:23.730> there<00:02:23.970> is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
in three spots now if that if there is

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.180 
in three spots now if that if there is
zero<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.569> means<00:02:24.810> there's<00:02:25.230> nothing<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.769> so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
zero that means there's nothing there so

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.729 
zero that means there's nothing there so
you<00:02:26.610> don't<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.970> shade<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.269> there<00:02:27.739> one

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
you don't have to shade in there one

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.120 
you don't have to shade in there one
means<00:02:29.069> there's<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:30.319> part<00:02:31.319> in<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.680> column

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
means there's one part in that column

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.250 
means there's one part in that column
that<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> shade<00:02:32.940> but<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.019> can't

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that you have to shade but you can't

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
that you have to shade but you can't
really<00:02:34.380> tell<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:34.920> no<00:02:35.069> because<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.269> be<00:02:36.360> this

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
really tell or no because it can be this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.000 
really tell or no because it can be this
one<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.870> came<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.769> be<00:02:37.890> this

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
one it came to this one it can be this

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.030 
one it came to this one it can be this
one<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.120> let's<00:02:39.510> look<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.989> top<00:02:40.200> column<00:02:40.830> here

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
one so let's look at the top column here

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.280 
one so let's look at the top column here
says<00:02:41.850> one<00:02:42.090> common<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.780> means<00:02:43.049> that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
says one common one that means that

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
says one common one that means that
there's<00:02:43.500> space<00:02:43.920> between<00:02:44.280> each<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.330> ones

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
there's space between each of the ones

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
there's space between each of the ones
so<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:47.190> pretty<00:02:47.519> self-explanatory<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
so it's pretty self-explanatory in

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.460 
so it's pretty self-explanatory in
the<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.910> after<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> space<00:02:51.269> since<00:02:51.720> can't<00:02:52.140> put

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
the one after the space since can't put

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.699 
the one after the space since can't put
anything<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.370> middle<00:02:53.730> column<00:02:54.120> and

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
anything in that middle column and

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.560 
anything in that middle column and
there's<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.910> I

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
there's one there and one there and I

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.110 
there's one there and one there and I
basically<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:58.140> quick<00:02:58.829> check<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.340> see<00:03:00.090> if

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
basically just quick check to see if

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.930 
basically just quick check to see if
you're<00:03:00.359> right<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:00.840> you're<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
you're right if you're right you get the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.220 
you're right if you're right you get the
screen<00:03:03.209> send<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.630> let's<00:03:06.810> get<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
screen send you one so let's get into a

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.650 
screen send you one so let's get into a
harder<00:03:07.799> puzzle<00:03:08.130> here<00:03:08.370> hopefully<00:03:09.150> i<00:03:09.239> can<00:03:09.299> pick

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
harder puzzle here hopefully i can pick

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.460 
harder puzzle here hopefully i can pick
a<00:03:10.019> one<00:03:10.290> that<00:03:10.530> that's<00:03:10.920> pretty<00:03:11.190> easy<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:13.170> really

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
a one that that's pretty easy not really

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.130 
a one that that's pretty easy not really
sure<00:03:13.620> if<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.799> guys<00:03:13.920> get<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.579> mean<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.630> was

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
sure if you guys get that I mean it was

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.750 
sure if you guys get that I mean it was
a<00:03:16.170> bit<00:03:16.410> confusing<00:03:16.799> when<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.980> first<00:03:17.220> started

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
a bit confusing when I first started

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.170 
a bit confusing when I first started
playing<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.359> guys<00:03:19.200> aren't<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.560> only<00:03:19.650> one

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
playing it so guys aren't the only one

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.460 
playing it so guys aren't the only one
so<00:03:21.180> as<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.480> can<00:03:21.600> see<00:03:21.780> there's<00:03:21.989> different

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
so as you can see there's different

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.120 
so as you can see there's different
modes<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.799> one<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.100> time<00:03:23.400> attack<00:03:23.730> where<00:03:24.540> you

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
modes this one is time attack where you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.130 
modes this one is time attack where you
do<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.160> puzzle<00:03:26.609> in<00:03:26.730> unlimited<00:03:27.239> time<00:03:27.420> there's

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
do the puzzle in unlimited time there's

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.559 
do the puzzle in unlimited time there's
also<00:03:28.350> one<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.950> forgot<00:03:29.790> what<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> was<00:03:30.090> called<00:03:30.390> but

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
also one I forgot what it was called but

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.470 
also one I forgot what it was called but

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
you have to get the right numbers or

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.440 
you have to get the right numbers or
else<00:03:34.069> the<00:03:35.069> whole<00:03:35.100> game<00:03:35.489> ends<00:03:35.819> let's<00:03:36.239> start

let's just skip that let's go to the

let's just skip that let's go to the
column<00:03:57.840> here<00:03:58.160> 6<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.489> means<00:03:59.699> shading<00:04:00.359> six
