seminar<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> few<00:01:31.710> months<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.310> fact<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
seminar a few months back in fact it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.920 
seminar a few months back in fact it
might<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:32.850> been<00:01:32.909> almost<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.329> year<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
might have been almost a year now I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.749 
might have been almost a year now I
think<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.259> was<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> October<00:01:35.130> maybe

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
think it was like in October maybe

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980 
think it was like in October maybe
November<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.270> something<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> went

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
November or something like that I went

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.569 
November or something like that I went
to<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> seminar<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.680> theirs<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.100> Connecticut

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
to a seminar of theirs in Connecticut

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.130 
to a seminar of theirs in Connecticut
actually<00:01:39.150> made<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> video<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.020> going

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
actually made a video on it so I'm going

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.270 
actually made a video on it so I'm going
to<00:01:40.200> link<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> put<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
to link that and put that in the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.350 
to link that and put that in the
description<00:01:41.460> box<00:01:41.790> below<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.240> you're

interested<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:43.340> part<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
interested but part of that one of the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
interested but part of that one of the
main<00:01:45.360> things<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.750> got<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.259> seminar

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
main things I got out of that seminar

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.800 
main things I got out of that seminar
even<00:01:47.100> though<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.340> covered<00:01:47.700> benching<00:01:48.630> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
even though they covered benching and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
even though they covered benching and
deadlifting<00:01:49.290> as<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.490> had<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
deadlifting as well was what they had to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
deadlifting as well was what they had to
say<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:50.850> squatting<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:52.049> how<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
say about squatting and really how to

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.840 
say about squatting and really how to
get<00:01:52.619> ready<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> biggest<00:01:53.670> things

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
get ready and one of the biggest things

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
get ready and one of the biggest things
I<00:01:53.970> took<00:01:54.030> away<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.619> working<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.979> breathing

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
I took away was working on my breathing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.760 
I took away was working on my breathing
and<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.240> sounded<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.930> dumb<00:01:58.229> back<00:01:58.469> then<00:01:58.740> I

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and that sounded really dumb back then I

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
and that sounded really dumb back then I
was<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.040> breathing<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.520> mean<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.759> you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
was like breathing I mean are you

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.819 
was like breathing I mean are you
serious<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.960> easy<00:02:01.170> how<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> not

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
serious so it's easy how can you not

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.310 
serious so it's easy how can you not
breathe<00:02:02.130> right<00:02:02.369> but<00:02:03.210> I've<00:02:03.390> worked<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.930> lot<00:02:04.079> on

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
breathe right but I've worked a lot on

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.139 
breathe right but I've worked a lot on
it<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.159> still<00:02:05.340> sounds<00:02:05.579> dumb<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> say<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it and it still sounds dumb to say it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.760 
it and it still sounds dumb to say it
now<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.540> breathing<00:02:06.810> has<00:02:07.079> been<00:02:07.229> huge<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.680> me

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
now but breathing has been huge for me

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.960 
now but breathing has been huge for me
and<00:02:07.799> squats<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> one<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
and squats and I think this is one of

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.620 
and squats and I think this is one of
the<00:02:09.060> reasons<00:02:09.450> why<00:02:09.720> my<00:02:10.470> squat<00:02:10.830> has

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
the reasons why my squat has

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.180 
the reasons why my squat has
probably<00:02:12.080> faster<00:02:12.230> than<00:02:12.560> my<00:02:12.680> benching<00:02:13.070> and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
probably faster than my benching and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.650 
probably faster than my benching and
deadlifting<00:02:13.610> recently<00:02:14.060> only<00:02:14.210> because<00:02:14.510> there

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
deadlifting recently only because there

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.030 
deadlifting recently only because there
are<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:14.900> many<00:02:15.050> little<00:02:15.290> things<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.860> could

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
are so many little things that I could

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
are so many little things that I could
tweak<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.520> really<00:02:16.760> work<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.150> from<00:02:17.840> squeezing

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
tweak and really work on from squeezing

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.720 
tweak and really work on from squeezing
my<00:02:18.380> elbows<00:02:18.680> together<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.310> pushing<00:02:19.610> them

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
my elbows together to pushing them

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.060 
my elbows together to pushing them
forward<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.390> trying<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.750> create<00:02:21.140> an<00:02:21.560> arrow<00:02:21.860> or

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
forward to trying to create an arrow or

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.980 
forward to trying to create an arrow or
grip<00:02:22.340> stance<00:02:23.000> all<00:02:23.330> sorts<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.720> different

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
grip stance all sorts of different

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.720 
grip stance all sorts of different
things<00:02:24.020> they<00:02:24.680> summarized<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.250> lot<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.490> this<00:02:25.610> in

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
things they summarized a lot of this in

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.130 
things they summarized a lot of this in
a<00:02:25.820> really<00:02:26.000> great<00:02:26.270> article<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:26.720> I'm<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.110> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
a really great article that I'm going to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.420 
a really great article that I'm going to
actually<00:02:27.260> show<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.740> how<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> get<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.370> I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
actually show you how to get to and I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.710 
actually show you how to get to and I
will<00:02:28.580> link<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.790> in<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.120> description<00:02:29.240> box

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
will link that in the description box

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
will link that in the description box
below<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:30.320> well<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.800> really<00:02:31.400> like<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:31.700> because

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
below as well I really like it because

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
below as well I really like it because
it's<00:02:32.090> simple<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.690> I'm<00:02:32.810> kind<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.290> simpleton

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
it's simple and I'm kind of a simpleton

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.710 
it's simple and I'm kind of a simpleton
in<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.190> fashion<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.120> don't<00:02:35.300> like<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.570> read

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
in that fashion I don't like to read

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.750 
in that fashion I don't like to read
these<00:02:35.840> long<00:02:36.080> in-depth<00:02:36.560> articles<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.250> maybe

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
these long in-depth articles and maybe

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.870 
these long in-depth articles and maybe
it's<00:02:38.000> great<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.660> actual<00:02:39.340> full-out<00:02:40.340> knowledge

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
it's great for actual full-out knowledge

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.750 
it's great for actual full-out knowledge
but<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.330> me<00:02:41.600> short<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.710> simple<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.550> key

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
but to me short and simple is the key

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.580 
but to me short and simple is the key
only<00:02:44.030> because<00:02:44.600> when<00:02:44.900> I'm<00:02:45.020> trying<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.320> remember

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
only because when I'm trying to remember

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.440 
only because when I'm trying to remember
some<00:02:45.860> of<00:02:45.890> these<00:02:46.130> cues<00:02:46.490> when<00:02:46.700> I'm<00:02:46.820> lifting<00:02:47.030> I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
some of these cues when I'm lifting I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.120 
some of these cues when I'm lifting I
don't<00:02:47.870> want<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.080> remember<00:02:48.260> paragraph<00:02:48.860> upon

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
don't want to remember paragraph upon

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.370 
don't want to remember paragraph upon
paragraph<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.000> actual<00:02:50.630> biomechanics<00:02:51.320> and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
paragraph and actual biomechanics and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.510 
paragraph and actual biomechanics and
all<00:02:51.530> these<00:02:51.680> other<00:02:51.830> things<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.130> just<00:02:52.280> want<00:02:52.430> to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
all these other things I just want to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.550 
all these other things I just want to

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
I figured it could also probably help

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.070 
I figured it could also probably help
you<00:02:57.680> guys<00:02:57.890> if<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.850> interested<00:02:59.660> which<00:02:59.810> you

you guys if you are interested which you
should<00:03:00.320> be<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.740> also<00:03:01.190> try<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.430> get<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> lot<00:03:01.760> of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
should be I also try to get a lot of

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.400 
should be I also try to get a lot of
different<00:03:02.120> angles<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.570> this<00:03:02.720> particular<00:03:03.200> day

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
different angles on this particular day

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.020 
different angles on this particular day
now<00:03:03.620> I've<00:03:03.710> been<00:03:03.860> feeling<00:03:04.190> pretty<00:03:04.310> tight<00:03:04.640> again

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
now I've been feeling pretty tight again

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.490 
now I've been feeling pretty tight again
as<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.270> mentioned<00:03:05.300> these<00:03:05.780> were<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.080> first<00:03:06.230> time

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
as I mentioned these were the first time

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.040 
as I mentioned these were the first time
that<00:03:06.740> I<00:03:06.770> wore<00:03:07.070> my<00:03:07.250> nike<00:03:07.520> Romo<00:03:07.850> Leo's<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.330> will<00:03:08.870> be

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
that I wore my nike Romo Leo's I will be

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.660 
that I wore my nike Romo Leo's I will be
doing<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.350> comparison<00:03:09.650> review<00:03:10.160> but<00:03:10.400> literally

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
doing a comparison review but literally

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.460 
doing a comparison review but literally
this<00:03:10.880> was<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.210> first<00:03:11.420> time<00:03:11.630> I<00:03:11.690> wore<00:03:11.990> them<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.440> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
this was the first time I wore them so I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.810 
this was the first time I wore them so I
don't<00:03:12.710> think<00:03:12.800> it'd<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:12.980> very<00:03:13.100> beneficial<00:03:13.430> for

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
don't think it'd be very beneficial for

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.690 
don't think it'd be very beneficial for
me<00:03:14.000> to<00:03:14.210> do<00:03:14.330> my<00:03:14.480> review<00:03:14.690> right<00:03:15.320> now<00:03:15.620> but<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.580> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
me to do my review right now but one of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.800 
me to do my review right now but one of
the<00:03:16.760> things<00:03:17.000> that<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.210> will<00:03:17.390> point<00:03:17.630> out<00:03:17.750> that

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
the things that I will point out that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.140 
the things that I will point out that
was<00:03:18.050> interesting<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.560> me<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.860> these<00:03:19.550> actually

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
was interesting to me is these actually

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.470 
was interesting to me is these actually
felt<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.660> lot<00:03:20.960> tighter<00:03:21.500> in<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.820> forefront<00:03:23.240> of

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
felt a lot tighter in the forefront of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.420 
felt a lot tighter in the forefront of
my<00:03:23.660> foot<00:03:24.020> and<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.590> say<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:24.980> only<00:03:25.010> because

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
my foot and I say that only because

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.010 
my foot and I say that only because
that's<00:03:25.730> oftentimes<00:03:26.150> what<00:03:26.570> people<00:03:26.840> say<00:03:26.990> about

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
that's oftentimes what people say about

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's oftentimes what people say about
the<00:03:27.530> ADI<00:03:27.860> powers<00:03:28.250> too<00:03:28.700> tight<00:03:28.940> up<00:03:29.060> front<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
the ADI powers too tight up front the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.690 
the ADI powers too tight up front the
toe<00:03:29.570> box<00:03:29.750> isn't<00:03:30.050> very<00:03:30.230> big<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.740> didn't<00:03:31.550> find

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
toe box isn't very big I didn't find

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.980 
toe box isn't very big I didn't find
that<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:31.970> be<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.150> case<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.450> found<00:03:32.660> these<00:03:32.780> were<00:03:32.930> a

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
that to be the case I found these were a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.750 
that to be the case I found these were a
lot<00:03:33.260> tighter<00:03:33.500> than<00:03:33.620> my<00:03:33.800> Addie<00:03:33.980> powers<00:03:34.370> despite

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
lot tighter than my Addie powers despite

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.820 
lot tighter than my Addie powers despite
being<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.090> same<00:03:35.270> size<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.840> probably<00:03:36.350> attribute

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
being the same size I probably attribute

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.680 
being the same size I probably attribute
a<00:03:36.950> lot<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.970> secondary<00:03:38.360> strap

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
a lot of that to the secondary strap

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.480 
a lot of that to the secondary strap
they<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:39.020> over<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.410> toe<00:03:39.560> box<00:03:39.770> but<00:03:40.070> you<00:03:40.370> can

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
they have over the toe box but you can

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.820 
they have over the toe box but you can
all<00:03:40.730> go<00:03:40.910> more<00:03:41.209> in<00:03:41.360> depth<00:03:41.600> on<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:41.840> in<00:03:42.260> the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
all go more in depth on that in the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.949 
all go more in depth on that in the
actual<00:03:42.980> comparison<00:03:43.670> review<00:03:44.270> here's<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
actual comparison review here's the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.750 
actual comparison review here's the
another<00:03:45.200> set<00:03:45.590> here<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.220> again<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.459> wanted<00:03:46.670> to

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
another set here and again I wanted to

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.220 
another set here and again I wanted to
give<00:03:46.850> you<00:03:46.880> guys<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> lot<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.420> angles<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.870> see<00:03:47.959> my

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
give you guys a lot of angles to see my

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.870 
give you guys a lot of angles to see my
depth<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.620> know<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.770> struggle<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.280> hit<00:03:49.400> parallel

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
depth I know I struggle to hit parallel

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.699 
depth I know I struggle to hit parallel
but<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.120> do<00:03:50.240> feel<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.630> I'm<00:03:50.870> hitting<00:03:51.170> parallel

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
but I do feel that I'm hitting parallel

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.560 
but I do feel that I'm hitting parallel
at<00:03:51.770> least<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.100> all<00:03:52.220> these<00:03:52.430> plus<00:03:53.180> it's<00:03:53.330> tough<00:03:53.480> to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
at least in all these plus it's tough to

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.110 
at least in all these plus it's tough to
see<00:03:53.690> with<00:03:53.810> my<00:03:53.900> shorts<00:03:54.260> however<00:03:55.100> one<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:55.970> these

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
much like I said about five sets of

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.870 
much like I said about five sets of
glute-ham<00:04:03.740> race<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.160> here<00:04:04.310> I've<00:04:04.490> been<00:04:04.610> really

hell<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.770> me<00:04:06.890> which<00:04:07.490> again<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:07.940> probably

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
hell for me which again is probably

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.370 
hell for me which again is probably
gonna<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.390> beneficial<00:04:08.540> for<00:04:08.959> me<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.170> get<00:04:09.290> better

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
gonna be beneficial for me to get better

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
at them in the long run just because I

at them in the long run just because I
really<00:04:10.910> want<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.180> strengthen<00:04:11.390> my<00:04:11.630> hamstrings
