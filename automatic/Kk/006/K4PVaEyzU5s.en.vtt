 excel services together with this video 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600
 we have an application developed in 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.700
 excel which will be of great help 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.860
 for good room control 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.960
 how does your application work here 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.180
 three leaves some venom and nothing less 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.770
 called users that's where they're going 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.220
 to register then all the users or 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.290
 clients that are going to fit in 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.870
 every day in each room they already work 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.330
 that are payroll rooms good we're going 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.239
 to loja menu and then we start to work 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.710
 well before starting to work 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.920
 four applications we will notice that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.140
 we have five rooms inside inside 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.850
 of which 22 rooms are 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.470
 they are busy and we have 3 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 rooms available 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.500
 to occupy a room is enough 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.690
 click on this button 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.150
 called available we make a click and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.210
 then it opens a button or a form 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.159
 in which we are going to register then the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.950
 user in this case we enter the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.990
 name of the document and the price 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.969
 yes for saying we do not want to occupy this 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.490
 room we give in cancel it 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.320
 close the form and follow us 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.840
 thus having the room totally 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.869
 available we start with exercise 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.490
 we are going to enter a data in this case the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.970

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.219
