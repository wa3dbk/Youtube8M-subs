00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.240 

a<00:02:44.290> little<00:02:45.290> paw<00:02:45.470> up<00:02:45.680> goal

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
a little paw up goal

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.550 
a little paw up goal
it<00:02:46.670> also<00:02:46.820> comes<00:02:47.240> equipped<00:02:47.390> with<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.750> 7-speed

it also comes equipped with a 7-speed
PDK<00:02:48.590> transmission<00:02:49.690> here's<00:02:50.690> how<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.080> works

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
PDK transmission here's how it works

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.770 
PDK transmission here's how it works
let's<00:02:52.070> say<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.520> example<00:02:52.550> you're<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.270> second

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
let's say for example you're in second

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.120 
let's say for example you're in second
gear<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.140> other<00:02:54.290> clutch<00:02:54.680> actually

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
gear the other clutch actually

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.530 
gear the other clutch actually
pre-selects<00:02:55.790> third<00:02:56.120> gear

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
pre-selects third gear

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.450 
pre-selects third gear
so<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.990> shifts<00:02:57.320> between<00:02:57.470> gears<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.160> that

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
so the shifts between gears it's that

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.580 
so the shifts between gears it's that
quick<00:02:58.760> that's<00:02:59.270> absolutely<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.900> instant

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
quick that's absolutely that instant

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.320 
quick that's absolutely that instant
there's<00:03:00.740> no<00:03:00.920> friction<00:03:01.310> loss<00:03:01.640> between<00:03:01.880> gear

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
there's no friction loss between gear

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.960 
there's no friction loss between gear
shifts<00:03:02.690> we<00:03:03.170> also<00:03:03.350> have<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.800> Sport<00:03:04.160> Plus<00:03:04.340> and
