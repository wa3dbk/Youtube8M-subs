are<00:01:01.469> three<00:01:01.739> reasons<00:01:01.949> why<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.489> decided<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.239> try

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
are three reasons why I decided to try

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.890 
are three reasons why I decided to try
the<00:01:03.539> product<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.519> has<00:01:05.729> 42<00:01:06.330> natural

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the product first one it has 42 natural

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.770 
the product first one it has 42 natural
ingredients<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.979> that's<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:09.240> important

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
ingredients and that's really important

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.350 
ingredients and that's really important
to<00:01:09.869> me<00:01:11.180> infinite<00:01:12.180> aloe<00:01:12.439> also<00:01:13.640> has<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.270> ability

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to me infinite aloe also has the ability

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.859 
to me infinite aloe also has the ability
to<00:01:16.049> penetrate<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.770> seven<00:01:17.430> layers<00:01:17.729> deep<00:01:18.570> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
to penetrate up to seven layers deep of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.560 
to penetrate up to seven layers deep of
skin<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.189> basically<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
skin so basically it's not just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.090 
skin so basically it's not just
nourishing<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> top<00:01:22.409> layers<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.950> your<00:01:23.040> skin

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
nourishing the top layers of your skin

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.560 
nourishing the top layers of your skin
it's<00:01:23.820> nourishing<00:01:24.360> down<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.950> 7<00:01:26.310> layers<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it's nourishing down to 7 layers and

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.590 
it's nourishing down to 7 layers and
because<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.990> penetrates<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.860> deeply<00:01:29.420> who<00:01:30.420> was

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because it penetrates so deeply who was

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800 
because it penetrates so deeply who was
able<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.930> shower<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.710> his<00:01:31.860> skin<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.780> able<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
