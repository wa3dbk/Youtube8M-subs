all<00:00:04.589> right<00:00:07.790> to<00:00:08.790> close<00:00:09.059> actually<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.590> is<00:00:10.860> the

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
all right to close actually this is the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.150 
all right to close actually this is the
idle<00:00:12.210> speed<00:00:12.500> actuator

input hose and output hose and
attachment<00:00:21.060> bracket<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:23.180> electrical

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
attachment bracket and it's electrical

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.560 
attachment bracket and it's electrical

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
connection to the PCM I'm going to turn

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.820 
connection to the PCM I'm going to turn
on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> key<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.289> if<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.439> makes<00:00:28.590> any<00:00:28.710> noise

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
on the key and see if it makes any noise

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.920 
on the key and see if it makes any noise
oh<00:00:29.689> my<00:00:30.740> hair

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
oh my hair

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.920 
oh my hair
as<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.700> its<00:00:35.700> input<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.360> through<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
as you can see its input is through that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.959 
as you can see its input is through that
tube<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.559> into<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.809> intake<00:00:39.809> system<00:00:40.969> this

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
tube there into the intake system this

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.720 
tube there into the intake system this
is<00:00:42.210> your<00:00:42.480> mass<00:00:43.170> airflow<00:00:43.440> sensor<00:00:46.280> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> your

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
is your mass airflow sensor this is your

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.600 
is your mass airflow sensor this is your
manifold<00:00:48.660> pressure<00:00:49.079> sensor<00:00:49.739> which<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.399> don't

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
manifold pressure sensor which I don't

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.529 
manifold pressure sensor which I don't
know<00:00:50.730> why<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.149> up<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.260> by<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:54.350> air<00:00:55.350> intake

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
know why it's up here by the air intake

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.180 
know why it's up here by the air intake
this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.899> throttle<00:00:58.460> positioning<00:00:59.460> sensor

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
this is your throttle positioning sensor

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
this is your throttle positioning sensor
down<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.670> by<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.420> injectors<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.290> two

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
down here by your injectors one two

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.359 
down here by your injectors one two
three<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> fourth<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.530> on

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
three and the fourth is up here and on

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.830 
three and the fourth is up here and on
the<00:01:08.520> end<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:11.960> hmm<00:01:13.250> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.840> fuel

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the end is your hmm this is the fuel

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
the end is your hmm this is the fuel
pressure<00:01:16.290> regulator<00:01:17.159> which<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> have

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
pressure regulator which I have

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.490 
pressure regulator which I have
disconnected<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.950> runs<00:01:20.159> better

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
disconnected because it runs better

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.350 
disconnected because it runs better
maybe<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.009> idles<00:01:23.400> been<00:01:23.700> that's<00:01:23.909> actually

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
maybe if the idles been that's actually

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.490 
maybe if the idles been that's actually
on<00:01:24.479> idle<00:01:24.869> specifically<00:01:26.030> but<00:01:27.030> maybe<00:01:27.350> was<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
on idle specifically but maybe was the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.010 
on idle specifically but maybe was the
idle<00:01:29.100> speed<00:01:29.220> control<00:01:29.759> actuator<00:01:30.299> replaced

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
idle speed control actuator replaced

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.929 
idle speed control actuator replaced
it'll<00:01:31.409> aisle<00:01:31.650> correctly<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.400> I'll<00:01:32.520> reattach

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
it'll aisle correctly and I'll reattach

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.810 
it'll aisle correctly and I'll reattach
the<00:01:33.509> fuel<00:01:34.079> pressure<00:01:34.380> regulator<00:01:34.820> unless

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the fuel pressure regulator unless

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
the fuel pressure regulator unless
there's<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> problem<00:01:36.180> with<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> fuel<00:01:36.900> pressure

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
there's a problem with the fuel pressure

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.210 
there's a problem with the fuel pressure
regulator<00:01:40.220> which<00:01:42.320> I'm<00:01:43.320> under<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> belief

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
regulator which I'm under the belief

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.480 
regulator which I'm under the belief
that<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:46.189> increasing<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> fuel

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
that right now is increasing the fuel

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.010 
that right now is increasing the fuel
pressure<00:01:47.729> while<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.420> disconnected<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
pressure while it's disconnected that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
pressure while it's disconnected that
alarm<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.110> on

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.969 

okay<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.810> making<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.289> noise<00:02:04.469> it's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
okay it's not making any noise it's

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:14.809 
okay it's not making any noise it's
vibrating<00:02:07.099> that's<00:02:08.099> for<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> better<00:02:13.700> put<00:02:14.700> in

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
vibrating that's for the better put in

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.970 
vibrating that's for the better put in
three<00:02:15.110> common<00:02:16.110> plank<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:19.260> say<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.739> get

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
three common plank and you say don't get

three common plank and you say don't get

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.690 

now<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.020> car<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.410> warmed<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:27.490> I've

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
now the car is warmed up because I've

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:44.240 
now the car is warmed up because I've
just<00:02:28.030> driven<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.320> store

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.030 

well<00:02:45.110> who<00:02:46.110> knows

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.190 

they're<00:02:51.040> scared<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.030> what's<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.720> on

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.160 

I<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.040> park<00:02:59.280> spot

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
