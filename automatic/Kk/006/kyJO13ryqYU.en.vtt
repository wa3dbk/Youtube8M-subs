00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.590

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.510

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.550
 guyomard so the way of a bios of 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.070

 by the time I 'm doing the video has 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.899
 of course 3400 view it's pretty huge 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.759

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.190
