hi<00:00:03.710> everyone

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
hi everyone

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.599 
hi everyone
on<00:00:06.439> this<00:00:06.649> video<00:00:06.889> I<00:00:07.040> want<00:00:07.189> to<00:00:07.250> show<00:00:07.399> how<00:00:07.550> to

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
on this video I want to show how to

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:16.450 
on this video I want to show how to
check<00:00:07.969> the<00:00:08.120> starter<00:00:08.599> on<00:00:09.410> a<00:00:09.769> BMW<00:00:12.820> EAB<00:00:13.820> 3<00:00:14.240> I<00:00:15.460> made

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
check the starter on a BMW EAB 3 I made

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.020 
check the starter on a BMW EAB 3 I made
this<00:00:16.580> video<00:00:16.789> because<00:00:16.939> it's<00:00:17.449> a<00:00:17.630> little<00:00:17.750> hard<00:00:19.030> to

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
this video because it's a little hard to

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.850 
this video because it's a little hard to
get<00:00:20.150> to<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.390> wire<00:00:20.600> underneath<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.260> intake

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:21.860 
get to the wire underneath the intake

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.620 
get to the wire underneath the intake
manifold<00:00:23.380> so<00:00:24.380> what<00:00:24.590> we<00:00:24.740> have<00:00:24.949> here<00:00:24.980> is<00:00:25.369> a<00:00:25.400> EA<00:00:26.180> t3

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
manifold so what we have here is a EA t3

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:36.330 
manifold so what we have here is a EA t3
no<00:00:26.840> start<00:00:30.369> ok<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:33.230> what<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:33.440> did<00:00:33.940> I'm<00:00:34.940> using<00:00:35.270> my

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
no start ok so what I did I'm using my

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.819 
no start ok so what I did I'm using my
Easter<00:00:37.340> software<00:00:37.820> oh<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:42.350> have<00:00:42.500> my<00:00:42.620> power

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
Easter software oh and I have my power

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.049 
Easter software oh and I have my power
probe<00:00:43.160> here<00:00:43.719> on<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.960> white<00:00:45.200> wire<00:00:46.030> which<00:00:47.030> is

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
probe here on the white wire which is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.229 
probe here on the white wire which is
the<00:00:47.360> pin<00:00:47.920> 23<00:00:49.480> all<00:00:50.480> right

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the pin 23 all right

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.860 
the pin 23 all right
it<00:00:53.239> runs<00:00:53.600> from<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.960> IBM<00:00:54.860> all<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.510> way<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.690> the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
it runs from the IBM all the way to the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.959 
it runs from the IBM all the way to the
starter

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.770 

okay

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
okay

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.430 
okay
and<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.560> uh<00:01:08.780> it's<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:10.020> hard<00:01:10.320> to

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
and right here uh it's pretty hard to

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.580 
and right here uh it's pretty hard to
get<00:01:10.560> because<00:01:11.090> it's<00:01:12.090> underneath<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> intake

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
get because it's underneath the intake

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.969 
get because it's underneath the intake
manifold<00:01:14.060> all<00:01:15.060> right<00:01:17.600> so<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:18.900> doing<00:01:18.979> I'm

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
manifold all right so what I'm doing I'm

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.880 
manifold all right so what I'm doing I'm
checking<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> output<00:01:21.860> at<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.220> IBM<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.710> make

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
checking the output at the IBM to make

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.940 
checking the output at the IBM to make
it<00:01:26.010> easier<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> faster

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.710 

and<00:01:31.340> I'm<00:01:31.670> using<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.060> power<00:01:32.270> probe<00:01:32.570> by<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.810> way

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.620 

so<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.930> IBM<00:01:39.259> is<00:01:39.409> going<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.710> be<00:01:40.159> located

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
so the IBM is going to be located

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.120 
so the IBM is going to be located
underneath<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.720> hood<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.770> left<00:01:42.950> hand

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
underneath the hood on the left hand

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:52.820 
underneath the hood on the left hand
side

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.780 

this<00:01:53.580> wire<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:56.280> runs<00:01:56.550> all

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
this wire right here this one runs all

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.670 
this wire right here this one runs all
the<00:01:56.940> way<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:57.300> starter<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:59.760> it's<00:02:03.680> pretty

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the way to the starter and it's pretty

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.010 
the way to the starter and it's pretty
hard<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.580> I<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.880> decided<00:02:08.210> to<00:02:09.210> check

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
hard to get so I just decided to check

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:17.710 
hard to get so I just decided to check
it<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.260> here<00:02:10.500> okay

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:30.610 

so<00:02:19.280> let's<00:02:20.280> check<00:02:20.580> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.020 

okay

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
okay

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.589 
okay
so<00:02:33.600> starters<00:02:34.230> getting<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> signal

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:59.580 

but<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.689> car<00:02:43.900> won't<00:02:44.049> start

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.569 

all<00:03:00.590> right<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.129> card<00:03:01.370> is<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.549> starter

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
all right so this card is a starter

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.700 
all right so this card is a starter
thank<00:03:04.579> you
