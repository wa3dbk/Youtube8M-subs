around with Blair supporting move it
towards<00:01:13.270> 100<00:01:13.780> which<00:01:13.900> is<00:01:13.930> max<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.560> flares

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
towards 100 which is max and the flares

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.960

tactical changes take effect immediately
and<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:34.399> is<00:01:34.520> something<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:34.939> work<00:01:35.119> very<00:01:35.149> hard

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
and that is something we work very hard

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:45.480 
and that is something we work very hard
on

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.889 

okay<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.640> time<00:01:46.850> let's<00:01:47.270> see<00:01:47.390> what<00:01:47.509> happens<00:01:47.810> if

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
okay this time let's see what happens if

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.959 
okay this time let's see what happens if
we<00:01:48.020> adjust<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.439> support<00:01:48.770> range<00:01:49.009> push<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.880> up

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
we adjust the support range push it up

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.789 
we adjust the support range push it up
to<00:01:49.999> 100<00:01:50.569> and<00:01:50.749> players<00:01:50.960> provide<00:01:51.380> first<00:01:51.649> in

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
to 100 and players provide first in

to 100 and players provide first in
support<00:01:52.189> good<00:01:52.549> if<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:53.420> like<00:01:53.539> playing<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.899> short

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
passes push it towards zero and the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.530 
passes push it towards zero and the
player<00:01:56.630> spread<00:01:56.990> out

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.360 

receptor<00:02:04.540> tendus<00:02:04.930> time<00:02:05.140> seems<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.220> perfect

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
receptor tendus time seems the perfect

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.219 
receptor tendus time seems the perfect
length<00:02:06.760> of<00:02:06.910> playing<00:02:07.120> long<00:02:07.330> ball<00:02:07.360> but<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.110> can

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
length of playing long ball but you can

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.109 
length of playing long ball but you can
see<00:02:08.440> it<00:02:08.710> really<00:02:09.040> isn't<00:02:09.490> this<00:02:09.580> set<00:02:09.759> up<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.000> play

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
see it really isn't this set up to play

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.630 
see it really isn't this set up to play
balls<00:02:10.479> along<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.869> ground<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:12.190> always<00:02:12.400> best
