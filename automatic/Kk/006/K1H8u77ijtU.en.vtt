paints<00:00:09.960> so<00:00:10.650> today<00:00:10.860> what<00:00:11.160> I'm<00:00:11.280> really<00:00:11.400> doing<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
paints so today what I'm really doing is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.060 
paints so today what I'm really doing is
showing<00:00:12.540> you<00:00:12.719> how<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> paint<00:00:13.349> miss<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
showing you how to paint miss the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.430 
showing you how to paint miss the
scenery<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> mines<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.660> moria<00:00:15.929> box<00:00:16.199> set

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
scenery for the mines of moria box set

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.820 
scenery for the mines of moria box set
and<00:00:17.750> the<00:00:18.750> best<00:00:19.020> way<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.199> thought<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.470> doing<00:00:19.650> it

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and the best way I thought of doing it

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.310 
and the best way I thought of doing it
will<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.160> with<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.490> main<00:00:21.119> doors<00:00:21.449> because<00:00:21.930> that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
will be with the main doors because that

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
will be with the main doors because that
seems<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.890> all<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.189> other<00:00:23.310> components

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
seems to have all the other components

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.370 
seems to have all the other components
like<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.990> words<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> stone<00:00:26.090> I<00:00:27.199> met<00:00:28.199> her

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
like the words and the stone I met her

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
like the words and the stone I met her
when<00:00:28.500> things<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.099> all<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> other<00:00:29.609> bits<00:00:29.849> need

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
when things like all the other bits need

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.100 
when things like all the other bits need

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
pink pigment in the officer unit okay

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.059 
pink pigment in the officer unit okay
smaller<00:03:24.959> brush

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
smaller brush

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:34.119 
smaller brush
Boop<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.030> will<00:03:27.480> use<00:03:29.659> this<00:03:30.659> one<00:03:31.370> thin<00:03:32.370> brush<00:03:32.670> and

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129
