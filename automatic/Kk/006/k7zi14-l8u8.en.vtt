00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
thing that's holding Durant back is that

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.830 
thing that's holding Durant back is that
he<00:00:21.570> plays<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.020> small<00:00:22.260> market<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:24.510> have

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
for instance that when we saw Carmelo

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.910 
for instance that when we saw Carmelo
come<00:00:26.699> from<00:00:26.970> Denver<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> New<00:00:27.869> York<00:00:28.140> his<00:00:28.680> sales

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
boomed because he was in a big market if

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.910 
boomed because he was in a big market if
Durant<00:00:33.090> were<00:00:33.300> in<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.510> big<00:00:33.690> market<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.260> Miami

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
Durant were in a big market like Miami

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.510 
Durant were in a big market like Miami
or<00:00:35.360> Chicago<00:00:36.360> or<00:00:36.540> New<00:00:36.630> York<00:00:37.250> he<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.399> have

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
or Chicago or New York he would have

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.900 
or Chicago or New York he would have
much<00:00:38.760> more<00:00:39.170> broad<00:00:40.170> base<00:00:40.410> i<00:00:40.649> think<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.980> sales<00:00:41.489> if

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
much more broad base i think in sales if

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.030 
much more broad base i think in sales if
he<00:00:42.420> wins<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.719> championship<00:00:42.770> he's<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
he wins a championship he's going to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.010 
he wins a championship he's going to
have<00:00:44.160> broader<00:00:44.399> base<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> sales<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.270> yes<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
have broader base in sales so yes I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
have broader base in sales so yes I
think<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.289> possibility<00:00:46.890> exists<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.550> him<00:00:47.640> to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
think the possibility exists for him to

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.880 
think the possibility exists for him to
do<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.570> there<00:00:48.840> need<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:49.320> some

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
do that but there need to be some some

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.150 
do that but there need to be some some
factors<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> happen

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
factors that line up for that to happen

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
factors that line up for that to happen
okay<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.180> see<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> price<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.930> sneakers

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
okay do you see the price of sneakers

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.430 
okay do you see the price of sneakers
rising<00:00:55.649> annually<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.969> since<00:00:57.449> 2011

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
rising annually as they have since 2011

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
rising annually as they have since 2011
yeah<00:00:59.309> they<00:00:59.460> typical<00:00:59.910> price<00:01:00.270> increase<00:01:00.690> for

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
yeah they typical price increase for

sneakers is between three and five
percent<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.619> expected<00:01:05.400> we'll<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
percent and I expected we'll see that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.630 
percent and I expected we'll see that
kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.360> increase<00:01:06.689> continue<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.560> forward

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
kind of increase continue to go forward

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.640 
kind of increase continue to go forward
we<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.790> increases<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.420> labor<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:10.560> have

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
we have increases in labor we have

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
we have increases in labor we have
increases<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> oil<00:01:11.460> prices<00:01:11.760> which<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.360> into

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
increases in oil prices which go into

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
increases in oil prices which go into
not<00:01:13.049> only<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> materials<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> shoes<00:01:14.189> are

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
not only the materials the shoes are

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.249 
not only the materials the shoes are
made<00:01:14.520> from<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.240> also<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.630> freight<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> get

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
made from but also the freight to get

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.190 
made from but also the freight to get
them<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:17.360> we<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.479> innovations<00:01:19.049> in

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
them here we have innovations in

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
them here we have innovations in
technology<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.189> expensive<00:01:20.509> so

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
technology that are more expensive so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.600 
technology that are more expensive so
you<00:01:21.540> roll<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> up<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.040> three<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> five

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you roll all that up and three to five

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.359 
you roll all that up and three to five
percent<00:01:23.970> typical<00:01:24.420> 2012<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> real<00:01:25.590> outlier

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
percent typical 2012 was a real outlier

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.219 
percent typical 2012 was a real outlier
year<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.909> saw<00:01:27.060> increases<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.659> almost<00:01:28.049> as

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
year or we saw increases of almost as

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
year or we saw increases of almost as
high<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.500> ten<00:01:28.710> percent<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.420> mostly

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
high as ten percent because of mostly

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
high as ten percent because of mostly
because<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.290> oil<00:01:31.500> prices<00:01:32.009> okay<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.210> know

because of oil prices okay so you know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
because of oil prices okay so you know

actually producing and raising the
prices<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.430> are<00:01:41.909> worth<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.140> money<00:01:43.290> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
