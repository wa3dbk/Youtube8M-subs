00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.320

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 nevertheless thats actually i 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.250
 I want to show you for it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.210
 great product let's start with the packaging 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 Today, probably we will only shoot 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 more packaging now more today 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 watch nothing means look here 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.210
 we actually tear off 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:39.170
 Packed luggage so beautiful packaging 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:43.290
 here from all sides here you can see 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:47.780
 so what good is this machine he has 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.510
 7-inch screen it has a built-in 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 bluetooth accordingly it can 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:59.250
 manage your fellow colleagues smartphone 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.410
 smartphone it has already smoke is very 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.500
 connector according to this now 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.799
 probably see means to give open not 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.049
 let's talk for a long time the question is open 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:15.049
 then open the box that we have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.470
 inside complete 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:24.689
 then it comes with a cable 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:29.729
 this cable this cable press with one 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.220
 side of another country m slot i'm so 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.200
 I understand most likely he will work with 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.579
 sony phones but that's us now 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.750
 check means besides this we have here 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.619
 there are adapters I mean it with this 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.909
 side we have a radio connector with this 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.820
 side 2 of the standard connector 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.979
 you see the sandbox, respectively 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.659
 cables need it 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.360
 see instructions for cable 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.250
 Well, in general, that's all there is like 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.020
 accordingly, this is our breaking up 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.220
 then break it a parking brake sorry 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 Here, respectively, it is clear to us 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.220
 hdmi-hdmi cable 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.670
 from the side of the big connector of the order and here 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.220
 same thing just maybe i'm pretty 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 this is the biggest light set 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 perhaps because of this will highlight 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.770
 I hope that will be fine except 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.260
 This is a microphone here. 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:43.380
 here you can probably see there is a clip and 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.520
 is paperwork it understands a 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.030
 self-adhesive piece of himself recant 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.430
 double sided tape 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.610
 that is, you can donate here 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 this is our connector and but we will return it 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.380
 pullers 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:07.410
 that's a set of fasteners here 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.550

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.990

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.600
 and accordingly the instruction 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.070

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:36.030
