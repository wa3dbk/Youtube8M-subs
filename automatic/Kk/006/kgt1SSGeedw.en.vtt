quite complicated one it involves taking

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.490 
quite complicated one it involves taking
trees<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.830> are<00:00:35.010> becoming<00:00:35.550> mature<00:00:36.060> so<00:00:36.840> so

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
trees that are becoming mature so so

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.790 
trees that are becoming mature so so
please<00:00:38.210> growing<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.379> three

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
please growing up up to about three

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
please growing up up to about three
meters<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.430> over<00:00:41.700> three<00:00:42.180> meters<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.660> height

meters or over three meters in height

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
meters or over three meters in height
once<00:00:43.470> those<00:00:43.710> trees<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.580> height

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
once those trees have got to that height

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
once those trees have got to that height
what<00:00:45.390> happens<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.080> is<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.680> base<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.280> tree

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
what happens is is the base of the tree

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.390 
what happens is is the base of the tree
no<00:00:47.970> longer<00:00:48.330> has<00:00:48.800> vegetation<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.949> it<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.309> you

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
no longer has vegetation on it so you

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.580 
no longer has vegetation on it so you
just<00:00:50.520> got<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> base<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.330> a<00:00:51.390> single<00:00:51.720> tree<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
just got the base of a single tree so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.170 
just got the base of a single tree so
you've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> lines<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.909> different

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
you've got a lot of lines of different

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.509 
you've got a lot of lines of different
trees<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.830> you<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.040> have<00:00:56.309> is

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
trees if you like what you don't have is

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.950 
trees if you like what you don't have is
you<00:00:56.580> don't<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.970> barrier<00:00:57.360> at<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.600> bottom

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you don't have a barrier at the bottom

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.770 
you don't have a barrier at the bottom
and<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.589> barrier<00:00:59.159> is<00:00:59.610> quite<00:01:00.120> important<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and that barrier is quite important and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.979 
and that barrier is quite important and
it<00:01:00.900> was<00:01:00.989> particularly<00:01:01.440> used<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:03.210> keeping<00:01:03.809> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it was particularly used for keeping in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.680 
it was particularly used for keeping in
livestock<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:05.309> idea<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> head<00:01:05.970> flying<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
livestock the idea of head flying is to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.070 
livestock the idea of head flying is to
take<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> tree<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.190> cut<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> bottom<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
take the tree to cut it at the bottom of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.039 
take the tree to cut it at the bottom of
the<00:01:10.409> tree<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> bend<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:11.850> still<00:01:12.780> leaving

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the tree and bend it over still leaving

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.250 
the tree and bend it over still leaving
some<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> bark<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.030> cambium<00:01:15.090> intact

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
some of the bark and the cambium intact

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.620 
some of the bark and the cambium intact
we<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.740> stakes<00:01:17.010> in<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.760> hold<00:01:17.970> them<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
we put stakes in to hold them there and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.750 
we put stakes in to hold them there and
then<00:01:19.320> we've<00:01:19.470> been<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.220> such<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> way<00:01:20.729> that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
then we've been over in such a way that

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.090 
then we've been over in such a way that
it's<00:01:21.210> still<00:01:21.810> attached<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.409> tree<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.920> it's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's still attached to the tree but it's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.639 
it's still attached to the tree but it's
laying<00:01:23.549> horizontally<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.049> weave<00:01:25.260> the

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
laying horizontally and you weave the

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.859 
laying horizontally and you weave the
features<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.759> they're<00:01:26.969> called<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> bits

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
features as they're called and the bits

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.020 
features as they're called and the bits
have<00:01:28.170> been<00:01:28.200> laid<00:01:28.950> horizontally<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.850> weave

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
have been laid horizontally you weave

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
have been laid horizontally you weave
those<00:01:30.240> together<00:01:30.539> to<00:01:31.049> hold<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.649> whole<00:01:31.799> thing

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
those together to hold the whole thing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
those together to hold the whole thing
down<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.060> bleachers<00:01:33.539> don't

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
down so that the bleachers don't

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
down so that the bleachers don't
actually<00:01:34.200> spring<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.829> again<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.219> once

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
actually spring back up again and once

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.569 
actually spring back up again and once
that's<00:01:36.360> done<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.289> actual<00:01:37.439> trees<00:01:38.009> start

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
that's done the actual trees start

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.929 
that's done the actual trees start
sprouting<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.439> horizontal<00:01:40.939> features

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
sprouting from the horizontal features

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.499 
sprouting from the horizontal features
so<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.719> creates<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.469> live<00:01:44.219> hedge<00:01:44.670> alive

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
so that creates a live hedge alive

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.929 
so that creates a live hedge alive
living<00:01:45.750> hedge<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> also<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.909> make

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
living hedge this that is also will make

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
living hedge this that is also will make
it<00:01:48.270> dense<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> bottom<00:01:49.200> again<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> like

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it dense at the bottom again if you like

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.760 
it dense at the bottom again if you like
so<00:01:50.310> you're<00:01:50.969> you're<00:01:51.390> creating<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.990> barrier<00:01:52.649> in

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so you're you're creating a barrier in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.319 
so you're you're creating a barrier in
the<00:01:52.829> bottom<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.579> things<00:01:53.969> that<00:01:54.149> livestock

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the bottom so that things that livestock

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.719 
the bottom so that things that livestock
can't<00:01:54.810> escape<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.710> reason<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.549> house

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
can't escape the reason that we do house

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.630 
can't escape the reason that we do house
staying<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.359> is<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.439> reasons<00:01:58.469> first<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
staying here is for two reasons first of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.639 
staying here is for two reasons first of
all<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.850> show<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.450> art<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:01.079> hedge<00:02:01.380> laying

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
all to show the art of hedge laying

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
all to show the art of hedge laying
because<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.340> quite<00:02:02.520> important<00:02:02.880> people<00:02:03.359> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
because it's quite important people a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.359 
because it's quite important people a
lot<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> people<00:02:03.960> haven't<00:02:04.259> seen<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.679> before<00:02:04.829> or

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
lot of people haven't seen it before or

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.980 
lot of people haven't seen it before or
haven't<00:02:05.520> done<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> before<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.509> do<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.749> for<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
haven't done it before we do it for that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.840 
haven't done it before we do it for that
reason<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.380> also<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:08.220> for<00:02:08.460> wildlife

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
reason but also it's for wildlife

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.570 
reason but also it's for wildlife
benefit<00:02:09.420> because<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.440> lay<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> hedge<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
benefit because when you lay a hedge it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
benefit because when you lay a hedge it
allows<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.360> different<00:02:12.810> species<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.530> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
allows the different species to be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.560 
allows the different species to be
spread<00:02:14.220> out<00:02:14.250> along<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> whole<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.390> length

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
spread out along the whole of the length

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:28.539 
spread out along the whole of the length
of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> hedge

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.160 

coppicing<00:02:29.579> is<00:02:29.879> slightly<00:02:30.510> different<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.079> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
coppicing is slightly different to the

come through them while we're doing the
tree<00:03:09.140> felling<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.099> do<00:03:10.220> another<00:03:10.489> type

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
tree felling and then we do another type

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.460 
tree felling and then we do another type
of<00:03:10.819> car<00:03:11.239> called<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.599> felling<00:03:11.930> cart<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.379> the

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
of car called the felling cart at the

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.650 
of car called the felling cart at the
back<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:13.220> eventually<00:03:13.849> that<00:03:14.030> creates<00:03:14.390> what<00:03:14.569> we

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
back and eventually that creates what we

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.140 
back and eventually that creates what we
call<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> hinge<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.799> that<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.010> tree<00:03:16.250> instead<00:03:16.849> of

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
call a hinge so that the tree instead of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.360 
call a hinge so that the tree instead of
going<00:03:17.480> really<00:03:18.019> really<00:03:18.230> fast<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:18.859> falling

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
going really really fast and falling

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.149 
going really really fast and falling
falls<00:03:19.819> down<00:03:20.090> very<00:03:20.480> gradually<00:03:23.709> when<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.859> when

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
falls down very gradually when you when

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.039 
falls down very gradually when you when
you<00:03:25.310> coppice<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.909> area<00:03:26.299> because<00:03:26.870> you're

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
you coppice in area because you're

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.319 
you coppice in area because you're
clearing<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.739> area<00:03:27.890> of<00:03:28.190> trees<00:03:28.640> effectively

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
clearing the area of trees effectively

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.819 
clearing the area of trees effectively
and<00:03:29.480> you're<00:03:29.569> creating<00:03:29.959> more<00:03:30.140> light<00:03:30.349> coming<00:03:30.709> in

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
and you're creating more light coming in

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.649 
and you're creating more light coming in
it's<00:03:31.129> a<00:03:31.250> bit<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.579> blade<00:03:31.849> creation<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.599> the

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
it's a bit like blade creation in the

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.839 
it's a bit like blade creation in the
sense<00:03:32.930> because<00:03:33.379> you're<00:03:33.620> clearing<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.549> so<00:03:34.730> that

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
sense because you're clearing it so that

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.520 
sense because you're clearing it so that
other<00:03:34.970> wild<00:03:35.299> plants<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.810> wild<00:03:36.049> flowers<00:03:36.109> can

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
other wild plants and wild flowers can

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.559 
other wild plants and wild flowers can
come<00:03:36.680> up<00:03:36.829> instead<00:03:37.220> creating<00:03:37.849> more<00:03:38.060> diversity

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
come up instead creating more diversity

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.420 
come up instead creating more diversity
again<00:03:38.900> once<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> trees<00:03:39.680> start<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.099> grow<00:03:40.250> back

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
again once the trees start to grow back

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.159 
again once the trees start to grow back
on<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.700> coppicing<00:03:41.180> it<00:03:41.659> then<00:03:41.840> creates

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
on the coppicing it then creates

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.870 
on the coppicing it then creates
different<00:03:42.530> habitats<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.220> you<00:03:43.340> have<00:03:43.459> different

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
different habitats so you have different

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.610 
different habitats so you have different
