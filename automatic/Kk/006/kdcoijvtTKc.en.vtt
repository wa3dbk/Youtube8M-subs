00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
hello my name is Tom and I wanted to

hello my name is Tom and I wanted to
this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.670> sort<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.090> an<00:00:09.240> introduction<00:00:09.690> but

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
this is sort of an introduction but

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.690 
this is sort of an introduction but
actually<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.440> doing<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.740> after<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.250> bunch<00:00:11.550> of

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
actually I'm doing it after a bunch of

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.720 
actually I'm doing it after a bunch of
tests<00:00:12.090> we've<00:00:12.210> done<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.780> drip<00:00:13.679> brewing<00:00:14.309> pour

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
tests we've done on drip brewing pour

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.180 
tests we've done on drip brewing pour
over<00:00:15.000> drip<00:00:15.210> brewing<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:16.890> wanted<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
over drip brewing and I just wanted to

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.370 
over drip brewing and I just wanted to
share<00:00:17.400> our<00:00:17.550> findings<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.050> watch<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
share our findings you can watch the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.340 
share our findings you can watch the
other<00:00:19.410> videos<00:00:19.920> too<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.910> mess<00:00:21.350> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
other videos too which are a mess and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
other videos too which are a mess and
see<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.730> process<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.630> etcetera<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.490> there's

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
see the process and etcetera but there's

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.450 
see the process and etcetera but there's
been<00:00:27.510> some<00:00:27.660> very<00:00:28.109> interesting<00:00:28.460> revelations

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
been some very interesting revelations

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.690 
been some very interesting revelations
in<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:30.179> series<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> tests<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.199> did<00:00:31.700> I'll

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
in this series of tests that we did I'll

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.030 
in this series of tests that we did I'll
just<00:00:32.969> cut<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> chase<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.290> them<00:00:34.440> was

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
just cut to the chase one of them was

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.790 
just cut to the chase one of them was
what<00:00:35.280> you're<00:00:35.760> trying<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.450> was<00:00:37.350> basically

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
what you're trying to do was basically

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.430 
what you're trying to do was basically
make<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.370> best<00:00:38.579> tasting<00:00:38.940> coffee<00:00:39.149> possible<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
make the best tasting coffee possible to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.190 
make the best tasting coffee possible to
do<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:41.180> we're<00:00:42.180> doing<00:00:42.300> two<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.989> course

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
do that we're doing two things of course

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.110 
do that we're doing two things of course
we're<00:00:43.379> tasting<00:00:43.590> our<00:00:44.010> results<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> we're<00:00:44.969> also

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we're tasting our results and we're also

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.160 
we're tasting our results and we're also
using<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:46.079> refractometer<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:48.360> check<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> brew

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
using a refractometer to check the brew

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.400 
using a refractometer to check the brew
strength<00:00:50.210> one<00:00:51.210> thing<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> we<00:00:51.690> found<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
strength one thing that we found is that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.950 
strength one thing that we found is that
this<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.219> tells<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.940> something<00:00:54.840> in

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
this thing tells you that something in

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.479 
this thing tells you that something in
the<00:00:55.140> area<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.579> point<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.750> eight<00:00:57.780> percent

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
the area of one point one eight percent

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
the area of one point one eight percent
extraction<00:00:59.809> to<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.020> point<00:01:01.260> two<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.550> where

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
extraction to one point two two is where

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
extraction to one point two two is where
most<00:01:03.270> people<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.899> their<00:01:04.860> extraction<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.970> we

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
most people like their extraction and we

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.609 
most people like their extraction and we
definitely<00:01:06.570> found<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> be<00:01:07.049> true<00:01:07.140> with

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
definitely found that to be true with

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.140 
definitely found that to be true with
the<00:01:07.770> cups<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.340> under<00:01:08.700> extracted<00:01:10.549> we<00:01:11.549> could

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the cups we under extracted we could

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.210 
the cups we under extracted we could
tell<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> favorable<00:01:14.939> result

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
tell that it was not a favorable result

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
tell that it was not a favorable result
what<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> does<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> measures<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
what this does is this measures the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.859 
what this does is this measures the
amount<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.170> soluble<00:01:19.860> solids<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.570> wash

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
amount of soluble solids that you wash

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.950 
amount of soluble solids that you wash
out<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> coffee<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.369> brewing<00:01:23.580> process

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
out of the coffee in the brewing process

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100 
out of the coffee in the brewing process
so<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.290> variables<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:27.030> grind<00:01:27.390> which

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
so the variables are your grind which

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.789 
so the variables are your grind which
exposes<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.220> surface<00:01:29.700> area<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.350> coffee

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
exposes more surface area of the coffee

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.850 
exposes more surface area of the coffee
to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> hot<00:01:32.640> water<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.479> allow<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.380> soluble

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to the hot water to allow the soluble

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
to the hot water to allow the soluble
solids<00:01:35.040> meaning<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> flavor<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> taste

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
solids meaning the flavor what you taste

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.039 
solids meaning the flavor what you taste
to<00:01:38.009> wash<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> coffee<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
to wash out in the coffee you have the

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
to wash out in the coffee you have the
temperature<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> brew<00:01:43.890> water<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:45.000> have

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
temperature of the brew water you have

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.670 
temperature of the brew water you have
the<00:01:45.420> amount<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.750> time<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.049> they're<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the amount of time that they're in

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.670 
the amount of time that they're in
contact<00:01:47.090> with<00:01:48.090> each<00:01:48.149> other<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.470> also

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
contact with each other and you also

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.889 
contact with each other and you also
have<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.810> turbidity<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:53.390> mixing<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
have the turbidity the mixing of the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.429 
have the turbidity the mixing of the
water<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:56.600> coffee<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.259> that's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
water and the coffee so if that's

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.480 
water and the coffee so if that's
stirred

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
stirred

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.730 
stirred
you<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> higher<00:02:00.509> extraction<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> shorter

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you get a higher extraction in a shorter

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.109 
you get a higher extraction in a shorter
amount<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.009> time<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.310> also<00:02:02.640> change<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
amount of time you also change the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
amount of time you also change the
flavor<00:02:03.299> results<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.659> those<00:02:06.659> things<00:02:06.869> are<00:02:07.079> all

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
flavor results so those things are all

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.430 
flavor results so those things are all
variable<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.849> obviously<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.750> filter<00:02:10.170> comes

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
variable and obviously with filter comes

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.820 
variable and obviously with filter comes
where<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.950> water<00:02:11.130> just<00:02:11.370> pours<00:02:11.700> right<00:02:11.790> through

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
where the water just pours right through

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.220 
where the water just pours right through
you<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.099> less<00:02:14.340> contact<00:02:14.790> time<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:16.110> know

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you have just less contact time you know

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
you have just less contact time you know
that's<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.280> difference<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.360> have

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
that's the difference is is that we have

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.910 
that's the difference is is that we have
these<00:02:18.599> filter<00:02:18.989> cones<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.500> then<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:19.680> have<00:02:19.800> this

don't<00:03:50.370> care

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
don't care

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.690 
don't care
but<00:03:51.390> um<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.439> filters<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.129> had<00:03:53.280> really<00:03:53.489> good

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
but um and filters have had really good

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.910 
but um and filters have had really good
results<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.360> us<00:03:54.569> I<00:03:54.870> think<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.799> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
results for us I think that the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.350 
results for us I think that the
structure<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> filter<00:03:56.849> doesn't<00:03:57.030> break<00:03:57.329> down

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
structure the filter doesn't break down

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.660 
structure the filter doesn't break down
so<00:03:57.840> much<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.439> pulp<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.010> paper<00:03:59.340> doesn't

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so much so the pulp of the paper doesn't

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.929 
so much so the pulp of the paper doesn't
get<00:03:59.970> into<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.360> coffee<00:04:00.629> as<00:04:01.470> much<00:04:01.799> why<00:04:02.730> does

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
get into the coffee as much why does

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.300 
get into the coffee as much why does
this<00:04:03.090> matter<00:04:03.360> well<00:04:03.900> with<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.409> Kenya<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.099> can

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
definitely tell the results I don't know

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.050 
definitely tell the results I don't know
if<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.200> could<00:04:07.349> with<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.680> Sumatra<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.909> can

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
especially with these methods you get

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.000
