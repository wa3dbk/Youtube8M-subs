00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.830
 smartphones or today's focus to me 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.020
 smartphone drawing app 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.800
 look now i'm using this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.670
 applications will try to predict one 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.779
 of the aces that looked 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.779
 waste try 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:46.300
 let us set aside the smartphone aside and 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.300
 mix review 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.050
 and ask the viewer to choose one of 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:01:00.170
 aces as a spectator no take advantage 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:03.530
 handle up to the very she falls on this one 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.000
 card and this is the ace of hearts 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:15.020
 what let's see our prediction 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.700
 this is also the ace of hearts learning this 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.500
 magic tricks for magic 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.380
 special application you can download 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.539
 on the link under the video and so how is she 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.240
 works see it looks normal 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.530
 drawing machine 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.649
 but if we run two fingers along 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.690
 screen we have a menu here 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.950
 proposed prediction can choose 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.300
 one of them can also create a file 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.569
 click to create a new prediction 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.630
 us a smartphone appears in each of 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.459
 systems of two leaves in total 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 there can be 8 predictions on each of 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.900
 do we write with a dot let quietly before 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.230
 here 2 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.230
 3 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.600
 and 4 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.229
 instead of these numbers in focus 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.289
 were addressed aces save and now 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.349
 look out you can draw all that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.200
 when you turn it over with you 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.370
 all but disappear now depending on 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.620
 what country will you be 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.900
 turn over the smartphone such 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.450
 predictions of you appearing let's say and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 if the viewer made a guess 3 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.950
 turn this way with us 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:35.239
 trio appears if 4 this way 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:39.410
 four if we take two for the bottom corners 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.250
 smartphone and raise up deuce and one 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.250
 over the top 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.299
 nails said prediction maybe 8 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.650
 so we change our little 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.650
 we will write a prediction on one side 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 golden eagle 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.220

 now we have to turn over 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.470
 addiction if we invert quickly 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.010
 we will be three look at the lines if 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.160
 almost longer 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:26.710
 there will be five 55 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.060
