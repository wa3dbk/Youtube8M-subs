 who is guilty 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.130
 incomprehensibly incomprehensible which consisted 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 there was a mowin technique I can hit him 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.809
 wash the engine will stop mass 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.450
 options and ball lightning run a little 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 so far this gene was with us today tragedies 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.740
 reminds only signs and rye from here 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.490
 before the runway airfield 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 Borodyanka 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.619
 only a kilometer and a half according to 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.840
 alexander famous trouble test pilot 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 no hard landing and no speech comes with 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.420
 height of about two thousand meters plane 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.700
 l-410 fell down literally buried 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.250
 nose of the earth from the crash site wreckage 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 aircraft transported here to the special site 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.850
 experts have already seized airborne 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.410
 recorders after decoding them about 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.510
 the causes of the disaster can be said 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.820
 probably being considered 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 multiple versions have complex conditions 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600
 pilot error technical failure 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.120
 well, or a combination of all factors 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.710
 plane paratroopers aboard stayed in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 air no more than 10 minutes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.609
 hurricane storm 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.379
 a shower came suddenly why 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.350
 dispatchers with such forecasts and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.610
 allowed departure figure out investigators 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 the crew commander decided 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.299
 urgently return attempt 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 land ended in tragedy 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.860
 5 skydivers died on the spot another 15 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.750
 man including two crew members 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.909
 are now in hospitals 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.340
 aircraft not equipped not equipped 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.100
 which is already a matter of which 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.530
 can determine where nosachas and thunderstorms then 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.150
 is it all visually visually if 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.430
 there is clearance clear there 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.439
 they are like blind kittens I understand 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 in the Ukrainian school of pilots who 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.829
 belongs to the board as well as in the club 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.329
 skydiving to comment 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.820
 situation refused until the end 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 the investigation is known that the pilots were 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.890
 experienced athletes with different levels 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.590
 preparation of l-410 is just applied for 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.110
 delivery parachutists to a height of 4000 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.790
 meters for delayed jumps per day 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.280
 this plane could fly up to 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 15 times before technical problems not 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.620
 arose works good reliable 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.800
 operated very well 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.680
 operated by 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.830
 Airplanes I do not know in my 89 years 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.229
 release and still he fly or for so long 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 the word aircraft capacity of 18 people 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.430
 this together with crew members while 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.290
 wreck aboard was 20 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.959
 investigator does not exclude possible 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 the cause of the accident is overweight on the plane 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.580
 l-410 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 can take two crew members and 16 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 passengers 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.410

 us passengers two people who 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.150
 seemed on the plane let's say it was 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 there were extra passenger they did not pass 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.480
 physical examination of flying that's how 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.730
 the way they were allowed too becomes 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.680
 the prosecutor's office of the Kiev region brought 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.320
 criminal case if established 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.180
 guilty person faces from 5 to 10 years 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.310
 prisons along with that on the airfield 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.290
 Borodyanka not going to cancel flights
