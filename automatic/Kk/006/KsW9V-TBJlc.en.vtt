00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I I did too and but I didn't really like

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.019 
I I did too and but I didn't really like
this<00:00:16.800> map<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.160> first<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.460> really<00:00:17.580> started<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
this map at first I really started to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
this map at first I really started to
kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:19.550> I<00:00:20.550> remember<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> did

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
kind of like it I I remember I did

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
really good in this match but think I

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.150 
really good in this match but think I
had<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.300> really<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:24.960> close<00:00:25.380> calls<00:00:25.769> and
