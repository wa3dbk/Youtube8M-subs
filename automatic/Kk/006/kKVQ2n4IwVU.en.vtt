00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.650
 hi how about youtube friends how are you 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.820
 he says he's missing 90 with a new video and 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.250
 good friends in that we find in a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.230
 boxing a very different product for 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.630
 the channel in this case as you can see is 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.180
 a command a control for what they are 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.150
 mobile devices is the fashion brand 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.179
 and it's fashion but it's a control like 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.349
 I comment via bluetooth that can follow 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.699
 to play with mobile devices in 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.010
 this case only works with 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.470
 Android only works with android 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.699
 from version 2.3 and well let 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 open up this part of here a little 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.329
 that can see what it brings in here 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.460
 good here where he creates situations of 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.110
 how to use it open up a bit what is a 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.750
 slot that it brings to be able to insure its 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.059
 phone and to enjoy what is the 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.260
 game and I also know we can use it 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.640
 to play on our tablet phone and 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.800
 this good although it is compatible with 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.649
 different types of game we are not going to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.629
 proceed to open it to parties only 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.629
 some games with others are compatible 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.300
 let's open it to see what it includes 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.190
 on the inside 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.920
 and good that on the street absolutely 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.140
 nothing and good as a good person who in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.940
 what is the control and in the part 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.990
 bottom is not a USB cable is USB 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 Mini USB is not Micro USB USB Pardon 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.439
 micro usb is to be able to charge it I guess 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.750
 based on plastic and brings us this 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.600
 small base that apparently is for 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.570
 put a tablet to use it with 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.329
 a tablet is a small adapter that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.880
 as you can see from here what is the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.140
 mark muga let's see how it is used 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.819
 well we are going to be able to side so 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.610
 soon and good friends here we have what 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.710
 which is the control let's proceed to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.909
 remove it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.909
 it looks complicated 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.729
 ready we could take it out as they can 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.060
 appreciate is very similar to what a 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.760
 xbox control what are the joysticks 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.220
 the buttons of this part from here to 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.770
 the eyes from here are very similar 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.120
 so what are the triggers is very 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.310
 similar or that are verb control 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 same is very ergonomic also and has 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.430
 very good grip on this part of here 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.560
 I have good pressure this part of here 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.150
 It has some kind of texture and it's another 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.430
 material which will allow you very 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.580
 have a good grip on the back 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.820
 we can see only what is the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.560
 brand and here has a small button 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.940
 -I do not know what will be in the part 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.500
 here we can see what is the charger or 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.070
 the adapter for the micro usb charger 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.620
 and in this part, what he does is 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.550
 lift and bring a qr code and in this 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.350
 part of here we are going to put our 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.050
 phone how can you see that you can 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.690
 expand 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.000
 to be able to put our phone, try 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.430
 that a phone is 4.5 inches what 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.290
 which as you can appreciate is very very 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.420
 great without problems of entering the 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.300
 phone and here I have to do button 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 to turn it on and off the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.500
 true control is very father and as you 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.690
 I say it is compatible with various types of 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.190
 game we studied programs forward in 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.170
 a full what we are going to be doing 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.700
 trying some games but it would be good 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.460
 share them in a box in this product 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.620
 the control is very rigid is very very 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:29.150
 solid the stick feel very good 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.550
 feel a little lighter than the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.830
 of the xbox just like the trigger they feel very 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.990
 well and also the top buttons and 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.070
 all others and without protection 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.690
 but well we 're going to try that already in 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.010
 one was the review where we're going to be 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.650
 testing different types of games and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.570
 everything to try and play experience 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.370
 can give us this kind of control of 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.750
 my furniture liked to be a box if you 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.890
 will like to leave a comment in the part 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.570
 from here below see how they thought 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.220
 click on I like button and they are 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.630
 negotiated decades in the part here 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.920
 down something very important that I 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.570
 like to leave in the comments 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.220
 what game do you like that program that 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.390
 let's try this control since good 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.440
 is devastating the game that you 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.750
 leave to be able 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.150
 do is a good review and that is useful 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.710
 for you to see how it 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.330
 unwraps in different games is like 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.500
 I left it in the comments and what game 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.360
 of justice that we will prove with this 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.290
 control then I hope you like this 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.290
 video let's go to the next 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.010
 and 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.010
 and
