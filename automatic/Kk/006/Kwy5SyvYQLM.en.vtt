00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
with it snarling it's not even slightly

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.749

happening<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.450> degree<00:01:31.020> tur<00:01:31.369> not<00:01:32.369> happening

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
happening on a degree tur not happening

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.090 
happening on a degree tur not happening
just<00:01:33.270> there<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.720> happening<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.950> that

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
just there to happening which is that

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:44.899
