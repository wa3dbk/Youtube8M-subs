00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
something that I started doing when I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.000 
something that I started doing when I
had<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.540> be<00:04:29.660> introduced<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.410> idea<00:04:30.710> of<00:04:30.770> doing

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
had to be introduced the idea of doing

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.400 
had to be introduced the idea of doing
life<00:04:31.220> drawing<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.850> when<00:04:32.540> you're<00:04:32.720> 17<00:04:33.170> you're

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
life drawing and when you're 17 you're

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.530 
life drawing and when you're 17 you're
dying<00:04:33.710> naked<00:04:33.980> people<00:04:34.250> usually<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.940> best<00:04:35.240> way

out what I'm doing and then do a

what I want to do it's been finalized
idea<00:05:17.000> before<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.840> move<00:05:18.170> on<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.800> whatever<00:05:19.550> the

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
idea before I move on to whatever the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.960 
idea before I move on to whatever the
final<00:05:19.910> is<00:05:20.150> going<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.540> be<00:05:21.460> and<00:05:22.460> I<00:05:22.550> know<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.820> is

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
final is going to be and I know this is

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.410 
final is going to be and I know this is
kind<00:05:23.180> of<00:05:23.240> all<00:05:23.420> the<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:25.100> it's<00:05:25.880> a<00:05:26.180> little

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
kind of all the and it's a little

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.450 
kind of all the and it's a little
difficult<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:27.110> follow<00:05:27.580> in<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.700> way<00:05:28.930> but<00:05:30.460> there

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
difficult to follow in a way but there

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000 
difficult to follow in a way but there
are<00:05:31.730> other<00:05:31.940> ways<00:05:32.150> to<00:05:32.600> sort<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:32.960> learn<00:05:33.440> how<00:05:33.830> to

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
are other ways to sort of learn how to

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.940 
are other ways to sort of learn how to
pick<00:05:34.850> up<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:35.210> art<00:05:35.420> stuff<00:05:35.690> those<00:05:36.440> art<00:05:36.680> books

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
pick up on art stuff those art books

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.710 
pick up on art stuff those art books
that<00:05:37.190> they<00:05:37.340> have<00:05:37.580> where<00:05:37.850> it's<00:05:37.970> like<00:05:38.120> draw<00:05:38.420> a

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
that they have where it's like draw a

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.600 
that they have where it's like draw a
circle<00:05:39.200> and<00:05:39.230> then<00:05:39.530> draw<00:05:39.770> a<00:05:39.890> line<00:05:40.190> for<00:05:40.490> the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
circle and then draw a line for the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.360 
circle and then draw a line for the
spine<00:05:40.910> and<00:05:41.330> then<00:05:41.420> draw<00:05:41.660> another<00:05:41.800> box<00:05:42.800> for<00:05:43.280> the

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
spine and then draw another box for the

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.050 
spine and then draw another box for the
chest<00:05:43.700> I<00:05:44.270> do<00:05:44.840> use<00:05:45.260> that<00:05:45.590> method<00:05:46.340> in<00:05:46.640> order<00:05:46.910> to

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
chest I do use that method in order to

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.750 
chest I do use that method in order to
sort<00:05:47.270> of<00:05:47.390> gauge<00:05:48.020> proportions<00:05:48.950> on<00:05:49.340> some<00:05:49.610> of<00:05:49.730> my

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
sort of gauge proportions on some of my

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.920 
sort of gauge proportions on some of my
art<00:05:51.040> it's<00:05:52.040> very<00:05:52.330> frustrating<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.720> have

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
art it's very frustrating to have

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.590 
art it's very frustrating to have
disproportionate<00:05:54.860> characters<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:56.060> can<00:05:56.330> tell

disproportionate characters you can tell

disproportionate characters you can tell
almost<00:05:56.900> immediately<00:05:57.290> when<00:05:57.470> something's

almost immediately when something's
wrong<00:05:57.890> especially<00:05:58.160> if<00:05:58.610> you<00:05:58.700> draw<00:05:58.880> people

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
wrong especially if you draw people

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
people are difficult to draw because we

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.640 
people are difficult to draw because we
know<00:06:02.270> so<00:06:02.510> much<00:06:02.660> what<00:06:02.870> they<00:06:02.990> look<00:06:03.200> like<00:06:03.230> if

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
know so much what they look like if
