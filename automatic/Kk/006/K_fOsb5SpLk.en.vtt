00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 television know if it is read or read or what 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.040
 kind of technology buy this what 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.830
 we can do if we talk to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.110
 a tech assistant warehouse sim치n 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 we are here with leo our teak 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.310
 assistant as is I read you like the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.020
 clear television especially if on a tv 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.660
 one can do much more than just see 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.580
 good channels you can even do with 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 a curved TV like this one that we have 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
 here a very peculiar characteristic the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.059
 that you mentioned about our from the jehol 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
 is that being curved means that we can 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.620
 see it from any angle of view 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.540
 It is a thin and light screen and 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.830
 quite flexible with a sharpness 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.019
 incredible that's an experience 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.040
 different from what we knew before and 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.620
 It even saves you almost 50% of energy 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.080
 If I want the best resolution for a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.430
 I have to ask for a TV 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:03.630
 4k television in sim치n warehouses 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.930
 Several samsung lg and sony brands that 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.160
 They have 4k TVs as options which 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.620
 It is the best option that we 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.170
 we could have for sports or to see 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.570
 They are very good and we could evaluate their 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.220
 magnetic fluid speakers that would give 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 a much more enveloping sound 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 three luminous technology for that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.009
 image sharpness providing a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.460
 experience as if you were in the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.460
 stadium 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 I understand that the samsung option that 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.840
 we have in warehouses sim치n can also 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.150
 be a topic on Skype if it's right and that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.680
 it's because of its integrated camera that you 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.320
 allows to also use platforms 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.300

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.909
