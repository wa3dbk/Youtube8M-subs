 plant we are talking about today 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.850
 it is a perennial plant though among 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.220
 cereals found and annuals just 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.930
 ships waters considered uncomfortable so much 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.580
 time to spend on annuals to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.609
 It begins with a low all 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.739
 cuttings are not evil at all but it 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.019
 foliage is very similar to low weed on 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.969
 low cereal and blooms blue or 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.530

 residual place for him we chose 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.649
 Putin in contrast to him and the color of the foliage and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.210
 as if in biology by the present glock 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.500
 it is a yellow variegated face 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.920
 configuration of the seat for her 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.740
 more round Siberian iris 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.440
 also not evil but to distinguish it from varnishes not 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.720
 a specialist is very difficult his fountain 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.369
 similar empty and narrow fresh leaves 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.240
 beautifully set off 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.030
 yourself fee lightness yellow yellow 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.090

 Siberian pepper and place the real 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.340
 the eye is miscanthus sugar tsvetkova 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.649
 and here yourself with the campus as if at the very

 water cascade massage lines 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.780
 in general daylilies are plants of nature itself 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.729
 intended for lacquer garden 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.100
 plants used for planting dolls 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.929

 floral lily non hybrid iris 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.479
 Siberian soil which we prepare for 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.340
 planting cereals we dig 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.030
 align we give it a desired level and 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.700
 we make light sand markings so that 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.320
 here are these configurations of seats 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.810
 which are meant for some 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.049
 one kind of cereal of one 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.109
 varieties were clearly visible pay attention 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.970
 that the area of the seat, as it were 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.310
 increases as 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.560
 increases the height and size of the bushes 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.829
 plants but this is understandable because 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.709
 little fescue need a little square 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:35.440
 every bush here for months 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.389
 67 bushes and a large 2-meter y 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 miscanthus u need more space and there 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:42.990
 fit only 2-3 bush 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.180
 for those who want to create cereal ok 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.940
 Olya Russian style 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.050
 better quality of herbs to choose 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.200
 plant heavily pubescent or fragrant 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.780
 leaf foliage typical plant is sage 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.660
 this plant is really steppe 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.580
 southern not all sage we have a good self 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.750
 feel for several types of perennial 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.830
 sage will be very out of place 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.740
 decorative bows that are not worth 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.110
 neglect bloom in june month 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.540
 cereal garden here for example large bow 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:24.470
 capitate moisture for dry places fescue 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.470
 gray losing bulbous adjika finger 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.580
 flowering plant that is, those that we 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.100
 call the grass close and decided 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.830
 plant and in a familiar garden is better for them 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.480
 take a narrow strip here I am cereal we 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.770
 took a wide long and rounded look 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.200
 forbs in this case yarrow 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.260
 in the dry glock garden we took 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.120
 narrow strip of cereals better developed on 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.590
 rather poor soils therefore 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.850
 categorically can not be made there 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.490
 rotted manure 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.160
 compost it all will result in excessive 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:00.150
 the growth of the bones of their collapse and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.510
 loss of decoration keep in mind 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.010
 many signs are very good and fast 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.900
 spread so they don't 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.610
 flooded your tatka in the most malicious 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.880
 I advise weeds to limit their vital 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.530
 Todes hip business or winding horizontal bar 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.359
 netting even if you are not 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.970
 fan of cereals and not going 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.030
 do a cereal garden in your garden not 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.690
 forget that cereals are wonderful 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.260
 neighbors 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.900
 for all garden plants and in the plan 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.760
 decoration and in terms of biological 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.690
 they look great next to 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.480
 coniferous near ferns miles and 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.210
 miles nicknames thousands of foresters 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.600
 daisies and just adding cereals 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:52.250
 any garden composition flower garden will give 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.669
 him natural beauty and elegance and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.669
 grace
