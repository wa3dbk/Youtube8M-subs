00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.930
 and this is the theme of today doing one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.720
 vegan pastry then only with 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.110
 but exclusively vegetable products 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.200
 not using refined flours and 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.600
 not even sugars and refined and then 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.279
 who would I like to talk about these of these 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 characteristics therefore pastry 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.430
 possibly vegan greedy playful and 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.430
 also healthy 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 here at most we are in the world gotha 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 haute cuisine is also a bit 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 sad because for now I'm the only ad 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 be invited to this event 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.350
 i'm a bit thoughtful i wish there 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.269
 they were more traveling companions than ever 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.190
 it is not an organization of this kind 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.680
 an important space has been given but 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.630
 relatively small compared to the big one 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.310
 event that is however the world and this 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.810
 maximum let's say this is one 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.050
 representation also of what stands 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.800
 happening in the reality that surrounds us 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.570
 we take the good we take as 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.130
 good these extraordinary occasions 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.360
 we are together with kitchen masters 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.340
 traditional 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.290
 let us try to set an example in the meantime 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.790
 we try to do our thing yours 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.090
 craft my trade we try to 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.980
 do me good and then we hope that he is 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.890
 these little seeds we are putting 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.310
 in the ether in the air then I can be 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.050
 optimistic but the flavors of gastronomy 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.110
 traditional based on animal foods and 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.000
 that people consider me take you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.560
 instead it succeeds in realizing them 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.180
 first of all maximum is not said that me 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.979
 should always follow these tastes 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.770
 traditional can sometimes go too 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.900
 crosswise and in any case I don't know if you have 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 also saw the exhibition you saw that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.290
 aromatic herbs are also present 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.090
 in spices the spices in a delicate way 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.740
 use of natural sweeteners also 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.510
 those give flavors sometimes 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.190
 strangers but at the same time also that 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.630
 they give a character a strength 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.220
 what is the thing that strikes of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.560
 more people who approach for the first 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.320
 once this new style the presence of 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.900
 taste and playfulness the philosophy that 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.570
 behind it is the philosophy that 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.580
 behind must be offer must not 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.640
 to be imposed and therefore it may be necessary 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.860
 often under the guise of maybe throwing it 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.050
 messages but not violently 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.209
 not directly sometimes 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.130
 bypassing the obstacle in mode 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.720
 expressive shortly to laborers and between 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.880
 we vegans there are people who have a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.860
 big heart of skills 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.870
 extraordinary but then on a practical level i 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.000
 dishes are not very greedy 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.920
 are the eyes are devoid of those 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.780
 instead all these areas must be cultivated 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.680
 the new vegan kitchen will have to be like this 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 this is certain 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.530
 may be light, not always healthy 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.300
 must copy the traditional forms e 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 must be rich in colors of 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.510
 this is also contrasting consistencies 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.120
 what is important is a technique 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.520
 clear sharp aesthetic that the part 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.200
 exterior of the mountain so loved by 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.900
 tiziano terzani and his wife well but i 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.640
 True treasures are within flavors 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.130
 so it is also a metaphor for life 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.050
 there is the external beauty and also the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.820
 inner achievements so coveted by 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.560
 our friend tiziano terzani then the 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.510
 research spiritual research that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.880
 also scientific, etc., etc. 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.290
 if the mondadori is interested by the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.330
 recipes there will be a reason 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.760
 we can see what is achieved 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.020
 together with them but with them I did 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.580
 an interesting vegan cookbook 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.890
 the out-of-print book is not going 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.910
 well now we are reprinting and this is it 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:55.340
 an immense joy has already immense it is me 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.780
 also due to the fact that I finished a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.090
 another book always with the mondadori 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.370
 on vegan pastries e 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.950
 the introduction of the magic angela 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.050
 staude terzani then the wife of the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.150
 disappeared Titian Terzani and she has 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.460
 decided to give me this hand 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.730
 the miracle of vegan pastry 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.540
 I think the big challenge is a challenge 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.980
 of challenges 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.520
 seems impossible not in pastry 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.550
 vegan john can't eggs e 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.080
 let's do as I said before 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.640
 you don't need to copy one hundred percent 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.040
 classic recipes sometimes the 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.180
 Vegan pastries can also go into 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.920
 a direction all its own 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.870
 today we tried to make a dessert not 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.150
 I know if you saw a mimosa form of 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.480
 mountain is a whose the aesthetic game a 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.460
 gustatory game then cheers i 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.010
 if vegan pastry chefs then have the 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.930
 courage to do traditional things to 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.969
 same time then take even if not 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.429
 it's quarrel nizar is what it is 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.279
 tradition already offers due to invent 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:54.899
 or this is to ensure I like it 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.499
 very much make fruit cappuccinos 

00:04:54.899 --> 00:05:00.509
 so for example take the fruit 

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:02.819
 smoke carla with cherry wood 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.879
 also make it fit glasses 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:08.039
 transparent and form Capuchins with 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.889
 foams made from the sides of pine nuts 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.739
 or sides with almonds and fruit 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.809
 dry as the future of it sees it 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:17.939
 plant-based nutrition certainly 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:21.329
 erosia as long as people do 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:23.759
 intrigue in order to do things 

00:05:21.329 --> 00:05:25.739
 colorful and tasty with textures 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.589
 fun colors 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:30.569
 now we are an average of 67 million 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.860
 interested and in the vegetarian world in 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.019
 Italy 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.819
 well surely growing number a 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.769
 level at university level la 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.719
 request in the cafeterias and is 13 percent 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:41.099
 of food that Italians therefore this is 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.319
 an important number and these 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.989
 modern and young vegetarians will be 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:49.829
 then dad will be mothers who in turn 

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:51.659
 will recommend the children plant food a 

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:54.419
 I turn to them I root for them 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:56.759
 and I'm trying to offer them gods 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.509
 useful tools for the dissemination of 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:01.279
 these issues 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.279
 the future is certainly green
