barracks to build I'm not going to go to
right<00:01:06.570> now<00:01:06.720> because<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> build<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> free

right now because I want to build a free

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.280 
right now because I want to build a free
but<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:09.150> sec<00:01:09.420> let's<00:01:09.689> go<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.229> there

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but one sec let's go right back there

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.660 
but one sec let's go right back there
and<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:11.220> costs<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> said<00:01:12.360> yeah

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
and it costs I think it said yeah

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.969 
and it costs I think it said yeah
750,000<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> why<00:01:15.979> apparently

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
750,000 so this is why apparently

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.560 
750,000 so this is why apparently
according<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.670> forums<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.210> why<00:01:18.330> they

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
according to the forums is why they

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.859 
according to the forums is why they
implemented<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.580> 25<00:01:21.150> new<00:01:21.299> walls<00:01:21.540> was

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
implemented and these 25 new walls was

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.140 
implemented and these 25 new walls was
because<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> their<00:01:22.470> new<00:01:22.850> buildings<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
because of their new buildings in the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.999 
because of their new buildings in the
game<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.600> already<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.320> dark<00:01:25.680> barracks

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
game I already have one dark barracks

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.520 
game I already have one dark barracks
here<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.460> haven't<00:01:27.060> found<00:01:27.450> much<00:01:27.630> used<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.470> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
here I haven't found much used for the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
here I haven't found much used for the
dark<00:01:28.710> barracks<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.549> farming<00:01:29.970> minions<00:01:30.780> are

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
dark barracks for farming minions are

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.960 
dark barracks for farming minions are
quite<00:01:31.110> strong<00:01:31.470> once<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.130> level<00:01:32.460> them<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.729> but

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
quite strong once you level them up but

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340 
quite strong once you level them up but
that's<00:01:33.150> got<00:01:33.420> actually<00:01:33.869> quite<00:01:34.020> expensive

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that's got actually quite expensive

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
that's got actually quite expensive
takes<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.189> long<00:01:35.340> time<00:01:35.369> takes<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.880> lot<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> dark

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
takes a long time takes a lot of dark

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.510 
takes a long time takes a lot of dark
elixir<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.799> haven't<00:01:37.950> used<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
elixir so I really haven't used them to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.910 
elixir so I really haven't used them to
too<00:01:38.670> much<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> i<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.329> probably<00:01:39.570> upgrade<00:01:40.320> my

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
too much and i will probably upgrade my

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
too much and i will probably upgrade my
dark<00:01:41.159> barracks<00:01:41.520> once<00:01:42.119> i<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.630> much

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
