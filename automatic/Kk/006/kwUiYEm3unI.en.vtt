00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hello, I welcome you to this new one 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.880
 Video 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 Today we want to match Easter 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.050
 live a few easter bunnies 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.630
 you can decorate the beautiful for 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 example in europe or it is also one 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:37.739
 good gift idea for friends or 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:41.879
 family now you start with that he 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.250
 records the hare on the fabric 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 you just take chalk or tailor 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.149
 just like I just have a textile here 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.219
 pen and yes the whole thing would have to now 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.730
 do it twice for the fore and aft 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.739
 back of the rabbit and the template 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.180
 You can just go to the bottom of the page 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.180
 Download video description 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.970
 Now follows the cutting out of the bunny 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.979
 make sure you do the whole thing 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.680
 Carefully, you can do it all the better 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.960
 then both sides overlap 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.960
 to sew all together later 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.409
 then you put both pieces of fabric 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.650
 right on the right that is nice side 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.990
 on nice side and then you can 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.960
 to draw another helper line for the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 Sincerely, you can just give one 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.240
 measure half a centimeter from the edge then 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.140
 you have easier later too 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 to sew now with the whole 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.190
 stick pins off so you guys later 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.190
 when sewing nothing slipped 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.560
 Here you have to pay attention that you 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.570
 below leaves a turning open 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 that means you can not take it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:16.610
 otherwise you can not hare the rabbit later 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:20.300
 turn around on the nice side so now 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.730
 it starts with the sewing at the beginning 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.519
 lock that the seam does not open 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.500
 and then on the dashed line up 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.440
 continue to turn 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.120
 then you briefly set and locked 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.549
 again so that the seam does not rise 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.030
 and then you just take it up again 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.170
 to start through and then the hare 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.170
 already sewn together 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.760
 another small tip around the curves 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 to be able to see better 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.200
 Just let the needle lift in the fabric 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.200
 the nose of 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.390
 then you can turn the fabric and then 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.260
 never lower her feet and cut 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.260
 simply further 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.299
 if you are to deal with the then 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.719
 just cuts all superfluous ones 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.129
 threads off and then it goes along already 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:36.129
 get rid of the walls 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.079
 to make it easier you can 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.950
 just take a pencil 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.950
 the fabric corners and edges better 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.950
 fill 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.060
 so now we almost come to the end 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.430
 and that stuffed with cotton because of the 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.610
 craft is always very expensive buy 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.090
 I always just like that in the furniture market 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:50.430
 a cheap pillow cuts it open and 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.430
 take from it debate then to fill 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.199
 after stuffing with cotton must now 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.710
 down the walls mouth closed 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.220
 become 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.770
 you're back for a few 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.379
 pin so that the ethics inside 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.020
 lie and then you can just 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.759
 drive with the sewing machine over it 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.419
 and then the rabbit is actually too 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.419
 already finished 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.999
 Finally, you just take one more 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.539
 Wool thread to hang the rabbit later 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:35.810
 to be able to and stings this with one 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:39.139
 Needle needle between both ears relative 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.449
 by the edge of the fabric and then 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.789
 you just have to knot it together yes 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:06:11.479
 and then the rabbit is actually too 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:06:13.669
 that's it , that's it 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.389
 with the video I hope you have it 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.919
 like 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:17.600
 I wish you much fun 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.280
 check 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.080
 if you want you can have one here 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:27.850
 Tie the ribbon drum and the easter bunny 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.850
 and then we'll see each other in the next video
