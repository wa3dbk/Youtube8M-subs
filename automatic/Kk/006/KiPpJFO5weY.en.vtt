00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.709
 to the question next 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.879
 can a similar article by platini bureau 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.090
 get across what's cool from where 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.250
 she took 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.199
 to have a discussion in 2005 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.329
 firstly it is called a planet 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:13.859
 as 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.359
 nemesis only them when in fact 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:17.829
 it is not clear 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.199
 continue 8th place 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.339
 that is, when ours is the sun up to 2 0 star 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.929
 maybe if you forgot the way to this 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.300
 the concept of questions is well known to science 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.659
 and so on and here's the second sun in march 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.040
 exploded 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.080
 sverdlov feeling was 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.300
 died that is, there is a stub from 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.320
 the sun 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.510
 mass in circulation 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 out of them was dissolved arose tried 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.150
 our sun system 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.300
 what's left of sweat stomach tears 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.210
 one atom left dead 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.400
 star clinics news what 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.830
 I'm in this which is up to 1600 kilometers 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.790
 and your girlfriend is also sunny by the way 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.650
 so only they are extremely planet 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.550
 naturally dead star project 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.980
 neutron star 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.310
 which turns into a club of her fat 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.530
 the pros beaten has changed 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.670
 according to the embassy information pieces on 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.990
 cigarettes will be very large olympic 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.950
 detectives 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.480
 before communication up to 3600 years 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.030
 you want cards for 3,500 years 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 nipped off percent of the ring 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.170
 email that's just from the percentage plane 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.540
 solar man process with all 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.070
 planets which this project 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.170
 advanced but spirit do 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.150
 the limit will happen so let's say always 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.680
 it happened at different points of his wives 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.870
 times cataclysms when and so on 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.020
 shields work this year 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.050
 she ran drains close land and to 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.990
 the sun and in this case disappeared but 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.270
 scoreboard podium being third year 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.750
 on the army parameter is that the apple from 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.860
 publications which then and search took 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.020
 sultanate 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.170
 but I'm their scf that person then 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.830
 stock project 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.770
 Where 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.650
 it's more like the sun 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.760
 and reported that the activity of the sun 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.490
 increases dramatically 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.990
 social styling minded because no color and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.180
 solar activity 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.929
 and this is in the middle then the cycle is friend 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.239
 cut assets oslo and homage 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.429
 that taking 17 hours of sleep to scientists 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:19.899
 but already shouted m about what will be given and 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.099
 percentage of supernovae new 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.639
 time the sun came in 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.429
 what is that sverdlovskim not 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.199
 new and there are comments 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.389
 I have this new when 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.239
 m for a very short time 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.439
 luminosity of the sun and the star of the year 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.650
 what happened was the sauce 2 a dozen 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.539
 million times 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:40.929
 not just a flash in the sun she is a million 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.399
 since it wove to the fact that 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.279
 on the surface of the ebrr on 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.819
 parts of the planet that are lit up for him 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.479
 evaporated 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.230
 no seas oceans and so on 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.750
 if everything else would be needed 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.960
 but it was the fourth too 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.240
 I am very glad that 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.530
 There, too, discounts are available to the prosecutor 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.830
 low 1000 degrees ports and busy what 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.859
 how much to stay 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.249
 new life of the city died 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:06.380
 completely 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 percentage of supernova interrogation sun burst 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.989
 star 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.669
 what will happen next went the same managed 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.679
 perished 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.489
 here oh after that if not today 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.359
 it was new 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.209
 ready next year's adventures of this 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.729
 preaching pixels after the death of nemesis 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:23.369
 and so on 

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.969
 had to go very close to the ground and 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.709
 after school fell m if it was not 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.829
 would get a solution 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.749
 the atmosphere of the earth was in the area of ​​circulation 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.939
 Only for a day can they do it at all 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.029
 he continued the topic there would be no one 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.199
 love the fact that no one would have died with laughter 

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.209
 the order is no different 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.839
 this is what might happen in the future 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.189
 year 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.839
 it is not true that the referees of this one 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.780
 spheres 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.149
 the winner will not be 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.299
 there was a change of 92 according to boldyrev 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.449
 the limits 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.959
 rumors will never come again and 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.219
 for the first time hold their dirty tricks 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.389
 apparently the area of ​​the brain that spawned the whole 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:01.999
 a life 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.659
 she almost destroyed everything to 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.749
 strait though on the mass already 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.279
 destroyed the scene earlier on Friday 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.359
 Karpachev 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.339
 Rumas cigarette in the village is already a question 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:13.010
 so 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.979
 Mr. N 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.289
 whatever it may have passed and this is not a loss 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.859
 no such price predict it so 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.580
 uh facts that just captures 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.389
 it is their job since others 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.520
 bills have already exceeded that this fat is over 30 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.960
 at one point stopped his 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.930
 motion 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.210
 no one shook the loading villages 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.639
 the growth of the track went the other way
