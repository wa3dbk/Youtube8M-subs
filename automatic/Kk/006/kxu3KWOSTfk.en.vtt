well<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.270> use<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.570> wood<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:12.960> project<00:00:13.469> was

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
well the use of wood on this project was

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.890 
well the use of wood on this project was
a<00:00:13.980> decision<00:00:14.430> that<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.090> embraced<00:00:15.389> very<00:00:15.629> early

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a decision that we embraced very early

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.480 
a decision that we embraced very early
in<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.110> project<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> reasons<00:00:17.340> were

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
in the project and and the reasons were

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.179 
in the project and and the reasons were
multifaceted<00:00:17.939> on<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.840> level<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.830> really

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
multifaceted on one level we really

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.950 
multifaceted on one level we really
appreciate<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.000> people<00:00:21.450> respond

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
appreciate the way that people respond

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
appreciate the way that people respond
to<00:00:22.050> wood<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.590> see<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> emotional<00:00:23.460> response

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to wood we see the emotional response

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.609 
to wood we see the emotional response
and<00:00:24.119> connection<00:00:24.540> that<00:00:24.720> people<00:00:25.020> make<00:00:25.230> within

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
and connection that people make within

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.380 
and connection that people make within
facilities<00:00:25.860> like<00:00:26.399> this<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.970> wood<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.360> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
facilities like this and wood as a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.990 
facilities like this and wood as a
material<00:00:27.899> you<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.649> it's<00:00:29.279> maybe<00:00:29.520> cliche<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
material you know it's maybe cliche to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.330 
material you know it's maybe cliche to
call<00:00:30.270> it<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.509> warmth<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.050> wood<00:00:31.079> but<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
call it the warmth of wood but there is

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.560 
call it the warmth of wood but there is
something<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.300> something

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
something in that there is something

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.090 
something in that there is something
about<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> nature<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.410> wood<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.680> people

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
about the nature of wood that people

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
about the nature of wood that people
respond<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> course<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> larger

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
respond to and of course the larger

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
respond to and of course the larger
issue<00:00:37.170> associated<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
issue associated with that is we are a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
issue associated with that is we are a
wood<00:00:38.640> culture<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.300> our<00:00:39.840> public<00:00:40.230> buildings

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
wood culture and our public buildings

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.160 
wood culture and our public buildings
should<00:00:41.040> celebrate<00:00:41.970> that<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> our<00:00:42.750> community

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
should celebrate that and our community

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
should celebrate that and our community
facilities<00:00:43.650> should<00:00:43.800> celebrate<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> we

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
facilities should celebrate that and we

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.890 
facilities should celebrate that and we
believe<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.540> when<00:00:45.780> we're

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
believe that and so that when we're

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.200 
believe that and so that when we're
doing<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.200> project<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:47.010> wood<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.850> quite

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
doing a project like this wood is quite

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.540 
doing a project like this wood is quite
often<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.900> first<00:00:49.320> choice<00:00:49.530> for<00:00:49.860> us<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.340> wood

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
often a first choice for us the wood

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.280 
often a first choice for us the wood
itself<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.150> is<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.510> natural<00:00:51.660> choice<00:00:52.020> for

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
itself that is it's a natural choice for
