00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
took the gas tank play off now the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
took the gas tank play off now the
governor<00:00:17.580> lever<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.000> just<00:00:18.359> moved<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.990> this

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
governor lever I just moved it to this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.609 
governor lever I just moved it to this
front<00:00:19.560> mount<00:00:20.369> hoe<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.140> believe<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
front mount hoe here and I believe I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.720 
front mount hoe here and I believe I
bent<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.189> over<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.730> came<00:00:23.939> from<00:00:24.119> right<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:24.840> I

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
bent this over it came from right here I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.580 
bent this over it came from right here I
had<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.849> drill<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> these<00:00:27.539> holes<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
had to drill one of these holes out to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
had to drill one of these holes out to
get<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.920> zip<00:00:29.160> tie<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.060> hold<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.479 
get that zip tie on there to hold the
cable<00:00:30.689> housing<00:00:30.869> I've<00:00:31.769> got<00:00:31.949> one<00:00:32.099> little<00:00:32.250> piece

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
cable housing I've got one little piece

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.370 
cable housing I've got one little piece
of<00:00:32.640> baling<00:00:32.820> wire<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.020> hold<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
of baling wire there just to hold the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
of baling wire there just to hold the
cable<00:00:34.739> housing<00:00:34.890> where<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> want<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.750> here

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
cable housing where I want it right here

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.490 
cable housing where I want it right here
I<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> boat<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.370> stack<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> washers

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
I just use a boat and a stack of washers

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.250 
I just use a boat and a stack of washers
to<00:00:40.500> clamp<00:00:40.770> everything<00:00:41.280> together<00:00:41.960> this<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.140> an

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
to clamp everything together this is an

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.180 
to clamp everything together this is an
original<00:00:43.710> piece<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.160> linkage<00:00:46.039> took<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
original piece of linkage took the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.549 
original piece of linkage took the
spring<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> clamp<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:49.050> got<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> running

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
spring to the clamp and got it running

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.950 
spring to the clamp and got it running
back<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> frame<00:00:51.300> but<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> mount<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
back to the frame but you mount that

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.220 
back to the frame but you mount that
wherever<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.000> I've<00:00:54.149> also<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.960> one

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
wherever and then I've also on this one

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.360 
wherever and then I've also on this one
I<00:00:55.500> got<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> second<00:00:56.460> spring<00:00:57.800> hooked<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.039> right

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I got a second spring hooked in right

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.270 
I got a second spring hooked in right
there<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.840> gas<00:01:04.049> tank<00:01:04.409> closed

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
there the gas tank closed

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.469 
there the gas tank closed
I<00:01:05.309> cut<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> apart<00:01:06.000> quite<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:08.330> welded<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
I cut it apart quite a bit and welded it

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.160 
I cut it apart quite a bit and welded it
inside<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.260> frame<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> gas<00:01:12.659> tank<00:01:12.990> would

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
inside the frame so the gas tank would

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.209 
inside the frame so the gas tank would
be<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.740> lower

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.279 

and<00:01:18.369> then<00:01:18.939> we've<00:01:19.060> got<00:01:19.240> another<00:01:19.570> one<00:01:19.719> and<00:01:20.140> you

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
and then we've got another one and you

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.169 
and then we've got another one and you
can<00:01:20.469> see<00:01:20.499> this<00:01:20.859> gas<00:01:21.189> tank<00:01:21.520> mounting<00:01:21.969> right

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
can see this gas tank mounting right

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.249 
can see this gas tank mounting right
here<00:01:24.119> these<00:01:25.119> have<00:01:25.329> a<00:01:25.390> piece<00:01:25.659> that<00:01:25.689> stick<00:01:26.109> out

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
here these have a piece that stick out

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.669 
here these have a piece that stick out
on<00:01:26.469> the<00:01:26.590> other<00:01:26.740> side<00:01:26.859> you<00:01:27.310> had<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.549> cut<00:01:27.729> off

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
on the other side you had to cut off

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.309 
on the other side you had to cut off
this<00:01:29.679> one<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.039> just<00:01:30.069> mounted<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:31.020> straight<00:01:32.020> to

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
this one I just mounted it straight to

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.699 
this one I just mounted it straight to
the<00:01:32.640> original<00:01:33.640> tank<00:01:34.179> mount<00:01:34.630> which<00:01:35.170> was<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
the original tank mount which was just a

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.429 
the original tank mount which was just a
flat<00:01:35.950> plate<00:01:36.280> on<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.700> top<00:01:37.479> of<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:37.750> frame<00:01:38.109> just

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
flat plate on the top of this frame just

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.499 
flat plate on the top of this frame just
used<00:01:38.679> two<00:01:39.810> bolts<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:42.000> bolted<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.149> one<00:01:43.359> on

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
used two bolts and bolted that one on

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.010 
used two bolts and bolted that one on
there<00:01:43.750> it<00:01:44.140> sits<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.560> little<00:01:44.649> bit<00:01:44.920> higher<00:01:46.020> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
there it sits a little bit higher and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.929 
there it sits a little bit higher and
then<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.740> only<00:01:47.859> difference<00:01:47.979> on<00:01:48.520> this<00:01:48.729> one

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
then the only difference on this one

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.029 
then the only difference on this one
really<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.539> I<00:01:49.750> put<00:01:49.959> this<00:01:50.049> aluminum<00:01:50.619> plate<00:01:50.829> on

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
really is I put this aluminum plate on

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.270 
really is I put this aluminum plate on
here<00:01:51.369> to<00:01:51.700> direct<00:01:52.270> more<00:01:52.629> air<00:01:52.959> through<00:01:53.439> the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
here to direct more air through the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:05.930 
here to direct more air through the
cylinders<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:56.079> basically<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.860> same<00:01:57.069> setup

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.860 

there<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.080> hope<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.500> helps<00:02:07.770> you
