00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.310
 great hello to everyone today on the channel 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.670
 yes fish cooker put on cook 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 pink salmon and here is one thing that weighs 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.990
 almost two kilos 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.269
 no head and no tail with fins 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.109
 in the name of economy we will cook from it 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.560
 fish soup so the recipe is extremely simple 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.830
 make small cuts by whom fish I her 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.199
 see divided into three pieces to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 it was convenient to lay the multicooker Andrei 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.070
 close up to fit them 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.270
 half of the lemon slices and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.320
 accordingly for the recipe to us 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.430
 will need more lemon your sos y 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.430
 I will be instead of salt and favorite spices 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.800
 to lose taste jerks 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.230
 so I immediately will probably start up 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 in the slow cooker 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:00.710
 before that after all the fish so doing here 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.710
 same over the river 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.280
 added added quite a bit 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.450
 olive oil though while roasting 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.830
 olive 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.390
 it will be natural to roast in your 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.180
 just I just had a little bit 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.150
 Olive oil I omit everything here now 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.369
 can't half 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 paul paul polo circles like rings 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.490
 Whether correctly to tell boys and I will 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 insert in our track all the top 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.299
 sprinkle soy sauce on it all 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 remaining 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.229
 just pour lemon on top with you 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.450
 it's generally classic and very tasty and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.030
 gently it turns out I 'll leave 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.159
 top of the account ugly much to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.329
 all in the past 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.850
 further topped with soy sauce 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.110
 there is no special fire to make 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:06.060
 sprinkler all over time 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:10.039
 appears and add my favorites now 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.069
 Pepper Spices 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.599
 I want to make the recipe as useful as possible 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:27.690
 so as little as possible 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:31.080
 notice the pepper in this case 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.140
 average salty that is just for the whole 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.140
 families with myself this more I will not 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.370
 add any spices and 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:47.250
 close will cook on the program 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:53.209
 baking 35 minutes so what was for 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.209

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.180
 pours roasted and in doing so 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.760
 the slow cooker can't dry as 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:25.650
 it may seem at first glance that 35 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:33.000
 minutes this is a lot I really like 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:35.030
 how lemon shade the taste of fish here 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.010
 so that's inside 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.280
 such a simple simple dish can 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.599
