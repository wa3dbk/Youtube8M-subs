that<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.299> did<00:01:10.719> is<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:12.340> they<00:01:13.240> just<00:01:13.600> say<00:01:14.609> that

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
that I did is now they just say that

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.889

going to the Indian story
a<00:03:50.150> couple<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.810> paths<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:52.330> want<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.390> try<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.599> on<00:03:53.810> my

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
a couple of paths I want to try it on my

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.430 
a couple of paths I want to try it on my
daughter's<00:03:54.349> hair<00:03:54.620> because<00:03:55.069> although<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
daughter's hair because although the the

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.180 
daughter's hair because although the the
natural<00:03:57.890> henna<00:03:58.330> does<00:03:59.330> have<00:03:59.599> a<00:03:59.900> diver<00:04:00.200> lease<00:04:00.650> to

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
natural henna does have a diver lease to

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.640 
natural henna does have a diver lease to
it<00:04:01.400> because<00:04:02.030> it's<00:04:02.209> all-natural<00:04:02.470> depending<00:04:03.470> on

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
it because it's all-natural depending on

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.149 
it because it's all-natural depending on
the<00:04:03.830> purpose<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:05.230> why<00:04:06.230> you're<00:04:06.440> using<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:07.069> I

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
the purpose of why you're using it I

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.039 
the purpose of why you're using it I
think<00:04:07.430> it'd<00:04:07.579> still<00:04:07.940> be<00:04:08.000> beneficial<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.810> a

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
think it'd still be beneficial to a

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.449 
think it'd still be beneficial to a
younger<00:04:12.049> children<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.650> well<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:13.129> mean<00:04:13.280> not

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
younger children as well I mean not

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.629 
younger children as well I mean not
babies<00:04:13.909> but<00:04:14.209> my<00:04:14.780> daughter<00:04:15.049> is<00:04:15.340> eight<00:04:16.340> years

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
babies but my daughter is eight years

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.270 
babies but my daughter is eight years
old<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.359> I<00:04:17.930> think<00:04:18.380> it<00:04:18.620> could<00:04:18.799> benefit<00:04:19.130> her

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
old and I think it could benefit her

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.540 
old and I think it could benefit her
because<00:04:19.489> she<00:04:19.579> has<00:04:19.699> very<00:04:19.729> fine<00:04:20.389> hair<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.550> anyway

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
because she has very fine hair so anyway

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.040 
because she has very fine hair so anyway
