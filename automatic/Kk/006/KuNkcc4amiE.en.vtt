00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
did I do that and why don't more

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
did I do that and why don't more
supplement<00:01:08.159> companies<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> same

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
supplement companies and do the same

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.250 
supplement companies and do the same
thing

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
thing

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.870 
thing
well<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.799> tell<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.130> why<00:01:11.280> most<00:01:11.520> suppli

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
well I can tell you why most suppli

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.990 
well I can tell you why most suppli
companies<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.869> not<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:14.729> because

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
companies do not do this it's because

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.070 
companies do not do this it's because
they<00:01:15.600> don't<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> know

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
they don't want you to know

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.370 
they don't want you to know
how<00:01:17.710> little<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.370> each<00:01:18.490> ingredient<00:01:18.790> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
how little of each ingredient is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.970 
how little of each ingredient is
actually<00:01:20.380> in<00:01:20.590> their<00:01:21.550> product<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.830> know

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
actually in their product you know

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.460 
actually in their product you know
people<00:01:24.730> think<00:01:25.030> that<00:01:25.180> know<00:01:25.570> they<00:01:26.050> put

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
people think that know they put

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.440 
people think that know they put
proprietary<00:01:27.100> blends<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.970> no<00:01:28.150> one<00:01:28.270> can

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
proprietary blends so that no one can

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.490 
proprietary blends so that no one can
rip<00:01:28.660> off<00:01:28.870> their<00:01:29.290> magical<00:01:29.890> formula<00:01:30.670> well<00:01:31.500> look

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
rip off their magical formula well look

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.520 
rip off their magical formula well look
that's<00:01:32.710> really<00:01:33.040> not<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.220> case

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that's really not the case

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.040 
that's really not the case
if<00:01:35.530> they<00:01:35.800> had<00:01:36.100> real<00:01:36.700> doses<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.840> each

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
if they had real doses of each

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.020 
if they had real doses of each
ingredient<00:01:38.260> they<00:01:38.860> would<00:01:39.010> probably<00:01:39.550> mark<00:01:39.820> it

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
ingredient they would probably mark it

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.410 
ingredient they would probably mark it
on<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.240> label<00:01:40.710> much<00:01:41.710> like<00:01:41.950> I<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.370> with<00:01:42.940> pre

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
Jim and that's why I marked it so that

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.900

beta-alanine in their will that's
already<00:03:23.580> seven<00:03:24.390> grams<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:25.769> you're<00:03:26.069> already

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
already seven grams so you're already

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.670 
already seven grams so you're already

over what their six grams serving is so

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.850 
over what their six grams serving is so
you<00:03:28.739> know<00:03:29.040> they're<00:03:29.310> skimping<00:03:30.860> ingredients

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860

ingredients into a six grand serving so

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.820 
ingredients into a six grand serving so
they<00:03:38.550> list<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.970> proprietary<00:03:39.540> blend<00:03:39.830> because

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
they list a proprietary blend because

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.850 
they list a proprietary blend because
most<00:03:41.660> consumers<00:03:42.660> don't<00:03:42.959> educate<00:03:43.110> themselves

on the doses that they need and this way
they<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:48.000> trust<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.690> oh<00:03:48.720> well<00:03:49.080> there's<00:03:49.260> bed

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860

they just trust that oh well there's bed
alanine<00:03:50.370> in<00:03:50.489> there<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:50.910> there<00:03:51.150> must<00:03:51.330> clearly

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
there must be enough when in fact you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.360 
there must be enough when in fact you
can't<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.209> enough<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.720> six<00:03:54.989> gram<00:03:55.370> serving

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
can't get enough in a six gram serving

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.360 
can't get enough in a six gram serving
so<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.530> wary<00:03:58.890> of<00:04:00.140> products<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.829> lists

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
so be very wary of products that lists

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.759 
so be very wary of products that lists
proprietary<00:04:03.360> blends<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:04.230> not<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.650> they're

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
proprietary blends it's not that they're

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.620 
proprietary blends it's not that they're

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
hiding a magical formula it's the fact

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.479 
hiding a magical formula it's the fact
that<00:04:06.720> they're<00:04:06.930> hiding<00:04:07.170> in<00:04:08.130> adequate<00:04:08.700> doses<00:04:09.599> of
