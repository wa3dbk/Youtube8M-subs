currents<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.390> don't<00:02:40.450> do<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.930> sleight

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
currents like I don't do that sleight

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.100 
currents like I don't do that sleight
it's<00:02:41.470> about<00:02:41.709> that

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's about that

a<00:03:07.130> little<00:03:07.160> piece<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.640> line<00:03:07.970> that's

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
a little piece of line that's

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.940 
a little piece of line that's
obstructing<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:08.900> there<00:03:09.650> we<00:03:09.770> go<00:03:09.920> then<00:03:10.910> also

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
obstructing it there we go then also
