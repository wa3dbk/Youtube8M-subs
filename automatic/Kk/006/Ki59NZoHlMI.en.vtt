out there to kind of confirm that this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
out there to kind of confirm that this
indeed<00:00:36.420> appears<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.440> fixed<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.010> first<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
indeed appears to be fixed so first of

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.670 
indeed appears to be fixed so first of
all<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.059> image<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> background<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
all the image in the background is a

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.860 
all the image in the background is a
massive<00:00:41.280> indication<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.390> thick<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
massive indication that this is thick it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
massive indication that this is thick it
is<00:00:43.290> actually<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.010> multiplayer<00:00:44.610> map<00:00:44.879> riots

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
which you can clearly see by the massive

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
which you can clearly see by the massive
explosion<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.690> hand<00:00:48.960> side<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
explosion to the right hand side of this

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.400 
explosion to the right hand side of this
image<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> actually<00:00:51.120> an<00:00:51.570> opening<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
image it is actually an opening that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
image it is actually an opening that
leads<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> outside<00:00:53.850> area<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.899> map

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
leads out to the outside area of the map

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319 
leads out to the outside area of the map
and<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:56.129> clearly<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> prison<00:00:57.059> cells

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and you can clearly see the prison cells

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.970 
and you can clearly see the prison cells
you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> Holograms<00:00:58.410> outside<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you can see the Holograms outside the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.369 
you can see the Holograms outside the
prison<00:00:59.160> cells<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.359> i<00:01:00.539> will<00:01:00.600> now<00:01:00.870> put<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> few

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
prison cells which i will now put a few

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
prison cells which i will now put a few
more<00:01:01.530> images<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:02.160> screen<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
more images on screen right now of this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
more images on screen right now of this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
map so you guys can actually you know a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
map so you guys can actually you know a
reference<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> multiplayer

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

reference that this is the multiplayer
map<00:01:08.430> riots<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.360> this<00:01:09.630> doesn't<00:01:09.869> really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
map riots now this doesn't really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.200 
map riots now this doesn't really
confirm<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.040> image<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.460> thick<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
confirm that this image is thick it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.929 
confirm that this image is thick it
could<00:01:12.659> indeed<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.159> co-op<00:01:14.460> mode<00:01:14.490> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
could indeed be with in co-op mode this

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
could indeed be with in co-op mode this
map<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.840> no<00:01:16.020> reason<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.740> shouldn't

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
map there is no reason that it shouldn't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.280 
map there is no reason that it shouldn't
be<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.790> there<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> few<00:01:18.479> other<00:01:18.659> things<00:01:18.810> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
be but there is a few other things that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.130 
be but there is a few other things that
do<00:01:19.590> indeed<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.150> apparently<00:01:21.780> thick

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
do indeed make this apparently thick

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
do indeed make this apparently thick
first<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> rankings<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> players

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
first of all the rankings of the players

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.390 
first of all the rankings of the players
they're<00:01:24.270> actually<00:01:24.689> ranks<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.560> world<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.159> war

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
they're actually ranks from world at war

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.980 
they're actually ranks from world at war
I've<00:01:26.670> seen<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> few<00:01:27.180> comments<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.780> Twitter

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
I've seen a few comments on Twitter

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
I've seen a few comments on Twitter
saying<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.460> possibly<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
saying that this could possibly be a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.350 
saying that this could possibly be a
really<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.500> world<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.009> war<00:01:32.150> mod<00:01:33.150> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
really really good a world at war mod I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
really really good a world at war mod I
think<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.140> actually<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.220> know

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
think that it is actually just you know

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.940 
think that it is actually just you know
someone<00:01:35.909> fault<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.390> shops<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> actually

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
someone fault or shops this and actually

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.219 
someone fault or shops this and actually
made<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.150> know<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.299> actually<00:01:39.570> leaked<00:01:39.990> out

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
made it you know to actually leaked out

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
made it you know to actually leaked out
and<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.070> know<00:01:41.189> kind<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.549> gain<00:01:41.820> credit<00:01:42.210> or

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and you know kind of gain credit or

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
and you know kind of gain credit or
