00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
what you're going to do is you take this

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.320 
what you're going to do is you take this
and<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.560> wrap<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:11.970> under<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.120> knee<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:15.330> it

and you wrap it under your knee and it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.980 
and you wrap it under your knee and it
acts<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.780> spring<00:02:17.970> pulling<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.270> you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
acts like a spring pulling you up you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.800 
acts like a spring pulling you up you
see<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.580> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.850> can't<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.209> single<00:02:22.420> chin<00:02:22.690> up

and then you put this you put this under
your<00:02:24.820> knees<00:02:25.090> you'll<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:25.959> able<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.200> perform

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.830 
lot of fat moms well anyway that's
that's<00:02:45.220> what<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.520> would<00:02:45.730> do<00:02:45.850> another<00:02:46.570> thing

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
that's what I would do another thing

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.180 
that's what I would do another thing
that<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.140> can<00:02:47.260> do<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.530> mix<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:47.950> up<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.160> little

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
that you can do to mix it up a little

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.410 
that you can do to mix it up a little
bit<00:02:48.489> is<00:02:48.730> do<00:02:49.239> chin<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.570> negatives<00:02:51.180> that's<00:02:52.180> going

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
bit is do chin up negatives that's going

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.360 
bit is do chin up negatives that's going
to<00:02:52.480> simply<00:02:52.780> look<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.050> this

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.600 

you're<00:02:56.940> going<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.150> jump<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:58.370> chin<00:02:59.370> over<00:02:59.489> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you're going to jump up chin over the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:10.070 
you're going to jump up chin over the
bar<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:02.180> slowly<00:03:03.180> lower<00:03:03.569> yourself

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.360 

and<00:03:10.590> that's<00:03:10.740> going<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:10.890> strengthen<00:03:11.100> all<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and that's going to strengthen all the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
and that's going to strengthen all the
muscles<00:03:11.490> associated<00:03:12.300> with<00:03:12.420> with<00:03:12.750> developing
