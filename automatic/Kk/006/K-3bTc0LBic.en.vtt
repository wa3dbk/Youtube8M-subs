00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
get the stroke order right because once

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.800 
get the stroke order right because once
you<00:00:20.279> get<00:00:20.369> fast<00:00:20.670> if<00:00:21.000> your<00:00:21.150> stroke<00:00:21.330> order<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.600> bad

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
you get fast if your stroke order is bad

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.160 
you get fast if your stroke order is bad
your<00:00:22.380> kanji<00:00:22.890> will<00:00:23.039> look<00:00:23.189> crappy<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:25.019> way

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
your kanji will look crappy and the way

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.960 
your kanji will look crappy and the way
the<00:00:25.320> kanji<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.800> created<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.760> it

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the kanji is created is to make it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.210 
the kanji is created is to make it
pretty<00:00:27.570> much<00:00:27.750> faster<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.740> write<00:00:28.920> that's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
pretty much faster to write that's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
pretty much faster to write that's
pretty<00:00:29.490> much<00:00:29.670> why<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.210> way<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.689> back

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
pretty much why it's that way and back

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.450 
pretty much why it's that way and back
in<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> day<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> would<00:00:31.830> write<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> brush

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
in the day you would write with a brush

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030 
in the day you would write with a brush
so<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:33.930> your<00:00:34.110> brush<00:00:34.410> moves<00:00:34.710> across<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so the way your brush moves across the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
so the way your brush moves across the
paper<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:36.360> important<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.079> stroke<00:00:37.350> learn

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
paper very important that stroke learn

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.959 
paper very important that stroke learn
or<00:00:37.620> else<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.950> won't<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.280> writing<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> letter

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
or else you won't be writing a letter

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.200 
or else you won't be writing a letter
that<00:00:39.210> looks<00:00:39.390> right<00:00:39.629> okay<00:00:40.700> why<00:00:41.700> do<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.879> mean<00:00:42.059> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that looks right okay why do I mean that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.330 
that looks right okay why do I mean that
well<00:00:42.360> let's<00:00:42.750> look<00:00:42.809> at<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:44.040> are<00:00:44.129> three

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
well let's look at this there are three

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
well let's look at this there are three
types<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> strokes<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.989> forgive<00:00:46.829> me<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
types of strokes and forgive me this is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
types of strokes and forgive me this is
what<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.460> call<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.180> fade-out<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:49.620> is

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
what I call them the fade-out which is

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310 
what I call them the fade-out which is
this<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.160> means<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.879> brush<00:00:51.170> comes<00:00:52.170> off

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this one which means the brush comes off

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
this one which means the brush comes off
the<00:00:52.440> paper<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.829> little<00:00:53.280> bit<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> time<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.030> it

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the paper a little bit at a time and it

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.580 
the paper a little bit at a time and it
just<00:00:54.120> fades<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.260> right

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just fades out all right

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
just fades out all right
then<00:00:56.160> we've<00:00:56.309> got<00:00:56.550> what's<00:00:56.789> called<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.510> dead

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
then we've got what's called the dead

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.330 
then we've got what's called the dead
stop<00:00:59.660> just<00:01:00.660> stops<00:01:01.109> by<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:01.980> Japanese<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
stop just stops by the way Japanese I

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.759 
stop just stops by the way Japanese I
would<00:01:02.460> say<00:01:02.550> tomato<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
would say tomato and the the the the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
other one is this one which I call a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
other one is this one which I call a
bound<00:01:11.880> Spade<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> honey-do<00:01:13.049> which

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
bound Spade which is a honey-do which

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
bound Spade which is a honey-do which
means<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.950> bounces<00:01:14.430> right<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.119> honey<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.570> wear

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
means it bounces right so honey to wear

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.850 
means it bounces right so honey to wear
your<00:01:16.470> brush<00:01:16.680> goes<00:01:17.720> comes<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.590> want<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
your brush goes comes up and I want you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.080 
your brush goes comes up and I want you
to<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> character<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.820> particular

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to look at this character in particular

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.380 
to look at this character in particular
this<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.229> hiragana<00:01:22.560> II<00:01:23.040> notice<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.119> from

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
this this hiragana II notice that from

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.770 
this this hiragana II notice that from
there<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.810> goes<00:01:24.990> up<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> starts<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.460> new

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
there it goes up and starts this new

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
there it goes up and starts this new
stroke<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.400> writing<00:01:29.640> it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
stroke and so if you're writing it

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.800 
stroke and so if you're writing it
really<00:01:29.850> fast<00:01:30.060> sometimes<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.570> get

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
really fast sometimes these get

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469 
really fast sometimes these get
connected<00:01:31.340> okay<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.970> brush<00:01:33.270> doesn't

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
connected okay that the brush doesn't

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.179 
connected okay that the brush doesn't
actually<00:01:33.630> come<00:01:33.869> off<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> paper<00:01:34.290> sometimes<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
actually come off the paper sometimes so

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
actually come off the paper sometimes so
it's<00:01:35.430> very<00:01:35.579> important<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:37.079> if<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.290> know

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
it's very important but if you know

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's very important but if you know
these<00:01:37.650> fades<00:01:38.070> you'll<00:01:38.820> know<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.210> dead<00:01:39.479> stop

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
these fades you'll know that a dead stop

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.319 
these fades you'll know that a dead stop
