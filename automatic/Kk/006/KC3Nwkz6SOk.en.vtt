being<00:02:14.940> locker<00:02:15.330> room<00:02:15.720> situation<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.610> I

being locker room situation you know I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.180 
being locker room situation you know I
don't<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:18.750> there's<00:02:18.989> many<00:02:19.319> problems<00:02:19.709> on

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
don't think there's many problems on

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.089 
don't think there's many problems on
court<00:02:20.819> as<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.390> are<00:02:21.599> off<00:02:21.930> court<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.980> know

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
court as there are off court you know

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.420 
court as there are off court you know
locker<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.760> situations<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.770> know<00:02:25.800> showering

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
locker in situations you know showering

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580

with<00:02:26.730> other<00:02:26.910> players<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.599> stuff<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.080> I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
with other players and stuff like that I

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.400 
with other players and stuff like that I
think<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.520> those<00:02:29.730> issues<00:02:30.239> may<00:02:30.810> have<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.230> be

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
think that those issues may have to be

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.640 
think that those issues may have to be
further<00:02:31.739> ironed<00:02:32.340> out<00:02:33.080> throughout<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.440> league

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
further ironed out throughout the league

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.160 
further ironed out throughout the league
in<00:02:34.980> respective<00:02:35.730> teams<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.269> whatnot<00:02:36.629> but<00:02:36.930> I

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
in respective teams and whatnot but I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
in respective teams and whatnot but I
don't<00:02:37.709> think<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.950> anyone<00:02:38.420> necessarily<00:02:39.420> has

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
don't think that anyone necessarily has

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.309 
don't think that anyone necessarily has
anything<00:02:40.170> against<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:41.090> gay<00:02:42.090> person<00:02:42.390> playing<00:02:42.959> in

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
anything against a gay person playing in

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.199 
anything against a gay person playing in
any<00:02:43.769> teams<00:02:44.069> for<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.580> at<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.000> NFL<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:46.470> NBA

any teams for be at the NFL the NBA

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.759 
any teams for be at the NFL the NBA
major<00:02:48.209> league<00:02:48.480> professional<00:02:48.989> baseball

major league professional baseball

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.460 
major league professional baseball
whatever<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.670> may<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:52.019> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
whatever it may be you know I think that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.920 
whatever it may be you know I think that
people<00:02:52.980> are<00:02:53.099> more<00:02:53.129> open<00:02:53.610> nowadays<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.720> more

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
people are more open nowadays and more

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.920 
people are more open nowadays and more
accepting<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.709> who<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.550> person<00:02:56.819> is<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.810> know

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
accepting of who a person is you know

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.649 
accepting of who a person is you know
and<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.739> just<00:02:58.920> think<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.190> um<00:02:59.550> you<00:03:00.330> know<00:03:00.450> it's

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
and I just think that um you know it's

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.380 
and I just think that um you know it's
time<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.260> maybe<00:03:01.920> hopefully<00:03:02.310> more<00:03:02.849> athletes

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
time and maybe hopefully more athletes

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.979 
time and maybe hopefully more athletes
will<00:03:03.659> get<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.959> strength<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.620> kind<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.780> be<00:03:06.780> who

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
will get the strength to kind of be who

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.500 
will get the strength to kind of be who
they<00:03:07.170> are<00:03:07.409> you<00:03:07.830> know<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.280> even<00:03:09.090> though<00:03:09.239> i'm
