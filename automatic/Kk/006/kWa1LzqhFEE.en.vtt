00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
not contain the jobs the Jasper chipset

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.060 
not contain the jobs the Jasper chipset
the<00:00:27.480> Jasper<00:00:27.930> chipset<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.500> those<00:00:28.619> who<00:00:28.769> haven't

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the Jasper chipset for those who haven't

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.640 
the Jasper chipset for those who haven't
heard<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> smaller<00:00:30.060> well<00:00:30.960> smaller

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
heard of it is a smaller well smaller

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.610 
heard of it is a smaller well smaller
chipsets<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> CPU<00:00:32.730> GPU<00:00:33.050> which<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.350> turn

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
chipsets for the CPU GPU which in turn

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.799 
chipsets for the CPU GPU which in turn
less<00:00:35.070> power<00:00:35.370> consumption<00:00:35.760> better<00:00:36.480> cooling

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
less power consumption better cooling

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.340 
less power consumption better cooling
now<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.910> does<00:00:39.180> however<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.989> modified

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
now it it does however have a modified

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.860 
now it it does however have a modified
motherboard<00:00:41.250> where<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.600> some

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
motherboard where there's some

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.139 
motherboard where there's some
modifications<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.190> hopefully

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
modifications so which in hopefully

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.220 
modifications so which in hopefully
reduce<00:00:46.700> reduce<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> heat<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.930> better

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
reduce reduce the heat and have better

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.279 
reduce reduce the heat and have better
cooling<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.969> should<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.480> theory<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.960> more

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
cooling so this should in theory be more

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.670 
cooling so this should in theory be more
reliable<00:00:53.449> basically<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> C

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
reliable basically it's it's like the C

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
reliable basically it's it's like the C
it's<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> other<00:00:56.399> gig<00:00:56.610> console<00:00:57.239> versions

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it's like the other gig console versions

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.750 
it's like the other gig console versions
you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> pro<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.520> got<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
you know it's like the pro we got the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
you know it's like the pro we got the
whites<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.780> main<00:01:00.960> difference<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.530> obviously

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
whites the main difference is obviously

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.530 
whites the main difference is obviously
60<00:01:02.730> gigabyte<00:01:03.470> hard<00:01:04.470> drive<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
60 gigabyte hard drive and the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.789 
60 gigabyte hard drive and the
modifications<00:01:06.540> inside<00:01:06.960> does<00:01:07.260> contain<00:01:07.590> your

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
modifications inside does contain your

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.940 
modifications inside does contain your
standard<00:01:08.189> HDMI<00:01:08.549> ports<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.560> all<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.740> daisy

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
standard HDMI ports and all that daisy

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.410 
standard HDMI ports and all that daisy
stuff<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.670> um<00:01:12.000> yeah<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.760> worth<00:01:14.909> buying<00:01:14.939> well

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
stuff so um yeah is it worth buying well

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.240 
stuff so um yeah is it worth buying well
right<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.049> 300<00:01:16.470> bucks<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.159> those

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
right now it's 300 bucks and for those

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
right now it's 300 bucks and for those
who<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.610> own<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> console<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.780> highly

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
who don't own a console I do highly

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
who don't own a console I do highly
recommend<00:01:19.830> getting<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:21.270> seems<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> be

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
recommend getting but this seems to be

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
recommend getting but this seems to be
much<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.080> reliable<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.950> only<00:01:23.070> three

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
much more reliable and it's only three

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.310 
much more reliable and it's only three
hundred<00:01:23.340> dollars<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> yeah<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.900> folks

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
hundred dollars so yeah not much folks

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.789 
hundred dollars so yeah not much folks
so<00:01:25.939> I'm<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> sound<00:01:27.780> fan<00:01:28.200> test

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so I'm just going to do a sound fan test

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.850 
so I'm just going to do a sound fan test
um<00:01:31.790> just<00:01:32.790> do<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> little<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.110> know<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.740> those

me lower the TV volume down okay what
you're<00:02:11.910> hearing<00:02:12.090> right<00:02:12.210> now<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.570> these<00:02:12.900> fat<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
you're hearing right now is these fat is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.460 
you're hearing right now is these fat is
the<00:02:14.010> fan<00:02:14.220> speeds<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.660> noticeably

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the fan speeds now it's noticeably

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.120 
the fan speeds now it's noticeably
higher<00:02:17.570> than<00:02:18.570> previous<00:02:19.530> consoles<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.950> I've

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
higher than previous consoles that I've

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.030 
higher than previous consoles that I've
owned<00:02:20.630> but<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:22.130> this<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:24.630> should<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.380> theory<00:02:25.740> be

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
owned but in this it should in theory be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.500 
owned but in this it should in theory be
in<00:02:26.880> taking<00:02:27.570> more<00:02:28.070> more<00:02:29.070> air<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.580> pushing<00:02:30.360> out

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
in taking more more air and pushing out

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.229 
in taking more more air and pushing out
the<00:02:31.200> hot<00:02:31.410> air<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> produces<00:02:32.370> inside<00:02:32.790> so

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
the hot air that it produces inside so

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.380 
the hot air that it produces inside so
it<00:02:33.540> should<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.590> lot<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.250> cooler<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.120> more

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it should be a lot more cooler and more

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.540 
it should be a lot more cooler and more
much<00:02:36.780> more<00:02:36.810> reliable<00:02:37.410> but<00:02:37.560> that<00:02:37.770> is<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.190> fan

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
much more reliable but that is the fan

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.340 
much more reliable but that is the fan
speeds<00:02:38.940> here's<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> closer<00:02:39.750> look

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
speeds here's a closer look

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.660 
speeds here's a closer look
well<00:02:41.280> closer<00:02:41.690> sound<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.310> don't<00:02:44.310> mind<00:02:44.489> it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
well closer sound I don't mind it

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.280 
well closer sound I don't mind it
sounding<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.150> loud<00:02:45.480> obviously<00:02:46.140> I've<00:02:46.260> been

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
sounding that loud obviously I've been

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
sounding that loud obviously I've been
through<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.739> many<00:02:46.830> 360s<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.610> I'm<00:02:47.700> so<00:02:47.880> used<00:02:48.150> to

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
through so many 360s and I'm so used to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.640 
through so many 360s and I'm so used to
it<00:02:48.360> by<00:02:48.570> now<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:50.150> that's<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.390> fan<00:02:51.870> speed<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.410> far

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
it by now so that's the fan speed so far

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.650 
it by now so that's the fan speed so far
so<00:02:52.950> yeah<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.280> flippin<00:02:57.000> Nomad<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:57.540> with
