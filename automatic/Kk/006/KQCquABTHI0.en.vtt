00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
problem of the methane one is to use a

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.690 
problem of the methane one is to use a
flare<00:01:03.269> stack<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.749> burn<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.530> methane<00:01:05.339> but

what<00:01:06.060> we've<00:01:06.180> chosen<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.899> is<00:01:07.079> actually<00:01:07.280> use

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
what we've chosen to do is actually use

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.270 
what we've chosen to do is actually use
it<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.689> gas<00:01:09.689> generators<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.829> generators

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it in gas generators the generators

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.160 
it in gas generators the generators
produce<00:01:11.399> 4.8<00:01:12.060> megawatts<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.659> power<00:01:12.899> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
produce 4.8 megawatts of power and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.940 
produce 4.8 megawatts of power and
that's<00:01:13.710> enough<00:01:14.009> to<00:01:14.039> light<00:01:14.640> up<00:01:14.759> 4,600<00:01:15.360> homes

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
that's enough to light up 4,600 homes

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's enough to light up 4,600 homes
usually<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.280> shift<00:01:17.490> starts<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.939> morning

usually my shift starts in the morning

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.249 
usually my shift starts in the morning
at<00:01:18.299> about<00:01:18.329> 8<00:01:18.869> a.m.<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:21.240> composed<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
at about 8 a.m. and it's composed of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
at about 8 a.m. and it's composed of
checking<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> computers<00:01:23.609> to<00:01:23.820> make<00:01:23.939> sure

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
checking the computers to make sure

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.929 
checking the computers to make sure
there<00:01:25.140> aren't<00:01:25.259> any<00:01:25.350> alarms<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
there aren't any alarms then I have a

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.429 
there aren't any alarms then I have a
checklist<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.899> through<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
checklist that I go through and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.139 
checklist that I go through and
basically<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.369> physically<00:01:29.820> walking

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
basically it's physically walking

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.840 
basically it's physically walking
through<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.420> plant<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.579> making<00:01:32.579> sure<00:01:32.729> all

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
through the plant and making sure all

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.179 
through the plant and making sure all
the<00:01:33.060> readings<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.229> where<00:01:34.859> they<00:01:34.979> should<00:01:35.159> be

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
the readings are where they should be

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.539 
the readings are where they should be
and<00:01:36.200> if<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> identify<00:01:37.619> any<00:01:38.009> problems<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and if I identify any problems and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.459 
and if I identify any problems and
that's<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.149> I<00:01:39.179> have<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.840> opportunity<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
that's when I have the opportunity to

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.349 
that's when I have the opportunity to
fix<00:01:40.859> them<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.189> keep<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.820> plant<00:01:42.060> running

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
fix them and keep the plant running

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.039 
fix them and keep the plant running
the<00:01:43.289> generators<00:01:43.710> themselves<00:01:44.219> run<00:01:44.700> 24<00:01:45.149> hours<00:01:46.020> a

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the generators themselves run 24 hours a

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:46.969 
the generators themselves run 24 hours a
day<00:01:46.140> seven<00:01:46.560> days<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.710> week

day seven days a week

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.999 
day seven days a week
and<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:48.060> we're

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
and so we're

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.760 
and so we're
ensuring<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.700> they've<00:01:49.969> got<00:01:50.149> enough<00:01:50.630> oil<00:01:51.229> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
ensuring that they've got enough oil and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.209 
ensuring that they've got enough oil and
coolant<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:53.409> everything<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.500> working<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.920> all

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.429 
coolant and everything is working on all
those<00:01:55.369> minutes<00:01:55.780> once<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.899> rounds<00:01:57.200> are<00:01:57.289> done

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
those minutes once the rounds are done

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.039 
those minutes once the rounds are done
it<00:01:57.799> might<00:01:57.979> be<00:01:58.130> report<00:01:58.700> writing<00:01:59.049> gathering

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
it might be report writing gathering

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.309 
it might be report writing gathering

field<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.790> guess<00:03:26.420> what<00:03:26.690> we<00:03:26.840> begin<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:27.889> is<00:03:28.160> what

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
field I guess what we begin with is what

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.770 
field I guess what we begin with is what
we<00:03:28.760> look<00:03:28.940> for<00:03:28.970> is<00:03:29.859> an<00:03:30.859> individual<00:03:31.760> with<00:03:31.940> some

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
we look for is an individual with some

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.420 
we look for is an individual with some
sort<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.049> technical<00:03:33.620> trade<00:03:34.660> background

second<00:03:37.209> thing<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.480> we<00:03:37.569> would<00:03:37.750> look<00:03:38.319> for<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.800> I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
second thing that we would look for is I

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.240 
second thing that we would look for is I
guess<00:03:39.849> personality<00:03:40.629> fit<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.769> you<00:03:41.830> need<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.129> be

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
guess personality fit so you need to be

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.360 
guess personality fit so you need to be
able<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.879> be<00:03:43.060> self-motivated<00:03:44.129> you<00:03:45.129> have<00:03:45.250> to

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
able to be self-motivated you have to

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.740 
able to be self-motivated you have to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
have good time management skills I think

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.140 
have good time management skills I think
with<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> position<00:03:50.379> like<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.590> if<00:03:51.150> you're

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
with a position like this if you're

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.500 
with a position like this if you're
adaptable<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.049> you're<00:03:53.530> willing<00:03:53.680> to<00:03:53.830> learn

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
adaptable and you're willing to learn

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.240 
adaptable and you're willing to learn
then<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:56.379> sky's<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.650> limit

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
then the sky's the limit

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.119 
then the sky's the limit
one<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.910> opportunities<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.599> see<00:03:58.810> is

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
one of the opportunities that I see is

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.280 
one of the opportunities that I see is
moving<00:04:00.129> in<00:04:00.220> from<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:01.299> operation<00:04:01.989> side<00:04:02.170> of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
moving in from the operation side of

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.900 
moving in from the operation side of
things<00:04:02.440> into<00:04:02.739> more<00:04:03.099> of<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> management<00:04:03.489> side

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
things into more of the management side

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.880 
things into more of the management side
of<00:04:03.970> things<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:05.019> reports<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.500> have<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.799> go

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
of things the reports that have to go

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.699 
of things the reports that have to go
out<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.720> government<00:04:07.720> agencies<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.410> they

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
out go to government agencies and they

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.539 
out go to government agencies and they
have<00:04:08.829> to<00:04:08.950> be<00:04:09.069> accurate<00:04:09.489> and<00:04:09.840> complete<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.549> as

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
have to be accurate and complete and as

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.780 
have to be accurate and complete and as
an<00:04:12.940> operator<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.390> get<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> feel<00:04:14.680> for<00:04:14.950> where

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
an operator you get a feel for where

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.280 
an operator you get a feel for where
this<00:04:15.940> data<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.239> coming<00:04:16.450> from<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.049> whether

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
this data is coming from and whether

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.379 
this data is coming from and whether
it's<00:04:17.500> accurate<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.910> just<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> next

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
it's accurate and it's just the next

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.500 
it's accurate and it's just the next
step<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:20.489> think<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.549> most<00:04:21.669> satisfying<00:04:22.210> thing

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
step I think the most satisfying thing

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.909 
step I think the most satisfying thing
is<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:23.080> being<00:04:24.419> in<00:04:25.419> control<00:04:26.020> of<00:04:26.290> what<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.800> do

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
is is being in control of what I do

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.200 
is is being in control of what I do
during<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.340> day

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
during the day

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.990 
during the day
if<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:29.770> need<00:04:29.979> to<00:04:30.130> operate<00:04:30.700> heavy<00:04:30.820> equipment

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
if I need to operate heavy equipment

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.350 
if I need to operate heavy equipment
outside<00:04:31.389> I'll<00:04:31.810> be<00:04:31.930> outside<00:04:32.220> if<00:04:33.220> I'm<00:04:33.460> if<00:04:34.210> I'm

outside I'll be outside if I'm if I'm

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.580
