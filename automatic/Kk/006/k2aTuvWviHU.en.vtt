will get whenever he walks through so if

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
will get whenever he walks through so if
we<00:01:36.000> make<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> little<00:01:36.450> trail<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.140> here

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
we make like a little trail right here

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.300 
we make like a little trail right here
of<00:01:37.560> really<00:01:38.490> stacked<00:01:39.030> high<00:01:39.299> snow<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> could

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.039 
of really stacked high snow you could
tell<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.090> try<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.329> walk<00:01:42.630> through<00:01:42.869> this

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
tell that if I try to walk through this

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990

it<00:01:43.259> will<00:01:43.470> be<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.979> slower<00:01:44.399> than<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> was

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
it will be much slower than if I was

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.300 
it will be much slower than if I was
walking<00:01:45.360> normally<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.590> also<00:01:46.829> works<00:01:47.159> for

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
walking normally now this also works for

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.870 
walking normally now this also works for
mobs<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.689> get<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.840> pig<00:01:49.460> we<00:01:50.460> sat<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
mobs so if we get a pig we sat down the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
mobs so if we get a pig we sat down the
pig<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.149> make<00:01:51.390> him<00:01:51.509> follow<00:01:51.780> us<00:01:52.049> he<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:53.070> get

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
pig and make him follow us he will get

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.210 
pig and make him follow us he will get
slow<00:01:53.579> when<00:01:53.909> walking<00:01:54.149> through<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> snow<00:01:54.869> also

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220

slow when walking through the snow also
now<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> cool<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.240> about<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
now the cool thing about that is that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.410 
now the cool thing about that is that
you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.440> make<00:01:58.590> sort<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> like<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.940> trap

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you can make sort of like a little trap

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.000 
you can make sort of like a little trap
for<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.870> friends<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.620> I<00:02:01.650> could<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:01.950> be

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
for your friends so I could just be

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.320 
for your friends so I could just be
walking<00:02:02.310> around<00:02:03.200> Christmas<00:02:04.200> tree<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.830> be<00:02:05.670> all

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
walking around Christmas tree and be all

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.150

right<00:02:06.450> sorry<00:02:06.750> about<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.770> they're

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
right sorry about that so they're

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.080 
right sorry about that so they're
walking<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.670> there<00:02:08.759> like<00:02:08.910> la<00:02:09.210> la<00:02:09.270> la<00:02:09.509> la<00:02:09.780> la<00:02:10.020> ah

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
walking in there like la la la la la ah

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.410 
walking in there like la la la la la ah
so<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:13.350> might<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.010> might<00:02:14.280> happen<00:02:14.550> so

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so that that might that might happen so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.520 
so that that might that might happen so
the<00:02:15.810> other<00:02:15.990> cool<00:02:16.290> thing<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:18.530> snow

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the other cool thing is that if the snow

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.970 
the other cool thing is that if the snow
stops<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:21.600> Sun<00:02:21.990> comes<00:02:22.320> out<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.740> there's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
stops and the Sun comes out and there's

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.220 
stops and the Sun comes out and there's
a<00:02:23.040> lot<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> light<00:02:23.550> then<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.690> means<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.140> the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
a lot of light then that means that the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.620 
a lot of light then that means that the
snow<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:25.650> start<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> melt<00:02:26.280> now<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.450> will
