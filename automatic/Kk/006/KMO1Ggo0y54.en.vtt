00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 such immensely superior the swansea the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.589
 first part of the first part of the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.599
 nightmare starts low with this very 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.280
 good recovery the cavalcade of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.280
 trees in michu auction 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.050
 from that moment it was beginning to be 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.700
 protagonist and that think also we 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.000
 gave away is 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.230
 Creative celebration is a good way 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.230
 so they do not take out a card 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.470
 and that you can also show your number without 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.200
 inconveniences the auction of michu with 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.330
 left leg 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.320
 sacrificed and arrived yesterday in the 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.750
 40 production yes very patient would burn 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 his rival who walked him from the place to another 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 Hernandez of the best of the field I 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.079
 for this value to me 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.320
 with the left as saying between the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.320
 Mountain range 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.460
 awesome beautiful goal the one of this 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.460
 player 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.699
 is one of the stars of the swansea of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.490
 laudrup another one of the Spaniards 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.680
 a good number 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.960
 they play on the team many vouchers 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 Spanish many Dutch Germans 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.510
 second time 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 followed the nightmare quickie in 47 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.100
 so much is the most beautiful goal of all the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.640
 torn out and the rest of the recovery 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.130
 from here he is the one who carries the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 ball for de guzmán who stays 2 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.209
 man attends very well this dyer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.939
 would have the dispute with the Dutch the 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.289
 diagonal is fantastic as the leaves 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.569
 pass twice 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.119
 michu must also be said and as 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:48.439
 defines well to second post that great yesterday 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.439
 nice definition 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.730
 and already 3 to 0 starting second time was 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.110
 unsustainable for the burton after 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.480
 comes the play of the criminal and the exclusion 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.310
 for my hope against of normal of 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.190
 adding he understood that he had the right to 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.580
 charge did not let him charge yesterday he wanted 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.490
 be your first hat-trick charges well for 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.650
 some indifference but very safe at 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.450
 right stick the newly admitted 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.489
 more key could not do absolutely 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.379
 nothing was there yesterday's people 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.849
 product of the previous discussion that 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.180
 had produced to see who was doing 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.180
 position 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.469
 and that was the 40th party already defined by 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.019
 that good will come the opinions to 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:34.290
 respect nice subject again the ball 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.870
 for the team brain today hernandez 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.680
 opens the court has rangel and managed 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.310
 Spanish 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.540
 and guzmán appeared biting that ball 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.540
 that bounced on
