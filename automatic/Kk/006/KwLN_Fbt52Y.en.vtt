00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.850
 Guadalajara as a great metropolis attracts 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.010
 all kinds of urban activities but 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.780
 Without a doubt, parkour is the 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.550
 most extreme movement of the past 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.710
 times and not only in the land tapatÃ­a 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.580
 but also at the national level and 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.470
 international 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.630
 our friend Ivan received it in his 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.890
 gym to share with us a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.890
 of their concurrent practices 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.800
 tell us a little about this class that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.770
 we saw now he continues to teach in your full 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.840
 apogee because it is precisely what more 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.309
 we dedicate ourselves to this matter of 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.770
 teaching parkour the power 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.350
 Take it to the greatest amount and variety 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.050
 of people who can where I do not like 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.180
 they saw is not a sport solely for 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 Young people or already strong is for children 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.260
 it's for girls it 's for people of all 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.269
 complexion is how you motivate these 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.730
 children to do these maneuvers that 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.040
 Well, somehow they are a little 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.899
 risky and not afraid of a child 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.700
 from little he starts doing parkour 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.560
 although they do not name it but always 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.200
 It is a curiosity of children to start 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.850
 jump to climb to run then more 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.860
 well you have to teach them how to do it without 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.500
 hurt but motivation do not need 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.539
 I want to see you and some buddies 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.789
 that are at your level but now that 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.890
 in the street where is the ship there 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.600
 clear the gym only a tool 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.630
 to learn certain maneuvers but the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 parkour belongs to the urban environment and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.570
 Well, if we have some places very 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.340
 parents to train and I have some 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.320
 friends that I would like to introduce you if 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.230
 you want to know what good the urban monkeys 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.260
 invade the streets of Guadalajara 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.810
 and we're going to see them in action as the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.250
 origins of parkour are by nature 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.960
 We could not let the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.700
 opportunity to leverage all 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.590
 obstacles and constructions that there are in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 this great city so that the maximum 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.400
 le parkour exponents of Mexican 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 they took flight to the lint and we 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.390
 will delight with a show that 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.900
 frankly it steals your breath 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.900
 anyone 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.890
 Well, we are still here in Guadalajara 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.540
 with mere groupers of parkour in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.070
 our friend dale was telling him 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.130
 international and you are one of the least I 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.540
 Well basically I'm an athlete 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.240
 Parkour has been training for seven years 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 I have dedicated this year to bring the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.740
