mine<00:02:26.010> very<00:02:27.000> efficiently<00:02:27.600> this<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.959> what<00:02:28.109> I

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
mine very efficiently this is what I

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
mine very efficiently this is what I
picked<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.340> let's<00:02:29.519> just<00:02:29.700> hop<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> water

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
picked up so let's just hop in the water

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
picked up so let's just hop in the water
as<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.109> can<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.470> our<00:02:31.769> bubbles<00:02:32.370> are

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
as you can see our bubbles are

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.110 
as you can see our bubbles are
disappearing<00:02:33.510> at<00:02:33.720> normal<00:02:34.500> rate<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.640> once<00:02:35.940> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
disappearing at normal rate so once you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.490 
disappearing at normal rate so once you
let's<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.450> say<00:02:36.660> we're<00:02:37.079> going<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.319> over

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
let's just say we're going to get over

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.319 
let's just say we're going to get over
to<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.709> clay<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.489> will<00:02:38.910> be<00:02:39.060> showing

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
to this clay and now I will be showing

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.580 
to this clay and now I will be showing
you<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.650> door<00:02:41.069> comes<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.850> handy<00:02:42.590> okay

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
you how this door comes in handy okay

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.509 
you how this door comes in handy okay
now<00:02:44.250> as<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.609> see<00:02:45.049> this<00:02:46.049> door<00:02:46.290> provides<00:02:47.100> an

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
now as you can see this door provides an

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.349 
now as you can see this door provides an
air<00:02:47.700> pocket<00:02:48.000> which<00:02:48.390> will<00:02:48.630> stay<00:02:48.930> prominently

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
air pocket which will stay prominently

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.729 
air pocket which will stay prominently
so<00:02:51.359> this<00:02:51.720> allows<00:02:52.590> us<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:53.130> breathe<00:02:53.519> underwater

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
so this allows us to breathe underwater

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.370 
so this allows us to breathe underwater
we<00:02:55.739> don't<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.130> as<00:02:56.459> much<00:02:56.940> we<00:02:57.120> leave<00:02:57.380> that

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
we don't have as much we leave that

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.860 
we don't have as much we leave that
always<00:02:58.739> come<00:02:58.920> back<00:02:59.069> once<00:02:59.850> we<00:02:59.940> happen<00:03:00.359> they<00:03:00.660> go

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
always come back once we happen they go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.610 
always come back once we happen they go
away<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:03.030> look<00:03:03.209> at<00:03:03.329> this<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:04.290> can<00:03:04.470> just

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
away so and now look at this we can just

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.400 
away so and now look at this we can just
get<00:03:04.829> all<00:03:04.859> this<00:03:05.160> clay<00:03:05.459> no<00:03:06.150> problem<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.260> can

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410

just come out here get this
look<00:03:11.239> at<00:03:11.330> there's<00:03:11.510> no<00:03:11.750> problem<00:03:12.319> I'm<00:03:12.620> not

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
look at there's no problem I'm not

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.800 
look at there's no problem I'm not
having<00:03:13.040> a<00:03:13.099> single<00:03:13.580> problem<00:03:13.819> now<00:03:14.480> let's<00:03:14.690> just

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
having a single problem now let's just

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.699 
having a single problem now let's just
say<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.959> get<00:03:15.140> low<00:03:16.299> go<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.360> the<00:03:17.569> door<00:03:17.810> leave

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
say I get low go to the door leave

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:19.479 
say I get low go to the door leave
punish<00:03:19.129> it

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
punish it

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.039 
punish it
one<00:03:19.819> thing<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.030> like<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.629> found<00:03:20.870> cool

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
one thing I like that I found cool

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.410 
one thing I like that I found cool
backdoors<00:03:21.560> you<00:03:22.370> get<00:03:22.519> like<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.730> noisy<00:03:22.970> boost

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
backdoors you get like a noisy boost

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.820 
backdoors you get like a noisy boost
once<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.989> hop<00:03:24.200> out<00:03:24.379> which<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:24.980> kind<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.310> cool

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
once you hop out which is kind of cool

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.039 
once you hop out which is kind of cool
so<00:03:27.830> this<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.459> fastest<00:03:29.239> way<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.750> have<00:03:30.019> found

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
so this is the fastest way I have found

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.589 
so this is the fastest way I have found
the<00:03:30.620> most<00:03:30.769> efficient<00:03:31.430> way<00:03:31.610> I<00:03:31.910> found<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.510> get

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
the most efficient way I found to get

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.330 
the most efficient way I found to get
clay<00:03:32.840> look<00:03:33.110> at<00:03:33.230> this<00:03:33.379> from<00:03:33.860> that<00:03:34.099> little

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
clay look at this from that little

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.990 
clay look at this from that little
pocket<00:03:34.670> with<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.599> fortune<00:03:36.140> shovel<00:03:36.799> we<00:03:37.430> already

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
pocket with a fortune shovel we already

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.819 
pocket with a fortune shovel we already
have<00:03:38.269> two<00:03:38.959> stacks<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.829> just<00:03:40.640> straight-up<00:03:41.090> clay

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
have two stacks of just straight-up clay

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.830 
have two stacks of just straight-up clay
now<00:03:43.000> depending<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.030> what<00:03:44.150> you're<00:03:44.329> making<00:03:44.480> are

no hardened clay is you do need a lot of
clay<00:03:49.129> to<00:03:49.400> make<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:49.790> know<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.209> is<00:03:50.329> very

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
clay to make I know that is very

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.890 
clay to make I know that is very
difficult<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.470> get<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.400> especially

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
difficult to get that is especially

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.229
