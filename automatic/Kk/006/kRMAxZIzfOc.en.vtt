00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello friends welcome here 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 to a new slogan like him 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 me a mercedes sprinter 316 bluetec 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.240
 service in version 1.0 of the fire 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.760
 technology and we have here 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 different stories the one behind 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 we already see one here 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.060
 high-pressure cleaner to a gas tank 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.150
 which her thanks to seeds, we have water 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 Get a seat here Yes that was it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.309
 have been and the whole serves 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.380
 Of course, around our farm in the best possible way 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 provide with everything you just like that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 now, for example, we needed one 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.610
 asked to hang out because you go here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.559
 Forgot to thank for example or because 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.989
 we run out of seed or or or 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 There are various possibilities we 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.989
 more functions like for example me 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 this all-round light quote 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.539
 around light heat indicator on 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.239
 side mirror that is very very cool 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.480
 also made a horn the horn is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.240
 overwhelming for a mercedes sprinter 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.189
 inside technically I have to confess 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.580
 saw the model but stories 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.509
 they were not so epic as we were 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.490
 constructively now claim that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.650
 barely improved that is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.590
 unfortunately god not really tingling 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.200
 So we have here 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 Externally, in any case, quite respectable 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.770
 made summer but meet 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.720
 a bit interesting because you are here 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.140
 looks connect is unfortunately god 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.180
 only show if you look here so 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.329
 a bit out of a certain one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 You can see painting of certain angles 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 rear tire is now for 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.630
 For example you can see even a very brief 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.950
 a bit soft gags and right 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.479
 looks a bit more interesting 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.270
 but I have never seen it so 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.950
 This line seems like there 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.040
 one side to the other side 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 mirrored and there we have that 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.479
 Assembly made reasonable now 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.130
 and then, as I said, it works 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.740
 That's why I'm so critical here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.869
 mature dust tire marks there are however 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.230
 just because it shows what is 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.330
 that's it 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.760
 hopefully understandable for everyone 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.580
 look if the trailer hitch is behind 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.420
 we have a function that we are very 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.040
 interest 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.060
 otherwise we have the button 5 one 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.220
 at least on the rhine with the 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.019
 keeper 8 but definitely working 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.230
 that's that blackboard okay coal 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:42.280
 history we all have for him 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:48.970
 here with the key 5 it is hinged 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.700
 extremely horny eighth with the 5 can now 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.970
 do not recognize friends 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.019
 okay, what exactly is up there 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.660
 can read down the back with the button 5 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:07.810
 so funny with me , the flap 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:11.230
 not much it just stands there for a very short time 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.010
 also you can work out with him the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.889
 The police are brought down ok 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.019
 friends who can read is clearly us 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.540
 have read times you must therefore 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.940
 go and so he dx is not that 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.440
 the five-seater sticks but that does not matter 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.329
 Can you shut up and do it 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.329
 and it's about a cool story 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.700
 Democracy until she is curious as always here 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.360
 So gladbach bochum comes where it is 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.410
 Maybe open the door here 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.690
 first to the church 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.640
 that was it, now it's real 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.420
 not like kirchner we use 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.370
 kÃ¤rcher frank gardener god if like 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.720
 you can just use the kÃ¤rcher 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.770
 puzzle a bit no idea for it 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.140
 exciting story maybe you know 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.260
 her friend's will burn 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.880
 We are only interested in doing this 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.780
 make here only with the test with the 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.000
 trailer hitch 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.640
 I am very curious if it is possible 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.310
 is for example only at threshing of 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.820
 rest for example what a counter off to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.250
 load or so with the prantner 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.950
 jamal does not work we will 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.750
 now once again very briefly one 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.920
 second try the alcohol one 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.290
 I believe that Michael one 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.910
 the vase works really nice 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.350
 this is now only a vague guess ok 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.860
 you can not hang anything behind okay 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.930
 says to humanly tragic 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.970
 Nevertheless, thank you very much for it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.490
 see you and hopefully see you 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
 friends again next time 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.530
 a new murder conception until then 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.530
 bye
