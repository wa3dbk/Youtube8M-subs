00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
whenever we do capture people I think

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.440 
whenever we do capture people I think
they<00:01:46.190> they<00:01:46.220> take<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.730> for<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:46.910> right<00:01:47.030> reasons

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
they they take it for the right reasons

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.000 
they they take it for the right reasons
it's<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.200> matter<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.440> breaking<00:01:48.920> through

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's just a matter of breaking through

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.550 
it's just a matter of breaking through
to<00:01:49.100> those<00:01:49.660> 16<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.810> under<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.200> they'd<00:01:51.350> be<00:01:51.410> out

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
to those 16 and under that they'd be out
