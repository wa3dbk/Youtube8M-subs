00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
to break down the assault rifles and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.089 
to break down the assault rifles and
rank<00:00:09.360> them<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.990> it's<00:00:10.380> pretty<00:00:10.530> easy<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.980> me<00:00:11.040> to

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
just take it for what it's worth my

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.599 
just take it for what it's worth my
number<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.570> assault<00:00:24.900> rifle<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.189> opinion

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
number one assault rifle in my opinion

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.740 
number one assault rifle in my opinion
is<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> scar-l<00:00:27.619> and<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.310> close<00:00:29.550> second<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
is the scar-l and it's a close second to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.400 
is the scar-l and it's a close second to
the<00:00:30.960> type<00:00:31.140> 95<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.340> ACR<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.410> guess

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the type 95 in the in the ACR I guess

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
the type 95 in the in the ACR I guess
you<00:00:34.500> could<00:00:34.590> say<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.010> top<00:00:35.280> three<00:00:35.550> guns<00:00:35.840> but<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you could say the top three guns but the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
you could say the top three guns but the
number<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> my<00:00:37.620> opinion<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> scar-l

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
number one in my opinion is the scar-l

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
number one in my opinion is the scar-l
because<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> iron<00:00:39.390> sights<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.469> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
because of the iron sights and for that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.889 
because of the iron sights and for that
reason<00:00:40.920> alone<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.969> really<00:00:42.480> good<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
reason alone it's really good it's a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
reason alone it's really good it's a
very<00:00:42.930> balanced<00:00:43.680> all-around<00:00:44.250> gun<00:00:44.460> very<00:00:45.030> high

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
very balanced all-around gun very high

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
very balanced all-around gun very high
accuracy<00:00:45.780> very<00:00:46.770> good<00:00:46.980> damage<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.789> good

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
accuracy very good damage and very good

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.660 
accuracy very good damage and very good
fire<00:00:48.390> rate<00:00:48.800> it's<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:49.980> comparable<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
fire rate it's very comparable to the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.970 
fire rate it's very comparable to the
ACR<00:00:51.120> ACR<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.140> more<00:00:52.289> accurate<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.949> my

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
ACR ACR is a little more accurate in my

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
ACR ACR is a little more accurate in my
opinion<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.670> maybe<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.600> little<00:00:54.750> less<00:00:54.989> accurate

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
opinion or maybe a little less accurate

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.990 
opinion or maybe a little less accurate
I<00:00:55.559> mean<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.250> honest<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.910> around

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I mean to be honest I don't go around

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700 
I mean to be honest I don't go around
comparing<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> guns<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> does<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
comparing the guns but it does have a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
comparing the guns but it does have a
little<00:00:58.920> less<00:00:59.160> damage<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.840> thing<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
little less damage the thing about the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
little less damage the thing about the
scar<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.340> has<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> ability<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.420> to

huge<00:01:45.869> advantages<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:47.070> using<00:01:47.220> this<00:01:47.720> my<00:01:48.720> number

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
huge advantages to using this my number

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.249 
huge advantages to using this my number

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
of the better assault rifles very

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
of the better assault rifles very
comparable<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.280> scar-l<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:06.420> scar-l<00:02:06.689> will

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
comparable to the scar-l but scar-l will

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
comparable to the scar-l but scar-l will
get<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> nod<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> better<00:02:07.979> iron<00:02:08.129> sights

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
get the nod for the better iron sights

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.070 
get the nod for the better iron sights
allowing<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.330> suppressor<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
allowing you to use suppressor and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.999 
allowing you to use suppressor and
extended<00:02:10.440> mags

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
extended mags

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.289 
extended mags
together<00:02:12.110> number<00:02:13.110> four<00:02:13.349> would<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.299> m4a1

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
together number four would be the m4a1

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.140 
together number four would be the m4a1
m4a1<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.319> also<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> very<00:02:16.890> balanced<00:02:17.310> weapon<00:02:17.640> it's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
m4a1 is also a very balanced weapon it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.670 
m4a1 is also a very balanced weapon it's
high<00:02:18.390> rate<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.659> fire<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.110> gonna<00:02:19.290> allow<00:02:19.439> you<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
high rate of fire is gonna allow you to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
high rate of fire is gonna allow you to
be<00:02:19.799> very<00:02:20.010> aggressive<00:02:20.310> with<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.510> find

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
be very aggressive with it and I find

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.460 
be very aggressive with it and I find
one<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.049> better<00:02:22.260> combinations<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:25.079> use<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
one of the better combinations to use is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.500 
one of the better combinations to use is
the<00:02:25.650> red<00:02:25.860> dot<00:02:26.010> silencer<00:02:26.819> it's<00:02:27.120> probably<00:02:27.390> one

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
the red dot silencer it's probably one

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.940 
the red dot silencer it's probably one
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.659> best<00:02:27.870> guns<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.290> use<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.590> red<00:02:28.799> dot

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
of the best guns to use with red dot

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.800 
of the best guns to use with red dot
silencer<00:02:29.400> due<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.760> high<00:02:29.970> fire<00:02:30.299> rate<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
silencer due to that high fire rate and

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.100 
silencer due to that high fire rate and
also<00:02:31.560> decent<00:02:32.459> damage<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:33.989> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
also decent damage so I really like this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.830 
also decent damage so I really like this
gun<00:02:34.319> although<00:02:35.129> I<00:02:35.549> prefer<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.360> use<00:02:36.510> something

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
gun although I prefer to use something

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.349 
gun although I prefer to use something
like<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.079> scar-l<00:02:37.409> due<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.129> its<00:02:38.609> higher<00:02:38.879> rated

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
like the scar-l due to its higher rated

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.580 
like the scar-l due to its higher rated
it's<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.170> hybrid<00:02:40.650> due<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.250> its<00:02:41.400> higher<00:02:41.609> damage

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's a hybrid due to its higher damage

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.930 
it's a hybrid due to its higher damage
but<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:43.980> also<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.220> very<00:02:44.430> good<00:02:44.519> gun<00:02:44.760> it's

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
but this is also a very good gun it's

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.930 
but this is also a very good gun it's
the<00:02:45.030> first<00:02:45.239> gun<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> leveled<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.019> level<00:02:46.140> 31

know the exact multipliers I haven't
really<00:03:18.720> researched<00:03:18.930> into<00:03:19.349> that<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.769> just

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
really researched into that and just

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.670 
really researched into that and just
going<00:03:20.280> by<00:03:20.430> from<00:03:20.760> what<00:03:21.060> I've<00:03:21.150> used<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:22.590> yeah

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
going by from what I've used but yeah

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
this is a very very good gun number 6 I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.289 
this is a very very good gun number 6 I
would<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.590> to<00:03:28.709> put<00:03:29.129> number<00:03:29.370> 6<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.970> number<00:03:30.030> 7

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
would have to put number 6 and number 7

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.500 
would have to put number 6 and number 7
close<00:03:30.840> together<00:03:31.199> the<00:03:31.500> CM<00:03:31.829> 9<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.430> also<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.760> g36

I'm gonna put the CM 9 over it simply

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
I'm gonna put the CM 9 over it simply
because<00:03:36.329> it<00:03:36.419> has<00:03:36.510> very<00:03:36.840> high<00:03:36.900> damage<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.650> when

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
because it has very high damage and when

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.259 
because it has very high damage and when
you<00:03:37.859> put<00:03:38.040> something<00:03:38.250> like<00:03:38.370> kick<00:03:38.699> on<00:03:38.879> this<00:03:39.030> gun

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you put something like kick on this gun

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.400 
you put something like kick on this gun
despite<00:03:40.109> his<00:03:40.230> fire<00:03:40.470> rate<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.949> is<00:03:41.340> very<00:03:41.639> lethal

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
despite his fire rate it is very lethal

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.930 
despite his fire rate it is very lethal
that<00:03:43.410> high<00:03:43.650> damage<00:03:44.069> is<00:03:44.160> gonna<00:03:44.340> make<00:03:44.549> it<00:03:44.669> like<00:03:44.910> a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that high damage is gonna make it like a

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.009 
that high damage is gonna make it like a
3<00:03:45.629> shot<00:03:46.019> kill<00:03:46.079> on<00:03:46.410> almost<00:03:46.620> any<00:03:46.859> distance<00:03:47.340> I

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
3 shot kill on almost any distance I

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.659 
3 shot kill on almost any distance I
really<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.169> that<00:03:49.349> gun<00:03:49.500> will<00:03:49.650> kick<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.579> then

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
really like that gun will kick and then

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.030 
really like that gun will kick and then
you<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.000> g36<00:03:51.629> in<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:52.019> opinion<00:03:52.379> g36

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
something like the scar-l in my opinion

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.520 
something like the scar-l in my opinion
what<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.090> have<00:04:03.329> found<00:04:03.569> though<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.319> like

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
what I have found though is that I like

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.219 
what I have found though is that I like
using<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.919> g36<00:04:05.639> from<00:04:05.909> the<00:04:06.060> hip<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.540> lot<00:04:06.989> more

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
using the g36 from the hip a lot more

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.319 
using the g36 from the hip a lot more
than<00:04:07.409> the<00:04:07.560> other<00:04:07.799> assault<00:04:08.159> rifles<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.790> don't

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
than the other assault rifles I don't

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.789 
than the other assault rifles I don't
know<00:04:09.449> what's<00:04:09.720> going<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.260> hipfire<00:04:10.620> on

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
know what's going on with the hipfire on

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.439 
know what's going on with the hipfire on
this<00:04:10.919> gun<00:04:11.069> but<00:04:11.280> things<00:04:11.609> like<00:04:11.699> steady<00:04:12.030> aim<00:04:12.209> what

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
this gun but things like steady aim what

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.939 
this gun but things like steady aim what
the<00:04:12.540> g36<00:04:13.229> are<00:04:13.440> very<00:04:14.069> effective<00:04:15.229> so<00:04:16.229> there<00:04:16.859> you

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
the g36 are very effective so there you

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.260 
the g36 are very effective so there you
go<00:04:17.359> number<00:04:18.359> 8

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.100 

I'd<00:04:22.270> have<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.510> say<00:04:22.630> number<00:04:22.780> eight<00:04:22.960> would<00:04:23.050> be

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
I'd have to say number eight would be

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.680 
I'd have to say number eight would be
the<00:04:23.290> m16<00:04:23.860> m16<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.700> also<00:04:25.000> a<00:04:25.030> three<00:04:25.270> round<00:04:25.480> burst

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
weapon like the type 95 but this

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.600

it in modern warfare 2 and I certainly

better<00:05:26.230> choices<00:05:26.500> in<00:05:26.890> my<00:05:27.130> opinion<00:05:27.580> such<00:05:27.790> as<00:05:27.940> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
better choices in my opinion such as the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.280 
better choices in my opinion such as the
SCAR<00:05:28.330> L<00:05:28.360> or<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.870> ACR<00:05:29.640> but<00:05:30.750> yeah<00:05:31.750> some<00:05:32.020> people

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
SCAR L or the ACR but yeah some people

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.200 
SCAR L or the ACR but yeah some people
love<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.620> ak-47<00:05:33.160> it<00:05:33.610> was<00:05:33.730> actually<00:05:34.030> pretty

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
love the ak-47 it was actually pretty

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.770 
love the ak-47 it was actually pretty
decent<00:05:34.450> in<00:05:34.750> black<00:05:34.930> ops<00:05:35.200> but<00:05:35.710> not<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:36.340> much<00:05:36.490> here

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
decent in black ops but not so much here

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.600 
decent in black ops but not so much here
and<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:38.350> number<00:05:38.620> 10<00:05:38.770> assault<00:05:39.070> rifle<00:05:39.340> would<00:05:39.490> be

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
and the number 10 assault rifle would be

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.460 
and the number 10 assault rifle would be
the<00:05:39.790> fad<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.360> don't<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.840> this<00:05:40.990> gun<00:05:41.170> simply

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
the fad I don't like this gun simply

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.650 
the fad I don't like this gun simply
because<00:05:41.710> its<00:05:41.890> damage<00:05:42.220> is<00:05:42.430> too<00:05:42.640> low<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:43.420> does

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
because its damage is too low it does

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.020 
because its damage is too low it does
have<00:05:43.840> a<00:05:43.870> very<00:05:44.110> high<00:05:44.380> rate<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.650> fire<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.250> it's

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
have a very high rate of fire and it's

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.910 
have a very high rate of fire and it's
decently<00:05:46.810> accurate<00:05:47.350> there's<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:47.590> little<00:05:47.830> bit

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920 
decently accurate there's a little bit

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.920 
decently accurate there's a little bit
of<00:05:48.010> jump<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:48.610> even<00:05:48.910> when<00:05:49.150> you<00:05:49.330> put<00:05:49.510> kick<00:05:49.750> on

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
of jump to it even when you put kick on

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.860
