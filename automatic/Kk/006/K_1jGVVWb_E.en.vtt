00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.940 
shaped like a pot still so I bought it
for<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.569> weight<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.110> stainless<00:02:12.560> which<00:02:12.769> is

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
for the weight of the stainless which is

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.030 
for the weight of the stainless which is
like<00:02:13.130> three<00:02:13.430> or<00:02:13.519> four<00:02:13.580> hundred<00:02:13.790> bucks<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
like three or four hundred bucks and and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.680 
like three or four hundred bucks and and
then<00:02:16.310> we<00:02:16.430> had<00:02:16.580> people<00:02:16.819> that<00:02:17.060> were<00:02:17.209> regulars

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
then we had people that were regulars

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
then we had people that were regulars
here<00:02:17.840> at<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.049> pub<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.530> used<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.950> from

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
here at the pub that used to from

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.479 
here at the pub that used to from
appleton<00:02:19.970> rum<00:02:20.810> distillery<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.680> their<00:02:22.310> other

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
appleton rum distillery and their other

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.340 
appleton rum distillery and their other
candidate<00:02:23.330> location<00:02:23.750> there<00:02:23.900> are<00:02:23.989> huge<00:02:24.200> fans

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
candidate location there are huge fans

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.220 
candidate location there are huge fans
of<00:02:24.560> worldwide<00:02:25.010> stout<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:26.120> we<00:02:26.480> did<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.959> little

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
of worldwide stout so we did a little

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.680 
of worldwide stout so we did a little
wampum<00:02:27.819> trade<00:02:28.819> of<00:02:29.269> worldwide<00:02:30.110> stout<00:02:30.500> for

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
wampum trade of worldwide stout for

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.059 
wampum trade of worldwide stout for
engineering<00:02:32.690> bus<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.380> they<00:02:33.470> helped<00:02:33.980> us

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
engineering bus and they helped us

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.759 
engineering bus and they helped us
figure<00:02:34.340> out<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:35.180> ratio<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.140> metal<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
figure out the ratio of this metal that

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.160 
figure out the ratio of this metal that
need<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.190> stained<00:02:37.760> jacketed<00:02:38.480> which<00:02:39.049> is

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
need to be stained jacketed which is

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.699 
need to be stained jacketed which is
what<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.440> see<00:02:39.590> down<00:02:39.769> here<00:02:40.570> how<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.709> soldier

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
what you see down here how the soldier

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.440 
what you see down here how the soldier
would<00:02:43.250> come<00:02:43.519> up<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.030> meet<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
would come up and meet with with

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.330 
would come up and meet with with
refractory<00:02:47.450> arm<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.410> then<00:02:48.890> over<00:02:49.310> here

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
refractory arm here and then over here

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.000 
refractory arm here and then over here
you<00:02:49.609> see<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:49.970> condensing<00:02:50.720> coil<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.799> they

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
you see the condensing coil and they

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.660 
you see the condensing coil and they
gave<00:02:52.190> us<00:02:52.340> an<00:02:52.820> idea<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:53.329> what<00:02:53.799> length<00:02:54.799> copper

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
gave us an idea of what length copper

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.060 
gave us an idea of what length copper
condensing<00:02:56.510> we<00:02:56.660> needed<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.799> were<00:02:57.890> too

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
condensing we needed and we were too

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.789 
condensing we needed and we were too
cheap<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> buy<00:02:58.459> another<00:02:58.880> vessel<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.260> we<00:03:00.410> welded

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
cheap to buy another vessel so we welded

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:06.280 
cheap to buy another vessel so we welded
to<00:03:01.010> KCC<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:03.049> pretty-pretty<00:03:04.090> get<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.299> wicked

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
to KCC it pretty-pretty get up wicked

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.559 
to KCC it pretty-pretty get up wicked
affect<00:03:06.650> efficient<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.940> there's<00:03:08.120> two<00:03:08.329> kegs

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
affect efficient so there's two kegs

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.050 
affect efficient so there's two kegs
rolled<00:03:09.019> together<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:10.100> basically<00:03:10.609> how<00:03:11.030> it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
rolled together and so basically how it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.410 
rolled together and so basically how it
works<00:03:11.359> is<00:03:12.850> liquor<00:03:13.850> or<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.630> alcohol<00:03:14.870> has<00:03:15.260> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
works is liquor or the alcohol has a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.599 
works is liquor or the alcohol has a
lower<00:03:17.420> evaporation<00:03:18.410> temperature<00:03:18.920> than<00:03:19.579> the

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
lower evaporation temperature than the

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.090 
lower evaporation temperature than the
wash<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> first<00:03:21.139> thing<00:03:21.260> that<00:03:21.380> goes<00:03:21.530> into

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
wash so the first thing that goes into

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.820 
wash so the first thing that goes into
ass<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.730> alcohol<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:23.690> goes<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.740> the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
ass is the alcohol so that goes in the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.620 
ass is the alcohol so that goes in the
gaps<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.430> comes<00:03:25.670> out<00:03:25.850> through<00:03:26.090> here<00:03:26.330> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
gaps and it comes out through here and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.120 
gaps and it comes out through here and
when<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.900> hits<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.230> cold<00:03:27.500> water<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
when it hits the cold water in the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.970 
when it hits the cold water in the
condenser<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.330> comes<00:03:30.110> packing<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> liquid

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
condenser it comes packing the liquid

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.090 
condenser it comes packing the liquid
form<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.490> comes<00:03:32.420> out<00:03:32.690> as<00:03:32.900> alcohol<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.010> then

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
form and comes out as alcohol and then

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.370 
form and comes out as alcohol and then
we<00:03:34.190> bring<00:03:34.370> into<00:03:34.550> these<00:03:34.790> two<00:03:35.090> tanks<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:36.080> again

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
we bring into these two tanks that again
