Jim our topic for today is skateboarding
laws<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:08.970> reason<00:00:09.240> we're<00:00:09.360> doing<00:00:09.450> it<00:00:09.570> is

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
laws and the reason we're doing it is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.850 
laws and the reason we're doing it is
obviously<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.290> of<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.530> man<00:00:10.680> who<00:00:10.830> was

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
obviously because of that man who was

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.370 
obviously because of that man who was
hit<00:00:11.520> and<00:00:11.730> run<00:00:12.060> our<00:00:12.390> hit<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.930> run<00:00:13.020> last<00:00:13.200> night

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
hit and run our hit and run last night

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.680 
hit and run our hit and run last night
the<00:00:13.980> man<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.400> his<00:00:14.430> skateboard<00:00:14.760> so<00:00:15.300> the<00:00:15.570> big

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
the man was on his skateboard so the big

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
the man was on his skateboard so the big
question<00:00:15.810> of<00:00:16.080> course<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.379> where<00:00:17.160> are<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
question of course is where are the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.880 
question of course is where are the
skateboarding<00:00:18.300> laws<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.810> city<00:00:18.990> well<00:00:19.410> it's

skateboarding laws in the city well it's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.220 
skateboarding laws in the city well it's
very<00:00:20.040> interesting<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.110> skateboards<00:00:22.110> are

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
very interesting because skateboards are

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
very interesting because skateboards are
treated<00:00:22.530> like<00:00:22.560> bicycles<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> state<00:00:24.030> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
don't find anything that suggests that

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.940 
don't find anything that suggests that
the<00:01:09.509> real<00:01:09.719> issue<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.200> whether<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.860> on

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the real issue is whether they can be on

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
the real issue is whether they can be on
sidewalks<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.479> as<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> understand<00:01:13.110> it

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
sidewalks or not but as I understand it

at the skateboarders fault well I think

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.419

that's<00:02:03.689> kind<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.079> jump<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.619> judgment<00:02:05.280> that

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
that's kind of a jump to judgment that

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.210 
that's kind of a jump to judgment that
is<00:02:05.609> way<00:02:05.819> way<00:02:06.060> too<00:02:06.119> premature<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:08.100> we

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
is way way too premature here and we

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
is way way too premature here and we
don't<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.670> circumstances<00:02:08.850> under<00:02:09.570> which

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
