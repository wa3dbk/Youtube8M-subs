 it seems if I present to you what you need and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 we start cooking we are going to start 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.239
 with the ground meat so come with me 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.939
 I have ground beef here and I have 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.280
 a little salt and here I have my pan 

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.350
 with water remember that the question with 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.689
 my recipes is to cook all the water for 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 do not use fat so I'm going to 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:03.750
 practice a little bit of the ground meat 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 Sometimes when you buy ground beef 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 you can see numbers right away from her that 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 says 80 2010 the 97 this 97 3 that's the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 amount of meat and the amount of fat 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.100
 which has for example an 80 20 wants 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 say that 20 percent of that is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.840
 fat and 80 percent is meat 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.720
 always try to look for example the one of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 90 to 10 or 90 and 37 so that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
 contain less fat like me in this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.930
 I could not find the meat 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.670
 that comes with less fat in everything that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.830
 I'm going to do is place it in this water and 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 I'm going to start cooking and the juice 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.960
 I'll take it out to get rid of it 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.960
 of fat season with a little salt 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.360
 and what do you think if we make a rich 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.310
 appointment to accompany these toasts by 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.260
 Here I have a jalapeno then 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.790
 toast and remove the skin does not matter 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.860
 that the whole shell is not removed 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.990
 I like that the color that the 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.640
 burned shell I have 3 tomatillos 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.520
 green without cooking so I'm going to put them 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.130
 I have here also 2 cloves of garlic 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.900
 a medium one asked a little one what 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.390
 I'm going to put another one and I'm going to complement 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.979

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.570
 cup 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.570

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.500
 it's already liquefied I'm going to add half a cup 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 of natural yogurt and this is going to give us the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.590
 effect as if it were a sauces and 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.590
