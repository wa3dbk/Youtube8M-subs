think people say that video games are

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
think people say that video games are
always<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> time<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.220> they're<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.670> good<00:01:05.939> at

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.340 
always the time one they're not good at
them<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.479> don't<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.750> playing<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> -

them so they don't like playing that -

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
them so they don't like playing that -
they<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.890> playing<00:01:08.040> them<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.670> no

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
they like playing them but they have no

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580

time so they don't want you to either or

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.200 
time so they don't want you to either or
the<00:01:10.830> worst<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.340> three<00:01:11.729> they<00:01:11.880> judge<00:01:12.119> you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the worst of all three they judge you

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.070 
the worst of all three they judge you
because<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.689> interest<00:01:12.990> in

something that they have no interest in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
something that they have no interest in
which<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.970> judgmental<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> makes

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
which is so judgmental and makes

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.240
