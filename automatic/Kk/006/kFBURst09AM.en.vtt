00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
you proponent this difference so you

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.290 
you proponent this difference so you
have<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.789> adjust<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.289> tactics<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
have to adjust to the tactics and

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.149 
have to adjust to the tactics and
today's<00:01:03.300> opponent<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.409> him<00:01:04.650> quite<00:01:04.830> well

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
today's opponent I I know him quite well

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
today's opponent I I know him quite well
we<00:01:05.430> grew<00:01:05.610> up<00:01:05.670> together<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.240> played<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> junior

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
we grew up together and played in junior

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.200 
we grew up together and played in junior
circuit<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.890> he's<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.340> unpredictable<00:01:08.760> with

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
circuit and he's very unpredictable with

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.980 
circuit and he's very unpredictable with
his<00:01:09.360> behavior<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.799> his<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.490> his<00:01:11.640> game<00:01:11.990> I

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
his behavior with his with his game I

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
his behavior with his with his game I
think<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.590> conditions<00:01:14.070> quite<00:01:14.580> suitable<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
think this conditions quite suitable to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
think this conditions quite suitable to
his<00:01:15.240> style<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> games<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.140> bit<00:01:16.290> slower<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
his style of the games a bit slower the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.410 
his style of the games a bit slower the
ball<00:01:16.979> wells<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.460> higher<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:17.970> loves<00:01:18.240> his

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
ball wells is higher and he loves his

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
ball wells is higher and he loves his
clay-court<00:01:18.960> specialist<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.650> he<00:01:20.340> came<00:01:20.490> back<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
clay-court specialist so he came back to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.249 
clay-court specialist so he came back to
the<00:01:20.939> match<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> he<00:01:21.450> made<00:01:21.630> me<00:01:21.750> work<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.140> know
