00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.889
 i am powerful hello i am free 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.330
 and today we maintain the shoes and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.330
 make them winterproof 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.930
 there are different materials that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.460
 you know for sure 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.529
 This is a very classic works 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
 leather that can be maintained and recommended 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.400
 we go with colony leather that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.019
 the ecological variant is one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.880
 version that you will encounter example of 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.120
 the julina a popular super reminds 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.020
 jurist is about the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 Material combination once with fabric 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.200
 once with catheter recommended for this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 we compose the nano pro and the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.820
 third variant that still exists that is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.550
 the notebook leather or general 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.770
 linguistically suede which is very bumpy in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.879
 the surface is and you get that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.879
 with a notebook spray 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.870
 So as I said the leather goes to take 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 for smooth again you can wear on 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 either with a brush should I 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
 now water or with a rapper and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 Frank does that and everyone goes is the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.680
 ecological variation around every water 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.680
 to make both 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.579
 that was the variant of the fly for him 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100
 smooth leather I show them now 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.479
 variant for the material mix 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 this we take the compose nano pro 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.960
 spray is very important that please 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.329
 apa 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.980
 That was the emergency variant 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.410
 and there is a book specifically for that 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.370

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.030
 So our schools are all now 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.920
 impregnated you can see it completely 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.020
 just when you 're out on the street 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.360
 is that the water easily get rid of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.890
 At the moment I can only say shoes 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.660
