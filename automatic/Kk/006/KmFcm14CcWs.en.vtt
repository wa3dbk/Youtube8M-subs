down<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.590> pre-owned<00:01:53.369> market<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.030> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
down like the pre-owned market to this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.910 
down like the pre-owned market to this
point<00:01:54.869> way<00:01:55.079> seems<00:01:55.409> like<00:01:55.649> they<00:01:55.770> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
point way seems like they just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.920 
point way seems like they just
completely<00:01:56.280> reverses<00:01:57.210> compared<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
completely reverses compared to this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.420 
completely reverses compared to this
bleep<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.680> get<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> feeling<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.280> there's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
bleep I get the feeling that there's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.950 
bleep I get the feeling that there's
going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.700> be<00:01:59.759> some<00:02:00.030> caveats<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.840> just

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
going to be some caveats that they just

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
going to be some caveats that they just
don't<00:02:01.140> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> dig<00:02:01.590> into<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> would

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
don't want to dig into because it would

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.940 
don't want to dig into because it would
kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> disagreement<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.770> think

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
kind of a disagreement I think I think

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
kind of a disagreement I think I think
they're<00:02:05.040> going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> be<00:02:05.280> open<00:02:05.310> about<00:02:05.689> something

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
they're going to be open about something

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.240 
they're going to be open about something
I<00:02:07.049> think<00:02:07.290> I'm<00:02:07.350> gonna<00:02:07.469> be<00:02:07.619> totally<00:02:07.860> cool<00:02:08.190> about

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
I think I'm gonna be totally cool about

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.380 
I think I'm gonna be totally cool about
it<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.670> definitely<00:02:08.849> think<00:02:09.090> they're<00:02:09.239> going<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it I definitely think they're going to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.309 
it I definitely think they're going to
detail<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.840> they're<00:02:10.020> going<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.289> open

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
detail and they're going to be open

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
detail and they're going to be open
about<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:11.700> want<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
about it but I think they don't want to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
about it but I think they don't want to
go<00:02:12.090> into<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> nitty<00:02:12.540> gritties<00:02:12.870> where<00:02:13.050> one

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
go into the nitty gritties where one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
go into the nitty gritties where one
every<00:02:13.950> city<00:02:14.189> has<00:02:14.310> every<00:02:14.909> game<00:02:15.120> has<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.360> unique

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
every city has every game has a unique

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.690 
every city has every game has a unique
code<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.379> wanted<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.739> use<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> gone<00:02:17.250> like

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
code that wanted to use is gone like

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.589 
code that wanted to use is gone like
they<00:02:17.819> don't<00:02:17.849> want<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> talk<00:02:18.239> about<00:02:18.299> that

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
they don't want to talk about that

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.149 
they don't want to talk about that
because<00:02:18.720> they<00:02:18.989> think<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.799> they're<00:02:19.950> not

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
because they think is that they're not

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.920 
because they think is that they're not
gonna<00:02:20.310> make<00:02:20.549> any<00:02:20.760> money<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.239> backwards

gonna make any money on backwards

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.690 
gonna make any money on backwards
compatibility<00:02:22.650> this<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.010> never<00:02:23.340> gonna<00:02:23.610> be

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
compatibility this is never gonna be

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.580 
compatibility this is never gonna be
about<00:02:24.000> money<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.360> mean<00:02:24.569> it<00:02:24.659> up<00:02:24.780> sells<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> xbox

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
about money I mean it up sells the xbox

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.500 
about money I mean it up sells the xbox
one<00:02:25.769> slightly<00:02:26.189> yes<00:02:26.519> but<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:27.329> is

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
one slightly yes but this is this is

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.750 
one slightly yes but this is this is
about<00:02:27.689> fanservice<00:02:28.379> right<00:02:29.099> this<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.549> about

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
about fanservice right this is about

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.880 
about fanservice right this is about
their<00:02:30.000> engineers<00:02:30.510> doing<00:02:31.140> loads<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.560> software

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
their engineers doing loads of software

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.589 
their engineers doing loads of software
emulation<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.519> back<00:02:32.670> end<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.420> play

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
emulation on the back end so we can play

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.089 
emulation on the back end so we can play
our<00:02:33.629> old<00:02:33.870> games<00:02:34.109> this<00:02:34.349> isn't<00:02:34.560> about<00:02:34.620> selling

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
our old games this isn't about selling

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.679 
our old games this isn't about selling
or<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.459> reckon<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:35.819> everyone<00:02:36.299> will<00:02:36.510> be<00:02:36.659> able

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
or do you reckon I everyone will be able

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.270 
or do you reckon I everyone will be able
to<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:36.989> pass<00:02:37.200> around<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> same<00:02:37.769> game<00:02:38.010> and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
to just pass around the same game and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.710 
to just pass around the same game and
yeah<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> think<00:02:39.209> that's<00:02:39.420> going<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.569> be<00:02:39.659> actually

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
yeah I think that's going to be actually

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.500 
yeah I think that's going to be actually
fine<00:02:39.989> i<00:02:40.019> think<00:02:40.109> a<00:02:40.290> few<00:02:40.439> publishers<00:02:40.829> who<00:02:41.129> would

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
fine i think a few publishers who would

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.819 
fine i think a few publishers who would
re-releasing<00:02:42.510> digital<00:02:43.019> deluxe<00:02:43.319> editions

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829

if you want or the d-pad I think was the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.129 
if you want or the d-pad I think was the
most<00:03:50.340> sort<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.909> eye-catching<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:52.109> uh

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
most sort of eye-catching is that uh

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.409 
most sort of eye-catching is that uh
that<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:53.159> little<00:03:53.430> Basin<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.209> had

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
different angles so it was again it was

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.509 
different angles so it was again it was
like<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.239> little<00:03:57.780> hole<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.319> sort<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.560> our<00:03:59.280> cave

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
kind of functionality into it it could

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.010

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
i would add in lithium batteries or like

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.750 
i would add in lithium batteries or like
yeah<00:04:51.120> recharge<00:04:52.020> abilities<00:04:52.500> terribly<00:04:52.979> but

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
yeah recharge abilities terribly but

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.480 
yeah recharge abilities terribly but
this<00:04:53.910> appears<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.479> be<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:55.050> lot<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:55.889> battery<00:04:56.100> case

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
this appears to be a lot of battery case

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.820 
this appears to be a lot of battery case
very<00:04:57.240> casing<00:04:57.690> yeah<00:04:57.810> they're<00:04:57.990> going<00:04:58.169> hard<00:04:58.710> on

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
very casing yeah they're going hard on

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.290 
very casing yeah they're going hard on
Barry<00:04:59.130> casing<00:04:59.460> it<00:04:59.550> does<00:04:59.669> look<00:04:59.880> I<00:05:00.000> mean<00:05:00.120> there's

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
Barry casing it does look I mean there's

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.850 
Barry casing it does look I mean there's
gonna<00:05:00.389> be<00:05:00.540> a<00:05:00.570> lot<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.750> third-party<00:05:01.320> you<00:05:01.740> know

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
gonna be a lot of third-party you know

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.530 
gonna be a lot of third-party you know
peripheral<00:05:02.639> makers<00:05:02.910> out<00:05:03.030> there<00:05:03.090> creating

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
peripheral makers out there creating

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.270 
peripheral makers out there creating
custom<00:05:03.960> bits<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.440> it's<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:04.979> good<00:05:05.160> way<00:05:05.250> to

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
custom bits and it's a good way to

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.640 
custom bits and it's a good way to
customize<00:05:05.669> your<00:05:06.150> own<00:05:06.210> controller<00:05:06.900> like<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.380> do

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650

version of a control if they could just

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.010

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
ever play with a controller with these

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.500 
ever play with a controller with these
things<00:05:28.590> because<00:05:28.710> they're<00:05:28.889> definitely<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:30.090> use

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.480 
to press the buttons I you know I don't
have<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:40.050> tried<00:05:40.229> it<00:05:40.380> I've<00:05:40.500> never<00:05:40.710> tries<00:05:41.310> I

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
that was when call of duty hacking is a

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.860 
that was when call of duty hacking is a
big<00:05:44.789> thing<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:45.180> people<00:05:45.300> were<00:05:45.510> adding<00:05:45.750> in

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
shortcuts in the back just so they can

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.180 
shortcuts in the back just so they can
do<00:05:47.460> weird<00:05:47.729> like<00:05:48.000> 360<00:05:48.900> noscopes<00:05:49.349> and<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:49.950> kind

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
