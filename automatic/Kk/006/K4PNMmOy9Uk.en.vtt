welcome to a preview for a map called
thunderstorm<00:00:08.370> fields<00:00:08.940> some<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:09.960> are

thunderstorm fields some of you are
pretty<00:00:10.349> well<00:00:10.440> familiar<00:00:10.980> with<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.610> map<00:00:11.849> at

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
pretty well familiar with this map at

pretty well familiar with this map at
this<00:00:12.300> point<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.960> made<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> whole<00:00:13.769> series

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
this point I made a whole series

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.460 
this point I made a whole series
documenting<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.880> construction<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
documenting the construction from the

documenting the construction from the
ground<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.490> called<00:00:17.760> farm<00:00:18.150> project<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
ground up it's called farm project and

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.560 
ground up it's called farm project and
you<00:00:18.960> can<00:00:19.080> find<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.070> channel<00:00:20.430> it's<00:00:21.330> lit

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you can find it on this channel it's lit

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.779 
you can find it on this channel it's lit
up<00:00:21.660> into<00:00:21.810> five<00:00:22.020> different<00:00:22.260> chunks<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.949> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
up into five different chunks and it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.370 
up into five different chunks and it
starts<00:00:24.150> from<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> very<00:00:24.660> beginning<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> very

hasn't<00:00:31.980> gone<00:00:32.070> through<00:00:32.520> enough<00:00:32.730> playtesting

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
hasn't gone through enough playtesting

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.940 
hasn't gone through enough playtesting
enough<00:00:33.899> play<00:00:34.290> testing<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.710> me<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.860> be

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
enough play testing for me to be

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.560 
enough play testing for me to be
satisfied<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> map<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.120> yet<00:00:36.360> I'm

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
satisfied with the map just yet I'm

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.209 
satisfied with the map just yet I'm
having<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> lot<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> trouble<00:00:37.710> nailing<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
having a lot of trouble nailing down a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
having a lot of trouble nailing down a
game<00:00:38.489> type<00:00:38.760> for<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.690> default<00:00:39.840> modes

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
game type for this the default modes

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
game type for this the default modes
just<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.770> work<00:00:40.950> well<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.399> map<00:00:41.640> uh

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
just do not work well on this map uh

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
just do not work well on this map uh
which<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.140> probably<00:00:43.500> due<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> fact<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.010> it's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
which is probably due the fact that it's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.979 
which is probably due the fact that it's
very<00:00:44.309> open<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.210> having<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.480> come<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.870> with

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
very open so I'm having to come up with

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.069 
very open so I'm having to come up with
my<00:00:46.350> own<00:00:46.590> game<00:00:46.950> type<00:00:47.190> from<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> time<00:00:47.969> being<00:00:48.239> but

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
my own game type from the time being but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.439 
my own game type from the time being but
until<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.469> done<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.940> guys<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.300> just

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and you can also find warthogs in these

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.749 
and you can also find warthogs in these
garages<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.530> warthog<00:01:37.950> drop<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> S

garages just one warthog drop the S
there<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.189> game<00:01:41.369> modes<00:01:41.549> I'm<00:01:41.670> still

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
there and in some game modes I'm still

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.399 
there and in some game modes I'm still
playing<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> idea<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.509> having<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.020> vehicle

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
playing on the idea of having a vehicle

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.350 
playing on the idea of having a vehicle
in<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> map<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:44.070> not<00:01:44.280> entirely<00:01:44.700> happy<00:01:44.939> with

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
in this map I'm not entirely happy with

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.249 
in this map I'm not entirely happy with
it<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:46.020> yet<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> vehicle

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it just yet but we'll see the vehicle

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.530 
it just yet but we'll see the vehicle
may<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.310> end<00:01:50.460> because<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
may have to go in the end because the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
may have to go in the end because the
wide<00:01:52.229> open<00:01:52.500> vehicle<00:01:52.680> lane<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> goes<00:01:53.460> around

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
wide open vehicle lane that goes around

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
wide open vehicle lane that goes around
the<00:01:53.759> map<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.329> kind<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> problem<00:01:55.110> for

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the map it's kind of a problem for

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.660 
the map it's kind of a problem for
effective<00:01:55.649> players<00:01:55.829> at<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.070> moment<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.579> I'm

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
effective players at the moment so I'm

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
effective players at the moment so I'm
having<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.939> tweak<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.420> I'll<00:01:57.990> figure

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
having to tweak that I'll figure

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.620 
having to tweak that I'll figure
something<00:01:58.770> out<00:01:58.860> there

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
something out there

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.020 
something out there
and<00:01:59.829> here<00:02:00.829> we<00:02:00.920> are<00:02:01.040> this<00:02:01.189> is<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> barn<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:01.939> is

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and here we are this is the barn this is

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.340 
and here we are this is the barn this is
probably<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.360> only<00:02:02.539> thing<00:02:02.810> that's<00:02:03.020> pretty

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
probably the only thing that's pretty

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.529 
probably the only thing that's pretty
much<00:02:03.500> directly<00:02:03.920> recreated<00:02:04.700> from<00:02:05.060> off<00:02:05.329> the

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
much directly recreated from off the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.719 
much directly recreated from off the
grid<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.409> very<00:02:06.649> very<00:02:07.009> similar<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.670> design

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
grid this is very very similar in design

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.940 
grid this is very very similar in design
to<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.539> barn<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.019> off<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.470> grid<00:02:09.619> map<00:02:09.800> in

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
to be barn on the off the grid map in

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.589 
to be barn on the off the grid map in
Halo<00:02:10.130> for<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.729> rest<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> map<00:02:11.209> is

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
Halo for the rest of the map is

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.180 
Halo for the rest of the map is
completely<00:02:12.110> different<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.890> is

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
completely different but that is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.089 
completely different but that is
probably<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:13.910> thing<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.780> same

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
probably the one thing that is the same

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.170 
probably the one thing that is the same
then<00:02:16.099> over<00:02:16.310> here<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.519> some<00:02:16.670> last<00:02:16.970> little

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
then over here to some last little

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.020 
then over here to some last little
static<00:02:17.480> details<00:02:18.010> we<00:02:19.010> got<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.400> radio<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.849> we<00:02:19.940> got

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
static details we got a radio and we got

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.210 
static details we got a radio and we got
a<00:02:20.060> campfire<00:02:20.590> something<00:02:21.590> I<00:02:21.800> kind<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.099> just

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
a campfire something I kind of just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.380 
a campfire something I kind of just
discovered<00:02:22.670> while<00:02:22.790> planning<00:02:23.000> on<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.209> lights

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
discovered while planning on the lights

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.780 
discovered while planning on the lights
and<00:02:23.569> trees<00:02:23.900> is<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.769> trunks<00:02:25.340> light<00:02:25.519> up<00:02:25.670> in

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
and trees is that the trunks light up in

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.699 
and trees is that the trunks light up in
a<00:02:25.849> really<00:02:26.030> interesting<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.569> when<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.590> hold

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
a really interesting way when you hold

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.979 
a really interesting way when you hold
an<00:02:27.860> orange<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.250> red<00:02:28.280> light<00:02:28.550> up<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.910> them<00:02:29.060> it

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
an orange or red light up to them it

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.600 
an orange or red light up to them it
makes<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.709> would<00:02:30.950> look<00:02:31.099> like<00:02:31.220> it's<00:02:31.370> actually

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
makes the would look like it's actually

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.339 
makes the would look like it's actually
on<00:02:31.670> fire<00:02:31.819> like<00:02:32.120> as<00:02:32.239> embers<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:33.049> glowing

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
on fire like as embers and it's glowing

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.960 
on fire like as embers and it's glowing
so<00:02:33.799> that's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.310> cool<00:02:34.400> little<00:02:34.519> effect<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.849> can

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
so that's a cool little effect you can

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.820 
so that's a cool little effect you can
play<00:02:35.090> around<00:02:35.180> with<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:36.230> anyway<00:02:36.530> thank<00:02:36.799> you

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
play around with but anyway thank you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.130 
play around with but anyway thank you
