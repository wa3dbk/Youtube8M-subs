00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.100
 well that shuts him this tutorial hd en 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 I hope you're fine for my 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.699
 well, it's okay so at the game we get 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.320
 found for a brand new video 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.060
 so today we find ourselves for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.039
 explain how to teleport 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.029
 anywhere in the map on gta 5 at 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.919
 name 1.25 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 and finally for 27 so it's a whole 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.300
 new method that was found by 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.220
 riders so big unions that you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.110
 because all the other methods have 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 been patched so that was it's the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 last method for now that has 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 been found by darksiders so word is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.870
 said kass also to fatalist who told me 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.250
 helped to make this little video so 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.780
 as usual before starting the 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.400
 little trick I ask you to chew 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 a maximum of blue thumb so a big 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.430
 blue thumbs to please me 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.920
 infra really very very pleasure if you 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.530
 could have dropped a maximum of blue thumbs 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.760
 on this little trick so everything 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 first I show you we are on the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.690
 map so we end up in the center 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.490
 city ​​right next to the apartment in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 400 thousand dollars and we will want to 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.420
 teleport the right there so to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.000
 trevor airport so first of all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.920
 for this cdd to teleport going to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 where you want to go 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.540
 select an activity anywhere 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.370
 near the bread or do you want to 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 teleport so I selected 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.400
 this mission but I would have taken a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.800
 another right next it would have been the same 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.140
 thing so we throw it with the button 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.060
 square and we validate so it's really 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.970
 a little trick to these practices 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.770
 because we can teleport anything 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.420
 where in the map in less than a minute and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.670
 with his friend so it's really still 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.530
 more practical than that because there 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.380
 teleported at the same time to the same 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.850
 place with his friend so here's a 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 once we are in the activity we invite 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.690
 our friend so been with us in the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.729
 part so it's obliged to be in the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.060
 same part by cons in the same 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.680
 session and then so that's when he has 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.370
 joined as soon as he is present you 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
 can leave 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.549
 so you have to leave this activity 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.540
 he's going to where he's going to have you 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.040
 invite as soon as you are in your 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.080
 in your session as soon as you have 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.930
 left as soon as you reappear he goes 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 have to invite directly and you 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.010
 you will join 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 so the mission again the one 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.450
 that you had just launched before 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.480
 so here it is good I received his 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.280
 invitation so I join as soon as I 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.860
 joined there is a final manipulation 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660
 very fast just to be teleported 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.850
 this is the end so there is going to have to 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 we will have left both 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.550
 have no timing there is no 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.489
 stuff at the same time I do not know what 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.600
 you do it as you want there 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.100
 can leave first I can leave 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.140
 first it will change nothing we will be all 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.790
 both teleport to the same place 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.160
 so in the end we are at the same 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.709
 place and in less than a minute 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.850
 so where we wanted to go on the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.420
 map so it's really very very 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.819
 convenient 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.110
 so feel free to drop a big shot 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.390
 buzz for this little trick 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.850
 I hope you have liked it so there 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.410
 here I show you that we are 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.739
 teleported just on the activity to 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.540
 trevor airport is so here 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.549
