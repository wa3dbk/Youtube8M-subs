00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.610
 all right 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.019
 betis network and let's see how it is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.419
 gives us this test game in shanghai 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.249
 with the acr and first game they comment 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.400
 direct this year 2015 and we're going to 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.020
 do it differently 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.270
 let's do it cool we are going to premiere 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.980
 format a format that I've seen with another 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.910
 content type mostly in 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.910
 driving games 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.440
 the channel of 10 and frost the channel of my 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.870
 friend you if it 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.400
 would be an excellent example of what you 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.500
 I speak but I have never seen in a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.850
 shooter so we can consider this 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.560
 a kind of experiment which is 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.910
 in my head is projected to the thousand 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.770
 wonders for what I would like to know 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.850
 your opinion the comments from 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.710
 a long time ago many of you 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.150
 you asked me to make videos 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.400
 showing my hand the mouse my hand 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.050
 keyboard but the truth is that the format 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.030
 2.0 is a format that does not finish me 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.920
 I convince not know very well why we will 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.280
 break up is here to see if we see any 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.680
 enemy is in the background 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.450
 for we have them here behind 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.700
 and I tell you the 2.0 format is a 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.379
 format that I personally do not 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.440
 ends up convincing instead this is 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.960
 exactly what I 'm seeing is 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.190
 it's my point of view 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.190
 the kitten is shy that is 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.759
 to see the other 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.270
 also the shit doing it for the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.270
 back also 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.440
 how bad I have done it in order many of 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.030
 you also ask why 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.170
 I do not teach the face really yes that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.600
 I show the face if you follow me is for 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.550
 twitter or by facebook with relative 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.970
 often only upload a photo when 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.720
 some shit different shit 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.400
 that the lighthouse radio is in the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.530
 dealer happens is that I tell you that you 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.150
 It's more I hope you heard 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.080
 load the shovels and see that nobody 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.550
 revive man 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.520
 I do not know if he has done very well pulling me 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.020
 here like crazy 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.030
 it has definitely not been a good 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.219
 idea let's see if with a little 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.179
 luck we left here with life I hope 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.219
 that the enemies that are reappearing 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.299
 right behind me as they have no line 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.110
 of vision with me we are going to close the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.179
 door 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.899
 more fear than shame be damned 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.899
 big 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.390
 has fallen one the carlos bases that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.390
 reappear here from behind let's see 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.220
 and there are a shot to the head 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.580
 he's a strong guy, or rather, he was an uncle 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.350
 strong because he is now dead 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.350
 These enemies are very shy 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.880
 the chapel this 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.080
 but what the fuck 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.080
 I think we just attended 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.260
 to the first region release that does not 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.110
 means a decrease in the last 25 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.870
 years I'm listening I never know either 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.870
 where is the fucking people likewise 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.519
 where are the bad guys? 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.970
 well then nothing will touch us 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.970
 look for them 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:11.069
 let's see around here 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.110
 you seem to have gone up is marked 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.890
 up on the minimap should be in 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.500
 the bridge is 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.630
 Pussy does not give him a whore goes the look and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.650
 the pussy blade but if it is if the wing 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.310
 haven 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.310
 uncle 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.530
 a server for playing for a while and started 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.940
 mind that I'm here playing 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.230
 if he's doing his thing 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.630
 explain that you are not finding me 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.860
 nobody is killing us all do not be 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.860
 greedy leaves something that they open 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.010
 do not be greedy 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.150
 and going through perfectly in all 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.610
 stubborn yes sir 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.840
 yes sir let's see why I think that 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.840
 are responding out there in the background 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.870
 let's see if we catch them in flagrante 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.219
 1 - that these so clean program 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.269
 leave from there from above because 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.930
 remove them in the head when 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.720
 they look out there is pretty delicate 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.880
 let's try to have a little bit of 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.880
 initiative that has seen me 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.500
 let's see I do not know if it's going to jump 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.540
 let's see how we solve this why 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.260
 very smart on your part and very 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.790
 smart on your part 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.770
 if you have ever find in this 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.540
 situation do not miss from above you have 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.990
 a very good strategic superiority 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.390
 because this support if you have ammunition 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.700
 whore and claymont of whore mother whore 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.090
 mother a classical support an elitist of 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.230
 conquer surely 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.690
 to see this also seems like a support 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.560
 this is this is this is what I 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.680
 I was looking for yes sir 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.240
 yes sir, well, we have ammunition 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.260
 now we only need to find the 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.289
 bad that it seems that they are 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.479
 hiding 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.479
 or that are giving them a lesson 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.710
 would shuffle the second option even more 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.160
 the first one does not seem very 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.210
 crazy upstairs mike 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.919
 but where they get 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.990
 this seems like walking dead 'more than 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:30.510
 battlefield good then nothing then nothing 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.970
 we are armed to the top all our 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.460
 ammo of love that there seems to be 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.930
 party around here back so we can 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.770
 pillar 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.770
 for this flank 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.590
 because nobody is dead come up 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.590
 dumbass 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.600
 and I'm sure you're swelling, I'm 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.310
 here strolling 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.570
 let's change the name to the map in 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.770
 instead of being already Shanghai and we're going to 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:02.150
 call walk through shanghai 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.150
 Stroll through Shanghai 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.660
 Well then nothing, the game is over 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.760
 here happy to this game of 13 this 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.420
 team in shanghai with the acr I'm going to 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.420
 drug a little 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.840
 it looks like a sponsored video but it's not 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.310
 the case is not the case to my regret 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.290
 Although my bank account is not the 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.280
 case this kind of thing you can do 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.920
 when you do a normal gameplay and 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.360
 current because they do not look and if it sounds 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.210
 something so you can edit it in the editor 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.950
 of video no but in this case then 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.180
 I'm not going to be able to edit it either, I think 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.770
 that we have solved the enigma of shanghai 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.210
 the mystery of shanghai because there was no 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.640
 people for shanghai because uy haven 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.170
 He was doing his thing in the end 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.210
 more than adding on my part I hope that 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.930
 you liked it and until next time 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.930
 chao chao
