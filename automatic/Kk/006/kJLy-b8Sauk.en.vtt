00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.880
 nice guys nice hold mind i 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.050
 welcome to this new tutorial that 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.330
 will most likely be the last one 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.550
 I will do on the series about how for a game 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.980
 similar to missed alive 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.100
 unfortunately we have to say something that 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.660
 this thing we are so sorry but it was 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.590
 then maybe we could do it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.059
 you have to accept it and as much as it will be 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.739
 probably the collapse of a myth 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.750
 even today it's okay we're kidding 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:47.230
 But of course it is not then this thing 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.920
 and that the only thing we missed was 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.100
 minecraft game was the ska a 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.090
 random casillas of the map you in 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.850
 javascript 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 it is not possible therefore or in any case it is 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.149
 possible but never and in addition to laughter 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.820
 they would be almost impossible 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:07.750
 very long members and so on 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.450
 these Christians 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.110
 we are giving both many though 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.869
 sorry answer the map does not 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.890
 we did it not by chance we have it 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:24.189
 downloaded from a site and from a crawford ha 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.039
 done similar to minecraft limits and ed 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.530
 sharp andy why we can't 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.119
 a program two because enemies do not chart 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.810
 we know program in the description of 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.439
 this video network an average link not 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.670
 it would be exact new megaupload you 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.159
 will make this rar file download 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.399
 that you will put in our project e 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.659
 that you will use then as you see here is that 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:59.159
 not the scripts actually yes as you see 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:02.340
 these are the scripts for the for 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.340
 transform the world 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.539
 unfortunately I can't manage them 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.830
 anyway let's see immediately there 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.100
 even a ready-made scene 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.450
 exact pre done anyway then you can 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.050
 also see some 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.690
 tourists if they are interested in is to see a little 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.250
 as also the son of the mass is a 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 another moment is a very heavy thing 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.480
 for the computer as you see it binds us on 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.959
 our computer from which it entered 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.810
 compounds stabilizes already stabilized 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.530
 because it is an immense thing to do exact 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.720
 however, if you really care, I can 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.720
 make a guide on how to make a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.930
 loading screen then then 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.610
 you will see everything works more you 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.769
 you can change what you want as 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.340
 add a pickaxe with all the 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.209
 Various things 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.579
 here you see also a shitty noise like 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.299
 some parts with the nerve however this 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.980
 it is however a start that we live and 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.000
 you of course as much as feelings of 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 what you want 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.630
 if you ca n't do it then we are 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.650
 here on purpose 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.170
 ask in the comments and we will try 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.480
 we will try to please them 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.829
 so as you see the spam of the world is 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.019
 random 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.500
 unfortunately we can raise that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:27.920
 I show and apologize again for 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.400
 unfortunately this is not the case 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.680
 it is not possible to do it since there is not 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.959
 in our abilities and we will never be able to 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:43.349
 we do so sorry but unfortunately it is 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.569
 so good almost at the end of the world the 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.849
 throw it down was what you see anyway 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:53.510
 you can see that it is a very world 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:57.590
 big with hills with a ferlin 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.739
 a disturbance generation on the map of 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.329
 sperling that is what I said e 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.069
 also those trees so I would say that for 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.909
 this is everything here and see us in 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.599
 next one 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.599
 beautiful beautiful
