some<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:54.899> units<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.649> left<00:01:56.189> here

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
some more units here that I left here

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.649 
some more units here that I left here
and<00:01:56.549> there<00:01:56.700> around<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> map<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.509> need

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
and there around the map because I need

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389 
and there around the map because I need
everything<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.290> get<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:59.009> try<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> hold

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
everything I can get to try and hold

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.270 
everything I can get to try and hold
back<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.729> advance<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.750> main<00:02:01.590> base<00:02:01.920> goes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
back this advance but the main base goes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.149 
back this advance but the main base goes
down<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.850> once<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.180> base<00:02:03.420> goes<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:04.159> you've

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
down and once the base goes down you've

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.910 
down and once the base goes down you've
got<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> few<00:02:05.729> larvae<00:02:06.180> left<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.409> use

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
got a few larvae left that you can use

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.609 
got a few larvae left that you can use
to<00:02:08.009> spawn<00:02:08.490> some<00:02:09.000> last-ditch<00:02:09.690> effort<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> hold

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to spawn some last-ditch effort to hold

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.979 
to spawn some last-ditch effort to hold
out<00:02:10.770> as<00:02:10.920> long<00:02:10.950> as<00:02:11.130> possible<00:02:11.280> but<00:02:11.940> once<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
out as long as possible but once the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.479 
out as long as possible but once the
main<00:02:13.170> Hatcher<00:02:13.410> goes<00:02:13.680> down<00:02:13.890> that's<00:02:14.040> basically

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
main Hatcher goes down that's basically

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.100 
main Hatcher goes down that's basically
it<00:02:14.610> for<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.940> base<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.660> ran<00:02:15.900> into

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
it for that base and I just ran into

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410 
it for that base and I just ran into
some<00:02:16.410> mines<00:02:17.220> out<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.640> his<00:02:17.730> mind<00:02:17.880> filled<00:02:18.120> their

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
some mines out of his mind filled their

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380 
some mines out of his mind filled their
that<00:02:18.660> his<00:02:18.810> herds<00:02:19.170> born<00:02:19.410> his<00:02:20.250> hero<00:02:20.520> can<00:02:20.760> summon

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
that his herds born his hero can summon

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.260 
that his herds born his hero can summon
a<00:02:21.569> bunch<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.870> units<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:23.120> summon<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
a bunch of units it can summon a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.050 
a bunch of units it can summon a
defensive<00:02:24.690> drone<00:02:24.959> he<00:02:25.590> has<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.190> leadership<00:02:26.880> aura

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
defensive drone he has a leadership aura

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.720 
defensive drone he has a leadership aura
which<00:02:27.660> improves<00:02:28.110> his<00:02:28.440> attack<00:02:28.950> rate<00:02:29.250> movement

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
which improves his attack rate movement

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.280 
which improves his attack rate movement
speed<00:02:29.940> other<00:02:30.180> things<00:02:30.510> for<00:02:30.750> all<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> units<00:02:31.200> in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
speed other things for all the units in

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.850 
speed other things for all the units in
her<00:02:31.380> body<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:34.080> can<00:02:34.200> also<00:02:34.350> see<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
her body you can also see that the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.530 
her body you can also see that the
drones<00:02:35.130> up<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.489> top<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.819> going<00:02:36.030> crazy<00:02:36.269> now

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
drones up at the top are going crazy now

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.220 
drones up at the top are going crazy now
that<00:02:36.720> their<00:02:36.900> hatchery<00:02:37.319> has<00:02:37.470> been<00:02:37.590> destroyed

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
that their hatchery has been destroyed

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.840 
that their hatchery has been destroyed
and<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.440> now<00:02:40.620> I'm<00:02:40.769> managing<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.310> finally<00:02:41.670> take

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
and so now I'm managing to finally take

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.699 
and so now I'm managing to finally take
out<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.630> his<00:02:42.750> units<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.170> he's<00:02:43.319> wiped<00:02:43.590> out

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
out some of his units but he's wiped out

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.050 
out some of his units but he's wiped out
almost<00:02:43.920> everything's<00:02:44.489> I'm<00:02:44.670> going<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.970> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
almost everything's I'm going to the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.080 
almost everything's I'm going to the
next<00:02:45.239> base<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.870> chain<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:47.090> bringing

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
next base in the chain and bringing

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
next base in the chain and bringing
trying<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.510> desperately<00:02:48.750> bring<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.380> some

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
trying to desperately bring in some

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.500 
trying to desperately bring in some
reinforcements<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.370> hold<00:02:50.940> him<00:02:51.060> back<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.360> long

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
reinforcements to hold him back as long

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.420 
reinforcements to hold him back as long
as<00:02:51.630> possible<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:52.110> try<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.500> use<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> remaining

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
as possible to try and use the remaining

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.809 
as possible to try and use the remaining
base<00:02:53.730> defenses<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.360> my<00:02:54.480> advantage<00:02:55.069> but<00:02:56.069> he's

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
base defenses to my advantage but he's

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.460 
base defenses to my advantage but he's
just<00:02:57.090> completely<00:02:57.269> wiping<00:02:57.930> everything<00:02:58.080> out

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
just completely wiping everything out

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.140 
just completely wiping everything out
now<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:58.950> don't<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.340> any<00:02:59.459> more<00:02:59.640> larvae<00:03:00.060> at

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
now that I don't have any more larvae at

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.990 
now that I don't have any more larvae at
this<00:03:00.299> base<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:01.190> once<00:03:02.190> he<00:03:02.340> takes<00:03:02.519> out<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.760> last

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
this base and once he takes out the last

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.309 
this base and once he takes out the last
base<00:03:03.269> defender<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.769> will<00:03:04.920> now<00:03:05.040> flip<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:06.319> his

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
base defender it will now flip and his

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.530 
base defender it will now flip and his
faction<00:03:07.709> will<00:03:08.130> warp<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.000> take<00:03:09.239> control

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
faction will warp and and take control

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.259 
faction will warp and and take control
of<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.870> control<00:03:10.290> point<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.180> once<00:03:12.180> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
of this control point and once that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.560 
of this control point and once that
happens<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.930> gone<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.940> attackers<00:03:15.420> now

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
happens it's gone and the attackers now

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.599 
happens it's gone and the attackers now
move<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.170> next<00:03:16.200> base<00:03:16.530> which<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
move on to the next base which the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.720 
move on to the next base which the
defender<00:03:18.000> nails<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.390> defend
