you can watch that Lawrence move that in
the<00:04:29.520> video<00:04:29.759> but<00:04:30.150> next<00:04:30.690> thing<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:31.050> harming<00:04:31.380> a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
the video but next thing is harming a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.469 
the video but next thing is harming a
lot<00:04:31.560> i<00:04:31.770> watch<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.490> very<00:04:32.520> closely<00:04:32.849> when<00:04:33.240> he<00:04:33.330> goes

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
lot i watch it very closely when he goes

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.900 
lot i watch it very closely when he goes
into<00:04:33.630> armor<00:04:33.930> lock<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.560> see<00:04:34.830> he<00:04:35.190> gets<00:04:35.280> damaged

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
into armor lock you see he gets damaged

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.320 
into armor lock you see he gets damaged
and<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.570> he<00:04:36.720> loses<00:04:37.229> he<00:04:37.680> loses<00:04:37.949> the<00:04:38.039> energy<00:04:38.430> he

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
and like he loses he loses the energy he

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.409 
and like he loses he loses the energy he
lose<00:04:39.539> his<00:04:39.570> enemy<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:41.190> guess<00:04:42.030> when<00:04:42.240> you<00:04:42.300> get

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
lose his enemy so I guess when you get

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.529 
lose his enemy so I guess when you get
shot<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:42.930> a<00:04:43.020> better<00:04:43.259> grenade<00:04:43.590> by<00:04:43.860> armor<00:04:44.190> lock

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
shot like a better grenade by armor lock

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.100 
shot like a better grenade by armor lock
you<00:04:45.539> love<00:04:46.699> you<00:04:47.699> lose<00:04:47.910> energy<00:04:48.150> instead<00:04:48.990> of

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
you love you lose energy instead of

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.560 
you love you lose energy instead of
taking<00:04:49.410> damage<00:04:49.729> I'm<00:04:50.729> luck<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.120> still<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.479> it

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
already the maps they all have barians

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.550 
already the maps they all have barians
like<00:05:57.060> this<00:05:57.270> map<00:05:57.419> has<00:05:57.599> this<00:05:57.810> one<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.320> there's

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
like this map has this one and there's

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.709 
like this map has this one and there's
another<00:05:58.800> one<00:05:59.009> called<00:05:59.159> I<00:05:59.280> think<00:05:59.460> tennis<00:05:59.729> which

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
another one called I think tennis which

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.510 
another one called I think tennis which
is<00:06:00.900> just<00:06:01.080> like<00:06:01.199> more<00:06:01.680> tunnels<00:06:02.009> and<00:06:02.159> rooms<00:06:02.190> and
