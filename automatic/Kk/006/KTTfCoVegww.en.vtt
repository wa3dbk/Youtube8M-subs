it's pretty much just do it yourself
with<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.599> n<00:00:15.780> fix<00:00:16.080> because<00:00:16.410> they're<00:00:16.650> pretty<00:00:16.859> easy

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980

one<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.730> remember<00:00:39.000> correctly<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.760> think

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
one if I remember correctly and think

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.840 
one if I remember correctly and think
they're<00:00:42.000> eight<00:00:42.570> inch<00:00:43.170> npt<00:00:44.070> s<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> sandwich

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
they're eight inch npt s in the sandwich

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
they're eight inch npt s in the sandwich
plate<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.230> what<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> remember<00:00:46.770> was<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.280> couple

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
days ago that I ordered that so I'm just

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.930 
days ago that I ordered that so I'm just

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of fitting size make it yourself

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
of fitting size make it yourself
and<00:01:16.020> they're<00:01:16.409> not<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.220> expensive<00:01:17.460> not

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and they're not that expensive not

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
and they're not that expensive not
really<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.509> compared<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> buying<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
really not compared to buying the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.520 
really not compared to buying the
pre-made<00:01:19.850> anodized<00:01:20.850> am<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.960> side<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.350> whole

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pre-made anodized am one side this whole

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
pre-made anodized am one side this whole
lot<00:01:22.799> comes<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.670> 12<00:01:24.000> quid<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.540> that's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
lot comes to like 12 quid and that's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
lot comes to like 12 quid and that's
enough<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> make<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.770> meet<00:01:26.040> along<00:01:26.369> high

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
enough to make to meet along high

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
enough to make to meet along high
pressure<00:01:26.909> feeds<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.540> adapters<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.829> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
pressure feeds with adapters so it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.710 
pressure feeds with adapters so it's
relatively<00:01:29.909> inexpensive<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.600> they're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
relatively inexpensive and they're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.910 
relatively inexpensive and they're
literally<00:01:31.079> made<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> really<00:01:31.770> decent

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
literally made to a really decent

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.420 
literally made to a really decent
quality<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.780> probably<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:34.860> far<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
quality so it's probably the by far the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.570 
quality so it's probably the by far the
easiest<00:01:35.460> way<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.909> doing<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.990 

we<00:01:44.420> got<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:45.250> Alfie's<00:01:46.250> sorted<00:01:46.580> out<00:01:46.670> last<00:01:46.850> night

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
we got the Alfie's sorted out last night

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.900 
we got the Alfie's sorted out last night
I've<00:01:47.330> had<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.450> bit<00:01:47.600> of<00:01:47.630> a<00:01:47.690> hoo-hoo<00:01:48.320> them<00:01:48.590> due<00:01:48.860> to

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
I've had a bit of a hoo-hoo them due to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.580 
I've had a bit of a hoo-hoo them due to
space<00:01:49.910> restraints<00:01:50.630> basically<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.380> back

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
space restraints basically down the back

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.010 
space restraints basically down the back
so<00:01:52.220> I've<00:01:52.340> ended<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.670> bung<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.210> hole<00:01:53.360> down

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
so I've ended up bung in the hole down

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.220 
so I've ended up bung in the hole down
the<00:01:54.170> back<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:55.250> we've<00:01:55.400> taken<00:01:55.870> pair<00:01:56.870> of<00:01:56.960> feeds

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
the back and we've taken pair of feeds

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.480 
outside they filled with sound we'd have
just<00:02:01.280> made<00:02:01.430> up<00:02:01.580> two<00:02:02.170> hoses<00:02:03.170> come<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.100> pair

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
just made up two hoses come up to a pair

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.600 
just made up two hoses come up to a pair
of<00:02:04.640> 10<00:02:05.600> micron<00:02:05.930> filters<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.680> 30<00:02:07.010> micron<00:02:07.220> filter

sorry

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
sorry

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.700 
sorry
and<00:02:08.390> because<00:02:08.720> that's<00:02:08.900> actually<00:02:09.080> unfiltered

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.770 
and because that's actually unfiltered
on<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.890> outside<00:02:10.190> there<00:02:10.460> starts<00:02:11.420> growing<00:02:11.570> food

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
on the outside there starts growing food

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.750 
on the outside there starts growing food
per<00:02:12.020> if<00:02:12.110> it<00:02:12.230> was<00:02:12.350> there<00:02:12.620> then<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.550> straight

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
per if it was there then it's straight

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.520 
per if it was there then it's straight
into<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> big<00:02:14.240> turbo<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.080> around<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
into the big turbo there and around the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.850 
into the big turbo there and around the
back<00:02:15.680> into<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.280> taro<00:02:16.640> there<00:02:17.470> that's<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
back into that taro there that's the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.110 
back into that taro there that's the
easiest<00:02:19.100> way<00:02:19.280> I<00:02:19.310> did<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:19.790> made<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
easiest way I did it I just made the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.520 
easiest way I did it I just made the
hoses<00:02:20.360> up<00:02:20.480> myself<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.960> cut<00:02:21.140> into<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.380> right

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
hoses up myself to cut into the right

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.520 
hoses up myself to cut into the right
links<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.270> pretty<00:02:23.270> much<00:02:23.450> cost<00:02:24.080> exactly<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
links and pretty much cost exactly the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.930 
links and pretty much cost exactly the
same<00:02:24.740> as<00:02:24.860> getting<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.190> made<00:02:25.370> down<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.670> local

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
same as getting the made down the local

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
same as getting the made down the local
hydro<00:02:26.270> place<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.810> was<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.140> easier<00:02:27.380> way

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
hydro place so that was the easier way

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.530 
hydro place so that was the easier way
of<00:02:27.560> doing<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.920> I'm<00:02:28.910> just<00:02:29.120> working<00:02:29.420> on<00:02:29.480> some

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
of doing that I'm just working on some

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.840 
of doing that I'm just working on some
water<00:02:29.840> hoses<00:02:30.100> down<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.220> back<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.610> block

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
water hoses down the back of the block

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.220

for<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.150> heat<00:02:32.300> matrix<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.900> expansion

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
for the heat matrix and the expansion

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.610 
for the heat matrix and the expansion
tank<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:35.180> then<00:02:35.270> I've<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.690> sort<00:02:35.900> out<00:02:36.170> some

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.750 
and doing that pretty much because I'm
still<00:03:38.840> waiting<00:03:39.080> for<00:03:39.110> bits<00:03:39.489> we've<00:03:40.489> just<00:03:40.640> got

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
still waiting for bits we've just got

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.009 
still waiting for bits we've just got
this<00:03:40.850> side<00:03:41.120> jacked<00:03:41.390> up<00:03:41.570> now<00:03:41.720> ready<00:03:41.930> for

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
this side jacked up now ready for

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.420 
this side jacked up now ready for
hopefully<00:03:42.530> tomorrow

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
hopefully tomorrow

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.250 
hopefully tomorrow
I'm<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.180> get<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.329> new<00:03:44.480> lower<00:03:44.719> camber

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
I'm going to get a new lower camber

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.369 
I'm going to get a new lower camber
pulley<00:03:45.530> which<00:03:45.829> has<00:03:45.950> been<00:03:46.099> machined<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.640> me

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
pulley which has been machined for me

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.050 
pulley which has been machined for me
which<00:03:48.379> should<00:03:48.799> then<00:03:48.859> enable<00:03:49.400> me<00:03:49.519> to<00:03:49.549> put<00:03:49.969> the

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
which should then enable me to put the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.020 
which should then enable me to put the
camera<00:03:50.359> back<00:03:50.569> on<00:03:50.599> for<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.170> last<00:03:51.290> time<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.909> it

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
camera back on for the last time and it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.390 
camera back on for the last time and it
should<00:03:53.209> track<00:03:53.480> correctly<00:03:54.099> which<00:03:55.099> will<00:03:55.280> then

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
should track correctly which will then

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.220 
should track correctly which will then
mean<00:03:55.579> I<00:03:55.700> get<00:03:55.969> on<00:03:56.090> with<00:03:56.269> building<00:03:57.049> up<00:03:57.109> the

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
mean I get on with building up the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.679 
mean I get on with building up the
charger<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.060> sorting<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.180> left-hand<00:03:59.540> side

00:03:59.679 --> 00:03:59.689 
charger and sorting the left-hand side

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.000 
charger and sorting the left-hand side
of<00:03:59.719> the<00:03:59.840> motor<00:04:00.019> out<00:04:00.170> completely<00:04:00.560> so<00:04:00.829> I<00:04:00.859> can

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
of the motor out completely so I can

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.979 
of the motor out completely so I can
cover<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.280> all<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.849> then<00:04:01.930> really<00:04:02.930> just

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
cover it all in and then really just

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.300 
cover it all in and then really just
worry<00:04:03.290> about<00:04:03.319> what's<00:04:03.769> going<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:04.040> over<00:04:04.159> there

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
worry about what's going on over there

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.679 
worry about what's going on over there
but<00:04:04.609> I'm<00:04:04.730> reluctant<00:04:04.939> to<00:04:05.209> put<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.389> front<00:04:05.510> end

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
but I'm reluctant to put the front end

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.780 
but I'm reluctant to put the front end
on<00:04:05.900> until<00:04:06.769> I've<00:04:06.889> sorted<00:04:07.219> out<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> belts

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
on until I've sorted out the belts

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.000 
on until I've sorted out the belts
because<00:04:07.909> you<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.379> look<00:04:09.379> in<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.590> front<00:04:09.769> air

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
because you can look in the front air

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.770 
because you can look in the front air
and<00:04:10.159> line<00:04:10.519> everything<00:04:10.700> up<00:04:10.969> perfectly<00:04:11.389> at<00:04:11.689> the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
and line everything up perfectly at the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.300 
and line everything up perfectly at the
moment<00:04:12.079> whereas<00:04:12.590> when<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.769> Front's<00:04:13.099> on<00:04:13.189> you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
moment whereas when the Front's on you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.759 
moment whereas when the Front's on you
can't<00:04:13.489> do<00:04:13.579> bugger<00:04:13.790> all<00:04:13.969> say<00:04:14.239> once<00:04:15.170> once<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:15.620> got

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
can't do bugger all say once once I got

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.140 
can't do bugger all say once once I got
that<00:04:15.859> together<00:04:16.039> I<00:04:16.280> can<00:04:16.459> get<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.639> front<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:17.000> and

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
that together I can get the front on and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.400 
that together I can get the front on and
then<00:04:17.239> things<00:04:17.570> should<00:04:17.750> start<00:04:17.930> falling<00:04:18.169> into

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
then things should start falling into

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.360 
then things should start falling into
place<00:04:18.699> and<00:04:19.699> so<00:04:19.820> we<00:04:19.849> find<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> next<00:04:20.359> problem

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
place and so we find the next problem

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.770 
place and so we find the next problem
all<00:04:22.370> right<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.880> bit<00:04:23.000> of<00:04:23.210> work<00:04:23.330> on<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.539> car

I've just said take a supercharger off

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.900 
I've just said take a supercharger off
because<00:04:39.169> I'm<00:04:39.259> afraid<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.830> charge<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.820> I

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
because I'm afraid the charge that I

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.640 
because I'm afraid the charge that I
bought<00:04:41.150> on<00:04:41.180> eBay<00:04:41.360> about<00:04:41.810> four<00:04:42.020> months<00:04:42.169> ago<00:04:42.349> was

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
bought on eBay about four months ago was

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.010 
bought on eBay about four months ago was
shagged<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.880> inside<00:04:44.120> barons<00:04:44.479> are<00:04:44.599> gone<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.900> it

shagged the inside barons are gone on it

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.360 
shagged the inside barons are gone on it
obviously<00:04:45.349> didn't<00:04:45.620> know<00:04:45.650> that<00:04:45.919> until<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.250> ran

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
obviously didn't know that until I ran

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.670 
obviously didn't know that until I ran
it<00:04:46.520> out<00:04:46.610> for<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:46.849> first<00:04:47.030> time<00:04:47.199> so<00:04:48.199> I<00:04:48.440> said<00:04:48.590> to

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
it out for the first time so I said to

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.960 
it out for the first time so I said to
pull<00:04:48.860> wrap<00:04:49.010> back<00:04:49.190> off<00:04:49.370> again<00:04:49.490> though<00:04:49.760> in<00:04:49.880> the

pull wrap back off again though in the

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.140 
pull wrap back off again though in the
process<00:04:50.389> now<00:04:50.630> of<00:04:51.669> changing<00:04:52.669> that<00:04:52.789> round<00:04:53.030> to

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
process now of changing that round to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.200 
process now of changing that round to
another<00:04:53.449> one<00:04:53.630> which<00:04:54.530> is<00:04:54.560> hopefully<00:04:55.310> okay<00:04:55.880> it's

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
another one which is hopefully okay it's

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.040 
another one which is hopefully okay it's
not<00:04:56.360> brilliant<00:04:56.630> admit<00:04:57.169> any<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:57.500> some<00:04:59.050> better

not brilliant admit any but some better

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.629 
not brilliant admit any but some better
than<00:05:00.110> the<00:05:00.260> last<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.710> be<00:05:01.159> right

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639
