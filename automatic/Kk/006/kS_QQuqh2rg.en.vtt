and<00:02:24.050> don't<00:02:25.050> pull<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> way<00:02:25.650> through

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
and don't pull it all the way through

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.040 
and don't pull it all the way through
just<00:02:27.510> leave<00:02:27.690> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
just leave it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.050 
just leave it
so<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.440> halfway<00:02:28.620> through<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:29.940> we're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
so it's halfway through and then we're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.910 
so it's halfway through and then we're
going<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.210> spread<00:02:30.570> our<00:02:30.750> ribbons<00:02:31.140> around<00:02:31.320> until

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
going to spread our ribbons around until

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:42.400 
going to spread our ribbons around until
it's<00:02:32.160> even

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.790 

and<00:02:42.530> then<00:02:43.040> if<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.400> need<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.790> you<00:02:44.420> can<00:02:44.770> take<00:02:45.770> a

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
and then if you need to you can take a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.410 
and then if you need to you can take a
double<00:02:46.220> prawn<00:02:46.520> clip<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:49.340> hold<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.150> hold

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
double prawn clip and and hold it hold

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.820 
double prawn clip and and hold it hold
the<00:02:51.610> whatever<00:02:52.610> shape<00:02:53.000> that<00:02:53.180> you've<00:02:53.300> made<00:02:53.830> but

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the whatever shape that you've made but

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.960 
the whatever shape that you've made but
I'm<00:02:54.980> not<00:02:55.100> going<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.370> use<00:02:55.520> that<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:55.820> it's

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
I'm not going to use that but it's

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.590 
I'm not going to use that but it's
definitely<00:02:56.410> great<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.470> use<00:02:57.770> if<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.160> need<00:02:58.190> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
definitely great to use if you need to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.990 
definitely great to use if you need to
we're<00:02:59.600> going<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> take<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.500> ribbon<00:03:01.310> end<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
we're going to take the ribbon end and

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.390 
we're going to take the ribbon end and
loop<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.750> onto<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.200> needle<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> said

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
loop it onto the needle so like I said

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.890 
loop it onto the needle so like I said
I'm<00:03:04.610> going<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.790> do<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> figure<00:03:05.360> eight<00:03:05.570> fold

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I'm going to do the figure eight fold

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:13.330 
I'm going to do the figure eight fold
here

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.790 

so<00:03:13.790> do<00:03:14.599> the<00:03:14.720> next<00:03:14.900> ribbon<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.349> then<00:03:15.410> can<00:03:15.620> just

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
so do the next ribbon and then can just

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.589 
so do the next ribbon and then can just
continue<00:03:16.220> doing<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.760> until<00:03:16.940> all<00:03:17.120> your<00:03:17.270> ribbons

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
continue doing it until all your ribbons

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:35.000 
continue doing it until all your ribbons
are<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.110> needle

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.720 

okay<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.750> may<00:03:36.900> need<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.310> reshape<00:03:38.310> some<00:03:38.610> of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
okay and you may need to reshape some of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.929 
okay and you may need to reshape some of
the<00:03:38.939> the<00:03:39.420> loops<00:03:39.659> when<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.260> get<00:03:40.379> to<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.620> end

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:40.939 
the the loops when you get to the end

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.610 
the the loops when you get to the end
just<00:03:41.939> to<00:03:42.030> make<00:03:42.120> sure<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:42.900> how<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.319> want

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
just to make sure that it's how you want

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.860 
just to make sure that it's how you want
it<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.180> when<00:03:45.299> you're<00:03:45.420> ready<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.720> go

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
it and then when you're ready to go

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.460 
it and then when you're ready to go
through<00:03:46.140> go<00:03:46.680> ahead<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.980> pull<00:03:47.189> your<00:03:48.470> needle

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
through go ahead and pull your needle

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.979 
through go ahead and pull your needle
and<00:03:49.799> thread<00:03:49.890> through<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.810> then<00:03:51.810> we're<00:03:51.900> going

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
and thread through and then we're going

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:59.370 
and thread through and then we're going
to<00:03:52.110> stitch<00:03:52.379> it<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.590> few<00:03:52.799> times

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.170 

and<00:03:59.470> if<00:04:00.010> it's<00:04:00.160> hard<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.460> pull<00:04:00.670> through<00:04:00.880> you<00:04:01.000> can

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
and if it's hard to pull through you can

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.330 
and if it's hard to pull through you can
just<00:04:01.330> do<00:04:01.420> something<00:04:01.630> hard<00:04:01.990> like<00:04:02.050> like<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.100> tip

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
just do something hard like like the tip

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.440 
just do something hard like like the tip
your<00:04:03.550> table<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.630> push<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:04.990> through<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.180> you're

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
your table to push it through and you're

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.180 
your table to push it through and you're
done<00:04:07.780> with<00:04:08.170> your<00:04:08.350> first<00:04:08.740> layer

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.640 

okay<00:04:14.850> now<00:04:15.060> just<00:04:15.510> do<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.840> same<00:04:16.050> thing<00:04:16.350> with

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
okay now just do the same thing with

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.960 
okay now just do the same thing with
your<00:04:16.800> next<00:04:17.160> layer<00:04:19.550> okay<00:04:20.550> and<00:04:20.730> then<00:04:20.820> you're

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
your next layer okay and then you're

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.440 
your next layer okay and then you're
done<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.330> your<00:04:21.540> your<00:04:21.989> next<00:04:22.200> layer<00:04:23.330> now<00:04:24.330> we're

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
done with your your next layer now we're

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.840 
done with your your next layer now we're
going<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.600> put<00:04:24.780> them<00:04:24.870> together<00:04:25.730> you're<00:04:26.730> going

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
going to put them together you're going

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.030 
going to put them together you're going
to<00:04:26.910> want<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.120> use<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.870> back<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.560> bow<00:04:28.710> at

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
to want to use the back of the bow at

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.700 
to want to use the back of the bow at
the<00:04:29.700> top<00:04:30.060> so<00:04:30.450> there<00:04:30.660> will<00:04:30.720> be<00:04:30.780> no<00:04:30.990> end<00:04:31.170> showing

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
the top so there will be no end showing

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.140 
the top so there will be no end showing
but<00:04:32.490> if<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:35.130> have<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.460> use<00:04:35.670> the<00:04:35.970> back<00:04:36.120> of

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
but if you you have to use the back of

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.030 
but if you you have to use the back of
it<00:04:36.420> it<00:04:36.780> doesn't<00:04:36.990> really<00:04:37.110> matter<00:04:37.410> because<00:04:37.830> if

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
it it doesn't really matter because if

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.260 
it it doesn't really matter because if
your<00:04:38.160> Center<00:04:38.400> is<00:04:38.430> big<00:04:38.610> enough<00:04:38.790> it<00:04:38.910> will<00:04:39.030> cover

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
your Center is big enough it will cover

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.450 
your Center is big enough it will cover
the<00:04:39.510> ends<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.930> ribbon<00:04:40.130> so<00:04:41.130> we're<00:04:41.310> going<00:04:41.400> to

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
the ends of the ribbon so we're going to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.430 
the ends of the ribbon so we're going to
take<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:42.120> bottom<00:04:42.720> layer<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.080> top<00:04:43.260> layer

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
take the bottom layer in the top layer

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.330 
take the bottom layer in the top layer
and<00:04:43.590> we're<00:04:43.710> going<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.860> glue<00:04:44.070> them<00:04:44.190> together

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
and we're going to glue them together

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:54.309 
and we're going to glue them together
with<00:04:44.670> hot<00:04:44.850> glue

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.579 

then<00:04:54.919> now<00:04:55.689> you're<00:04:56.689> ready<00:04:56.839> to<00:04:56.930> put<00:04:57.139> your<00:04:57.229> Center

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:57.589 
then now you're ready to put your Center

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.619 
then now you're ready to put your Center
on<00:04:57.770> you're<00:04:58.669> just<00:04:58.849> going<00:04:59.029> to<00:04:59.059> add<00:04:59.240> some<00:04:59.509> hot

on you're just going to add some hot
glue<00:04:59.779> on<00:04:59.839> the<00:04:59.930> back<00:05:00.080> of<00:05:00.110> my<00:05:00.349> resin

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.780 

just<00:05:09.090> add<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.630> center

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.360
