do click these bad boys in tighten them
up<00:01:56.380> and<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.890> does<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.190> solidifies

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
up and what that does that solidifies

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.430 
up and what that does that solidifies
the<00:01:58.150> shape<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.570> tent<00:01:58.780> which<00:01:59.080> gives<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.380> a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
the shape of the tent which gives it a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.820 
the shape of the tent which gives it a
lot<00:01:59.560> more<00:01:59.620> structure<00:02:00.159> obviously<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:02.170> quite

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
lot more structure obviously it's quite

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.310 
lot more structure obviously it's quite
small<00:02:03.220> in<00:02:03.430> here<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> ventilation<00:02:04.780> really

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
small in here so the ventilation really

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.920 
small in here so the ventilation really
is<00:02:05.500> key<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.310> important<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.210> working<00:02:07.720> with

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
is key and important so working with

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.479
