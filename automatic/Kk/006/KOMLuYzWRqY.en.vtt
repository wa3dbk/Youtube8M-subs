Assassin's<00:00:23.570> Creed<00:00:23.750> has<00:00:23.779> been<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.099> env3<00:00:25.099> since

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.249 
Assassin's Creed has been a env3 since
the<00:00:25.670> beginning<00:00:26.029> so<00:00:26.240> we<00:00:26.420> know<00:00:26.630> how<00:00:26.840> to<00:00:26.900> develop

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
the beginning so we know how to develop

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.409 
the beginning so we know how to develop
for<00:00:27.710> ps3<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.699> now<00:00:28.820> we're<00:00:29.000> really<00:00:29.240> enjoying

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:29.419 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.540 
for ps3 but now we're really enjoying
developing<00:00:30.050> for<00:00:30.199> ps4<00:00:30.680> first<00:00:31.130> thing<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.489> is

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
developing for ps4 first thing that is

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.860 
developing for ps4 first thing that is
going<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:31.759> change<00:00:31.939> drastically<00:00:32.270> as<00:00:32.750> the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
going to change drastically as the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.080 
going to change drastically as the
graphics<00:00:33.320> because<00:00:33.920> we<00:00:34.220> think<00:00:34.399> that<00:00:34.489> visually

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
graphics because we think that visually

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.780 
graphics because we think that visually
with<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.420> stronger<00:00:36.079> GPU<00:00:36.500> stronger<00:00:36.920> cpu<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.460> lot

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
with the stronger GPU stronger cpu a lot

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.430 
with the stronger GPU stronger cpu a lot
of<00:00:37.910> ram<00:00:38.120> we're<00:00:38.480> going<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:38.660> be<00:00:38.780> able<00:00:38.900> to<00:00:39.140> exploit

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
of ram we're going to be able to exploit

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.710 
of ram we're going to be able to exploit
a<00:00:39.739> lot<00:00:40.010> discounsel<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.820> push<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.180> bar<00:00:41.360> visual

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
a lot discounsel and push the bar visual

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.840 
a lot discounsel and push the bar visual
it's<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.170> lot<00:00:42.350> more<00:00:42.559> intuitive<00:00:42.920> for<00:00:43.339> engineers

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.880 
it's a lot more intuitive for engineers
it's<00:00:44.150> a<00:00:44.210> lot<00:00:44.360> more<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:44.839> compute<00:00:45.500> shaders

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
it's a lot more like compute shaders

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.100 
it's a lot more like compute shaders
that<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.190> add<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.610> put<00:00:46.850> them<00:00:47.030> on<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.360> ps4<00:00:47.629> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.350 
that we add and put them on the ps4 and
all<00:00:48.980> these<00:00:49.220> new<00:00:49.550> texts<00:00:49.909> that<00:00:50.000> we're<00:00:50.089> pushing

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
all these new texts that we're pushing

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.340 
all these new texts that we're pushing
are<00:00:50.780> natively<00:00:51.680> fitting<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.370> ps4<00:00:53.350> all

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.830 
are natively fitting in the ps4 all
little<00:00:54.920> details<00:00:55.370> that<00:00:55.520> you<00:00:55.940> cannot<00:00:56.270> right<00:00:56.600> now

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
little details that you cannot right now

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.420 
little details that you cannot right now
put<00:00:57.379> on<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.710> current<00:00:57.980> generation<00:00:58.039> of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
put on the current generation of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.400 
put on the current generation of
consoles<00:00:58.789> because<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.719> council<00:01:00.109> is<00:01:00.199> being

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
consoles because the council is being

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.930 
consoles because the council is being
fully<00:01:00.920> like<00:01:01.160> it's<00:01:01.340> running<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.640> hundred

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
fully like it's running a hundred

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.270 
fully like it's running a hundred
percent<00:01:02.059> right<00:01:02.300> now<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.559> cannot<00:01:03.769> add<00:01:04.009> all

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
percent right now so you cannot add all

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.710 
percent right now so you cannot add all
these<00:01:04.519> little<00:01:04.729> details<00:01:04.970> that<00:01:05.390> are<00:01:05.570> going<00:01:05.660> to

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
these little details that are going to

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.270 
these little details that are going to
make<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.020> game<00:01:06.170> even<00:01:06.350> more<00:01:06.500> beautiful<00:01:06.860> more

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
make the game even more beautiful more

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.330 
make the game even more beautiful more
immersive<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.600> overall<00:01:09.140> ps4<00:01:09.860> experience

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
immersive the overall ps4 experience

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.950 
immersive the overall ps4 experience
that<00:01:10.520> make<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.940> game<00:01:11.119> look<00:01:11.149> so<00:01:11.630> much<00:01:11.750> better

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
that make the game look so much better

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.710 
that make the game look so much better
on<00:01:12.259> ps4<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:13.220> think<00:01:13.759> definitely<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.479> share

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
on ps4 I think definitely the share

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.150 
on ps4 I think definitely the share
button<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.200> something<00:01:15.590> really<00:01:15.740> really<00:01:15.979> cool

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
button is something really really cool

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.510 
button is something really really cool
because<00:01:16.789> now<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.360> will<00:01:17.619> allow<00:01:18.619> us<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.860> keep<00:01:19.399> the

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
because now it will allow us to keep the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.070 
because now it will allow us to keep the
single-player<00:01:19.940> experience<00:01:20.119> but<00:01:20.869> make<00:01:21.050> it

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
single-player experience but make it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.560 
single-player experience but make it
connected<00:01:21.710> trying<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.310> blend<00:01:22.940> more<00:01:23.390> together

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
connected trying to blend more together

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.180 
connected trying to blend more together
like<00:01:23.990> your<00:01:24.140> friends<00:01:24.470> are<00:01:24.560> still<00:01:24.740> there<00:01:24.800> even

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
like your friends are still there even

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.710 
like your friends are still there even
if<00:01:25.460> you're<00:01:25.610> playing<00:01:25.759> in<00:01:25.970> single-player<00:01:26.390> you

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
if you're playing in single-player you

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.609 
if you're playing in single-player you
don't<00:01:26.900> necessarily<00:01:27.229> want<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.500> play

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
don't necessarily want to play

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.230 
don't necessarily want to play
multiplayer<00:01:27.950> don't<00:01:28.340> necessarily<00:01:28.700> wanna<00:01:28.970> like

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
multiplayer don't necessarily wanna like

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.990 
multiplayer don't necessarily wanna like
fight<00:01:29.689> against<00:01:29.990> another<00:01:30.290> player<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.000> then

fight against another player and then

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.100

we're<00:01:32.180> also<00:01:32.329> going<00:01:32.600> to<00:01:32.659> add<00:01:32.780> like<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
we're also going to add like the

we're also going to add like the
companion<00:01:33.650> gaming<00:01:34.070> so<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:34.729> going<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.030> be<00:01:35.150> a

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
companion gaming so it's going to be a

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.749 
companion gaming so it's going to be a
nice<00:01:35.600> evolution<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:36.500> terms<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.460> gaming

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
nice evolution in terms of the gaming

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.550 
nice evolution in terms of the gaming
world<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.509> assassins<00:01:38.930> creed<00:01:39.079> 4<00:01:39.140> black<00:01:39.350> flag

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
seamless boarding so right now you're

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
seamless boarding so right now you're
going<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.200> sea<00:01:57.469> you're<00:01:58.070> seeing<00:01:58.490> another
