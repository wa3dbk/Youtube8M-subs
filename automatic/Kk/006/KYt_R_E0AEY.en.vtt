00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.600
 pink tool for which the first thing 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.270
 we have to do as long as 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.020

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.940
 We are protected by excess water 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:42.700
 to cool down when we go to squeeze 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.700
 and even perfect 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.159
 we are in excess water suns and 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.359
 we add ice to the top 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.359
 upwards 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:04.710

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.240
 do not worry about the pink pepper 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.250

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.640
