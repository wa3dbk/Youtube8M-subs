is a downloading to my website and

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.630 
is a downloading to my website and
here's<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> arm<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.400> enter<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
here's the arm we have to enter the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.599 
here's the arm we have to enter the
password<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.449> readme<00:00:18.660> file<00:00:19.609> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
password it's in the readme file and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
password it's in the readme file and
once<00:00:20.820> she<00:00:20.939> went<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.240> password<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.960> so

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
once she went to the password I so

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:32.190 
once she went to the password I so
accept<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> terms<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.279> conditions

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.380 

and<00:00:32.710> here<00:00:32.950> we<00:00:32.980> go<00:00:33.070> persons<00:00:33.790> off<00:00:33.910> our<00:00:34.120> medium

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
and here we go persons off our medium

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.290 
and here we go persons off our medium
SAT<00:00:34.780> up<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:36.010> click<00:00:36.250> setup<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.910> then<00:00:37.000> open<00:00:37.270> your

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
SAT up so click setup and then open your

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.720 
SAT up so click setup and then open your
program<00:00:37.720> files<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:39.160> makes<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.490> a<00:00:39.580> bit<00:00:39.700> easier

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
program files just makes it a bit easier

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.280 
program files just makes it a bit easier
fuel<00:00:41.610> try<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.670> move<00:00:42.970> me<00:00:43.030> file<00:00:43.420> into<00:00:43.900> her<00:00:46.290> and

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
fuel try to move me file into her and

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.490 
fuel try to move me file into her and
that's<00:00:47.560> just<00:00:47.800> so<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.400> program<00:00:48.730> can<00:00:48.910> find<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
that's just so the program can find the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.620 
that's just so the program can find the
program's<00:00:50.860> inside<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.309> move<00:00:51.460> me<00:00:51.580> far<00:00:51.790> as<00:00:52.480> you

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
program's inside to move me far as you

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.940 
program's inside to move me far as you
can<00:00:52.750> see<00:00:52.870> I've<00:00:52.960> already<00:00:53.080> got<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.500> i'm<00:00:53.650> not<00:00:53.770> very

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
can see I've already got it i'm not very

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:04.979 
can see I've already got it i'm not very
writer<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> setup<00:00:56.230> done

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.500 

here's<00:01:05.590> a<00:01:05.680> few<00:01:05.860> themes

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
here's a few themes

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.600 
here's a few themes
I<00:01:07.570> kind<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.680> designed<00:01:08.980> the<00:01:09.070> program<00:01:09.190> around

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
I kind of designed the program around

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.610 
I kind of designed the program around
schools<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:10.750> they<00:01:10.780> don't<00:01:11.080> turn<00:01:11.320> on<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
schools so they don't turn on the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.960 
schools so they don't turn on the
program<00:01:11.920> doesn't<00:01:12.100> come<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.430> in<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.610> taskbar

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
program doesn't come up in the taskbar

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
program doesn't come up in the taskbar
and<00:01:13.390> there's<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.230> hide<00:01:14.440> button<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.670> shown

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.350 

so<00:04:07.159> you<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.370> use<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:07.940> on<00:04:08.120> IP

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
so you can use this to get on IP

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.410 
so you can use this to get on IP
addresses<00:04:08.930> or<00:04:09.760> passwords<00:04:10.760> for<00:04:10.909> the<00:04:11.030> Wi-Fi
