00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
requested tutorial and it is how to do

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680 
requested tutorial and it is how to do
the<00:00:10.830> two<00:00:11.250> strand<00:00:11.490> twist<00:00:11.759> on<00:00:12.000> marley<00:00:12.389> twists

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
the two strand twist on marley twists

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.079 
the two strand twist on marley twists
and<00:00:13.009> have<00:00:14.009> them<00:00:14.219> sit<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.700> very<00:00:14.880> long<00:00:15.059> time

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
and have them sit for a very long time

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.290 
and have them sit for a very long time
without<00:00:15.509> unraveling<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.800> i<00:00:17.670> have<00:00:18.029> two

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
without unraveling and i have two

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.580 
without unraveling and i have two
techniques<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.869> i'm<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.320> show<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
techniques that i'm going to show you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.160 
techniques that i'm going to show you
and<00:00:20.010> they're<00:00:20.130> very<00:00:20.340> simple<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.170> illuminating

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and they're very simple and illuminating

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.380 
and they're very simple and illuminating
would<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.680> black<00:00:23.070> rubber<00:00:23.430> band<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> pull<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
would be a black rubber band to pull the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.460 
would be a black rubber band to pull the
ends<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.840> your<00:00:24.869> hair

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
ends of your hair

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.490 
ends of your hair
all<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.300> Pringles<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.230> may

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
all right here is Pringles so you may

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380 
all right here is Pringles so you may
not<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.189> effect<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.939> style<00:00:30.269> very

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
not see the effect of the style very

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.659 
not see the effect of the style very
well<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.320> i'll<00:00:31.439> definitely<00:00:31.560> go<00:00:32.009> ahead<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
well but i'll definitely go ahead and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.540 
well but i'll definitely go ahead and
show<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
show it to you what you want to do is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.600 
show it to you what you want to do is
the<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:36.000> tape<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:37.739> i'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> take<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the first tape and i'm going to take a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.950 
the first tape and i'm going to take a
huge<00:00:39.030> chunk<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.840> hair

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.200 

and<00:00:45.050> make<00:00:46.010> sure<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.430> you<00:00:48.610> know<00:00:49.610> marking

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
and make sure that you know marking

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.700 
and make sure that you know marking
they're<00:00:50.360> coming<00:00:50.750> in<00:00:50.810> here<00:00:51.020> so<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.260> there<00:00:51.590> is

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
they're coming in here so that there is

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.350 
they're coming in here so that there is
no<00:00:52.270> tangle<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.820> then<00:00:55.820> you're<00:00:56.030> going<00:00:56.210> to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
no tangle and then you're going to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.740 
no tangle and then you're going to
separate<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:57.020> in<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.680> make<00:00:58.310> this<00:00:58.670> now<00:00:59.540> what

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
separate it in to make this now what

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.810 
separate it in to make this now what
you're<00:00:59.900> going<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:00.560> is<00:01:00.890> you're<00:01:01.520> going<00:01:01.700> to

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.090 
you're going to do is you're going to
twist<00:01:02.239> each<00:01:02.660> section<00:01:03.129> like<00:01:04.129> this<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.830> stop

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
twist each section like this and to stop

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.120 
twist each section like this and to stop
one<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.490> here<00:01:07.610> over<00:01:07.910> this<00:01:08.060> opposite<00:01:08.690> direction

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.310 

next<00:01:16.000> what<00:01:16.180> we're<00:01:16.360> going<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.630> do<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:17.050> take

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
next what we're going to do is to take

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.610 
next what we're going to do is to take
the<00:01:17.560> hair<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:18.340> wrap<00:01:18.850> them<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:20.229> each

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
the hair and just wrap them around each

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.520 
the hair and just wrap them around each
other

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.390 

and<00:01:29.650> at<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.729> end<00:01:31.409> secure<00:01:32.409> with<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.190> on

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
and at the end secure with you on

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.990 
and at the end secure with you on
Bourbon<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:37.330> will<00:01:37.540> not<00:01:37.780> go<00:01:37.990> anywhere<00:01:39.000> so

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
Bourbon well it will not go anywhere so

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.400 
Bourbon well it will not go anywhere so
I'll<00:01:40.150> come<00:01:40.360> closer<00:01:40.690> for<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.380> see

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.500 

it<00:01:46.410> will<00:01:46.650> not<00:01:46.920> move<00:01:47.190> we<00:01:47.580> are<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.090> move<00:01:48.300> on

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
it will not move we are going to move on

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.010 
it will not move we are going to move on
to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> second<00:01:49.700> technique<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.510> one<00:01:51.720> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to the second technique so this one is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.590 
to the second technique so this one is
if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.620> have<00:01:53.190> already<00:01:53.520> mastered<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.330> first

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
if you have already mastered the first

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
if you have already mastered the first
one<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.410> this<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.980> be<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.160> little<00:01:56.370> easier

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
one then this will be a little easier

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.210 
one then this will be a little easier
for<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.690> same<00:01:57.930> thing<00:01:58.290> take<00:01:58.650> a<00:01:58.680> chunk<00:01:58.980> up

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
for you the same thing take a chunk up

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.050 
for you the same thing take a chunk up
here<00:01:59.610> finger<00:02:00.600> comb<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.370> separate<00:02:02.370> it<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.670> two

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
here finger comb it separate it in two

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.420 
here finger comb it separate it in two
and<00:02:03.480> then<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.410> you're<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.190> is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
and then what you're going to do is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.719 
and then what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:06.000> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.330> twist<00:02:06.870> as<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.980> along<00:02:08.220> so

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you're going to twist as you go along so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.980 
you're going to twist as you go along so
if<00:02:09.180> you<00:02:09.300> notice<00:02:09.690> I'm<00:02:09.899> giving<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.500> twisting

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
if you notice I'm giving it a twisting

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:28.300 
if you notice I'm giving it a twisting
motion

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.960 

and<00:02:28.930> securities

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.140 

and<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.020> notice<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:36.160> will<00:02:36.400> not<00:02:36.640> unwrap<00:02:37.120> it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
and if you notice it will not unwrap it

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.720 
and if you notice it will not unwrap it
so<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.890> those<00:02:39.190> are<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> two

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
so this is all those are the two

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
so this is all those are the two
techniques<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.270> I<00:02:40.420> use<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.140> mainly<00:02:41.380> use

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
techniques that I use and I mainly use

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.250 
techniques that I use and I mainly use
the<00:02:41.680> second<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.280> because<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:42.970> faster<00:02:43.660> for

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the second one because it's faster for

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.890
