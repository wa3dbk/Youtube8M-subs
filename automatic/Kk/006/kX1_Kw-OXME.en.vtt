00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
a few reasons number one the deck does

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.109 
a few reasons number one the deck does
not<00:00:27.510> require<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.289> setup<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.670> take<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
not require a setup so you can take the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.209 
not require a setup so you can take the
deck<00:00:30.420> wherever<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.929> are<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.410> pull<00:00:31.619> out<00:00:31.800> four

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
random cards he's using the four Queens

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.389 
random cards he's using the four Queens
and<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.870> slides<00:00:37.170> are<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.160> difficult

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and to the slides are not that difficult

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
and to the slides are not that difficult
so<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.570> thing<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.899> need<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
so the first thing you need to do is

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.860 
so the first thing you need to do is
make<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> break<00:00:40.920> under<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.550> top<00:00:42.120> card<00:00:42.450> with<00:00:42.750> the

make a break under the top card with the
cards<00:00:43.140> face<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.100> we're<00:00:44.219> making<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.520> break

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
cards face up so we're making a break

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
cards face up so we're making a break
right<00:00:45.000> underneath<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.480> two<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> spades

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that are one up one down then he

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
that are one up one down then he
shuffles<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> cards<00:01:41.340> together<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.899> it<00:01:45.899> looks

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like everything is all mixed up then he

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
like everything is all mixed up then he
picks<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.259> cards<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.680> he<00:01:49.799> says<00:01:50.070> let's
