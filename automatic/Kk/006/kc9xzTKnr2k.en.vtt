00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.680
 or 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.840
 Yes 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.320
 I decided to do a little supplement 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.720
 video compared to my article I the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.070
 call damman I wanted what at 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.529
 moment of a little bit the different 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.000
 sounds because often I heard a 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.590
 person or stand such as 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.730
 bigger misunderstanding had all the time 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.559
 a snap a little bit empty at 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.650
 hunters it was said that every time 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.680
 but there is a time of a big market or 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.570
 a sense a little like that I decided 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.949
 to go deep into this I talked about 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 with several guides I did a little 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:52.010
 of tea in the field then I came 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.420
 with a conclusion enough but the crowd 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.110
 was if we were really telling 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.030
 members have a man of language 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.129
 the lover pruning to have family 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.189
 you will see a first video clip 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.170
 I showed you for a small world that 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.549
 speak with a moment so he wants him 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.490
 use a really aggressive sound that's 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.320
 really to think that it's just the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.270
 big members who will snap or go 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 have a concert reef victims they 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.869
 can do it as well they will 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.280
 often make a dug or what 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.570
 really answers the surroundings what 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.520
 is that a network that will feel 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 to dominate what you wish him regressed 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.910
 of the hand that I leave you with this 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 little word the blow was there we want 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:34.390
 we clearly hear or or 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 or 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:54.440
 ouh ouh ouh ouh ouh the brazza le 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.890
 next video clip is going quite 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.600
 contrary to the norms 5 if that was the 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.950
 see him this theme in batches I was doing 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.050
 just female calls in when 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490
 he was answering using a sound for 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.170
 to seduce is really a punch 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.830
 commenting like the little marc we come 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.220
 see before 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.270
 it's going to be a show where everything its purpose 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.680
 it's to seduce the window 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.150
 that's why I'm in 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.430
 the Arctic times we wind up 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 who we are here we imitate a dead person who is 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.700
 aggressive is not necessarily everything 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.160
 time the best thing because 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.320
 to seduce a female or just to 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.030
 attract especially if we say right away 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.800
 we are a vicky sailor and bewitch the air 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.690
 of the water is not your best 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.550
 thing so we evoke this video you 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.550
 go see a bowl with a sweet sound 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.769
 oh oh uh 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.400
 I hope this little piece of video 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.890
 the shelter of a little bit to better understand 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.000
 the language of moose is surprising 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.550
 using techniques 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.410
 different as much as we can go with 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.630
 rock line with female sounds the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.470
 polled are wrong you are going to have some 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.450
 different answers 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.980
 try the only terrain you will see 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.810
 sometimes our organs are usual 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.760
 same routine that it can be 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.200
 precisely times do them do them 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.030
 go out or get them moving 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.500
 or just make us a center that we 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.180
 say who can we allow children 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.920
 to go to him or the next 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.410
 so here I wish you a 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.880
 good hunting season then I you 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.590
