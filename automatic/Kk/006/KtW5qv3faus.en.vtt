all<00:00:02.760> right<00:00:02.909> guys<00:00:03.149> this<00:00:03.899> is<00:00:04.020> good<00:00:04.170> videos<00:00:04.620> going

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
all right guys this is good videos going

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.860 
all right guys this is good videos going
to<00:00:04.890> be<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.490> thermal<00:00:05.819> cycling<00:00:06.240> concept

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to be about the thermal cycling concept

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990 
to be about the thermal cycling concept
and<00:00:07.379> some<00:00:07.830> mistakes<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.400> made<00:00:08.730> some

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
and some mistakes that I made some

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.759 
and some mistakes that I made some
things<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.360> I've<00:00:09.480> learned<00:00:09.690> while<00:00:10.440> building

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
things that I've learned while building

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.100 
things that I've learned while building
the<00:00:11.070> thermal<00:00:11.309> scoffing<00:00:11.550> rocket<00:00:12.090> stove<00:00:12.300> it's

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
the thermal scoffing rocket stove it's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.570 
the thermal scoffing rocket stove it's
also<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.860> be<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.160> water

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
also going to be about water

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390 
also going to be about water
stratification<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> be

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
stratification so I'm going to be

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.740 
stratification so I'm going to be
adjusting<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> camera<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> little<00:00:18.359> bit<00:00:18.570> here

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
adjusting the camera a little bit here

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630 
adjusting the camera a little bit here
so<00:00:18.779> zooming<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:19.949> sand<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.490> my

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
so zooming in sand you can see my

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.480 
so zooming in sand you can see my
details<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.240> little<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.750> go<00:00:21.990> over<00:00:22.289> this

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
details a little so we can go over this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.980 
details a little so we can go over this
alright<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:24.300> thing<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.600> want<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.840> show

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
alright so first thing I want to show

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.290 
alright so first thing I want to show
you<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.039> want<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> show<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:26.910> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
you is is I want to show you how I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.620 
you is is I want to show you how I
actually<00:00:28.019> did<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> rocket<00:00:29.640> stove<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.269> that's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
actually did the rocket stove and that's

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080 
actually did the rocket stove and that's
going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.349> detail<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.040> there<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.850> a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
going to be that detail right there at a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.979 
going to be that detail right there at a
and<00:00:33.300> B<00:00:33.360> detail<00:00:33.930> right<00:00:34.140> here<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:36.390> what<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> did<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
and B detail right here so what I did is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.040 
and B detail right here so what I did is
I<00:00:37.079> came<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.680> 16<00:00:38.129> inches<00:00:38.460> here<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I came up about 16 inches here and I

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.369 
I came up about 16 inches here and I
went<00:00:40.320> over<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.649> my<00:00:40.950> coil<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.079> as

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
went over to my coil here right and as

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.639 
went over to my coil here right and as
my<00:00:43.590> coil<00:00:43.829> turned<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.430> into<00:00:44.719> pressure<00:00:45.719> from

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
my coil turned it into pressure from

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
my coil turned it into pressure from
boiling<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> water<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.730> making<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> vapor<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
boiling the water and making a vapor and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
boiling the water and making a vapor and
it'll<00:00:48.780> push<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.039> returns<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
it'll push it up and then returns it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.470 
it'll push it up and then returns it
back<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:51.920> when<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> did<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.820> wasn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
back here when I did that I wasn't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
back here when I did that I wasn't
thinking<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.050> heat<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.649> thinking<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thinking of my heat I was thinking of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.670 
thinking of my heat I was thinking of
the<00:00:56.489> loop<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.870> revolve<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.500> loop

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the loop and get it to revolve the loop

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.580 
the loop and get it to revolve the loop
and<00:00:58.949> wanted<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> see<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.379> resistant<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and wanted to see how resistant the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
and wanted to see how resistant the
water<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.510> stratification<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.140> ended<00:01:04.439> up

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
water was stratification what I ended up

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.850 
water was stratification what I ended up
with<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.100> 75<00:01:05.580> degrees<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.240> 70<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.900> 75<00:01:07.590> degree

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
with was 75 degrees or 70 to 75 degree

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
with was 75 degrees or 70 to 75 degree
water<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.400> bottom<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.930> area<00:01:10.200> here

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
water on bottom here in this area here

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.859 
water on bottom here in this area here
and<00:01:10.920> 150<00:01:11.850> degree<00:01:12.150> water<00:01:12.540> up<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.080> top<00:01:13.790> which

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
and 150 degree water up on top which

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
and 150 degree water up on top which
obviously<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> not<00:01:16.200> too<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.650> homogenous<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
obviously is not too much homogenous a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.510 
obviously is not too much homogenous a
ssin<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:19.229> using<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.280> not

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
ssin and not really using that I'm not

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
ssin and not really using that I'm not
heating<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.600> my<00:01:21.750> water<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.740> I'm

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
heating up all of my water so I'm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
heating up all of my water so I'm
probably<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.369> storing<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
probably not storing that you know the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.440 
probably not storing that you know the
BTUs<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.170> quiet<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.590> couldn't<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.009> stored

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
BTUs that are quiet I couldn't be stored

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
BTUs that are quiet I couldn't be stored
so<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.229> had<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:28.770> again<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.909> I

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so if I had it to do over again what I

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
so if I had it to do over again what I
would<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> would<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.350> return<00:01:31.710> or

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
would do is I would have my return or

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
would do is I would have my return or
going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.579> coil<00:01:32.850> very<00:01:33.180> low<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.409> then

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
going to my coil very low here and then

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
going to my coil very low here and then
just<00:01:35.100> six<00:01:35.430> inches<00:01:35.729> above<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.299> come<00:01:36.630> back<00:01:36.990> in

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
just six inches above it come back in

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
just six inches above it come back in
right<00:01:38.270> because<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.340> loop<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
right because it will make that loop and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
right because it will make that loop and
the<00:01:42.299> reason<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> will<00:01:42.810> make<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.229> loop<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the reason it will make that loop is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
the reason it will make that loop is
there's<00:01:43.890> less<00:01:44.159> water<00:01:44.490> above<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.240> hole<00:01:45.509> than

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
there's less water above this hole than

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:46.360 
there's less water above this hole than
there<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
there is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.610 
there is
hold<00:01:46.730> so<00:01:47.360> when<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:47.600> pressure<00:01:47.810> builds<00:01:48.260> up<00:01:48.350> here

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
hold so when the pressure builds up here

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.350 
hold so when the pressure builds up here
it<00:01:48.710> will<00:01:48.800> take<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.100> easiest<00:01:49.520> path<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:50.120> least

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
it will take the easiest path of least

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.780 
it will take the easiest path of least
resistance<00:01:50.480> and<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.800> will<00:01:51.950> come<00:01:52.130> back<00:01:52.160> up<00:01:52.370> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
resistance and it will come back up and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.510 
resistance and it will come back up and
as<00:01:53.330> it<00:01:53.480> comes<00:01:53.660> here<00:01:54.230> which<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.890> lower<00:01:55.100> in<00:01:55.400> the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
as it comes here which is lower in the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.730 
as it comes here which is lower in the
water<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.060> will<00:01:56.300> disperse<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:57.050> heat<00:01:57.350> into

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
water it will disperse that heat into

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.860 
water it will disperse that heat into
more<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:57.980> the<00:01:58.100> water<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.820> rises<00:01:59.270> up<00:01:59.300> through

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
more of the water as it rises up through

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.010 
more of the water as it rises up through
the<00:02:00.170> water<00:02:01.660> so<00:02:03.790> instead<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:04.850> doing<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.390> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
the water so instead of doing it the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.320 
the water so instead of doing it the
heater<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.680> having<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:07.370> returned<00:02:07.730> here<00:02:08.030> I

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
heater and having it returned here I

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.010 
heater and having it returned here I
would<00:02:09.320> suggest<00:02:09.649> put<00:02:10.490> very<00:02:10.970> low<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.900> it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
would suggest put very low and have it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.840 
would suggest put very low and have it
returned<00:02:12.350> just<00:02:12.740> six<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.160> eight<00:02:13.310> inches<00:02:13.640> up

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
returned just six to eight inches up

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.690 
returned just six to eight inches up
above<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:15.350> when<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.130> returns<00:02:16.460> it's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
above it because when it returns it's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.130 
above it because when it returns it's
not<00:02:16.850> going<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.090> naturally<00:02:17.450> come<00:02:17.630> back<00:02:17.900> down

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
not going to naturally come back down

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.810 
not going to naturally come back down
and<00:02:18.350> go<00:02:18.470> back<00:02:18.680> down<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.220> going<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.730> going

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
and go back down it's going it's going

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.610 
and go back down it's going it's going
to<00:02:20.060> go<00:02:20.240> it's<00:02:20.600> going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.930> heat<00:02:21.110> it's<00:02:21.350> going<00:02:21.560> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
to go it's going to heat it's going to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.350 
to go it's going to heat it's going to
rise<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.190> it's<00:02:22.580> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.760> eat<00:02:22.940> more<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
rise and it's going to eat more of that

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.060 
rise and it's going to eat more of that
water<00:02:23.570> it's<00:02:23.810> going<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.020> heat<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.290> water<00:02:24.500> more

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
water it's going to heat that water more

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.180 
water it's going to heat that water more
evenly<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:26.320> mean<00:02:27.320> back<00:02:27.530> out<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.100> get

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
evenly I mean back out so you can get

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.800 
evenly I mean back out so you can get
the<00:02:28.340> different<00:02:28.820> view<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.240> another<00:02:29.390> detail

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the different view of another detail

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.340 
the different view of another detail
here

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
here

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.010 
here
so<00:02:31.280> let's<00:02:31.520> talk<00:02:31.700> about<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.600> two<00:02:32.780> barrel

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
so let's talk about it in a two barrel

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.800 
so let's talk about it in a two barrel
system<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:34.070> what<00:02:34.550> would<00:02:34.700> what<00:02:35.510> would<00:02:35.630> work

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
system like what would what would work

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.480 
system like what would what would work
for<00:02:36.050> two<00:02:36.200> barrels<00:02:36.590> okay<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.920> again<00:02:40.280> is

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
for two barrels okay so this is again is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.270 
for two barrels okay so this is again is
what<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> initially<00:02:41.030> tried<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.960> do<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.860> because

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
what I initially tried to do and because

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.770 
what I initially tried to do and because
of<00:02:43.310> my<00:02:43.460> elevation<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.060> couldn't<00:02:44.360> push<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.630> up

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
of my elevation I couldn't push it up

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.680 
of my elevation I couldn't push it up
over<00:02:45.050> here<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:46.100> besides<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.210> still<00:02:47.510> was

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
over here but besides that I still was

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170 
over here but besides that I still was
coming<00:02:48.020> out<00:02:48.110> here<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:49.130> returning<00:02:49.550> over<00:02:49.880> here

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
coming out here and returning over here

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.360 
coming out here and returning over here
what<00:02:51.020> that<00:02:51.200> was<00:02:51.380> what<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.070> would<00:02:52.280> have

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
what that was what that would have

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.610 
what that was what that would have
caused<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.660> hot<00:02:53.870> water<00:02:54.050> were<00:02:54.290> returned

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
caused is that hot water were returned

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.979 
caused is that hot water were returned
over<00:02:54.830> here<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.250> high<00:02:55.489> and<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:56.180> hot<00:02:56.600> will<00:02:56.840> just

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
over here up high and that hot will just

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.800 
over here up high and that hot will just
set<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.230> up<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.709> at<00:02:57.770> the<00:02:57.830> top<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
set right up here at the top and so the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.090 
set right up here at the top and so the
hottest<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.380> water<00:03:00.590> would<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.920> leaked

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
hottest of that water would have leaked

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.590 
hottest of that water would have leaked
over<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.700> set<00:03:01.910> right<00:03:02.090> up<00:03:02.239> here<00:03:02.450> at<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
over here and set right up here at the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.360 
over here and set right up here at the
top<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:03.440> it<00:03:03.560> would<00:03:03.650> have<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.920> go<00:03:04.040> against

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
top and then it would have to go against

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.850 
top and then it would have to go against
its<00:03:04.550> natural<00:03:05.000> tendency<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.750> rise<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.440> go<00:03:06.590> down

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
its natural tendency to rise to go down

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.090 
its natural tendency to rise to go down
and<00:03:07.190> cool<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.700> come<00:03:07.850> back<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.860> work

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
and cool to come back so would it work

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.449 
and cool to come back so would it work
yes<00:03:10.670> it'll<00:03:10.970> work<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:11.540> kinda<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:12.890> extra

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
yes it'll work and kinda this extra

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.860 
yes it'll work and kinda this extra
route<00:03:13.610> this<00:03:13.820> cold<00:03:14.120> water<00:03:14.420> at<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.690> bottom

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
route this cold water at the bottom

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.050 
route this cold water at the bottom
would<00:03:15.230> would<00:03:15.590> keep<00:03:15.830> it<00:03:15.980> from<00:03:16.190> you<00:03:16.640> know<00:03:16.760> ever

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
would would keep it from you know ever

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
would would keep it from you know ever
getting<00:03:17.420> boiling<00:03:17.989> because<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.260> almost<00:03:18.350> like

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
getting boiling because it's almost like

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.720 
getting boiling because it's almost like
a<00:03:18.770> an<00:03:19.280> insulated<00:03:20.320> cool<00:03:21.320> spot<00:03:21.739> down<00:03:21.980> here<00:03:22.310> when

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
a an insulated cool spot down here when

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.449 
a an insulated cool spot down here when
you<00:03:22.820> have<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.150> returned<00:03:23.510> higher<00:03:24.200> going<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.280> we

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
you have the returned higher going to we

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.540 
you have the returned higher going to we
have<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.790> part<00:03:26.360> going<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.900> coil<00:03:27.110> higher

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
have the part going to the coil higher

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.520 
have the part going to the coil higher
than<00:03:28.550> whatever<00:03:29.209> waters<00:03:29.720> below<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.290> water

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
than whatever waters below it that water

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.560 
than whatever waters below it that water
below<00:03:30.800> but<00:03:30.980> it's<00:03:31.100> really<00:03:31.310> kind<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.700> insulated

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
below but it's really kind of insulated

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.060 
below but it's really kind of insulated
and<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.780> little<00:03:33.019> area<00:03:33.320> down<00:03:33.560> there<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.830> stays

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
and a little area down there that stays

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:40.870 
and a little area down there that stays
good<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.489> cool<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:39.610> here's<00:03:40.610> another

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
good and cool and so here's another

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.380 
good and cool and so here's another
possible<00:03:41.540> way<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.700> you'll<00:03:43.700> see<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.060> got

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
possible way and you'll see that I got

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.650 
possible way and you'll see that I got
this<00:03:44.660> link<00:03:44.989> in<00:03:45.230> here<00:03:45.640> low<00:03:46.640> and<00:03:46.910> high<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.510> this

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
this link in here low and high so this

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.420 
this link in here low and high so this
will<00:03:47.810> set<00:03:48.019> up<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.230> natural<00:03:48.680> convection<00:03:48.860> but

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
will set up a natural convection but

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.750 
will set up a natural convection but
it's

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
it's

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.479 
it's
still<00:03:49.909> going<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.599> tend<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.989> stratify<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.950> lot

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
still going to tend to stratify a lot

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.380 
still going to tend to stratify a lot
it's<00:03:52.939> still<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:55.700> top<00:03:55.939> half<00:03:56.209> of<00:03:56.299> the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
it's still going to the top half of the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.210 
it's still going to the top half of the
barrels<00:03:56.750> are<00:03:56.870> going<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:57.110> be<00:03:57.260> way<00:03:58.189> more

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
barrels are going to be way more

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.390 
barrels are going to be way more
advantageous<00:03:58.989> or<00:03:59.989> be<00:04:00.290> way<00:04:00.739> hotter<00:04:01.010> than<00:04:01.220> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
advantageous or be way hotter than the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.970 
advantageous or be way hotter than the
lower<00:04:01.549> parts<00:04:01.939> so<00:04:02.599> the<00:04:02.840> third<00:04:03.439> way<00:04:03.620> let<00:04:03.769> make

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
lower parts so the third way let make

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.270 
lower parts so the third way let make
sure<00:04:04.129> you<00:04:04.310> can<00:04:04.430> see<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:04.790> over<00:04:05.120> here<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:07.129> I'm

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
sure you can see this over here and I'm

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.410 
sure you can see this over here and I'm
kind<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.519> going<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.760> zoom<00:04:07.909> in<00:04:08.060> here<00:04:08.269> because

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
kind of going to zoom in here because

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.910 
kind of going to zoom in here because
this<00:04:08.629> is<00:04:08.780> kind<00:04:08.810> of<00:04:08.989> hard<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.200> see<00:04:09.440> it's<00:04:09.650> got

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
this is kind of hard to see it's got

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.500 
this is kind of hard to see it's got
some<00:04:09.950> detail<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.640> it

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.810 

the<00:04:14.510> third<00:04:14.750> way<00:04:14.989> here<00:04:15.379> is<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:16.100> two<00:04:16.250> barrels<00:04:16.669> is

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
the third way here is the two barrels is

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.240 
the third way here is the two barrels is
is<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.510> come<00:04:17.720> off<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.139> bottom<00:04:18.289> here<00:04:18.709> going<00:04:18.919> to

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
is I come off the bottom here going to

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.189 
is I come off the bottom here going to
my<00:04:19.430> coil<00:04:19.820> right<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:23.060> return<00:04:23.419> point<00:04:23.780> here

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
my coil right and the return point here

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.050 
my coil right and the return point here
to<00:04:24.410> Center<00:04:24.770> this<00:04:24.919> barrel<00:04:25.310> I<00:04:25.370> got<00:04:25.490> our<00:04:25.699> hereby

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
to Center this barrel I got our hereby

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.279 
to Center this barrel I got our hereby
return<00:04:26.240> points<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.810> didn't<00:04:26.990> want<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.169> come

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
return points I didn't want to come

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:28.810 
return points I didn't want to come
across<00:04:27.380> these<00:04:27.710> other<00:04:27.919> lines<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.280> meant<00:04:28.520> to

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
across these other lines that meant to

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.879 
across these other lines that meant to
confuse<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.449> anymore<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:30.620> what<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.800> did

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
confuse you anymore and so what I did

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.469 
confuse you anymore and so what I did
off<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.400> first<00:04:31.669> barrel<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.090> went<00:04:32.270> off

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
off of this first barrel is I went off

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.379 
off of this first barrel is I went off
the<00:04:32.690> high<00:04:32.870> point<00:04:33.350> down<00:04:33.830> low<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.850> then<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.270> went

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the high point down low and then I went

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.200 
the high point down low and then I went
off<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.600> high<00:04:35.750> point<00:04:36.080> down<00:04:36.770> low<00:04:37.070> here<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.060> what

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
off a high point down low here so what

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.000 
off a high point down low here so what
this<00:04:38.360> will<00:04:38.539> do<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.990> water<00:04:39.289> returns<00:04:39.710> here

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
this will do is this water returns here

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.100 
this will do is this water returns here
it<00:04:40.520> will<00:04:40.729> heat<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.120> water<00:04:41.360> as<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:41.690> comes<00:04:41.900> up

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
it will heat the water as it comes up

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.439 
it will heat the water as it comes up
through<00:04:42.289> it<00:04:42.470> will<00:04:43.460> disperse<00:04:43.880> its<00:04:44.090> heat<00:04:44.270> off

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
through it will disperse its heat off

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.360 
through it will disperse its heat off
into<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.750> rest<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.080> water<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.889> womans<00:04:46.250> and

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
into the rest of water the womans and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.219 
into the rest of water the womans and
water<00:04:46.520> will<00:04:46.729> stratify<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.510> top<00:04:47.720> the

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
water will stratify to the top the

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.110 
water will stratify to the top the
warmest<00:04:48.560> water<00:04:48.800> will<00:04:49.070> drop<00:04:49.430> down<00:04:49.669> to<00:04:49.729> flow<00:04:50.060> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
warmest water will drop down to flow the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.540 
warmest water will drop down to flow the
cold<00:04:50.419> over<00:04:50.780> in<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.050> barrel<00:04:51.440> as<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:52.190> barrel

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
cold over in this barrel as this barrel

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.150 
cold over in this barrel as this barrel
stratifies<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.449> it<00:04:54.169> gives<00:04:54.440> off<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.800> heat<00:04:54.979> and

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
stratifies and it gives off the heat and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.790 
stratifies and it gives off the heat and
it<00:04:55.280> rises<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:55.849> top<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.900> will<00:04:57.440> go<00:04:57.590> back

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
it rises to the top that will go back

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.770 
it rises to the top that will go back
down<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.340> flow<00:04:58.610> hot<00:04:58.849> the<00:04:58.970> cola<00:04:59.210> flow<00:04:59.510> to<00:04:59.570> the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
down and flow hot the cola flow to the

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.480 
down and flow hot the cola flow to the
coldest<00:05:00.080> area<00:05:00.349> here<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.830> then<00:05:01.250> hopefully

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
coldest area here and then hopefully

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.620 
coldest area here and then hopefully
rise<00:05:01.970> back<00:05:02.270> up<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.900> come<00:05:03.139> back<00:05:03.349> out<00:05:04.630> your

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
rise back up and come back out your

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.589 
rise back up and come back out your
return<00:05:05.930> point<00:05:06.289> so<00:05:07.039> this<00:05:07.310> is<00:05:07.490> definitely<00:05:07.789> a

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
return point so this is definitely a

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.080 
return point so this is definitely a
much<00:05:09.380> better<00:05:12.370> thorough<00:05:13.370> heating<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:14.030> the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
much better thorough heating of the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.469 
much better thorough heating of the
water<00:05:15.080> due<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.070> stratification<00:05:16.520> right

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
water due to the stratification right

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.659 
water due to the stratification right
somewhere<00:05:17.810> back<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.110> guys<00:05:18.260> out<00:05:18.560> now

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
somewhere back you guys out now

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.709 
somewhere back you guys out now
so<00:05:21.669> I<00:05:21.699> thought<00:05:21.969> those<00:05:22.149> things<00:05:22.179> were<00:05:22.509> worth

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
so I thought those things were worth

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.869 
so I thought those things were worth
bringing<00:05:23.019> up<00:05:23.379> and<00:05:23.829> one<00:05:24.159> other<00:05:24.309> thing<00:05:24.639> that<00:05:24.669> I

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
bringing up and one other thing that I

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.849 
bringing up and one other thing that I
thought<00:05:25.089> was<00:05:25.149> worth<00:05:25.509> bringing<00:05:25.779> up<00:05:26.109> in<00:05:26.319> this

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:26.859 
thought was worth bringing up in this

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.999 
thought was worth bringing up in this
thermal<00:05:27.279> cycling<00:05:27.699> system<00:05:28.179> and<00:05:28.839> that<00:05:29.019> is<00:05:29.319> using

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
thermal cycling system and that is using

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.219 
thermal cycling system and that is using
these<00:05:30.309> thermal<00:05:30.669> cycling<00:05:31.059> systems<00:05:31.539> when<00:05:32.079> you

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
these thermal cycling systems when you

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.609 
these thermal cycling systems when you
have<00:05:32.439> an<00:05:32.559> abasement<00:05:32.889> right<00:05:33.849> because<00:05:34.749> you've

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
have an abasement right because you've

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:37.259 
have an abasement right because you've
got<00:05:35.769> the<00:05:35.889> obviously<00:05:36.309> the<00:05:36.369> thermo<00:05:36.879> siphon<00:05:37.059> you

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:37.269 
got the obviously the thermo siphon you

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:39.359 
got the obviously the thermo siphon you
got<00:05:37.389> the<00:05:37.539> elevation<00:05:38.379> issue<00:05:38.619> you<00:05:38.799> already<00:05:39.189> saw

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:39.369 
got the elevation issue you already saw

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:42.359 
got the elevation issue you already saw
so<00:05:40.209> you<00:05:40.659> realize<00:05:40.929> you<00:05:41.109> set<00:05:41.349> a<00:05:41.379> wood<00:05:41.649> stove<00:05:41.919> or<00:05:42.339> a

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
so you realize you set a wood stove or a

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:45.119 
so you realize you set a wood stove or a
rocket<00:05:42.819> stove<00:05:42.969> in<00:05:43.269> the<00:05:43.359> basement<00:05:43.979> put<00:05:44.979> the

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
rocket stove in the basement put the

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.309 
rocket stove in the basement put the
water<00:05:45.369> coil<00:05:45.939> on<00:05:46.179> it<00:05:46.359> and<00:05:46.539> use<00:05:46.779> the<00:05:46.959> thermal

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
water coil on it and use the thermal

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.999 
water coil on it and use the thermal
cycling<00:05:47.799> to<00:05:48.339> transport<00:05:49.029> the<00:05:49.239> heat<00:05:49.479> upstairs

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
cycling to transport the heat upstairs

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.069 
cycling to transport the heat upstairs
and<00:05:51.009> you<00:05:51.129> could<00:05:51.339> you<00:05:51.999> don't<00:05:52.149> have<00:05:52.359> to<00:05:52.539> use<00:05:52.749> an

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:53.079 
and you could you don't have to use an

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:55.589 
and you could you don't have to use an
ugly<00:05:53.559> barrel<00:05:53.979> upstairs<00:05:54.519> to<00:05:54.909> transport<00:05:55.479> your

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
ugly barrel upstairs to transport your

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.679 
ugly barrel upstairs to transport your
heat<00:05:55.779> to<00:05:56.019> this<00:05:56.949> this<00:05:57.429> deal<00:05:57.759> could<00:05:58.029> actually<00:05:58.269> be

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:58.689 
heat to this this deal could actually be

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.949 
heat to this this deal could actually be
a<00:05:58.899> radiator<00:05:59.439> it<00:06:00.009> can<00:06:00.219> be<00:06:00.399> a<00:06:00.789> steel<00:06:01.269> radiator<00:06:01.779> or

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:01.959 
a radiator it can be a steel radiator or

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.429 
a radiator it can be a steel radiator or
any<00:06:02.139> kind<00:06:02.379> of<00:06:02.439> decorative<00:06:03.029> container<00:06:04.439> that

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
any kind of decorative container that

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.139 
any kind of decorative container that
would<00:06:05.649> hold<00:06:05.829> water<00:06:06.159> and<00:06:06.429> give<00:06:06.609> off<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:06.939> heat

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:07.149 
would hold water and give off the heat

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:08.879 
would hold water and give off the heat
if<00:06:07.359> you<00:06:07.479> wanted<00:06:07.749> to<00:06:07.839> set<00:06:08.049> it<00:06:08.079> out<00:06:08.319> in<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.709> room

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
if you wanted to set it out in the room

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:11.309 
if you wanted to set it out in the room
you<00:06:09.819> just<00:06:09.849> build<00:06:10.269> the<00:06:10.539> system<00:06:10.929> up<00:06:11.079> and<00:06:11.259> it

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
you just build the system up and it

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:12.989 
you just build the system up and it
would<00:06:11.469> naturally<00:06:11.949> thermal<00:06:12.309> cycling<00:06:12.789> and

00:06:12.989 --> 00:06:12.999 
would naturally thermal cycling and

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.629 
would naturally thermal cycling and
bring<00:06:13.269> the<00:06:13.449> heat<00:06:13.659> up<00:06:13.929> that<00:06:14.829> would<00:06:14.949> be<00:06:15.099> pretty

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
bring the heat up that would be pretty

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.059 
bring the heat up that would be pretty
neat<00:06:15.759> there<00:06:16.149> but<00:06:16.779> you'd<00:06:16.989> also<00:06:17.139> do<00:06:17.649> the<00:06:17.769> thermal

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:18.069 
neat there but you'd also do the thermal

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.589 
neat there but you'd also do the thermal
cycling<00:06:18.399> and<00:06:18.549> just<00:06:18.729> a<00:06:18.819> drop<00:06:19.029> and<00:06:19.239> put<00:06:19.389> it<00:06:19.479> in

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
cycling and just a drop and put it in

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.449 
cycling and just a drop and put it in
the<00:06:19.749> closet<00:06:19.929> and<00:06:20.379> then<00:06:20.529> let<00:06:20.709> the<00:06:20.859> heat<00:06:21.039> off<00:06:21.189> as

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:21.459 
the closet and then let the heat off as

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.809 
the closet and then let the heat off as
you<00:06:21.639> wanted<00:06:21.969> it<00:06:22.089> to<00:06:23.249> so<00:06:24.249> I<00:06:24.279> thought<00:06:24.519> these<00:06:24.669> were

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
you wanted it to so I thought these were

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.259 
you wanted it to so I thought these were
pretty<00:06:25.029> good<00:06:26.549> thoughts<00:06:27.549> to<00:06:27.759> be<00:06:27.879> thinking

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:28.269 
pretty good thoughts to be thinking

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:30.269 
pretty good thoughts to be thinking
about<00:06:28.509> on<00:06:28.959> how<00:06:29.229> you're<00:06:29.409> going<00:06:29.559> to<00:06:29.619> set<00:06:30.129> up<00:06:30.159> your

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:30.279 
about on how you're going to set up your

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.159 
about on how you're going to set up your
thermal<00:06:30.759> if<00:06:30.909> your<00:06:31.149> thermos<00:06:31.449> offing<00:06:31.869> and<00:06:31.989> I

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
thermal if your thermos offing and I

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.109 
thermal if your thermos offing and I
wanted<00:06:32.439> to<00:06:32.559> point<00:06:32.739> out<00:06:32.919> to<00:06:33.039> you<00:06:33.099> guys<00:06:33.159> that<00:06:33.579> I

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:34.119 
wanted to point out to you guys that I

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.959 
wanted to point out to you guys that I
am<00:06:34.360> getting<00:06:34.809> you<00:06:35.589> know<00:06:35.709> 75<00:06:36.579> degree

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969 
am getting you know 75 degree

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:38.519 
am getting you know 75 degree
temperature<00:06:37.629> difference<00:06:37.749> on<00:06:38.139> these<00:06:38.319> summer

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:38.529 
temperature difference on these summer

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.769 
temperature difference on these summer
side<00:06:38.829> things<00:06:39.039> off<00:06:39.219> of<00:06:39.369> that<00:06:39.519> off<00:06:40.329> that<00:06:40.569> stove

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:40.779 
side things off of that off that stove

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.609 
side things off of that off that stove
is<00:06:41.019> 75<00:06:41.559> at<00:06:41.769> the<00:06:41.860> bottom<00:06:42.189> walls<00:06:42.369> 150<00:06:43.209> so<00:06:43.869> I<00:06:44.379> think

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:44.619 
is 75 at the bottom walls 150 so I think

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:47.879 
is 75 at the bottom walls 150 so I think
this<00:06:44.829> is<00:06:45.129> a<00:06:45.749> at<00:06:46.749> least<00:06:46.929> the<00:06:47.079> beginning<00:06:47.529> it's

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
this is a at least the beginning it's

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.239 
this is a at least the beginning it's
not<00:06:48.039> the<00:06:48.189> full<00:06:48.369> definite<00:06:49.089> or<00:06:49.209> not<00:06:49.389> the<00:06:49.479> full

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
not the full definite or not the full

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:52.049 
not the full definite or not the full
understanding<00:06:51.249> but<00:06:51.369> this<00:06:51.519> is<00:06:51.669> least<00:06:51.909> the

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:52.059 
understanding but this is least the

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:53.909 
understanding but this is least the
beginning<00:06:52.539> you<00:06:52.659> know<00:06:52.719> considering<00:06:53.349> your<00:06:53.709> heat

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
beginning you know considering your heat

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.679 
beginning you know considering your heat
flow<00:06:54.219> when<00:06:54.549> you're<00:06:54.699> setting<00:06:55.029> up<00:06:55.149> your<00:06:55.209> thermal
