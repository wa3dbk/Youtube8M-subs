00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi girls how are you in this month 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.590
 we are in the month of awareness 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.250
 about breast cancer that we 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.219
 we regularly crash our breasts to 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:20.110
 that we ourselves explore ourselves 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.480
 so we can avoid a tragedy that 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.090
 let's do the exams that are 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.550
 necessary to be able to detect 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.340
 any anomaly ahead of time but 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.380
 There is a theme that we women 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.610
 sometimes we avoid and it's about the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.380
 papanicolau to see if it's a girl that 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.730
 make videos here on youtube and I 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.650
 contacted through twitter and told me 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.300
 that he wanted me to give a video that she 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.640
 had gone up and to help him pass the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.760
 voice because she already felt very committed 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.070
 with this topic and he wanted me to help him 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.660
 to spread the word and when I asked 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.780
 what it was about tells me it's about 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.460
 about the pap smear and the pap 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.600
 I am a very sad person 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.760
 with soda and with these topics that are very 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.520
 personal are will be try to keep me 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 on the sidelines and I was not at home 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.900
 Then I tell him when I get home 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.390
 I'm going to watch the video and then you 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.880
 I answer and that's when my end ended 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.909
 I already came to my house and seeing the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.090
 videos without sincerely moved me 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.119
 very much is a bit extensive here below 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.280
 in the description box I'm going to 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.229
 leave 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.390
 the direct link so they can see 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.820
 this video I invite you to look at 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.360
 It is a video that makes us all 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.670
 women to open our minds and not only 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.179
 open your mind and be attentive but 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.380
 also to be able to say pass the word and 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.360
 we also come to take 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.490
 awareness of our body because 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.409
 us women we love ourselves 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.940
 beautiful regias walk bags necklaces 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.010
 so much that we like to put on 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.830
 because we like to see 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.990
 we like to see each other very sure of 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.270
 we ourselves but as we take care 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.940
 our exterior we also have to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.630
 take care of our inner health 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.630
 our physique is a very serious subject to 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.760
 try and that's why I wanted to do this 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.280
 video when I saw the yale video I said 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.620
 I have to do it and she has passed 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.160
 two different times for this tragedy 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:37.510
 what is cancer for lack of being the 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.930
 papanicolau she lost her sister in the 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.610
 fight against cancer and was about 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.500
 of losing her second sister but 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.600
 thank God he's already five years old 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.650
 tell all that story in the video 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.880
 but she recommends and they do their 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.790
 checks and you're surprised of the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.070
 magnitude that can have this if you do not 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.020
 you do these checks then that's why 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.290
 I wanted to make this video and also be 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.520
 part of this campaign and girls who do 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.490
 videos 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.160
 and they make youtube videos of beauty of 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.430
 fashion of anything of interest to 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.920
 the woman I wholeheartedly ask you to 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.490
 you will also see this video and go through 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 the voice and talk about this topic for 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.230
 very embarrassing that it is and I think it is 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.730
 better spend a few minutes of embarrassment at 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.730
 move to a life with a disease that 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.640
 you can end your joy with 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.930
 your happiness and not only with one like 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.760
 us as women but also 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.030
 our children who depend on us 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.150
 our family is affected by this 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.640
 theme and awareness to yourself 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.890
 question does it make you how much time do I have 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.280
 that I did not get a Pap smear 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.320
 how long have I not been thrown out 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.420
 can suffer from cervical cancer that 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.860
 take until you get the matrix that 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.890
 they take away the opportunity to have children 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.250
 have sudden abortions all these 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.190
 things 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.530
 can happen through not being made to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.210
 a checkup then it's important that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.880
 we women take care of myself 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.100
 I'm so so informed about this 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.740
 I only know that we have to do this 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.130
 check and I tell you from the heart I do not 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.920
 I'm no gynecologist, no doctor 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.170
 but if I'm a woman and that's why I can 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.540
 spread the word to other women who 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.570
 they watch my videos of heart are the 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.670
 I recommend girls raise awareness and 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.500
 those who make video spread the word here 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.450
 below I will leave the link so that 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.450
 go watch your video and 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.690
 I hope that with this video you can 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.810
 help and we can save many many 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.930
 lives no matter how simple it looks but 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.790
 I think that in us is to spread the word and 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.240
 see you until the next video for 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.240
 girls
