00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
use more than two we're going to take a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
use more than two we're going to take a
large<00:01:32.820> spoon<00:01:33.270> we're<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> stir<00:01:34.200> our

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
large spoon we're going to stir our

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520 
large spoon we're going to stir our
water<00:01:34.860> creating<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.060> nice<00:01:36.450> vortex<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
water creating a nice vortex in the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.350 
water creating a nice vortex in the
center<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.490> where<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.880> get<00:01:39.030> just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
center and this is where it can get just

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.760 
center and this is where it can get just
a<00:01:39.450> little<00:01:39.720> tricky<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.170> once<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
a little tricky but once you do it a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.649 
a little tricky but once you do it a
couple<00:01:40.950> times<00:01:41.189> you'll<00:01:41.460> totally<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
couple times you'll totally get it so

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
couple times you'll totally get it so
you<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.049> nice<00:01:43.229> little<00:01:43.290> vortex<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
you get this nice little vortex in the

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.800 
you get this nice little vortex in the
center<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> bring<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.720> little

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
texture which is really pretty on a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.850 
texture which is really pretty on a
poached<00:02:02.390> egg<00:02:02.720> if<00:02:02.930> you<00:02:03.020> don't<00:02:03.170> use<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> vinegar

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
poached egg if you don't use the vinegar

the<00:02:04.070> texture<00:02:04.760> of<00:02:04.820> your<00:02:04.880> egg<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.330> little

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
the texture of your egg is a little

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.360 
the texture of your egg is a little
slimy<00:02:05.900> I<00:02:06.020> hate<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.350> say<00:02:06.500> that<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:06.800> that's<00:02:06.860> how

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
slimy I hate to say that but that's how

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.139 
slimy I hate to say that but that's how
it<00:02:07.490> turns<00:02:07.700> out

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it turns out

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.930 
it turns out
so<00:02:08.600> once<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:09.679> eggs<00:02:10.009> poaching<00:02:10.640> in

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
so once you have your eggs poaching in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.970 
so once you have your eggs poaching in
the<00:02:11.030> water<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.450> need<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.720> decide<00:02:12.050> how<00:02:12.920> many

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the water you need to decide how many

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.590 
the water you need to decide how many
minutes<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.490> want<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.760> leave<00:02:13.910> them<00:02:14.180> there

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
minutes you want to leave them there

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.510 
minutes you want to leave them there
I<00:02:14.630> recommend<00:02:15.290> anywhere<00:02:15.620> from<00:02:15.800> two<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.130> five

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.060 
I recommend anywhere from two to five
minutes<00:02:16.970> two<00:02:17.510> minutes<00:02:17.540> will<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.140> very<00:02:18.440> runny<00:02:18.770> I

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070
