00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.570 
idea behind the flank strap is to put it
on<00:01:55.450> tight<00:01:55.780> enough<00:01:56.020> so<00:01:56.080> it<00:01:56.290> stays<00:01:56.530> on<00:01:56.800> but<00:01:57.400> loose

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
on tight enough so it stays on but loose

on tight enough so it stays on but loose
enough<00:01:57.910> that<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.180> bull<00:01:58.330> thinks<00:01:58.660> he<00:01:58.780> can<00:01:58.900> kick

enough that the bull thinks he can kick
it<00:01:59.260> off<00:01:59.410> that's<00:02:00.040> what<00:02:00.310> makes<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> Bulls<00:02:00.850> kick
