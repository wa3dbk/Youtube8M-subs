00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
yeah my real goal with this hypertrophy

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.420 
yeah my real goal with this hypertrophy
little<00:00:38.420> block<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.840> training<00:00:39.170> not<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:40.100> I

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
little block of training not that I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.460 
little block of training not that I
really<00:00:40.790> need<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.060> add<00:00:41.450> that<00:00:41.750> much<00:00:41.960> more<00:00:42.020> size

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
really need to add that much more size

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.550 
really need to add that much more size
to<00:00:43.040> my<00:00:43.160> legs<00:00:43.430> as<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.790> as<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:44.720> can<00:00:44.780> tell<00:00:45.080> here<00:00:45.970> but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
to my legs as a as you can tell here but

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.930 
to my legs as a as you can tell here but
you<00:00:48.560> know<00:00:48.620> that<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.010> objective<00:00:49.130> is<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.610> do<00:00:49.790> as

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
you know that the objective is to do as

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.960 
you know that the objective is to do as
much<00:00:50.090> work<00:00:50.150> above<00:00:50.990> 60%<00:00:51.880> intensity<00:00:52.880> as

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
much work above 60% intensity as

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.000 
much work above 60% intensity as
possible<00:00:54.250> so<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.640> about<00:00:55.990> about<00:00:56.990> a<00:00:57.050> 800<00:00:57.800> pound

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
possible so it's about about a 800 pound

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.560 
possible so it's about about a 800 pound
high<00:00:58.220> bar<00:00:58.430> squat<00:00:59.300> for<00:00:59.570> me<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:01.450> so<00:01:02.450> we're

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
high bar squat for me and so we're

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.590 
high bar squat for me and so we're
trying<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.840> do<00:01:02.900> as<00:01:03.020> much<00:01:03.050> work<00:01:03.230> as<00:01:03.560> possible

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
trying to do as much work as possible

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.289 
trying to do as much work as possible
really<00:01:05.600> over<00:01:05.900> 480<00:01:07.210> up<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.600> know<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:08.899> 60<00:01:09.289> to<00:01:09.439> 70%

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299 
really over 480 up you know so 60 to 70%

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.160 
really over 480 up you know so 60 to 70%
intensity<00:01:11.740> so<00:01:12.740> just<00:01:12.979> between<00:01:13.219> 480<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.170> 560

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
intensity so just between 480 and 560

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.560 
intensity so just between 480 and 560
and<00:01:15.520> just<00:01:16.520> continuing<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.030> do<00:01:17.179> more<00:01:17.359> and<00:01:17.509> more

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
and just continuing to do more and more

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.300 
and just continuing to do more and more
and<00:01:17.689> more<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.109> the<00:01:18.170> more<00:01:18.380> volume<00:01:19.069> I<00:01:19.159> can

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
and more and the more volume I can

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.039 
and more and the more volume I can
handle<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> closer<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:19.999> can<00:01:20.240> get<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.929> my

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
handle the closer I can get to my

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.690 
handle the closer I can get to my
maximum<00:01:21.439> recoverable<00:01:22.100> volume<00:01:22.460> in<00:01:22.579> those

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
maximum recoverable volume in those

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.940 
maximum recoverable volume in those
ranges<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.810> bigger<00:01:24.140> muscles<00:01:24.409> I'm<00:01:24.740> going<00:01:24.859> to

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
ranges the bigger muscles I'm going to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.370 
ranges the bigger muscles I'm going to
get<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.310> take<00:01:26.299> those<00:01:26.479> bigger<00:01:26.749> muscles<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
get and take those bigger muscles and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.230 
get and take those bigger muscles and
put<00:01:28.009> them<00:01:28.130> into<00:01:28.249> a<00:01:28.340> strength<00:01:28.670> block<00:01:28.969> and<00:01:29.179> a

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
put them into a strength block and a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.760 
put them into a strength block and a
peaking<00:01:29.600> block<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.109> teach<00:01:30.530> them<00:01:30.649> how<00:01:30.710> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
peaking block and teach them how to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.980 
peaking block and teach them how to
produce<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.159> lot<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.310> force<00:01:31.609> and<00:01:31.990> hopefully

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
produce a lot of force and hopefully

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.599 
produce a lot of force and hopefully
become<00:01:33.139> a<00:01:33.259> great<00:01:33.619> great<00:01:33.889> power<00:01:34.159> lifter<00:01:34.460> by

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
become a great great power lifter by

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.660 
become a great great power lifter by
doing<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:34.969> so<00:01:35.409> as<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:37.039> can<00:01:37.159> see<00:01:37.219> here<00:01:37.549> it's

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
doing that so as you can see here it's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.709 
doing that so as you can see here it's
just<00:01:37.729> doing<00:01:38.659> more<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.020> more<00:01:39.229> squats<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.719> over

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
know I think 99% of lifters out there

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:03.209 
know I think 99% of lifters out there
would<00:02:01.009> be<00:02:01.130> ecstatic<00:02:01.490> with<00:02:02.299> the<00:02:02.450> days<00:02:02.630> they<00:02:02.869> had

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
would be ecstatic with the days they had

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.949 
would be ecstatic with the days they had
but<00:02:04.219> you<00:02:04.310> know<00:02:04.459> we<00:02:04.880> set<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.299> bar<00:02:05.479> very<00:02:05.509> very

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
but you know we set the bar very very

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.460 
but you know we set the bar very very
high<00:02:06.380> for<00:02:07.279> what<00:02:07.789> we're<00:02:07.939> considering<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.690> great

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
high for what we're considering a great
