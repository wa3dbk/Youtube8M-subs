00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the major objective for me is when we

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.980 
the major objective for me is when we
look<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:48.960> how<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.520> playing

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
encouraging more people to play more

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
encouraging more people to play more
participants<00:01:54.390> more<00:01:54.750> volunteers<00:01:55.259> more

coaches<00:01:56.040> more<00:01:56.250> referees<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.210> really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
coaches more referees and that's really

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
coaches more referees and that's really
what<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:57.869> should<00:01:58.080> be<00:01:58.259> doing<00:01:58.289> as<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.979> direct

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
what we should be doing as a direct
