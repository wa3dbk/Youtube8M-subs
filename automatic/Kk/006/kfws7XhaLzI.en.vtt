00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.059 
in the electric industry and throw it
back<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.370> bicycle

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
back into the bicycle

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.979 
back into the bicycle
so<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:11.790> came<00:03:11.939> up<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.329> heatsink

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
so we came up with this heatsink

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809 
so we came up with this heatsink
aluminum<00:03:13.469> box<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.310> went<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.519> there<00:03:14.670> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
aluminum box that went in there and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.610 
aluminum box that went in there and
everything<00:03:15.480> else<00:03:15.689> from<00:03:15.900> there<00:03:16.109> was<00:03:16.319> kind<00:03:16.530> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
everything else from there was kind of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.509 
everything else from there was kind of
fit<00:03:16.829> and<00:03:16.859> finished

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
fit and finished

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.729 
fit and finished
we<00:03:17.819> spent<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> lot<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.239> time<00:03:18.450> looming<00:03:19.290> each<00:03:19.469> wire

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
we spent a lot of time looming each wire

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.319 
we spent a lot of time looming each wire
so<00:03:20.040> that<00:03:20.189> it<00:03:20.280> had<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> nice<00:03:20.730> little<00:03:20.909> finished

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
so that it had a nice little finished

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.729 
so that it had a nice little finished
piece<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.230> think<00:03:22.379> just<00:03:22.560> building

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
piece to it and I think just building

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.009 
piece to it and I think just building
the<00:03:23.219> longevity<00:03:23.400> into<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.390> product<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the longevity into the product and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.229 
the longevity into the product and
showing<00:03:25.469> that<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:26.040> fine<00:03:26.280> details<00:03:26.790> are<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
showing that the fine details are the

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.940 
showing that the fine details are the
most<00:03:27.390> important<00:03:27.840> part<00:03:28.019> desks<00:03:28.409> like<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
most important part desks like the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160 
most important part desks like the
leather<00:03:29.189> and<00:03:29.579> all<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> ties<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.359> all<00:03:31.019> the

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
leather and all the ties and all the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.809 
leather and all the ties and all the
wire<00:03:31.349> routing<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:31.950> all<00:03:32.069> been<00:03:32.220> thought<00:03:32.400> out<00:03:32.430> I

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
wire routing is all been thought out I

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.580 
wire routing is all been thought out I
think<00:03:33.329> that's<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.599> most<00:03:33.720> important<00:03:34.230> part<00:03:34.379> of

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think that's the most important part of

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.020 
think that's the most important part of
doing<00:03:34.890> all<00:03:35.099> this<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.549> know<00:03:35.670> went<00:03:35.849> through<00:03:36.000> a

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
doing all this you know went through a

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.490 
doing all this you know went through a
couple<00:03:36.150> different<00:03:36.540> designs<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.230> think

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
couple different designs and I think

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.110 
couple different designs and I think
we've<00:03:37.620> really<00:03:37.889> fine-tuned<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.790> way<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.000> is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
we've really fine-tuned the way it is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.959 
we've really fine-tuned the way it is
now<00:03:39.650> we<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:40.859> create<00:03:41.310> these<00:03:41.430> bikes<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
now we really create these bikes and

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.059 
now we really create these bikes and
build<00:03:42.150> them<00:03:42.299> from<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> ground<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:43.049> first<00:03:43.769> step

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
build them from the ground up first step

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.220 
build them from the ground up first step
in<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.250> process<00:03:44.370> would<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.209> doing<00:03:46.019> all<00:03:46.109> the

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
in that process would be doing all the

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.199 
in that process would be doing all the
metalwork<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.980> manufacturing<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.879> frames

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
metalwork so manufacturing the frames

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.539 
metalwork so manufacturing the frames
manufacturing<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.169> forks<00:03:49.590> milling<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:50.370> all

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
manufacturing the forks milling out all

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.339 
manufacturing the forks milling out all
the<00:03:50.639> crowns<00:03:50.939> as<00:03:51.780> soon<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.049> that's<00:03:52.169> done

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
the crowns as soon as that's done

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.229 
the crowns as soon as that's done
everything<00:03:53.340> gets<00:03:53.519> shipped<00:03:53.700> off<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:54.030> powder

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
everything gets shipped off to powder

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.420 
everything gets shipped off to powder
coat<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:55.319> once<00:03:55.709> it's<00:03:55.829> powder<00:03:56.010> coated

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
coat and then once it's powder coated

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.309 
coat and then once it's powder coated
everything's<00:03:57.060> coming<00:03:57.359> back<00:03:57.569> final<00:03:58.079> assembly

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
everything's coming back final assembly

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.949 
everything's coming back final assembly

then<00:04:05.189> off<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.430> door<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.669> goes<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:09.200> think<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
then off the door it goes I think the

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.020 
then off the door it goes I think the
coolest<00:04:10.620> feeling<00:04:11.069> of<00:04:11.250> doing<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.849> whole

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
coolest feeling of doing this whole

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.909 
coolest feeling of doing this whole
