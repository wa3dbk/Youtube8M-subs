00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.830
 I am navi 666 the theme of this video will be 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.230
 Mexico has nuclear weapons 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.970
 Well, Mexico is in the nations 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.730
 with creative capacity in the 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.860
 nuclear military industry in this part 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.589
 it's very long and very confusing so 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.619
 I will put only the part of mexico gmexico 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.929
 In Mexico, in June 2006, a 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.230
 project nuclear development program 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.089
 rc ms for peaceful purposes this program 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.939
 had as plan a nuclear detonation 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.039
 but this project was canceled due 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.079
 to which Mexico is part of the countries 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.350
 who signed the treaty of no 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.420
 nuclear proliferation currently account 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.879
 with large deposits of uranium in the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.039
 State of Chiapas la Sedena and Sener 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.839
 they report around 6 tons 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.179
 produced from plutonium earlier in 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.609
 1986 mexico had planned to create a 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.829
 nuclear program but it was canceled 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.710
 due to financial problems in those 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.890
 times since I would invest about 30,000 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.500
 millions of dollars in those times 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.010
 Mexico already enjoyed nuclear energy with 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.780
 plant 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.510
 nuclear green lagoon located in the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.790
 state of veracruz mexico already has the 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.160
 economic and technological capacity to 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.290
 be able to promote a nuclear program and 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.510
 create their nuclear weapons in the short term 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.910
 of time from 2 to 3 years 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.130
 but this one is still deciding to grow 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.710
 economically and leave the military scope 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.810
 towards a very near future gustavo dÃ­az 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.330
 Ordaz after the killing of 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.090
 tlatelolco signed a permit for the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.830
 Mexican army will create nuclear weapons 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.740
 in response to the attempts of the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.290
 Cuban communists today you know 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.600
 between mexico and the us there have been 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.270
 dialogues about uranium that mexico 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.220
 has and us wants mexico to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.670
 deliver uranium or remove such 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.920
 treatment was proposed in April 2012 without 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.650
 However, Mexico has not wanted to comply 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.160
 said treatment since apart from the old 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 rivalry between mexico and usa mexico 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.880
 he fears that at any moment Cuba 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.070
 go back to the cold war times or 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.220
 that the United States have future plans 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.010
 of invasion towards the country currently 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.900
 Mexico believes that if you have nuclear weapons 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.269
 he thinks he has them hidden in the 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.430
 sound desert other sources say 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.739
 that Mexico has dismantled some of 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.810
 your nuclear weapons and other sources 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.939
 they say that Mexico continues to build 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.329
 nuclear weapons since the meetings 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.310
 between mexico and usa about elimination 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.379
 of uranium from mexico have questioned 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.780
 that Mexico can be the first 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:38.599
 Hispanic latina nation to have weapons 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.459
 nuclear weapons in secret would also be a 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.069
 great test of which cuba and mexico 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.109
 they have bad diplomatic relations a 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.390
 example of the very possible development 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.459
 nuclear of Mexico has been the one with the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.459
 first Mexican space agency that 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 was in competition with the us and the ussr 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.019
 in the space field and it was at par 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.040
 with these nations example of it have 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.079
 been the rockets sct 1 and sct 2 capable 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.859
 of going to space and they were put in 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.109
 orbit 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.120
 possibly have put satellites to 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.909
 space in secret as future 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.099
 development of spy satellites said 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.950
 rivalry could be abandoned due to 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.199
 the threats of the us and the ussr with a 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.060
 possible invasion because of the breakthrough 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:23.840
 technological of Mexico in him 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.849
 spatial Mexico with the development 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.160
 powerful rockets that can reach the 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.920
 space another one of the reasons why 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.230
 which is believed that the United States 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.750
 the government of mexico to abandon its 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.489
 space program and quite possibly the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.100
 predecessor of the birth of the program 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.590
 nuclear of mexico 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.100
 the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.440
 nuclear npt non-proliferation treat and in 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.280
 English is a treaty open to signature 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.100
 on July 1, 1968 that restricts the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.670
 possession of nuclear weapons the great 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.850
 majority of sovereign states 188 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.890
 are part of the treaty only five 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.250
 states are allowed in the treaty the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:13.310
 possession of nuclear weapons the usa 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:19.810
 Signatory in 1968 the United Kingdom- 1968 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:22.550
 France 1992 the Soviet Union 1968 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.840
 replaced today by Russia and 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.170
 the People's Republic of China 1992 the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.270
 special condition of these five countries 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:34.280
 called nuclear-armed states are 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.680
 defined from which were the only 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.090
 states that had detonated an essay 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.860
 nuclear until 1967 they are also the 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.780
 five permanent members of the council 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.030
 Security of United Nations 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.210
 what will happen to this treaty in the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.370
 future there is a broad debate about 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 of the effectiveness of the treaty as a basis for 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.990
 disarmament and non-proliferation regime 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.930
 nuclear especially after the call 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.240
 nuclear agreement india usa referred to 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.400
 civil uses and the definition of a 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.340
 special safeguard regime for the 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.889
 cited country in this regard the 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.080
 Review conference May 2010 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:16.050
 is perceived as critical to 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.840
 consolidate the treaty the May session 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.610
 of 2009 of the preparatory committee also 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.500
 had difficulty reaching a 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.660
 final document agreed with 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.600
 recommendations for that conference 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.820
 of revision but as well and all its result 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.190
 It was considered positive in comparison 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.530
 with those of previous years since it 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.690
 handcuffed the fundamental points of 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.350
 discussion and the agenda of the 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.580
 next meeting that will happen then 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.729
 Mexico will become a power 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.729
 world one day only time will tell 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.820
