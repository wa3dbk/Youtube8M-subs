 experts argue which way is better 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.070
 use fruits and berries people themselves 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.110
 prescribe a fruit diet as not 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 overdo it with vitaminization 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.250
 let's find out 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.320
 juice for breakfast, lunch and dinner, this 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.149
 simple way not to treat Trushina 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.029
 almost any disease is already in 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:30.700
 for 12 years according to her juice mix 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.920
 carrots beet and cucumber disease any 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.780
 tablets with the first effect of such 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.120
 power woman noticed already after 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.160
 the first 40-day course of astana 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.649
 pay attention to what I have 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 losing weight means pain disappeared 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:51.100
 in my knees rose 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.260
 mood as a woman notes from 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.030
 ordinary fruits and vegetables of this effect 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.190
 because firstly they won't be long 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.679
 digested and secondly then you have to 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.370
 they are from morning to evening with this 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:07.750
 and doctors agree fruits and vegetables has 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.060
 from let's say it is fiber they 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.220
 pass our full cycle 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.920
 digestion yes i mean they enter about 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.020
 this gastrointestinal tract then so 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.149
 let's say sucked only you useful 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.030
 substances that the body needs that 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.799
 concerns juices i.e. derivatives of 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.049
 fruit or vegetables 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.610
 it does not enter our body and 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.920
 absorbed immediately 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.659
 however, despite the fact that fruit and 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.610
 vegetable juices contain large amounts 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.860
 vitamins and antioxidants 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.280
 experts are sure of even the most useful 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.210
 products may have side effects 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.890
 American scientists in the course of their 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.570
 studies have concluded that juices 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.850
 can be not only useful but also 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.469
 harmful is the use of more 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.719
 three glasses of apple juice per day 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.539
 may increase the risk of sugar 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.430
 diabetes here for example use 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.920
 orange juice and does cause 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.259
 obesity nublo issues fruit they 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.060
 nothing like that said and right 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.469
 it is not said because the fruit looks like 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.359
 possess exclusively only 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.100
 positive properties besides 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.450
 vitamins they have fiber which 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.670
 necessary for normal 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.569
 intestinal functioning in juices 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.489
 of course no fiber 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.680
 Yes, and they lose vitamins much faster 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.049
 than whole fruits and therefore it is better to drink them 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.549
 immediately after cooking the threshold is not 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.450
 recommends everything because for example 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.939
 here's vitamin c when interacting with 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.219
 by air it disintegrates very quickly and 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.769
 the nutritional value will be completely not 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:34.459
 then a tomato for example it may darken 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.480
 also due to the acid therefore on the heap 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.819
 do right away 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.709
 but as for potentially dangerous 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.790
 properties of juices namely high 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.950
 fructose content 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.379
 then they can be completely avoided the main thing is not 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.750
 drink juice liters in general recommended 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.099
 the amount of juice is as fruity 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.439
 vegetable within 500 600 milliliters 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.989
 this is enough people who 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.489
 suffer from diabetes who has an elevated 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.040
 blood glucose level 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.609
 they should be more careful about 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.439
 juice and sweet fruit however even from 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.900
 they completely refuse doctors do not 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.099
 advise because I recommend my 2-3 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.810
 cups of juice per day 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.790
 can replace only one and a half two 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.500
 kilograms of whole fruits in reasonable 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.759
 limits and one and the other product 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.759
 extremely helpful
