00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:42.070
 avoid last hello to all people 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.840
 it's xenon I hope you're fine 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.580
 today we find ourselves on black ops 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.870
 common points nike is not much 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 to do with call of duty 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.020
 before that I will still ask you 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.970
 the gameplay decor so we're in 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.260
 confirmed eliminations on the map 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.390
 turbine it's a gameplay that I 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.460
 realized under water once again so 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.769
 I was with a small m27 cros 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.330
 silent in secondary 1 4 40 we have 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.629
 all determination bulletproof vest 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.980
 dexterity and looters with the little c4 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.620
 and here I think I'm done so 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.050
 with my class so this gameplay is 1 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.030
 108 3 in emea to confirm as I 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.680
 says that I realized underwater it's 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.000
 rather hard to make more than 100 kg 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.229
 eliminations confirmed when one is 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.790
 alone because with the allies who 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.229
 pick up the plates 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.520
 I think you know a little about that 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.050
 you are players of call of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.970
 duty just like me otherwise anyway 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.619
 you would not be here and you knew what 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.600
 point there are jackals raptors 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.380
 finally short to the guys they throw on 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.759
 the plates it's true that it's boring 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.950
 but hey, we can not do it big 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.369
 thing if not at district level beats 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.200
 hunting group the other star and the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.969
 little fly to shit as it would say gala 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.979
 so the escort group 1 for that 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.390
 would not have understood therefore in front of 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.890
 scores for those who normally speak 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.909
 and flies to shit for a little section 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.860
 disturbed in their heads 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.380
 so now we're going to spend about the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.460
 day then simply 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.049
 what do you want to do with your 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.630
 life knows it may seem a bit 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.560
 weird like that basically the stuff that I 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.729
 am going to ask you today it's me 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.740
 say a little bit for example in a few 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.149
 places you are what kind of study you 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.560
 plan to follow thereafter there is a 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.020
 job that makes you want to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.820
 others personally I'm going to you 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.649
 tell a little about my personal story 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.000
 I think that may interest 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.530
 some then it saves me from doing 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.960
 every summer every four mornings 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.000
 has to say and bills special 2000 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.140
 3000 or 4000 subscribers finally I do not want 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.280
 to make 50 miles more that me 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.320
 will answer questions 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.940
 that could be asked me so is my big 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.830
 I was in second general time in 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.670
 third general rather when I'm 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.920
 spent in second I had to choose 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.450
 several options charge to choose 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.319
 among several options because to my 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.540
 time 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.769
 here and one for the whole year now 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.269
 these four and you turn a little so 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.249
 I had taken easy so science of 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.700
 the engineer frankly it was really 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:37.780
 shit 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.280
 I do not say that the pawn 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.569
 she is shit herself but me 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.069
 personally I had paid but because 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.139
 it was not my thing 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.200
 after that I chained on a first 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:50.139
 so it s ssll been biology engrossed 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.340
 this is a scientist oriented 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.450
 biology so that we have not 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 of engineering science actually when 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.150
 you are left over you have two 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.799
 options finally three options man I believe 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.879
 that she has maths in any case in my 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.980
 high school there was not that thing there 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.290
 and then quite clearly not the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.639
 good choice because frankly the picture 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.230
 I will tell you I have finished the terminal 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.370
 with 3 average age will have the opportunity 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.769
 to talk to you about it again because I have 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 pretty funny stories with my teacher of 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.439
 terminal math let's say we got it 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.549
 a little crazy with 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.949
 my friends and we were a bit of 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.199
 salopiots at the time but good after 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.280
 it's after this first is so I 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.049
 still managed to pass in terminal 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.439
 without repeating I ended up having my 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.209
 trough 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.889
 so in just two years I have not 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.780
 redoubled I can also problems 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.159
 even though it's true it's a bit of a 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.120
 fucking miracle frankly I'm 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.810
 ask again how did I do to 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.310
 have my bac 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.689
 so this I think I'll have a little 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.970
 loquacious talk to you again because there is 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.280
 lots of stories about 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.239
 my organization at school and finally I 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.299
 am really not an example 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.639
 frankly so after the bac obviously 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.109
 we had to make the games on abb so those 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.150
 who have been there also owe 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.189
 know character had put several 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.209
 when I do a little anything 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.069
 we will say there was really that my 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.329
 first three games that is reflected this 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.310
 that I wanted after the rest I had 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.959
 almost just stuff for the 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.560
 fun frankly it's not something 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.239
 What to do 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.379
 after if you are practically sure 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.209
 to have your first choices it serves to 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.280
 nothing either to take the lead with 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.020
 that and make 45 wants 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.730
 secondary quotation mark that you 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.840
 serve in any way since anyway you 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.280
 you still have a lot of luck 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.330
 to have something that matches 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.220
 your wishes if you have averages 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.190
 okay so after that I landed in 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.090
 first year of computer science 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.590
 it is true that it is quite frankly 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.940
 it's a good training even though I have 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.950
 not held very long because after 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.630
 and all the time the head in the pc's 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.710
 morning at night even if you like that it has 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.020
 ended up becoming heavy 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.280
 so I preferred to stop pretty much at 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.750
 half of the year instead I'm 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.850
 to embark on a training so and the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.500
 to foreign languages ​​applied I know 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.750
 that it seems weird to go from one 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.650
 shot of her at something that is all 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.360
 very different 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.380
 especially the elected therefore was directed 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.210
 to foreign languages ​​so 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.800
 Spanish and English for my part in 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.700
 reality you just have to choose from 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.260
 london in quotation marks we in 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.180
 general these English and another language 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.500
 that you will learn you will do a little 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.640
 of economy and right next end in 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.460
 big is to trade 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.290
 international or translators or teachers of 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.060
 languages ​​that kind of things even though 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.890
 personally down I still do not know 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.970
 what I want to do I continue this 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.320
 training because it's kind of the 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.180
 only I like it but I do not have 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.919
 of precise idea so here I would like 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.570
 know you bakel school path you 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.860
 follow if you have finished your studies or 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.080
 if on the contrary you are still in 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.790
 and what profession makes you dream what 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.890
 course in quotation marks you would like 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.940
 to follow to get there it interests me 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.169
 know a little what you do too 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.760
 on your side since it's true that 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.650
 it's less youtuber but there is when 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.940
 not even me so here I hope 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.830
 even though the video will have you more 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.750
 the gameplay finish at 108.3 as I have 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.400
 said at the beginning and I hope this 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.289
 subject a little bit serious about 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.820
 usually we could please you then in 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.289
 waiting do not hesitate to leave a 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.060
 little like on the video if she ever 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.710
 you liked to comment to subscribe to 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.330
 the chain if it's not done yet and 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.979
 on that good me I tell you are you wearing 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.979
 well at the next udder
