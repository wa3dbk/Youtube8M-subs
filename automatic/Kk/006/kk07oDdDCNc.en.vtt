00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
composer's right I need to see a paper

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.260 
composer's right I need to see a paper
to<00:01:13.820> do<00:01:13.940> that<00:01:14.119> basically<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.050> technique<00:01:15.470> is

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
to do that basically the technique is

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.880 
to do that basically the technique is
basically<00:01:17.020> when<00:01:17.170> you're<00:01:17.289> chumming<00:01:17.469> snare

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
basically when you're chumming snare

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.279 
basically when you're chumming snare
drum<00:01:18.159> it's<00:01:19.090> basically<00:01:19.359> the<00:01:19.479> same<00:01:19.689> thing<00:01:19.750> so

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
drum it's basically the same thing so

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.319 
drum it's basically the same thing so
that's<00:01:20.560> why<00:01:20.679> we<00:01:20.710> drum<00:01:21.100> powwow<00:01:21.609> so<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.149> call

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
that's why we drum powwow so we call

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.590 
that's why we drum powwow so we call
this<00:01:23.039> basically<00:01:24.090> how<00:01:25.090> you're<00:01:25.240> going<00:01:25.329> to<00:01:25.420> play

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
this basically how you're going to play

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480 
this basically how you're going to play
out<00:01:25.719> there<00:01:26.020> that's<00:01:26.920> how<00:01:27.070> you're<00:01:27.219> gonna<00:01:27.280> play

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
out there that's how you're gonna play

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.910 
out there that's how you're gonna play
like<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.179> you<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.079> go<00:01:29.200> home<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.770> don't

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
like this you can go home and you don't

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.580 
like this you can go home and you don't
have<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.189> switch<00:01:30.460> your<00:01:30.579> technique<00:01:31.469> it's<00:01:32.469> not

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
have to switch your technique it's not

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.230 
have to switch your technique it's not
the<00:01:32.740> right<00:01:32.890> technique<00:01:33.369> just<00:01:33.640> our<00:01:33.819> technique

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the right technique just our technique

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.630 
the right technique just our technique
so<00:01:34.840> there's<00:01:35.020> no<00:01:35.110> rule<00:01:35.380> right<00:01:35.619> technique<00:01:36.100> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
so there's no rule right technique and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.149 
so there's no rule right technique and
we<00:01:36.670> use<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:37.000> lot<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.270> front<00:01:37.929> fulcrum<00:01:38.289> which<00:01:39.039> is<00:01:39.130> a

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
we use a lot of front fulcrum which is a

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.559 
we use a lot of front fulcrum which is a
lot<00:01:39.189> of<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:39.490> program<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.909> lot<00:01:40.060> of<00:01:40.149> bass<00:01:40.270> rumors

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
lot of this program a lot of bass rumors

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.059 
lot of this program a lot of bass rumors
use<00:01:40.719> this<00:01:40.869> weapon<00:01:41.079> which<00:01:41.350> I've<00:01:41.469> used<00:01:41.649> this<00:01:41.829> and

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
use this weapon which I've used this and

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.219 
use this weapon which I've used this and
it's<00:01:42.159> all<00:01:42.280> right<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.329> feel<00:01:43.600> if<00:01:43.780> we<00:01:43.899> do<00:01:44.049> that

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
it's all right but I feel if we do that

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.260 
it's all right but I feel if we do that
and<00:01:44.439> kind<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.590> chucks<00:01:44.890> off<00:01:45.069> for<00:01:45.340> residents<00:01:46.240> and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
and kind of chucks off for residents and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:02:05.580 
and kind of chucks off for residents and
stick<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:47.819> lot<00:01:48.819> of<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.110> lot<00:02:05.259> of<00:02:05.319> velocity

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
stick a lot of so it's a lot of velocity

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.589 
stick a lot of so it's a lot of velocity
and<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.810> get<00:02:07.929> that<00:02:08.289> too<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.880> not<00:02:10.209> so

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
and just to get that too so not so

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.030 
and just to get that too so not so
depending<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.260> where<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.680> are<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.010> show

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
depending on where we are in the show

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
there's lots of different techniques

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.350 
there's lots of different techniques
being<00:02:13.720> used<00:02:13.840> at<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.349> time<00:02:14.530> yeah<00:02:15.040> we<00:02:15.910> also<00:02:16.030> used

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
being used at one time yeah we also used

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
being used at one time yeah we also used
a<00:02:16.540> controlled<00:02:17.200> down<00:02:17.440> show<00:02:17.769> which<00:02:18.010> means<00:02:18.220> we

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
a controlled down show which means we

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.550 
a controlled down show which means we
don't<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:19.000> down<00:02:19.180> stroke<00:02:19.569> it<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.350> don't

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
don't you down stroke it but we don't

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.800 
don't you down stroke it but we don't
try<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> keep<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.880> right<00:02:22.000> there<00:02:22.060> we<00:02:22.359> always<00:02:22.540> let

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
try to keep it right there we always let

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.259 
try to keep it right there we always let
it<00:02:22.959> rebound<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.040> we<00:02:24.280> don't<00:02:24.459> discuss<00:02:24.850> like<00:02:25.090> how

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
it rebound so we don't discuss like how

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.270 
it rebound so we don't discuss like how
much<00:02:25.510> or<00:02:25.810> we<00:02:25.900> don't<00:02:25.989> define<00:02:26.410> anything<00:02:26.829> you

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
much or we don't define anything you

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
much or we don't define anything you
just<00:02:27.310> want<00:02:27.609> it<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> be<00:02:27.790> natural<00:02:28.150> that's<00:02:28.870> when

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
just want it to be natural that's when

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.379 
just want it to be natural that's when
you<00:02:29.260> give<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.470> drums<00:02:29.760> make<00:02:30.760> sure<00:02:30.790> you're<00:02:31.120> here

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
you give the drums make sure you're here

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.330 
you give the drums make sure you're here
so<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.930> sense<00:02:31.959> we're<00:02:32.799> letting<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> drum

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
so in a sense we're letting the drum

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.099 
so in a sense we're letting the drum
into<00:02:33.549> talking<00:02:33.760> yeah<00:02:34.090> okay<00:02:34.569> so<00:02:34.900> we're<00:02:35.019> not

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
into talking yeah okay so we're not

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.099 
into talking yeah okay so we're not
check<00:02:35.380> out<00:02:35.530> any<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.859> the<00:02:35.950> sound<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:40.690> makes<00:02:40.959> a

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
check out any of the sound it makes a

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.330 
check out any of the sound it makes a
huge<00:02:41.290> difference<00:02:41.620> when<00:02:41.889> you're<00:02:42.190> listening

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
huge difference when you're listening

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
huge difference when you're listening
from<00:02:42.790> afar<00:02:43.359> especially<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.350> really
