00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
Copenhagen from coast to coast and we've

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.550 
Copenhagen from coast to coast and we've
done<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.540> study<00:00:36.780> on<00:00:36.989> how<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.440> this

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
done a study on how can this

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.880 
done a study on how can this
infrastructure<00:00:38.310> investment<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:40.140> used<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
sort of a create a new form of urbanity

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.020 
sort of a create a new form of urbanity
because<00:00:43.829> Copenhagen<00:00:44.430> already<00:00:44.699> has<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:44.969> a

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
because Copenhagen already has like a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.509 
because Copenhagen already has like a
series<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> urban<00:00:46.140> development's<00:00:46.679> and<00:00:46.859> if<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
series of urban development's and if you

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.639 
series of urban development's and if you
look<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> projected<00:00:49.410> future

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
look at the at the projected future

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
look at the at the projected future
growth<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.219> Copenhagen<00:00:50.670> until<00:00:50.879> 2050<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:52.350> would

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
growth of Copenhagen until 2050 we would

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.410 
growth of Copenhagen until 2050 we would
actually<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.920> able<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.219> accommodate<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.359> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
actually be able to accommodate all of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.650 
actually be able to accommodate all of
the<00:00:54.809> extra<00:00:55.140> urban<00:00:55.289> growth<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.399> region<00:00:56.670> so

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the extra urban growth in this region so

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
the extra urban growth in this region so
we<00:00:58.379> made<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> study<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.010> how<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.969> train

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
we made a study on how this this train

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
we made a study on how this this train
line<00:01:00.480> could<00:01:00.839> not<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> physical

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
line could not only be the physical

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.349 
line could not only be the physical
infrastructure<00:01:02.339> for<00:01:02.579> people<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.969> move<00:01:03.089> around

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
infrastructure for people to move around

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.080 
infrastructure for people to move around
but<00:01:04.199> could<00:01:04.410> also<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.040> infrastructure<00:01:06.000> for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
but could also be the infrastructure for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.940 
but could also be the infrastructure for
like<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.290> recreative<00:01:08.130> spine<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.850> packs<00:01:09.890> sort<00:01:10.890> of
