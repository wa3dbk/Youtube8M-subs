 Well, here I am starting my 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.119

 I'm using avoid what is the s cr 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.669
 remember if I do not have a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.769
 camera a digital camera to be able 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.649
 record my videos yes but we have 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.840
 Experience experience of your liking 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.839
 kane then my channel more than anything 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.449
 will try about applications try to 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.620
 explain some modules without good and 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.260
 be that you want some 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.149
 special application that can be 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.589
 explain uploading some video well then 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.760
 you do not leave it in the comments 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.870
 they come out ok 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.360
 Well, starting with the first 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.989
 application this is mostly for the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.519
 that we have installed we have our 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.030
 rooted in our cell phone and we have 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.280
 installed dye module status bar yes 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
 this one which then in some 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.170
 applications like for example are 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.750
 facebook twitter what is the bar 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.159
 notifications and the navigation that is 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.250
 in my case that I have right now in my 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.070
 nexus 5 this does not do not give us the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.880
 color suitable to the application true 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.619
 then because I 'm going to show you a 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.670
 an application this the truth enough 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.240
 good helped me quite 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.210
 it's called color picker without work les 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 I'll leave the link to the application so that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 download it to those who have 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.750
 installed the status bar dye yes 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.210
 clarified is for users who are 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.580
 is they have their cell phone rooted yes 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.710
 because there is not no other 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.440
 good way I do not know if there is another way 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.220
 ok then this for example let's what 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.710
 which is the real application calc as you see 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.380
 in the part d 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.510
 of navigation as in the part of in the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.549
 Notification bar is in 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.930
 black color so ok then here what 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.990
 only thing we do is take a catch 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.080
 of screen 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.420
 if this one we're going we'll let the 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.840
 color picker app we will touch you 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.540
 here about this image of a camera we 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.400
 we go to the applications to our 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.900
 Gallery 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.840
 we play here and with the finger simply 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.290
 let's go be selecting the color and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.430
 we danced here that is already the part 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.780
 of touch &amp; color 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.170
 that is the code that you are going to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.810
 place in the dye module if in the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.239
 application of the reial calc so that 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.920
 can accommodate them ok then they are two 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.659
 bosses for the default assets and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.099
 then the code that you are going to 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:56.190
 point 58 58 58 ok already an easy color of 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.760
 put we wait for him to load the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.760
 Applications 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.140
 we look for real can 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:13.450
 which is on the top the first 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.450
 that here in the code 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.290
 before they set they put the color and I 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.240
 I will also put in my bar of 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.240
 navigation that met her 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.150
 so we go out here we go in again 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.030
 the application 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.459
 and that's the truth looks good 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.120
 the exact color above all and not be 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.930
 there battling 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.790
 in the box that puts the module for 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.250
 be tuning in the color if instead 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.580
 assimilate fast you and practically 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.989
 it seems that the application of real lime 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.890
 take advantage of what is then all the 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.620
 screen if what we were going to do another 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:05.170
 for example here I have the widgets of 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.810
 of the explorer that most of seen 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.910
 what is it that is easy yes then 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.580
 we are going to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.600
 same do the same a capture of 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.080
 screen 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.080
 yes 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.719
 just like then we go to the part of 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.830
 up good I'm in black down 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:34.009
 so there is one c 1 c 1 c yes 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.169
 then we apply the one below with in 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.169
 three times 48 well 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.730
 We look forward but to search is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.730
 file 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.169
 here it is 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.169
 upper part 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.790
 It was 1611 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.510
 previous and I put it to apply 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.520
 he does not know if he also puts it here because 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.289
 not all applications are sometimes 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.689
 places 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.659
 we produce 48 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:21.409
 although we leave here and go to the 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.209
 application 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.779
 look at the top if I get the 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:28.879
 put it right here is in the part of 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.249
 navigation I do not know why the truth does not 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.860
 put the color over and put me the one above 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:36.729
 if that happens also some other 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.680
 applications then this one 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.300
 let's make a third one last 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.870
 so you have a screenshot 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.470
 also about this 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.300
 this watch that I have if the truth 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.370
 I like it a lot because I use a lot 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.600
 what is the timer if this one 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.660
 well here I have it very effective 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.840
 color will come up as the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.030
 select green and spent what with the ex 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.580
 file if the navigation bar also 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.400
 put the same color yes or there is 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.650
