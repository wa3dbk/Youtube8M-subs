00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the glass is rigid and it's heavy so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.969 
the glass is rigid and it's heavy so
it's<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> keep<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> ground<00:01:16.650> when

any problems at all but the real

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
any problems at all but the real
advantage<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.520> glass<00:01:32.759> over<00:01:33.210> things<00:01:33.420> like

advantage of glass over things like

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.310 
advantage of glass over things like
perspex<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.040> heat<00:01:35.280> retention<00:01:36.320> perspex

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
perspex is the heat retention perspex

perspex is the heat retention perspex
lets<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> heat<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.490> whereas<00:01:39.150> glass

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
lets the heat out again whereas glass

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
lets the heat out again whereas glass
traps<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.950> heat<00:01:41.430> inside<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.750> grow<00:01:42.960> house<00:01:43.229> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
traps the heat inside the grow house so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
traps the heat inside the grow house so
I've<00:01:44.040> been<00:01:44.220> outside<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> early

only a couple of degrees outside and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.590 
only a couple of degrees outside and
that's<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> advantage<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.399> growing<00:02:03.030> under

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that's the advantage of growing under

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.820 
that's the advantage of growing under
glass<00:02:04.009> compared<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> growing<00:02:05.399> under<00:02:06.149> perspex

one of the unique things about the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.589 
one of the unique things about the
access<00:02:11.810> grow<00:02:12.110> house<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:13.550> sliding<00:02:13.910> door

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
access grow house is the sliding door

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.160 
access grow house is the sliding door
system<00:02:15.200> we've<00:02:15.800> got<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.280> good<00:02:16.629> access<00:02:17.629> into

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
system we've got really good access into

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.410 
system we've got really good access into
the<00:02:18.260> grow<00:02:18.470> house<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:19.310> we<00:02:19.430> can<00:02:19.640> slide<00:02:20.150> both

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the grow house and we can slide both

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.290 
the grow house and we can slide both
panels<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.959> we<00:02:21.080> can<00:02:21.290> access<00:02:21.739> both<00:02:22.640> ends<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.209> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
panels so we can access both ends of the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.780 
panels so we can access both ends of the
grow<00:02:23.480> house<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:24.349> also<00:02:24.530> these<00:02:24.830> sliding<00:02:25.370> panels

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
grow house but also these sliding panels

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.509 
grow house but also these sliding panels
give<00:02:26.030> us<00:02:26.120> really<00:02:26.450> excellent<00:02:27.170> ventilation<00:02:27.519> so

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
give us really excellent ventilation so

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.979 
give us really excellent ventilation so
in<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.730> summertime<00:02:29.060> we've<00:02:29.480> got<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> doors

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
the roof glass slides so we can open up

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.800 
the roof glass slides so we can open up
the<00:02:36.170> roof<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.620> let<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> hot<00:02:37.670> air<00:02:37.910> vent<00:02:38.599> out

up in there even though it might be
freezing<00:03:10.730> cold<00:03:11.000> outside<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.769> what<00:03:12.920> we<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.130> do

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
freezing cold outside so what we can do

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.910 
freezing cold outside so what we can do
is<00:03:13.400> open<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> doors<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.420> an<00:03:14.540> inch<00:03:14.720> or<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:14.989> let

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
is open the doors just an inch or so let

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.069 
is open the doors just an inch or so let
the<00:03:16.069> air<00:03:16.220> move<00:03:16.609> around<00:03:17.030> inside<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.930> grow

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
the air move around inside the grow

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.960 
the air move around inside the grow
house<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:19.069> prevents<00:03:19.519> us<00:03:19.639> having

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
house and that prevents us having

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.530 
house and that prevents us having
disease<00:03:20.630> problems<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:22.639> other<00:03:22.850> unique<00:03:23.269> thing

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
disease problems the other unique thing

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.629 
disease problems the other unique thing
about<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.930> access<00:03:24.290> grow<00:03:24.530> house<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:25.069> the

getting<00:03:54.349> down<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.950> lower<00:03:55.160> levels<00:03:55.639> if<00:03:56.239> we

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
getting down to the lower levels if we

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.099 
getting down to the lower levels if we
used<00:03:56.599> thick<00:03:57.079> wooden<00:03:57.560> slats<00:03:58.010> then<00:03:58.910> we're

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
used thick wooden slats then we're

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.720 
used thick wooden slats then we're
creating<00:04:00.109> permanent<00:04:00.380> shadows<00:04:01.069> and<00:04:01.250> we're

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
creating permanent shadows and we're

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.970 
creating permanent shadows and we're
minimizing<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.540> amount<00:04:02.690> of<00:04:02.900> light<00:04:03.500> that's

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
minimizing the amount of light that's

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.940 
minimizing the amount of light that's

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
going to get down to the bottom now our

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.280 
going to get down to the bottom now our

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
shelves are adjustable height wise so if

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.990 
shelves are adjustable height wise so if
you've<00:04:09.380> got<00:04:09.500> seed<00:04:10.010> trays<00:04:10.280> on<00:04:10.489> there<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:10.849> can

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
you've got seed trays on there you can

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.550 
you've got seed trays on there you can
have<00:04:11.120> them<00:04:11.239> closer<00:04:11.480> together<00:04:11.780> if<00:04:12.290> you've<00:04:12.410> got

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
have them closer together if you've got

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.710 
have them closer together if you've got
bigger<00:04:12.769> plants<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.639> can<00:04:13.819> move<00:04:14.299> them<00:04:14.510> further

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
bigger plants you can move them further

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.520

but<00:04:15.919> you<00:04:16.010> can<00:04:16.160> also<00:04:16.310> remove<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.390> shelves<00:04:17.659> if

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
but you can also remove the shelves if

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.690 
but you can also remove the shelves if
you<00:04:18.169> want<00:04:18.380> to<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:18.890> can<00:04:19.010> either<00:04:19.099> completely

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
you want to you can either completely

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.580 
you want to you can either completely
take<00:04:19.909> them<00:04:20.120> out<00:04:20.269> or<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.859> can

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
take them out or you can

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.090 
take them out or you can
put<00:04:23.270> them<00:04:24.270> flat<00:04:24.570> against<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.230> back<00:04:25.620> so

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
put them flat against the back so

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.550 
put them flat against the back so
they're<00:04:26.400> out<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.910> way<00:04:26.940> but<00:04:27.600> still<00:04:27.780> within

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
they're out of the way but still within

they're out of the way but still within
the<00:04:28.860> grow<00:04:29.040> house<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.300> can<00:04:30.450> see<00:04:30.480> here

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
the grow house and you can see here

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.230 
the grow house and you can see here
we've<00:04:31.380> got<00:04:31.410> all<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.770> these<00:04:31.980> holes<00:04:32.700> along<00:04:33.090> the

we've got all of these holes along the

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.650 
we've got all of these holes along the
back<00:04:33.390> so<00:04:33.690> we<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:34.350> change<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:35.250> height<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
back so we can change the height of the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.580 
back so we can change the height of the
shelving<00:04:37.140> in<00:04:37.350> there<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.870> access<00:04:40.170> grow<00:04:40.380> house

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
when it gets the autumn time then we can

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.790 
when it gets the autumn time then we can
start<00:05:23.760> planting<00:05:24.120> salad<00:05:25.050> crops<00:05:25.230> that<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:25.620> can

start planting salad crops that we can

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.220 
start planting salad crops that we can
be<00:05:25.920> harvesting<00:05:26.700> right<00:05:26.940> up<00:05:27.120> till<00:05:27.330> Christmas<00:05:27.780> we
