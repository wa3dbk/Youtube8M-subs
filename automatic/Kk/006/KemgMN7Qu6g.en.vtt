snow<00:00:04.170> blower<00:00:04.440> it<00:00:05.100> was<00:00:05.250> given<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.580> me<00:00:05.700> by<00:00:05.850> a

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
snow blower it was given to me by a

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.360 
snow blower it was given to me by a
friend<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.990> it<00:00:07.410> didn't<00:00:07.620> run<00:00:07.710> very<00:00:07.950> well<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.160> had

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
friend and it didn't run very well I had

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.160 
friend and it didn't run very well I had
some<00:00:08.550> carburetor<00:00:09.000> problems<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.750> fixed

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
some carburetor problems that I fixed

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.650 
some carburetor problems that I fixed
and<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.250> auger<00:00:11.429> belt<00:00:11.730> was<00:00:11.940> slipping<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> put

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
and the auger belt was slipping so I put

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660 
and the auger belt was slipping so I put
a<00:00:12.690> new<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.110> there<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:14.070> one<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.219> got<00:00:14.490> though

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
a new one on there the one I got though

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.220 
a new one on there the one I got though
is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.849> little<00:00:14.969> short<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.630> auger<00:00:15.870> runs<00:00:16.049> all

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
is a little short so the auger runs all

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.140 
is a little short so the auger runs all
the<00:00:16.260> time<00:00:16.379> now<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.580> still<00:00:17.820> would<00:00:17.940> only

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the time now but it still would only

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.480 
the time now but it still would only
throw<00:00:18.359> snow<00:00:18.630> about<00:00:19.020> three<00:00:19.470> feet<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.949> less<00:00:20.220> it

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
throw snow about three feet or less it

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.910 
throw snow about three feet or less it
was<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.970> anemic<00:00:21.359> ly<00:00:21.480> powered<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
was really anemic ly powered to the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
was really anemic ly powered to the
point<00:00:23.130> where<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.519> useless<00:00:23.910> well

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
point where it's pretty useless well

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.880 
point where it's pretty useless well
they<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.869> run<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> internet<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> little

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
they can run on the internet a little

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.250 
they can run on the internet a little
bit<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.010> found<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.460> modification<00:00:27.260> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
bit I found this modification that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
bit I found this modification that
essentially<00:00:28.769> put<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.220> rubber<00:00:29.580> paddle<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.300> to

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
essentially put a rubber paddle on to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
essentially put a rubber paddle on to
each<00:00:30.660> blade<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> fan<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
each blade of the fan of this thing and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.280 
each blade of the fan of this thing and
it<00:00:32.880> said<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.239> would<00:00:33.360> almost<00:00:33.480> double<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it said it would almost double the the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870 
it said it would almost double the the
throwing<00:00:34.649> distance<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.130> machine<00:00:35.430> well<00:00:35.730> in

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
throwing distance of the machine well in

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
throwing distance of the machine well in
this<00:00:36.000> case<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.570> being<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.290> old<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.620> worn<00:00:37.829> out

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
this case it being so old and worn out

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.520 
this case it being so old and worn out
it<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.059> did<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.750> excellent<00:00:40.140> job<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it really did a an excellent job in

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.590 
it really did a an excellent job in
making<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.070> thing<00:00:41.309> throw<00:00:41.610> throw<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.300> snow

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
making this thing throw throw some snow

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.110 
making this thing throw throw some snow
now<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.829> was<00:00:43.980> supposed<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> snow<00:00:44.700> last<00:00:44.940> night

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now it was supposed to snow last night

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639 
now it was supposed to snow last night
we're<00:00:45.420> supposed<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> foot

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we're supposed to have like about a foot

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
we're supposed to have like about a foot

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
it didn't so I had to move some snow off

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
it didn't so I had to move some snow off
kind<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> gather<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> could<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> give<00:00:51.629> us<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.209 
kind of gather all I could to give us a
nice<00:00:51.960> patch<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:52.739> pretty<00:00:52.890> thick

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
stuff so we're going to go ahead give it

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
stuff so we're going to go ahead give it
a<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.340> how<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> McGill<00:00:57.180> sin<00:00:57.420> can

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
a go and see how this McGill sin can

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.350 
a go and see how this McGill sin can
push<00:00:57.960> some<00:00:57.989> snow
