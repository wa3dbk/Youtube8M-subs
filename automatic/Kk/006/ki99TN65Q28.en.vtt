can reminisce about the times when we
were<00:05:28.120> younger<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.840> ups<00:05:29.020> and<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.259> downs

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
were younger the ups and the downs

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.820 
were younger the ups and the downs
that's<00:05:31.270> really<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.380> part<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:32.680> I

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
that's really that's the part that I

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.370 
that's really that's the part that I
thoroughly<00:05:33.280> enjoy<00:05:33.789> is<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.210> reuniting<00:05:35.169> of<00:05:35.169> the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
thoroughly enjoy is the reuniting of the

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.400 
thoroughly enjoy is the reuniting of the
family<00:05:35.740> again<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.870> think<00:05:37.870> by<00:05:38.110> being

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
family again I think by being

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.980 
family again I think by being
interracial<00:05:38.919> it<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.490> a<00:05:39.520> true<00:05:40.330> advantage

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
interracial it is a true advantage

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.050 
interracial it is a true advantage
because<00:05:41.289> I'm<00:05:41.680> exposed<00:05:42.159> to<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.400> black<00:05:42.639> holter

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
because I'm exposed to the black holter
