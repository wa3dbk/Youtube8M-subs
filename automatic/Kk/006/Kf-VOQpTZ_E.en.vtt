in<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.769> reason<00:02:54.040> why<00:02:54.129> i<00:02:54.189> left<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.519> seeds<00:02:54.760> on

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
in the reason why i left the seeds on

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.970 
in the reason why i left the seeds on
them<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.180> because<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.290> seeds<00:02:56.650> have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
them is because the seeds have

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
them is because the seeds have
incredible<00:02:57.489> properties<00:02:57.939> to<00:02:58.180> all<00:02:59.109> right<00:02:59.290> we're

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500
