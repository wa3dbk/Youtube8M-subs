00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello for the members of the soul 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.700
 and in the series a song a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.849
 rhythmic today an accompaniment 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.799
 for the neighbors of renan luce we see 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.120
 the version on the musical play back in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.340
 detail a little bit the technique in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.340
 guitar question just after 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.739
 12 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.739
 str 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.880
 I quickly and naturally on 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.760
 titular patients 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.120
 tomorrow 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:01:00.670
 anyway I do not know who to 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 tell technician in the us navy climb 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.660
 m 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:19.140
 ok so the stop will be valid for 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:21.990
 the whole song 1 we'll try the 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.340
 detail a little bit and the first 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 thing to clarify is that in terms of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 reasons 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:36.950
 here our rhythmic patterns will be stalled in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:39.780
 done on two beats that will give this 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 so here I'm talking about two teeth in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.090
 question besides the motive on the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.090
 first agreement for example 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.200
 so will detail her on the first 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.420
 time we are dealing with two close to the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.820
 right hand we attack with the fingers 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 on the first close we will attack the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.250
 normal bass of the agreement ie 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.830
 for the minor here it will be passed 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.920
 fifth string and so we will attack it 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.900
 with the thumb down 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.380
 first-note first-time for the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.640
 2nd crooked always of the first time 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.590
 this time we will attack the strings 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.709
 number 2 and number 3 with respectively 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.900
 major and index with the technique of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:36.099
 bread is like this our body keys 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:38.019
 whole body of number two major 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:47.440
 like number 3 and nex and both 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:51.940
 together so first time summarizes for 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.650
 the second time we will have two new 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.630
 relatives 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.150
 so first quaver of the second time 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.110
 we will change the bath that will take the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.690
 bass which will then be the bassetiere 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.280
 or the basis when of the agreement has the grade 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.950
 it's for him the power plant in Kent is 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.950
 to say precisely the 6th string 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.180
 always with the thumb and for the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.370
 second crash of the second time on 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:25.640
 will find the beginnings the same way 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:29.740
 than for the first one and so have we going 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.740
 associate the two times now 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.459
 first time a second time on the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.459
 tempo 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.360
 this is obviously the motive 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.010
 will repeat itself and who therefore had to in two 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.709
 time by which means that this motive 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.900
 it will have to be played twice for each 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.850
 measured 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.520
 and when when will an agreement last so 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.959
 of measures wrongly patterned four times 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.550
 Obviously, we will still make a 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.230
 little precision as to 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.660
 interpretation this time 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.120
 This is the basic reason without the addition 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.130
 I was going to say normally with the group 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.690
 on the other hand treble to be a little 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.750
 in the rank of the piece l interest to 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:28.400
 have an aggressive right hand attack 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:31.370
 to the major indexes quite dry and the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.960
 second thing to try left hand of 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.860
 cut a little bit is it to say 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.450
 that as soon as we attack is here in fact 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.210
 intuitively released a little the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.770
 finger pressure so that the 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:51.400
 resonance not miss that from as 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:51.400
 steve worth a loincloth and earlier 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:04.850
 that's going to be more in the spirit of 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:07.520
 piece because the chord will have strings to 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.180
 empty but I'm hard not to let go 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.200
 so either we do not care about it either but 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.030
 not right that we always have the solution 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.440
 as soon as we attack and so that's good 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.810
 useful it's not obvious you 're trying to 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.830
 feel it as soon as you attack and 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.180
 rest your fingers right away on the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.570
 ropes as if I'm on the ground 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.370
 the two bodies in questions that are 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.289
 a term and treble that I attack who 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.539
 are there reminds the second the 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:38.240
 third string are greedy at the level of 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.550
 the chord here and so to mute the sound 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:51.110
 I attack him and must rest from 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:54.260
 This is a small clarification as to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.220
 interpretation to put a little 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.229
 little in context 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.500
 so in fact one I'm going to play the intro 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:03.650
 since she's not riding on on the 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.140
 score and the intro actually consists of 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.370
 to play two measures of the minor and of 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.930
 measures of F major as a result of 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.210
 measurements in A minor 2009 major art 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.770
 casares and this cost can therefore the minor 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.150
 F major players better than you 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.150
 rent as many times as you want 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.860
 in the piece these two times problem 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.740
 it's twice the minor the minor fa 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.530
 major fa major so the minor the 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.659
 minor F major by a day by the way 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.690
 we will find this passage 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:35.870
 that too is not noted on the score 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:38.630
 between when will we resume part 1 that 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.980
 you will find on the score 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.520
 before resuming the party must 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:50.940
 redo this couple minor f major 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:51.710
 before we really resume 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.910
 following text 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.860
 knowing that on this part anyway 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.220
 the cats of the patterns lay and I 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.540
 always preferred neighbors to birds 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.250
 that's it but you'll hear it that will be 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.830
 specified in the comments of any 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.780
 way that's trying to make it work 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.300
 your dream is not in your ear 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.050
 to complete a little bit the score 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:33.750
 the rendering of the street nor that to finish a 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:36.260
 little bit is gone I told in 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.260
 the ground creaks 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.150
 we are generally at the party to 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:59.419
 you will find on the score 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:05.000
 score that is on the site always 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:07.060
 same age partition and I tell you to 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.060
 soon
