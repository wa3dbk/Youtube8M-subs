supply the monster power supply there in
case<00:00:57.490> i<00:00:57.640> installed<00:00:58.000> several<00:00:58.270> video<00:00:58.990> cards<00:00:59.380> I

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
case i installed several video cards I

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.340 
case i installed several video cards I
need<00:00:59.650> enough<00:00:59.860> power<00:01:00.130> to<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.870> going<00:01:02.079> so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
need enough power to get that going so

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.780 
need enough power to get that going so
that's<00:01:02.500> why<00:01:02.650> I<00:01:02.680> always<00:01:02.890> have<00:01:03.190> large<00:01:03.490> power

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
that's why I always have large power

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.910 
that's why I always have large power
supplies<00:01:04.150> in<00:01:04.360> my<00:01:04.510> in<00:01:04.750> my<00:01:04.780> cases<00:01:05.320> sometimes<00:01:05.830> I

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
button there for it ok so you would just

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.430 
button there for it ok so you would just
install<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.560> on<00:02:11.770> your<00:02:12.040> around

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
install this on your around

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.440 
install this on your around
on<00:02:12.620> your<00:02:12.860> slots<00:02:13.280> at<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.640> back<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.880> your<00:02:14.180> case

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
on your slots at the back of your case

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.250 
on your slots at the back of your case
and<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:16.280> that's<00:02:16.460> about<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.790> attach<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.750> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
and and that's about it attach the the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.900 
and and that's about it attach the the
power<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> course<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> touch

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
power to it of course you have to touch

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.630 
power to it of course you have to touch
the<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:22.250> sleeve<00:02:22.690> long<00:02:23.690> cord<00:02:24.470> has<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> plug<00:02:25.460> on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the the sleeve long cord has a plug on

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.670 
the the sleeve long cord has a plug on
it<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.330> one<00:02:26.660> end<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.930> would<00:02:27.050> plug<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.500> in

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it so on one end you would plug that in

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.590 
it so on one end you would plug that in
right<00:02:28.040> there<00:02:28.250> let<00:02:28.460> me<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:28.700> open<00:02:28.820> this<00:02:29.390> up

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
right there let me just open this up

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.680 
right there let me just open this up
here<00:02:29.840> no<00:02:29.960> show<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:30.770> what<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.010> mean<00:02:31.100> here<00:02:32.000> okay
