00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.760
 the 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.999
 this year 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:20.310
 or he said 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.499
 on the margins 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:22.769
 usual 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 these in the bin 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:29.649
 three centimeters full of potting soil 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.170
 therefore it may be that you are 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.810
 and we make the soil moist 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 and then the plastic is nice 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.640
 often the ground 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 or as a little comfort 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 we are going to suspend the case 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.620
 the figures of the debate is very small 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 as you can see 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 speak upright 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 and then they are open to us 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.230
 after the ek in this layer 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.440
 with centimeters 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.440
 potting soil 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600
 scatter internos and 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.900
 distribute evenly 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 and now the soil is damp 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.039
 so 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.029
 and I think I am down 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.269
 with plastic 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.879
 that's why you get it 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.879
 a greenhouse effect 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.499
 the packages come through the ground 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.199
 to grab plastic 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.579
 put you is easy to people who work in the office 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 that accelerated 

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.789
 Goodluck 

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:48.259
 this was hard 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:49.109
 until next time
