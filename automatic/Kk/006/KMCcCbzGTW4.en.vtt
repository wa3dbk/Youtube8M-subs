you'll see like later on the video what
he<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.510> building<00:00:33.810> and<00:00:34.370> what<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> map<00:00:35.700> looks

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
he is building and what the map looks

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
he is building and what the map looks
like<00:00:36.270> later<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.930> does<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.470> kind<00:00:37.740> of<00:00:37.800> cool

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
like later on it does look kind of cool

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.950 
like later on it does look kind of cool
there<00:00:38.580> are<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> lot<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:38.970> problems<00:00:39.480> with<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.780> map

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
there are a lot of problems with the map

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.070 
there are a lot of problems with the map
later<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.470> that<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:41.040> fixed<00:00:41.810> at<00:00:42.810> least

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
later on that can be fixed at least

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.690 
later on that can be fixed at least
aesthetic<00:00:43.590> why's<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.130> could<00:00:44.280> look<00:00:44.400> a<00:00:44.520> lot

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
aesthetic why's it could look a lot

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.200 
aesthetic why's it could look a lot
better<00:00:45.410> just<00:00:46.410> overall<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:48.180> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
better just overall there's a lot of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.610 
better just overall there's a lot of
things<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:48.690> could<00:00:48.840> look<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.200> better<00:00:49.350> with

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
things they could look a lot better with

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.050 
things they could look a lot better with
this<00:00:49.710> map<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.730> just

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
this map but this is more of just

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.230 
this map but this is more of just
beginner<00:00:51.780> building<00:00:52.350> techniques<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.160> Halo<00:00:54.000> 4

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
map ravine and he's you know over the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.020 
map ravine and he's you know over the
water<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.170> stuff<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:01.710> guys<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.950> said<00:01:02.850> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
me but they did say in the last video

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.459 
me but they did say in the last video
you<00:01:08.490> can<00:01:08.850> build<00:01:09.149> all<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.749> way<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.109> to<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
you can build all the way down to the

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.639 
you can build all the way down to the
water<00:01:10.850> okay<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.570> build<00:01:12.749> very<00:01:13.380> high

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
water okay and you can build very high

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.149 
water okay and you can build very high
up<00:01:13.859> I<00:01:14.310> don't<00:01:14.909> know<00:01:15.060> exactly<00:01:15.689> how<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.920> on

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
up I don't know exactly how I up but on

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980 
up I don't know exactly how I up but on
the<00:01:17.460> ravine<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.539> forerunner

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the ravine like on the forerunner

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
the ravine like on the forerunner
structure<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.039> there<00:01:20.219> on<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
structure that's right there on that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.520 
structure that's right there on that
island<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:21.299> are<00:01:21.479> able<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> build<00:01:22.079> in<00:01:22.350> that

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
island you are able to build in that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.859 
island you are able to build in that
little<00:01:22.829> circular<00:01:23.189> disk<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.329> high<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
little circular disk up high on the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.179 
little circular disk up high on the
forerunner<00:01:25.409> such<00:01:25.710> structure<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.929> at<00:01:28.499> least<00:01:28.979> we

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
forerunner such structure so at least we

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.649 
forerunner such structure so at least we
know<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> could<00:01:29.700> build<00:01:29.819> that<00:01:30.030> high<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> reason

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
know we could build that high the reason

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.559 
know we could build that high the reason
why<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:31.399> had<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.609> going<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.179> that<00:01:33.329> heís

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
why they had that going up that heís

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:34.849 
why they had that going up that heís
because<00:01:33.990> they<00:01:34.079> said<00:01:34.289> it<00:01:34.319> would<00:01:34.499> be<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.649> lot<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
because they said it would be a lot of

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.559 
because they said it would be a lot of
fun<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.219> have<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> warthog<00:01:35.999> jumping

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
fun to have like a warthog jumping

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:38.330 
fun to have like a warthog jumping
through<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.319> in<00:01:37.499> the<00:01:37.619> race<00:01:37.799> map<00:01:38.069> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
through that like in the race map and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.919 
through that like in the race map and
stuff<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:39.060> they're<00:01:39.240> thinking<00:01:39.569> about<00:01:39.630> us

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
stuff see they're thinking about us

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.069 
stuff see they're thinking about us
racers<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.649> stuff<00:01:40.889> so<00:01:41.069> that's<00:01:41.249> pretty<00:01:41.429> good

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
racers and stuff so that's pretty good

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.209 
racers and stuff so that's pretty good
but<00:01:43.079> yeah<00:01:43.229> he's<00:01:43.530> sitting<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:43.829> starting<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
but yeah he's sitting there starting to

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.340 
but yeah he's sitting there starting to
build<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.700> he<00:01:44.850> starts<00:01:45.209> using<00:01:45.389> the<00:01:45.719> you<00:01:46.229> know

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
build and he starts using the you know

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.739 
build and he starts using the you know
magnetic<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.700> thing<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.479> going

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
magnetic little thing and that's going

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.660 
magnetic little thing and that's going
to<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:48.959> so<00:01:49.409> amazing<00:01:49.859> to<00:01:50.069> be<00:01:50.280> able<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> use<00:01:50.639> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to be so amazing to be able to use that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
to be so amazing to be able to use that
so<00:01:50.969> much<00:01:51.149> faster<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.200> sure<00:01:52.469> everything's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so much faster to make sure everything's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.309 
so much faster to make sure everything's
nice<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.219> flush<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.969> that's<00:01:54.149> imperfect<00:01:55.109> I

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
nice and flush and that's imperfect I

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.279 
nice and flush and that's imperfect I
know<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.639> that<00:01:56.969> irritates<00:01:57.209> me<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.049> much

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
know that that irritates me so much

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.199 
know that that irritates me so much
whenever<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.249> know<00:01:59.369> I'm<00:01:59.459> playing<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.029> reach

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
whenever you know I'm playing and reach

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.779 
whenever you know I'm playing and reach
and<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.959> trying<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> get<00:02:01.469> something

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
and I'm trying to get something

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.749 
and I'm trying to get something
perfectly<00:02:02.789> level<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.959> other<00:02:04.109> thing<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
perfectly level with the other thing and

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.459 
perfectly level with the other thing and
you're<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.939> constantly<00:02:06.389> going<00:02:06.779> up<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.200> little

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
you're just constantly going up a little

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.800 
you're just constantly going up a little
bit<00:02:07.590> over<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.209> below<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
bit over then a little bit below it a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
bit over then a little bit below it a
little<00:02:09.989> bit<00:02:10.200> above<00:02:10.439> it<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.739> little<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.069> below

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
little bit above it a little bit below

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
little bit above it a little bit below
it<00:02:11.519> and<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.659> really<00:02:12.750> irritating<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.650> this

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
it and so it's really irritating so this

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.070 
it and so it's really irritating so this
will

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
will

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.810 
will

magnetic snap thing is going to be

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.400 
magnetic snap thing is going to be
really<00:02:16.150> awesome<00:02:16.420> it's<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.350> be

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
really awesome it's going to be

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.480 
really awesome it's going to be
extremely<00:02:17.650> useful<00:02:18.070> also<00:02:20.100> although<00:02:21.100> this

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
extremely useful also although this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
isn't really that great of a video like

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.720 
isn't really that great of a video like

building techniques of him building a

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.890 
building techniques of him building a
map<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.220> know<00:03:03.850> just<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.330> playing<00:03:04.630> around

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
map and you know just you playing around

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.660 
map and you know just you playing around
in<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> map<00:03:05.410> which<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.890> map<00:03:06.100> does<00:03:06.430> actually

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
in the map which that map does actually

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.670 
in the map which that map does actually
look<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.270> know<00:03:07.390> fairly<00:03:07.750> decent<00:03:08.290> looks<00:03:08.470> pretty

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.350 
cool but there are a lot of things that
needs<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.140> be<00:03:11.260> fixed<00:03:11.500> about<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.010> map<00:03:12.190> or<00:03:12.820> added

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
needs to be fixed about the map or added

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.780 
needs to be fixed about the map or added
on<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.600> map<00:03:13.990> to<00:03:14.950> make<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.310> little<00:03:15.459> bit<00:03:15.610> more

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
on the map to make it a little bit more

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.900 
on the map to make it a little bit more
fun<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.890> know<00:03:18.040> you're<00:03:18.550> sitting<00:03:18.880> here

complaining about how small these forge
maps<00:03:57.880> are<00:03:58.150> guys<00:03:58.810> these<00:03:59.260> maps<00:03:59.560> aren't<00:03:59.920> small

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
maps are guys these maps aren't small

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.640 
maps are guys these maps aren't small
yes<00:04:00.760> they<00:04:01.030> aren't<00:04:01.390> as<00:04:01.510> big<00:04:01.810> as<00:04:02.019> forge<00:04:02.380> world

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
yes they aren't as big as forge world

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.699 
yes they aren't as big as forge world
forgeworld<00:04:03.370> was<00:04:03.850> enormous<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:05.470> guys

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
forgeworld was enormous but guys

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.699 
forgeworld was enormous but guys
remember<00:04:05.820> what<00:04:06.820> does<00:04:07.269> did<00:04:07.780> anyone<00:04:08.170> build<00:04:08.500> a

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
remember what does did anyone build a

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.310 
remember what does did anyone build a
map<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.250> was<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.090> size<00:04:10.390> of<00:04:10.690> forged<00:04:11.080> world

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
map that was the size of forged world

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.670 
map that was the size of forged world
that<00:04:12.040> was<00:04:12.250> good<00:04:12.519> there<00:04:13.450> no<00:04:13.720> there<00:04:14.140> was<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:14.620> a

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
that was good there no there was not a

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.920 
that was good there no there was not a
map<00:04:15.100> that<00:04:15.130> was<00:04:15.519> good<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:16.180> was<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.510> size<00:04:16.780> of

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
map that was good that was the size of

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.900 
map that was good that was the size of
forge<00:04:17.200> world<00:04:17.410> all<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.070> maps<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.519> were<00:04:18.669> that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
forge world all the maps that were that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.390 
forge world all the maps that were that
big<00:04:19.180> or<00:04:19.450> horrible<00:04:20.169> maps<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.950> there's<00:04:21.190> really

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
big or horrible maps so there's really

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.490 
big or horrible maps so there's really
no<00:04:21.760> point<00:04:22.090> in<00:04:22.300> having<00:04:22.510> something<00:04:22.990> that<00:04:23.140> big

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
no point in having something that big

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400 
no point in having something that big
also<00:04:24.030> there's<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.240> like<00:04:25.660> creates<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.140> lot<00:04:26.289> of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
also there's it like creates a lot of

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.720 
also there's it like creates a lot of
lag<00:04:26.650> and<00:04:26.950> stuff<00:04:27.190> having

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
lag and stuff having

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.110 
lag and stuff having
map<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.330> big<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.860> you<00:04:30.340> know<00:04:30.610> because<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.970> has

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
map that big so you know because it has

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.420 
map that big so you know because it has
to<00:04:31.300> render<00:04:31.630> out<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.900> has<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.170> process<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:33.070> rest

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
to render out it has to process the rest

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.890 
to render out it has to process the rest
of<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.730> map<00:04:33.910> even<00:04:34.240> though<00:04:34.330> you're<00:04:34.510> playing<00:04:34.780> on

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
of the map even though you're playing on

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.310 
of the map even though you're playing on
a<00:04:34.960> small<00:04:35.350> little<00:04:35.590> space<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:37.570> guys<00:04:37.810> I<00:04:37.960> just<00:04:37.990> want

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
a small little space so guys I just want

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.690 
a small little space so guys I just want
to<00:04:38.380> explain<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.830> real<00:04:39.010> quick<00:04:39.220> i'll<00:04:39.370> probably

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700

to explain that real quick i'll probably
do<00:04:39.940> another<00:04:39.970> video<00:04:40.390> over<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:40.870> little<00:04:41.080> bit

do another video over a little bit
lighter<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:42.390> 343<00:04:43.390> has<00:04:43.750> said<00:04:44.080> that<00:04:44.500> these<00:04:44.740> maps

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
lighter and 343 has said that these maps

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.160 
lighter and 343 has said that these maps
are<00:04:45.310> big<00:04:45.910> with<00:04:46.210> someone<00:04:46.540> actually<00:04:46.690> told<00:04:46.900> me

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
are big with someone actually told me

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.100 
are big with someone actually told me
that<00:04:47.380> they<00:04:47.560> cannot<00:04:47.890> fit<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.580> btb<00:04:49.330> map<00:04:49.690> or<00:04:49.900> Reis

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
that they cannot fit a btb map or Reis

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.020 
that they cannot fit a btb map or Reis
map<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.530> them<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:51.460> was<00:04:51.610> like<00:04:51.760> you're

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.790 
map in them and I was like you're
completely<00:04:52.420> retarded<00:04:52.870> I<00:04:53.200> didn't<00:04:53.590> say<00:04:53.770> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
completely retarded I didn't say that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.440

but I was thinking it but you know these

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.360 
but I was thinking it but you know these
maps<00:04:58.720> are<00:04:58.900> big<00:04:59.170> guys<00:04:59.380> don't<00:04:59.800> worry<00:05:00.010> about<00:05:00.070> it

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
maps are big guys don't worry about it

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.370 
maps are big guys don't worry about it
you<00:05:00.460> can<00:05:00.580> fit<00:05:00.760> any<00:05:00.970> map<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.450> want<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.870> build<00:05:02.050> in

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
you can fit any map you want to build in

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.890 
you can fit any map you want to build in
to<00:05:03.010> you<00:05:03.370> know<00:05:03.490> these<00:05:03.880> maps<00:05:04.150> so<00:05:04.450> it's<00:05:04.690> going<00:05:04.810> to

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
to you know these maps so it's going to

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.930 
to you know these maps so it's going to
be<00:05:04.960> really<00:05:05.140> nice<00:05:05.380> can't<00:05:05.800> wait<00:05:05.860> to<00:05:06.070> play<00:05:06.220> you
