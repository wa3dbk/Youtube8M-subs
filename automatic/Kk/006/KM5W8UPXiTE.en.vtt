00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.580
 bidart body as well as defining the behavior of the application and 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.629

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.300

 interim crossed and here we can activate or deactivate 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.310
 we fear we can not define the synchronization if we are going to adapt 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.879
 issue to be synchronized 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.290

 so let's say a frequency 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.970

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 If we do not want you to ask us before doing it 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 I have defined that the source of leader of articles 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 the order of unread items pct 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.160
 we see how its simple and we go direct for the own creation of river 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.980
 we already have synchronized with our google ryder account with all 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.080

 if we had any note attached to any news we can define and see 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.990
 from here 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.660
 we see how we will have the ends on one hand and of course the folders that 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.489
 we have defined we sit in one of them we see the most read news 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.080
 as well as proven 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.320

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.299
 days 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.209
 we also put a voice to the icon we have the news that we share 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.829
 if we go back to the least general of the rider we see how we can see three options 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.889
 first favorites then the noble ideas 

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:34.969

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.480
 and the icon on the right we will be able to recharge 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.120

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.120

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
 It baffled me how the application is very simple and very fast 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.139
 even as we say 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.359
