00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.349
 So to another attraction of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.869
 nintendo land in this case it was the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.309
 evaluates to play along with michel 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 it next to me 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 He takes over the classic mediating 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.059
 Umsteuerung and it is heavy on the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.769
 pad mario instance to drive and now 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.210
 he goes the special feature that it is two 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.210
 coins are playing game 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:57.560
 put two games on the disengage 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:12.800
 items passed 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:31.229
 play makes you smart are stupid though 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:34.380
 just the experience makes guidance like 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.990
 said this mario steer and open 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.329
 you can view my screen 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.060
 Steinfeld of all things 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:57.689
 counter and here a certain 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 lead time to look up but one has 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:07.039
 Two player mode is there when the death 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.039
 supported by yoshi is the billionaire 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:20.599
 so planned 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.360
 this system that appears now is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.360
 the star that does not come up behind 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 shot past 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.920
 quickly with more mixing beneficial 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.819
 his 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.819
 as a small round 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.090
 the Hessian wins justified 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 first two games with mode 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.560
 otherwise keep hunting on mario 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:15.810
 repetition makes here no matter 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.549
 If anyone continues to think the case I 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.780
 or always not bad 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:28.010
 far is too stupid to me why is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.010
 just a second round 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.950
 we'll see 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.440
 classic radius number is also with 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.440
 there 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:53.180
 then also with the time a job free 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:54.590
 So also plays all but the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 We can not do it, I'm told 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:05.189
 run left and rusty 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:15.709
 otherwise apply in the meantime other 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:15.709
 Stahlkreuz does not doubt action 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.650
 It was very good 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:42.819
 Batteries can now come from the deer 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:47.560
 is a bit of a push against 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.560
 the special features until 10 o'clock for me 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:57.699
 We had arrived a little bit annoyed 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.699
 look that the machine is coming 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.160
 that was good now, actually 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:27.830
 So yoshi's fruits have been from the 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.830
 Good at least one cinema country 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.349
 such a beautiful sight 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:45.990
 very tight box 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:48.029
 but now he has our tests home 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.419
 found and then controls a fun game 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:53.120
 to five is five times better 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.189
 but then we 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:59.870
 Thanks for watching and see you soon 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.870
 next, first, attractions
