00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello dear users, I 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.280
 I welcome all those who are viewing 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:11.389
 This video is a review from the Internet. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.509
 stores kindness point ru zebra boxing . 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.570
 today we will introduce you not with a toy 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.060
 this is home security system 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.900
 and not needing the inclusion roll 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 to outside organizations that form you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.340
 what exactly happens in your house 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.830
 your home 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.430
 via the gsm network i.e. it can 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.110
 calls to your specified you specified 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.850
 mobile phone either sends 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.700
 relevant message itself 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.129
 but the box is so plain but at the same time 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.039
 inside is a very interesting product in general 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.649
 which we use on our universal 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.489
 then our houses are also about the same 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:01.620
 stand alarm look carefully 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:05.369
 what exactly do we have here 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.979
 In general, here we will focus on each of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.260
 these items in more detail we start 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.860
 the main thing is the base base system of this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.780
 security with antenna is wireless 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.790
 sensor as such 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.680
 and they are generally through this 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.939
 channel provide information base here 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.619
 we will take a closer look and see 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.110
 what we have in this case is the nest 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.930
 power on this is the connection socket 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.520
 sirens and so connect sockets 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.549
 wired sensors 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 This situation is a slot for installation 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:51.180
 SIM cards such slot is here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.320
 sim card is the settings button and in 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 Generally switch on 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 switching on well and the antenna connector further 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.979
 siren itself connecting by 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.870
 magic usual 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.709
 120 and belta sieve very loud where also 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.709
 three will be heard for sure 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.170
 further further the movement is again 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.090
 motion sensor on wireless 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.300
 technology here montana if it is far from 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.920
 20 you need to move the antenna inside 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.700
 then reek respectively on the second here 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.810
 off switch on 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.720
 actually give doors hanging to you 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 on based on that on the one hand on 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.610
 door magnet stands on the other side of the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.880
 and accordingly bringing it 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.440
 and imitate opening the door we see that 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.590
 the light bulb lights up then 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.000
 sent directly to bases he is not 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.070
 off and on not inside 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.850
 batteries again if the door is removed before 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:03:03.209
 Base need photo needles antenna unit 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:05.239
 power supply standard power supply 12 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.890
 volt 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.830
 control panel so that you can 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.209
 had to enter his apartment and remote 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.000
 control in general in this way 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:21.030
 looks at the walls of whom I work in 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.880
 next install the base in some 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.459
 an inconspicuous place know how to find out 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.290
 which is only you with this sensors 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.120
 set well let's say the sensor in 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.790
 corridor installed and triggered 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.560
 send information to the base database 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.030
 trying to phone wears would risk 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.000
 send sms messages to your 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.650
 mobile phone program than it is 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.250
 on installation as such this system 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.959
 security is easy enough 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.329
 well enough there are two options that is 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.239
 it either call that number which 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.200
 you installed in this unit and 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.940
 according to Wednesday instructions 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040
 set up everything or go to 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.990
 messages 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.810
 there are no buttons on the base with me 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.500
 all do remotely besides everything 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.120
 other things 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.950
 It is possible to call this number and 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.410
 collarbone intercom ie we will hear 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.450
 what are you saying in your phone well 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.190
 and vice versa, you can 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.930
 listen to what's happening now 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.270
 the room is also installed here 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.800
 microphone many functions can 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.739
 plenty of settings 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.840
 from 6 control zones you can connect here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.100
 in addition to the two sensors that showed 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.930
 four more that is possible 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.490
 that is, a map to each room so giving 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.650
 movement if you have several trusts 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.340
 Naturally a few sensors on the door 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.210
 there are also sold separately this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.330
 smoke detectors 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.030
 wait for water leak sensors again 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.120
 quite an interesting option that is in 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.520
 this situation appears rightness say 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.440
 bath accordingly if the floor 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.810
 water appears it closes the contact when 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.260
 this again the system dials you 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.700
 and you see that the sensors worked more accurately 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.480
 hear from the working sensor 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.460
 bathroom there are also fire sensors again 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.370
 and sensors are gassed ie everything 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.050
 the necessary option also there are very 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.300
 interesting option is actually good 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.580
 running for cream was giving itself simplicity and 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.160
 The main thing is cheapness, that is, you paid 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.340
 one time security system put 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.520
 then I sim card and no longer for anything 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.420
 plates look again completeness 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.600
 food base 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.360
 Motion Sensor 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.070
 door closer general siren 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.830
 This minimum set is suitable for 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.350
 any apartment in the office or some 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.850
 other premises where security is required 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.620
 as such it does not require 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.950
 connect to bang well well that is private 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.260
 security company if necessary 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.630
 alarm entry what 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.010
 call that one bunny worked you 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.680
 You can call the official police 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.780
 come to the place is very convenient at the very 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.870
 no extra cost 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.060
 requires well and in general that as such the price 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:04.470
 in this situation, it is very very low 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.970
 that is, it is like this 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.240
 money can be bought unless 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.800
 mobile phone is not the best 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.720
 on average, the price is somewhere 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.180
 slept for 4000 rubles 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.620
 again depends on the configuration here 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.960
 base model accordingly 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.050
 others more advanced with camcorders 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.210
 that is, from surveillance cameras 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.600
 again all this through gsm networks 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.370
 it is possible to transmit all the information very much 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.380
 An interesting option for those who are in general 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.760
 then you are on business trips to 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.780
 long departures to things like that 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.780
 recommend all the best bye
