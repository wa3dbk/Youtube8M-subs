and the question that I received this

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.339 
and the question that I received this
week<00:00:14.230> was<00:00:14.830> how<00:00:15.760> do<00:00:15.820> you<00:00:16.239> overcome<00:00:16.659> when<00:00:17.289> a

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
week was how do you overcome when a

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.749 
week was how do you overcome when a
friend<00:00:17.800> stops<00:00:18.220> being<00:00:18.489> a<00:00:18.699> friend<00:00:18.999> to<00:00:19.089> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
so this can be very difficult because

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.429 
so this can be very difficult because
first<00:00:27.460> I<00:00:27.789> think<00:00:28.060> you<00:00:28.149> have<00:00:28.269> to<00:00:28.419> figure<00:00:29.019> out<00:00:29.199> if

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.700 
first I think you have to figure out if
you<00:00:29.619> really<00:00:29.800> did<00:00:30.189> do<00:00:30.369> something<00:00:30.609> wrong<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:32.260> I
