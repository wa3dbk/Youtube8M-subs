00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
of whisked up egg so you just want to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.429 
of whisked up egg so you just want to
put<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.689> begin<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.170> start

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
put that in there and begin to start

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
put that in there and begin to start
with<00:01:13.619> your<00:01:13.799> fork<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:18.380> there<00:01:19.380> I've<00:01:19.619> done<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
with your fork in there I've done this a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.429 
with your fork in there I've done this a
few<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.920> easy<00:01:23.280> actually

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
few times and it's really easy actually

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
few times and it's really easy actually
and<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.680> only<00:01:25.830> took<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> few<00:01:26.220> minutes<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:31.820> will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and it only took a few minutes I will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
and it only took a few minutes I will
come<00:01:33.420> back<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.350> have<00:01:34.470> mixed<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> now

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
come back when I have mixed it so now

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.469 
come back when I have mixed it so now
you<00:01:37.380> mixed<00:01:37.950> up<00:01:38.100> all<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> things<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.299> has<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you mixed up all the things and it has a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.370 
you mixed up all the things and it has a
pretty<00:01:39.960> good<00:01:40.170> consistency<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.670> see

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
pretty good consistency as you can see

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.090 
pretty good consistency as you can see
so<00:01:43.380> at<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> point<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> add<00:01:44.990> two

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
so at this point you want to add two

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
so at this point you want to add two
chunks<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.369> banana<00:01:47.549> about<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.600> size<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
chunks of banana about this size so you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
chunks of banana about this size so you
just<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:52.490> smush<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> bit<00:01:54.799> again

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
just want to smush them a bit again

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.600 
just want to smush them a bit again
sometimes<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.140> good<00:01:58.350> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.100> find<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
sometimes it is good if you find a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
sometimes it is good if you find a
motion<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.810> would<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.469> good<00:02:04.590> if

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
motion so that would be really good if

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.370 
motion so that would be really good if
you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.009> find<00:02:05.219> some<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> those<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> just

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you can find some of those but you just

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.750 
you can find some of those but you just
want<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.100 

if<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.879> can<00:02:14.030> marshal<00:02:14.269> a<00:02:14.629> banana<00:02:14.959> before

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
if you can marshal a banana before

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.589 
if you can marshal a banana before
taking<00:02:16.010> some<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.489> that<00:02:16.730> will<00:02:16.970> be<00:02:17.000> really

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
taking some of them that will be really

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.990 
taking some of them that will be really
good<00:02:17.780> but<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.470> didn't<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.489> time<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.940> know

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
good but I didn't have the time you know

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740 
good but I didn't have the time you know
I<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.870> way<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> will<00:02:23.090> again

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
I just do it this way so I will again

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.949 
I just do it this way so I will again
return<00:02:24.050> when<00:02:24.500> I'm<00:02:24.650> finishing<00:02:25.300> mixing<00:02:26.300> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
return when I'm finishing mixing the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.839 
return when I'm finishing mixing the
banana<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.860> mix<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:30.170> now<00:02:30.200> my<00:02:30.980> mix<00:02:31.280> have<00:02:31.610> a

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
banana in this mix so now my mix have a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.530 
banana in this mix so now my mix have a
consistency<00:02:32.569> like<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:33.080> is<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:34.549> small<00:02:35.150> bit<00:02:35.510> of

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
consistency like this is a small bit of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.619 
consistency like this is a small bit of
trunk<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.530> that's<00:02:37.400> what<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:38.209> but

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629 
trunk in it and that's what I want but

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.949 
trunk in it and that's what I want but
you<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:39.019> mix<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.440> more<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.430> Lucas<00:02:40.959> more

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
you can mix it more and Lucas more

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.550 
you can mix it more and Lucas more
uniform<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.569> if<00:02:44.569> you<00:02:44.750> want<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.080> can<00:02:45.290> add<00:02:45.530> some

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
uniform so if you want you can add some

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.240 
uniform so if you want you can add some
chocolate<00:02:46.430> chips<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.989> this<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:49.099> is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
chocolate chips and this was that is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.330 
chocolate chips and this was that is
what<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.519> will<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:51.170> does<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:51.829> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
what I will do so I just does and you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.800 
what I will do so I just does and you
don't<00:02:52.849> have<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.269> add<00:02:54.880> you<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.299> want<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.569> add

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
don't have to add you just want to add

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:07.809
