00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.009
 with a man here we have to thank him 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.200
 always the generosity he has because 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.599
 this shows that you can before the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.040
 important parties a man that the 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:14.200
 technical director who has to take 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.029
 big decisions in the next ten 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.470
 days is always to chat Basque 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.740
 how are you thanks first 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.140
 good and problems when it starts to roll 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.509
 the ball we hope to make a good 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.759
 party we know it's going to be going to be 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.820
 hard as everyone but with confidence 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.100
 of trying to get another good tip 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.790
 you told me you're crossing your fingers 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.960
 because Cuba recovered it 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.850
 urgently you needed it because 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.159
 you wanted to risk gago how it gets to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.480
 cubists does not arrive well arrives well is 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.130
 obvious that maybe not with football that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 we think but it's okay 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.440
 it's a classic and motivation 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.230
 it comes from below so in that sense 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.640
 let's wait as a group as a team 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.550
 a good match to be a protagonist 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.890
 trying to know about the virtues and 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.659
 defects that have rival in Basques 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.580
 plan a game against the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.860
 river that you come from a streak 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.470
 spectacular 17 undefeated games 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
 winning most of them playing well 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.060
 generating many situations of goal and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.009
 converting many goals now the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.119
 match against the river, you think the same 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.119
 that against any other 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.450
 it's another kind of party for the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 transcendence and for what the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.160
 eternal rival but still three 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.740
 points in which we know that 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.470
 come three games in which it has 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.620
 talk a lot and good the chance of 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.200
 player to be able to continue with our goal 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.150
 will continue to be able to give a joy to 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 our people like I said I was going to 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.320
 be three tough games and this is the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.170
 first and we think about this and we do not think 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.480
 in what comes the Basque and has 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.180
 first you will hit better and that you win this 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.840
 match is going to leave hit the opponent not 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.370
 know how to win the game can leave blow 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.930
 or not to the opponent depending on the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.530
 mentality that the group has in the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.260
 schools but this is the league match 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.940
 it is different from the cup, the cup, if 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.690
 well they are true phrases are 180 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.020
 minutes 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.490
 here are 90 95 which stops to win 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.590
 match has to be better than rival and 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.050
 the only way I know of being better 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.780
 rival is trying to look for the rival arch 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.160
 and playing in equipment for kit hopefully 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.880
 let's see a great match again 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.570
 many thanks 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.570
 Sir
