actually<00:03:45.280> fit<00:03:45.579> down<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.329> here<00:03:47.189> so<00:03:48.189> when<00:03:48.280> you

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
actually fit down in here so when you

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.110 
actually fit down in here so when you
take<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.609> knife<00:03:51.120> actually<00:03:52.120> fits<00:03:52.720> down<00:03:53.079> in<00:03:53.409> and<00:03:54.120> I

take a knife actually fits down in and I

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.280 
take a knife actually fits down in and I
have<00:03:55.299> these<00:03:55.479> set<00:03:55.810> up<00:03:55.930> so<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.439> the<00:03:58.079> size<00:03:59.079> is

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
have these set up so that the size is

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.080 
have these set up so that the size is
really<00:03:59.620> kind<00:03:59.829> of<00:03:59.859> set<00:04:00.069> up<00:04:00.189> for<00:04:00.220> hinders<00:04:00.819> and

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
really kind of set up for hinders and

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.610 
really kind of set up for hinders and
Striders<00:04:01.569> because<00:04:01.780> that's<00:04:01.989> primarily<00:04:02.409> that

with the lid the lid closes over

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.510 
with the lid the lid closes over
fine<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:48.539> that's<00:04:48.870> it<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.319> don't<00:04:49.530> know<00:04:49.710> you<00:04:50.370> know

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
fine and that's it I don't know you know

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.870 
fine and that's it I don't know you know
how<00:04:50.729> long<00:04:50.910> did<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.330> take<00:04:51.449> me<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.780> make<00:04:52.020> this

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
how long did it take me to make this

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.080 
how long did it take me to make this
probably<00:04:53.880> carnations<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:56.190> guessing<00:04:56.669> a<00:04:56.759> cup<00:04:56.970> I

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
probably carnations I'm guessing a cup I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.659 
probably carnations I'm guessing a cup I
have<00:04:57.270> maybe<00:04:57.949> 20<00:04:58.949> hours<00:04:59.370> into<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:01.280> maybe<00:05:02.280> less

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
have maybe 20 hours into it maybe less

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.309 
have maybe 20 hours into it maybe less
but<00:05:02.699> you<00:05:03.300> know<00:05:03.419> what<00:05:03.599> really<00:05:03.840> took<00:05:04.050> up<00:05:04.229> the

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
but you know what really took up the

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:10.059 
but you know what really took up the
time<00:05:05.900> was<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.289> know<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.500> carving<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:09.240> pins

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:10.069 
time was you know the carving the pins

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.939 
time was you know the carving the pins
took<00:05:11.069> up<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.520> lot<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:11.789> time<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.680> doing<00:05:13.680> just

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
took up a lot of time just doing just

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.950 
took up a lot of time just doing just
doing<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:17.030> then<00:05:18.030> finishing<00:05:18.509> I'm<00:05:18.660> still

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
doing that and then finishing I'm still

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.860 
doing that and then finishing I'm still
I<00:05:19.169> mean<00:05:19.380> I'm<00:05:19.669> pretty<00:05:20.669> much<00:05:20.880> novice<00:05:21.330> at<00:05:21.479> this<00:05:21.630> so

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
I mean I'm pretty much novice at this so

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.779 
I mean I'm pretty much novice at this so
the<00:05:22.620> finish<00:05:22.949> is<00:05:23.099> still<00:05:23.340> kind<00:05:23.550> of<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.669> real

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
the finish is still kind of a real

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.529 
the finish is still kind of a real
challenging<00:05:24.300> part<00:05:24.599> but<00:05:26.120> he's<00:05:27.120> a<00:05:27.150> couple

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
challenging part but he's a couple

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.120 
challenging part but he's a couple
