00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and modeled on here the elevator

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.130 
and modeled on here the elevator
obviously<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.290> standard<00:01:55.710> stuff<00:01:56.840> nice<00:01:57.840> touch

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
obviously the standard stuff nice touch

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
obviously the standard stuff nice touch
when<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.530> roll<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> ailerons<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.210> also

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
when you roll the ailerons up you also

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.260 
when you roll the ailerons up you also
get<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.950> speed<00:02:02.340> brakes<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.909> come<00:02:03.090> up

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
get the speed brakes to come up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.990 
get the speed brakes to come up
depending<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.020> how<00:02:04.200> much<00:02:04.590> roll<00:02:05.189> pitch<00:02:05.700> you're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
depending on how much roll pitch you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.779 
depending on how much roll pitch you're
giving<00:02:06.329> into<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> yoke<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.610> nice

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
giving into the yoke so that's a nice

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.310 
giving into the yoke so that's a nice
feature<00:02:09.440> as<00:02:10.440> far<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.860> speed<00:02:11.099> brakes

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
feature as far as the speed brakes

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.810 
feature as far as the speed brakes
there<00:02:13.320> they<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:14.070> already<00:02:14.250> some<00:02:14.520> weird

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
there they are you already some weird

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.260 
there they are you already some weird
using<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.300> ailerons<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.800> exit<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.520> fully

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
using the ailerons the exit is fully

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.190 
using the ailerons the exit is fully
animated<00:02:19.220> which<00:02:20.220> is<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> nice<00:02:20.610> touch<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:21.810> far<00:02:22.110> as

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
animated which is a nice touch as far as

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.570 
animated which is a nice touch as far as
the<00:02:22.320> lighting<00:02:22.650> package<00:02:22.860> let's<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.400> ahead<00:02:23.460> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.420 
the lighting package let's go ahead and
go<00:02:23.790> inside<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.390> turn<00:02:25.320> those<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.370> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
go inside and turn those on just so you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.860 
go inside and turn those on just so you
guys<00:02:26.550> can<00:02:26.610> see<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.090> they're<00:02:27.240> like

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.970 

let's<00:02:33.560> go<00:02:34.330> alrighty<00:02:35.330> as<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.530> can<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.830> you've

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
let's go alrighty as you can see you've

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.470 
let's go alrighty as you can see you've
got<00:02:37.099> your<00:02:37.159> standard<00:02:37.459> anti-collision<00:02:38.390> nav<00:02:38.989> and

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
got your standard anti-collision nav and

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.460 
got your standard anti-collision nav and
landing<00:02:41.480> taxi<00:02:42.080> lights<00:02:42.400> all<00:02:43.400> fully<00:02:43.879> modeled<00:02:46.420> so

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
landing taxi lights all fully modeled so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.259 
landing taxi lights all fully modeled so
again<00:02:48.470> it's<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:48.739> very<00:02:48.950> nice<00:02:49.129> plane<00:02:49.519> obviously

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
again it's a very nice plane obviously

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.119 
again it's a very nice plane obviously
the<00:02:50.390> fans<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.019> turbines<00:02:51.440> come<00:02:51.769> up<00:02:51.920> and

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
the fans on the turbines come up and

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.190 
the fans on the turbines come up and
spin<00:02:52.430> when<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.760> engines<00:02:53.060> are<00:02:53.209> running<00:02:53.329> I'll

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
spin when the engines are running I'll

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.050 
spin when the engines are running I'll
show<00:02:54.590> you<00:02:54.739> more<00:02:55.129> of<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.340> later<00:02:55.579> in<00:02:55.909> their

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
show you more of that later in their

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.740 
show you more of that later in their
review<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.750> we<00:02:57.319> go<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:58.269> thrust<00:02:59.269> reversers

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
review as we go on thrust reversers

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500 
review as we go on thrust reversers
would<00:02:59.959> open<00:03:00.290> up<00:03:00.409> etc<00:03:00.769> etc<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.269> a<00:03:02.390> great

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
would open up etc etc so it's a great

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.039 
would open up etc etc so it's a great
model<00:03:03.250> let<00:03:04.250> me<00:03:04.340> flip<00:03:04.579> on<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.790> taxi<00:03:05.359> lights<00:03:05.599> and

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
model let me flip on the taxi lights and

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.130 
model let me flip on the taxi lights and
the<00:03:06.109> landing<00:03:06.500> lights<00:03:06.709> for<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.069> guys<00:03:08.140> actually

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
the landing lights for you guys actually

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.509 
the landing lights for you guys actually
I'm<00:03:09.230> going<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.680> from<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.859> cockpit<00:03:12.519> if

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
I'm going to do that from the cockpit if

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.520 
I'm going to do that from the cockpit if
I<00:03:13.670> had<00:03:13.760> my<00:03:13.819> track<00:03:14.209> I<00:03:14.450> are<00:03:14.629> on<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:15.079> be<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> lot

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
I had my track I are on that be a lot

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:24.039 
I had my track I are on that be a lot
easier<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.269> go<00:03:23.450> there's<00:03:23.750> the

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
easier and there you go there's the

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.800 
easier and there you go there's the
landing<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:24.890> taxi<00:03:25.370> lights<00:03:25.609> the<00:03:26.420> taxi

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
landing and the taxi lights the taxi

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.970 
landing and the taxi lights the taxi
lights<00:03:27.019> are<00:03:27.200> obviously<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.769> nose<00:03:27.950> gear

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
lights are obviously on the nose gear

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.099 
lights are obviously on the nose gear
and<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.819> landing<00:03:29.420> lights<00:03:29.629> are<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:29.840> the

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
and the landing lights are on the

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.729 
and the landing lights are on the
leading<00:03:30.650> edge<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.129> the<00:03:31.190> wing<00:03:31.780> so<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:33.379> my

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
leading edge of the wing so that's my

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.160 
leading edge of the wing so that's my
