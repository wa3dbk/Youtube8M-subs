00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the top now one of the things that I've

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.180 
the top now one of the things that I've
had<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> problem<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:54.059> these<00:00:54.329> figures<00:00:54.809> is

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
had a problem with what these figures is

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
had a problem with what these figures is
the<00:00:56.190> hands<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.460> not<00:01:00.030> being

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the hands actually you know not being

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.549 
the hands actually you know not being
able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:01.039> turn<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.370> hands<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.559> know

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
able to actually turn the hands you know

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.380 
able to actually turn the hands you know
so<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.229> guitar<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.130> her<00:01:09.119> hand

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so if you put the guitar in her hand

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.480 
so if you put the guitar in her hand
like<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.600> normal<00:01:09.960> minifigure<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.280> kind

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
like a normal minifigure it's just kind

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
like a normal minifigure it's just kind
of<00:01:11.520> odd<00:01:11.729> she<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> hold<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
of odd she can just kind of hold it so

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
of odd she can just kind of hold it so
that's<00:01:13.950> why<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.310> had<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> put<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.909> extra

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that's why they had to put this extra

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.530 
that's why they had to put this extra
little<00:01:15.810> piece<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> back<00:01:17.189> here<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.299> can

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
little piece on the back here so you can

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
little piece on the back here so you can
put<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.259> her<00:01:19.950> hand<00:01:20.900> like<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.400> then

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
put that in her hand like that and then

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.370 
put that in her hand like that and then
turn<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> guitar<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.720> that's<00:01:24.930> how<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> make

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
turn the guitar so that's how you make

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.399 
turn the guitar so that's how you make
it<00:01:25.439> look<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.860> she's<00:01:26.130> holding<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> know

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
it look like she's holding it you know

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
it look like she's holding it you know
so<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.040> glad<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.759> did<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.180> about

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so I'm glad that they did think about

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
so I'm glad that they did think about
that<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.110> kind<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> fixed<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> problem

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
that and they kind of fixed the problem

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
that and they kind of fixed the problem
with<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.180> guitar<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.950> been

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
with the guitar but it would have been

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.999 
with the guitar but it would have been
nice<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.479> could<00:01:36.689> actually<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
nice if you could actually you know just

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.480 
nice if you could actually you know just
twist<00:01:38.460> her<00:01:38.670> hands<00:01:39.150> um<00:01:39.650> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.740> be<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
twist her hands um you know be nice so

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.010 
twist her hands um you know be nice so
you<00:01:41.579> could<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.509> other<00:01:42.659> hand

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you could actually make the other hand

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.010 
you could actually make the other hand
hold<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> guitar<00:01:43.560> too<00:01:44.210> but<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.630> know<00:01:45.750> that's

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
hold the guitar too but you know that's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
hold the guitar too but you know that's
just<00:01:46.320> me<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> nitpicking<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:47.700> bit

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
just me kind of nitpicking a little bit

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.800 
just me kind of nitpicking a little bit
but<00:01:48.540> still<00:01:49.200> pretty<00:01:50.130> cool<00:01:50.460> little<00:01:51.119> figure<00:01:51.509> here

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
but still pretty cool little figure here

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.859 
but still pretty cool little figure here
so<00:01:52.799> let's<00:01:52.979> look<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> set<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.240> let<00:01:54.659> me<00:01:54.750> go

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so let's look at the set so let me go

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.240 
so let's look at the set so let me go
ahead<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.079> give<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.350> an<00:01:55.470> overview<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
ahead and give you an overview of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.910 
ahead and give you an overview of the
set<00:01:56.610> first<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> really<00:01:58.680> cool

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
set first I think this is a really cool

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.120 
set first I think this is a really cool
set<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.450> it's<00:02:00.450> probably<00:02:00.840> because<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.500> really

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
set and it's probably because I really

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240 
set and it's probably because I really
liked<00:02:02.310> music<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.140> being<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.320> stage<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
liked music so being a stage you know I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.109 
liked music so being a stage you know I
think<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.909> cool<00:02:06.119> set<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:08.030> we'll<00:02:09.030> go

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
of the set and what I think is the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.289 
of the set and what I think is the
coolest<00:03:25.799> part<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.519> you've<00:03:26.970> got<00:03:27.180> this

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
coolest part is that you've got this

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.660 
coolest part is that you've got this
whole<00:03:27.630> big<00:03:28.230> section<00:03:28.829> right<00:03:28.980> here<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.340> turns

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
whole big section right here that turns

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.120 
whole big section right here that turns
and<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.959> see<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.260> easily<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.799> turns

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
and you can see how easily it turns

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.500 
and you can see how easily it turns
around<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:33.799> that's<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:35.040> other<00:03:35.190> mirror<00:03:35.940> part

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
around and that's the other mirror part

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.900 
around and that's the other mirror part
that<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:36.900> talking<00:03:37.019> about<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.160> one<00:03:38.430> big

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
that I was talking about that is one big

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
that's really cool this side is actually

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.280 
that's really cool this side is actually
supposed<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:46.620> a<00:03:47.390> ballet<00:03:48.390> type<00:03:48.959> thing

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
supposed to be like a ballet type thing

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.580 
supposed to be like a ballet type thing
like<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.280> balance<00:03:50.760> bar<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.360> don't<00:03:52.079> really<00:03:52.440> know

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
like a balance bar I don't really know

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.550 
like a balance bar I don't really know
why<00:03:52.860> exactly<00:03:53.329> they<00:03:54.329> have<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> balance<00:03:54.989> bar<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
why exactly they have a balance bar and

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.090 
why exactly they have a balance bar and
with<00:03:56.220> like<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:57.600> know<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.930> music<00:03:58.470> stuff<00:03:58.950> I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
with like you know the music stuff I

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.640 
with like you know the music stuff I
mean<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.310> guess<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.790> could<00:03:59.820> do<00:04:00.150> both<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
mean I guess you could do both but it

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.960 
mean I guess you could do both but it
just<00:04:01.829> seems<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.400> maybe<00:04:02.610> should<00:04:02.940> have

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
just seems like that maybe should have

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.199 
just seems like that maybe should have
been<00:04:03.209> part<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.480> another<00:04:03.750> set<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.920> me<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.790> still

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
been part of another set to me but still

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.330 
been part of another set to me but still
cool<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.959> mean<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.320> really<00:04:07.470> like<00:04:07.739> this<00:04:07.950> clear

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
cool I mean I really like this clear

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.789 
cool I mean I really like this clear
pink<00:04:08.640> piece<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.720> think<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.200> could<00:04:10.350> maybe<00:04:10.530> use

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
pink piece I think I could maybe use

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.310 
pink piece I think I could maybe use
that<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.220> something<00:04:11.250> else<00:04:11.720> happen<00:04:12.720> anyway<00:04:13.079> I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
that for something else happen anyway I

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.650 
that for something else happen anyway I
like<00:04:13.799> that<00:04:13.829> that<00:04:14.160> turns<00:04:14.430> around<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.030> then<00:04:15.540> on

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
like that that turns around and then on

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.180 
like that that turns around and then on
this<00:04:15.840> side<00:04:15.900> you've<00:04:16.350> got<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.979> know<00:04:17.010> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
this side you've got you know the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.180 
this side you've got you know the
keyboard<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:19.880> nice<00:04:20.880> little<00:04:21.060> keyboard

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
keyboard here a nice little keyboard

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.120 
keyboard here a nice little keyboard
and<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.090> pretty<00:04:24.300> simple<00:04:24.570> easy<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.620> make<00:04:25.920> but

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
and it's pretty simple easy to make but

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.620 
and it's pretty simple easy to make but
I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.670> it's<00:04:26.790> really<00:04:26.910> cool<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.240> they<00:04:27.480> did

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
I think it's really cool that they did

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.990 
I think it's really cool that they did
do<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.350> you've<00:04:29.040> also<00:04:29.190> got<00:04:29.550> the

microphone on the stand right here as

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.270 
microphone on the stand right here as
you<00:04:35.430> can<00:04:35.460> see<00:04:35.990> or<00:04:36.990> I<00:04:37.020> hope<00:04:37.290> you<00:04:37.440> can<00:04:37.650> maybe<00:04:38.160> I
