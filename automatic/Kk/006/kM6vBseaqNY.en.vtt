all<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.159> reversing<00:01:14.159> process<00:01:15.470> what<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.590> found

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
all with reversing process what we found

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.590 
all with reversing process what we found
when<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.220> hope<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:18.030> building<00:01:18.300> this

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
when we hope this first building this

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.570 
when we hope this first building this
cabin<00:01:18.870> was<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> took<00:01:20.010> an<00:01:20.159> awful<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.550> of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
cabin was that it took an awful lot of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.610 
cabin was that it took an awful lot of
manpower<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.570> other<00:01:21.720> words<00:01:21.960> building<00:01:22.170> labor

well<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.550> designer<00:01:23.970> why<00:01:24.630> why<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.170> put

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
well I'm a designer why why not put

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
well I'm a designer why why not put
together<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.250> manual<00:01:26.880> instruction<00:01:27.570> manual<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
together a manual instruction manual and

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.230 
together a manual instruction manual and
the<00:01:28.350> set<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.620> plans<00:01:28.970> write<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.120> book

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the set of plans write the book

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600 
the set of plans write the book
basically<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.440> put<00:01:31.830> that<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> internet

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
basically and put that on the internet

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.450 
basically and put that on the internet
and<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.510> download<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:34.530> own<00:01:34.590> manual<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.400> how

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and you download your own manual of how

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420 
and you download your own manual of how
to<00:01:35.760> build<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.450> cabin<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.560> even<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> house<00:01:38.159> for

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to build a cabin or even a house for

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.550 
to build a cabin or even a house for
that<00:01:38.550> matter<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:39.120> then<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.990> can<00:01:40.140> spread<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
that matter and then I can spread that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.680 
that matter and then I can spread that
knowledge<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:41.070> over<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> world<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.090> DIY

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
knowledge all over the world and the DIY

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.510 
knowledge all over the world and the DIY
person<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:44.010> own<00:01:44.130> building

person can do their own building

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
person can do their own building
following<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> steps<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.620> they<00:01:46.770> get<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> a
