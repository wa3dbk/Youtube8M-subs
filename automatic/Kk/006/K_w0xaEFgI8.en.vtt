 explain to her that she is very skilled with 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:24.250
 words is not a gato gazette 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.590
 But my sister is what you want it to be 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.660
 is a column that helps us preserve 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.550
 family recipes in the sense 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.920
 exist in all families of the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.300
 crown recipes that the heart risks 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960
 go lost if they are not the recipe 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.670
 classic type I don't know spaghetti 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.769
 at the amatriciana they make everyone do now 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.219
 don't stick a giant button or not 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.859
 I can hold our guest 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.839
 comes from the Maremma and I could give it 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.209
 as many adjectives as his are 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.769
 surnames that are really very long 

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:57.760
 he is handsome tall very powerful 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.309
 winemaker who I think is my own 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.129
 favorite right now and come to 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.770
 bring us the recipe of the great-grandmother lea 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:10.330
 of the big bait comes on horseback a 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.710
 certainly currency one day so I have 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 left out so he is fine 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.170
 you brought this thing here is called 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.110
 use these for sure this as well 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.140
 suede today I will explain how to do the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.120
 suede from felia chiara ofelia was one 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 great friend my great-grandmother but not 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.930
 is what we see in the paintings of no 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.700
 it is not a current with all the flowers 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.240
 on the tent is an Ampezzo mountaineer 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.260
 but antic that is far ahead but not 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.860
 my great-grandmother is also exceptional 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.840
 in fact this recipe comes from her not 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.040
 I think it's Ampezzo I think it's more 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.280
 Austrian 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 ah ok to complicate things weighed the 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 suede as 36 procured the costs 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 unfortunately I tried my mother 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.090
 was more males let's say we leave 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.950
 knife instead my mother didn't go in 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.130
 val germanasca and threw it out the 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.940
 germany that is in piedmont all 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.530
 very compliments 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.870
 the recipe a bullshit, however, the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 difficult and produce sica mori already 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.910
 then the ingredients are 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.860
 very simple bay leaves grains of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 black pepper cream suede cognac and oil 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.240
 olive then for the navy uses i love the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.709
 cognac olive oils in equal parts 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.360
 practically I don't throw in misio 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.910
 then we put a good handful of 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.959
 black pepper grains and a couple of non fire 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.580
 too much to them because we leave them strong 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.320
 in these there is for two days a 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.000
 day sound time of more than ten 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.640
 years, however, better be careful the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.290
 you have to mix every 4 hours because otherwise 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.470
 to the oil and the indifferent coinage la 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.940
 night wake up at hours is like having a 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.770
 baby or a drop that haute cuisine 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.320
 because simone related canons sense us 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.420
 like and this cream we have here 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.360
 symbolically a reality drops 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.209
 4 liters of industrial quantities are required 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
 parma because the suede will cook in the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.030
 cream 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.790
 obviously we observe it with spaces 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.000
 if we have there then you can also do with 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.430
 the rigatone or really large pasta al 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.570
 butter and then we add teachers who 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.900
 I prepare for my baby 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.900
 ok pasta in coarse white 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 come back then let's start a 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.740
 cooking let's start cooking must 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.100
 take the meat obviously not there 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.590
 we want to throw all this marinade 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.590
 if it would not make them too greasy then 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.510
 with this ladle it seems to me excellent 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.160
 we find the receipt large 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.650
 we clear roughly because the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:08.060
 essential correct terminology then 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.730
 I scold roughly and love it 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.050
 I can more than I spend on little 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.850
 expect and take away their course 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:21.110
 we like black pepper 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.690
 bite him later but this is fantastic 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:27.950
 research this and carbonera has no hormones 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.140
 stuff you said a little lord to mine is 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.190
 just like a butcher because meat 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.390
 real lady 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.970
 here it is carnera is ok you see that browned 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.310
 all the sauce is well worked 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.340
 then now we can start adding 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.070
 our cream a quantity a mass 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:53.780
 industrial then I to over a liter 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:58.210
 a little more than half a liter will be like half 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.210
 liter this we add 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:11.440
 and let it cook practically a 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:12.310
 slow slow heat for three hours e 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.720
 half 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.610
 five hours we go through now 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.320
 we see now saw the thread pass 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.060
 you have to add the cream 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.040
 obviously every time it is called the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.780
 add for every half an hour add 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.580
 let's leave a little cream to pass 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.580
 a jimmy you five hours 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.870
 then see how it is not too narrow 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.139
 lamanna the love of this consistency 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.620
 fifth that if too narrow a taste a 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:56.220
 bit too much after a while creamy 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.220
 passage 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.319
 now we are almost missing a few minutes 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.910
 then we cook spaces that are 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:10.150
 spaces are not usually boiled no 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:13.599
 functions various risks a lot of butter a 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:16.300
 vote because we lacked we are missing part 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:18.430
 fat let's say follow it put a little 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.270
 the higher I make them so it has been in 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.270
 pan of the other 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.770
 much better than boiled politics not 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:30.990
 only we have inside 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.990
 now that the spaces are pretty crisp 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.790
 brown had diego is ready this is 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.010
 ready at this point we believe a dish 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.440
 It saves each part usually because they do not 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.420
 I burn everything together 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.960
 they do n't know how I like them, they are pretty 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:52.960
 we are not for the presentation born a 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.610
 some jocks but this is not it 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.610
 let's see what it is then 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:11.930
 lard because there is obviously a lot of beauty 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:15.620
 home of ready attack sauce 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:19.099
 no wonder let's try this 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.520
 is the chamois of ofelia the cream of 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:24.229
 great-grandmother lea of ​​la gherardesca 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.789
 great-grandmother of baloo who by the way had 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.340
 also other skills that while me 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.699
 taste then make public 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.789
 manifest should be stabilized was included 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:38.990
 in the world of the sky to the pigeon to say is 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:43.389
 fantastic considers me as satisfied 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:46.370
 let's explain how I would serve at a lunch 

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:49.250
 it is certainly certain it is called ai 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:56.199
 made not apart today from the great-grandfather of 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:56.199
 we of your skin want it but good 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:03.789
 we also ate vastarella now 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.789
 honorary flounder
