00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
you know sniper necklace a shitload of

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.059 
you know sniper necklace a shitload of
times<00:02:04.240> I<00:02:04.389> mean<00:02:04.539> our<00:02:04.719> subs<00:02:05.380> are<00:02:05.619> going<00:02:05.950> up

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
times I mean our subs are going up

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.430 
times I mean our subs are going up
drastically<00:02:07.029> but<00:02:07.689> what<00:02:08.020> doesn't<00:02:08.200> make<00:02:08.380> sense

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
drastically but what doesn't make sense

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.320 
drastically but what doesn't make sense
to<00:02:08.740> me<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.069> how<00:02:09.190> our<00:02:09.220> sobs<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.849> go<00:02:10.000> up<00:02:10.149> so

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
to me is how our sobs can go up so

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.780 
to me is how our sobs can go up so
quickly<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.020> then<00:02:11.590> we're<00:02:12.069> not<00:02:12.190> getting<00:02:12.580> more

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
quickly and then we're not getting more

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
quickly and then we're not getting more
views<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.390> because<00:02:14.020> that's<00:02:14.200> kind<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.470> weird

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
views that because that's kind of weird

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.070 
views that because that's kind of weird
so<00:02:15.099> we're<00:02:15.490> getting<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:15.970> wide<00:02:16.300> audience<00:02:16.540> but

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
so we're getting a wide audience but
