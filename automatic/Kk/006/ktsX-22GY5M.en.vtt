of a staccato effect so now a good

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.849 
of a staccato effect so now a good
application<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:45.930> be<00:02:45.989> let's<00:02:46.349> just<00:02:46.590> say<00:02:46.739> if

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
application would be let's just say if

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.550 
application would be let's just say if
you're<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.189> of<00:02:47.220> doing<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:48.140> shuffle

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you're kind of doing a shuffle

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.860 
you're kind of doing a shuffle
bluesy<00:02:50.250> shuffle<00:02:50.670> almost<00:02:51.090> kind<00:02:51.299> of<00:02:51.390> Johnny<00:02:51.689> be

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
bluesy shuffle almost kind of Johnny be

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.339 
bluesy shuffle almost kind of Johnny be
good<00:02:52.340> kind<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.459> thing<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.750> singer<00:02:55.049> sings

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
good kind of thing and the singer sings

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.619 
good kind of thing and the singer sings
a<00:02:55.500> line<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:56.220> then<00:02:56.340> he's<00:02:56.609> got<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:56.940> few<00:02:57.209> seconds

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
a line and then he's got a few seconds

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.599 
a line and then he's got a few seconds
before<00:02:57.780> he<00:02:58.109> sings<00:02:58.620> his<00:02:58.769> other<00:02:58.950> line<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.459> could

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
before he sings his other line you could

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.629 
before he sings his other line you could
squeeze<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:00.870> there<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.379> again<00:03:02.099> you<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
squeeze that in there and again you can

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:10.080 
squeeze that in there and again you can
do<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.849> at<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.150> speed

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:21.870 

or<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.810> could<00:03:12.050> do<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.380> like<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.560> halftime

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.340 

and<00:03:22.880> again<00:03:23.180> that's<00:03:23.330> kind<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.630> up<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.050> to

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
and again that's kind of up to you to

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.190 
and again that's kind of up to you to
experiment<00:03:25.160> with<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.520> and<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:26.780> know<00:03:26.870> try<00:03:27.170> it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
experiment with it and you know try it

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.710 
experiment with it and you know try it
in<00:03:27.350> different<00:03:27.500> applications<00:03:28.270> maybe<00:03:29.270> move<00:03:29.630> it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
in different applications maybe move it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.070 
in different applications maybe move it
around<00:03:29.810> try<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.710> other<00:03:30.920> strings<00:03:32.080> but

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
around try it on other strings but

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.440 
around try it on other strings but
that's<00:03:33.260> pretty<00:03:33.470> much<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.210> don't<00:03:35.210> forget<00:03:35.300> to

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450

I'm using on this is the power to laying

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.930 
I'm using on this is the power to laying
patch<00:03:41.480> for<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.870> HD<00:03:42.230> 500<00:03:42.890> so<00:03:43.220> that'll<00:03:43.790> be
