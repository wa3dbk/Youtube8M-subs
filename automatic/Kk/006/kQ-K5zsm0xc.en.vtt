00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.850 

so<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> equalization<00:01:31.590> start<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> Stasia

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
so the equalization start is a Stasia

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.289 
so the equalization start is a Stasia
built<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.850> days<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.860> format<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.520> done<00:01:39.090> on

built on two days the format is done on

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.580 
built on two days the format is done on
two<00:01:39.600> days<00:01:39.979> for<00:01:40.979> theory<00:01:41.820> session<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.720> for

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
two days for theory session and for

indoor session in in the pool
the<00:01:46.979> star<00:01:49.039> is<00:01:50.039> done

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the star is done

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.469 
the star is done
start<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.590> normal<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.030> classic

start from the normal the classic
pollination<00:01:55.439> technique<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:56.159> parental<00:01:57.149> eval

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
pollination technique so parental eval

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
pollination technique so parental eval
salba<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.409> techniques<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.090> everybody

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
salba the two techniques that everybody

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
salba the two techniques that everybody
should<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.720> do<00:02:01.050> or<00:02:01.350> shot<00:02:01.679> should<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.369> able<00:02:02.909> to

and<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.200> second<00:02:05.590> day<00:02:05.740> we<00:02:06.370> work<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:07.000> involved

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
and the second day we work on involved

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.920 
and the second day we work on involved
equalization<00:02:09.880> technique<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:11.190> sequential

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
equalization technique like sequential

Airways what we do in the stage is not
this<00:02:34.900> -<00:02:35.200> is<00:02:35.530> not<00:02:35.800> done<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.520> help<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.970> people<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
this - is not done to help the people to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.720 
this - is not done to help the people to
do<00:02:39.670> better<00:02:40.360> performance<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.680> do<00:02:41.860> their<00:02:42.130> PD

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
do better performance to do their PD

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.140 
do better performance to do their PD
they<00:02:42.910> personal<00:02:43.450> best<00:02:43.720> but<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.770> help<00:02:45.160> them<00:02:45.460> to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
they personal best but to help them to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.620 
they personal best but to help them to
be<00:02:46.300> aware<00:02:46.840> about<00:02:47.140> how<00:02:47.710> to<00:02:47.860> day<00:02:48.460> equalize

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
be aware about how to day equalize

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.410 
be aware about how to day equalize
so<00:02:50.020> what<00:02:50.500> they<00:02:50.710> do<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.130> right<00:02:51.310> way<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.910> we

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
so what they do in the right way and we

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.720 
so what they do in the right way and we
turn<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.840> mistake<00:02:53.260> they<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.710> we<00:02:54.340> put<00:02:54.550> together

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
turn the mistake they do we put together

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.020 
turn the mistake they do we put together
and<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:56.080> able<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.830> find<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.250> new<00:02:57.490> sequence

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
and to be able to find the new sequence

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and to be able to find the new sequence
that<00:02:59.400> allow<00:03:00.400> them<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.760> go<00:03:01.240> deep<00:03:01.540> in

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
that allow them to go deep in

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.340 
that allow them to go deep in
comfortable<00:03:02.950> way<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.880> what<00:03:04.300> we<00:03:04.600> try<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:04.960> teach

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
comfortable way so what we try to teach

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.699 
comfortable way so what we try to teach
is<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.770> go<00:03:06.220> down<00:03:06.550> without<00:03:07.300> any<00:03:07.810> barotrauma

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
is to go down without any barotrauma

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.440 
is to go down without any barotrauma
feeling<00:03:09.490> well<00:03:10.120> no<00:03:10.480> squeeze<00:03:10.900> no<00:03:11.740> lungs<00:03:12.580> edema

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
feeling well no squeeze no lungs edema

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.720 
feeling well no squeeze no lungs edema
and<00:03:13.690> just<00:03:14.500> feeling<00:03:15.220> their<00:03:15.370> self

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.030 

we<00:03:20.510> have<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.840> go<00:03:21.050> in<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.230> water<00:03:21.410> adjust

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
we have to go in the water adjust

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.820 
we have to go in the water adjust
because<00:03:22.430> we<00:03:22.849> like<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.360> not<00:03:23.750> because<00:03:24.170> we<00:03:24.379> we

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
because we like it not because we we

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:56.580 
because we like it not because we we
want<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.160> become<00:03:26.230> Superman

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:13.930 

Wow

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:21.860 

oh<00:04:13.970> hell

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:05:11.190 

ngo

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:36.500 

you
