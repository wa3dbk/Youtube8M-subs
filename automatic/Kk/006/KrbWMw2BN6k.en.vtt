Bonnie and Kelly and it's a big

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.860 
Bonnie and Kelly and it's a big
reference<00:00:41.100> from<00:00:41.280> one<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.670> idols<00:00:41.879> b.i.g<00:00:42.660> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
reference from one of my idols b.i.g and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.619 
reference from one of my idols b.i.g and
a<00:00:43.379> party<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.910> obviously<00:00:45.329> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
a party and was obviously a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.139 
a party and was obviously a
reference<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> song<00:00:46.950> graphic<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> yeah

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.720 
reference from the song graphic and yeah
exactly<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.440> thought<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.739> sums<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.430> my

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

exactly so we thought that sums up my
kind<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.149> party<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.289> why<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.770> take

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
kind of party so why don't we just take

kind of party so why don't we just take
that<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.120> two<00:00:54.420> words<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.379> kind<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.680> sums

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that it's two words and it kind of sums

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
that it's two words and it kind of sums
up<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.280> everyone's<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.670> yeah<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> guess<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
up and everyone's like yeah I guess the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.560 
up and everyone's like yeah I guess the
same<00:00:57.539> feeling<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.579> came

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
summer track and it felt really good to
me<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.820> wanted<00:01:11.939> people<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> hear<00:01:12.630> it
