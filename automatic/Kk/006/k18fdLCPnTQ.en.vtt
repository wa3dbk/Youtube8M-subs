00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Kennedy as you can see here is the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.560
 package that I won or that I got the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.099
 this way mont steam go in their forums 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.990
 that is my point com so sometimes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 bag bag the signs I leave a link 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 down where they can put the forums there 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.470
 is in English the funds of that sense 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.710
 steam and the legend I do not know how they want him 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.260
 say of schedule on youtube and they are 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 the best in the whole world in order to leave it 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.980
 here to the package as you see I do not bring 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.769
 triplet is this a bit impromptu 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.030
 but left the package and right now I go back 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 since you have this open for the one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 comes in and you have to open the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 box as you can see that inside is fine 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.600
 good packaging these are more extras 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 they are technical where the cable comes from 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.970
 around and all that must be seen 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.130
 ladder was 4 gauge 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.130
 100 feet 2 100 inches 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 of those who come as well packaged 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.860
 with this from here so they do not move 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.920
 when you sue by mail and everything 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.150
 that now emphasized that there are two 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
 applicators tells us someone who sees me 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.710
 and two in fishermen and this is the big one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.570
 I'm fine because such that inside the tal 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 leave it out and I open them to see 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 well that is it wants to grab us 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.369
 you take here from the box 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.610
 the presentation sisi sam's a brand 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.930
 relatively new but as we already know 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 good the ones that we know about this brand 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 we know that they are of good quality and that 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.570
 they are doing a good role in the world 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.420
 ran that is the minimum picador of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.970
 Four channels 60.4 city shaun I put you 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 a closer take countable some 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.080
 nerve something so I like it more 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.940
 challenge every time is this they know the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.320
 the internal part so you can see that yes 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.010
 It is made of good material and it is not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 They are selling a crap or I do not know 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.900
 very good that they give this apart it adds 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.520
 add it I do not know 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.950
 quality or do not communicate to say 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.840
 proposition because to put this and apart 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490
 of this say if they are the blue garment well 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.440
 such as letters and amplifier 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.590
 color now I think not because a hand 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.350
 but good there is this processors 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.520
 and if they are equal white and everything also 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.380
 it turns blue like you are 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.350
 letters if we flip it you also see 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.080
 all the internal part 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.600
 very nice all that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.610
 and it also comes with something else leave it 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.100
 I turn in here old bag what comes in 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.530
 this box that is here next and this 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.170
 what will come next controller 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.970
 for your bass and it tells you how much voltage 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.030
 what is the suit has your bass if you 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.620
 is distorting the clipping and when 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 is obviously learned you need to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.540
 says power here moves and all that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.430
 back and xx an as you can see very good 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.110
 this is like a thing is not innovative 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.320
 you can say almost nobody puts a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.580
 medium voltage voltage in the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.730
 driver under his blockers 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.170
 but good this has been the unboxing of 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.330
 this record and this one that I put it were 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.160
 faster as I said a video and more 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.000
 up close to show them how it looks 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.130
 city sound check 16 thousand thanks to the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.900
 esandi forums and that's all for 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.580
 this video is a back but more like I said 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.680
 I'm going to it is to a video more closely 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.970

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.920
