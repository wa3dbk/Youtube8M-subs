okay so here's what we've got we've just
got<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.889> hose<00:00:11.269> this<00:00:12.269> gauge<00:00:12.540> we're<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
got this hose this gauge we're going to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.660 
got this hose this gauge we're going to
check<00:00:13.380> compression<00:00:13.950> I'm<00:00:14.040> most<00:00:14.280> worried<00:00:14.610> about

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
check compression I'm most worried about

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.720

the<00:00:32.969> fitting<00:00:34.250> we<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.370> we've<00:00:35.579> got<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.760> weak

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the fitting we know we've got a weak

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.869 
the fitting we know we've got a weak
battery<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.899> it'll<00:00:37.649> probably<00:00:37.890> spin<00:00:38.430> us<00:00:38.550> over

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
battery but it'll probably spin us over

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.930 
battery but it'll probably spin us over
enough<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:41.040> watch<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.670> thing

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
enough and we can all watch this thing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.450 
enough and we can all watch this thing
every<00:00:42.210> time<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.570> pulses<00:00:43.050> throttle<00:00:43.739> open<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
every time it pulses throttle open and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.170 
every time it pulses throttle open and
every<00:00:45.120> time<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> pulses<00:00:45.870> we'll<00:00:46.110> see<00:00:49.640> that<00:00:50.640> my

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
every time it pulses we'll see that my

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.889 
every time it pulses we'll see that my
friends<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.829> bad<00:00:53.670> compression<00:00:54.570> we've

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
friends is really bad compression we've

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.360 
friends is really bad compression we've
got<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.829> 78<00:00:56.789> 75<00:00:57.600> 80<00:00:58.079> pounds<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> compression

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
got about 78 75 80 pounds of compression

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.500 
got about 78 75 80 pounds of compression
not<00:01:00.149> enough<00:01:00.809> we<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:01.770> looking<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.329> like

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
not enough we are looking for more like

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.149 
not enough we are looking for more like
130<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.860> 150<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.600> number<00:01:07.140> four<00:01:07.380> cylinders<00:01:07.890> week

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
130 to 150 so number four cylinders week

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.580 
130 to 150 so number four cylinders week
we're<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.180> ahead<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.900> do<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> rest

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
we're going to go ahead and do the rest

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:28.280 
we're going to go ahead and do the rest
oh<00:01:11.689> here<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.990> number<00:01:19.070> 350<00:01:26.840> 60<00:01:27.840> pounds<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
oh here we go number 350 60 pounds of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.780 
oh here we go number 350 60 pounds of
compression<00:01:30.860> looks<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.040> number<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.549> might

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
compression looks like number one might

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
compression looks like number one might
be<00:01:32.939> our<00:01:33.030> strongest<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.810> second<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.259> I'm

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
be our strongest just second here I'm

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:44.240 
be our strongest just second here I'm
gonna<00:01:34.500> kick<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.170 

we've<00:01:45.250> got<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.400> hundred<00:01:45.729> pounds<00:01:46.090> of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
we've got a hundred pounds of

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.149 
we've got a hundred pounds of
compression<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.840> number<00:01:47.140> one<00:01:47.350> that's<00:01:47.979> our

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
compression in number one that's our

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.290 
compression in number one that's our
strongest<00:01:48.640> cylinder

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
strongest cylinder

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.570 
strongest cylinder
okay<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:49.990> we've<00:01:50.290> gone<00:01:50.470> through<00:01:50.530> we've<00:01:51.280> done<00:01:51.550> a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
okay so we've gone through we've done a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.310 
okay so we've gone through we've done a
compression<00:01:52.090> check<00:01:52.450> on<00:01:52.630> all<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.780> cylinders

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
compression check on all the cylinders

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.600 
compression check on all the cylinders
actually<00:01:53.740> I'm<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> little<00:01:54.070> surprised<00:01:54.400> we

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
actually I'm a little surprised we

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.280 
actually I'm a little surprised we
didn't<00:01:54.820> get<00:01:54.909> what<00:01:55.090> I<00:01:55.119> expected<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.080> last

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
didn't get what I expected the last

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.930 
didn't get what I expected the last
thing<00:01:56.470> we're<00:01:56.619> gonna<00:01:56.680> do<00:01:56.979> is<00:01:57.520> we're<00:01:57.700> gonna<00:01:57.790> go

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.840 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.270> as<00:01:58.899> an<00:01:59.200> example<00:01:59.710> what<00:02:00.100> what<00:02:00.520> we<00:02:00.670> can

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
ahead and as an example what what we can

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.350 
ahead and as an example what what we can
find

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
find

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.790 
find
we're<00:02:01.659> gonna<00:02:01.750> shoot<00:02:01.930> some<00:02:01.990> oil<00:02:02.409> into<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
we're gonna shoot some oil into the

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.460 
we're gonna shoot some oil into the
number<00:02:03.070> four<00:02:03.250> cylinder<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.780> oil<00:02:05.020> will<00:02:05.229> seal

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
number four cylinder the oil will seal

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.170 
number four cylinder the oil will seal
up<00:02:05.500> if<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.070> rings<00:02:06.280> are<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:06.580> badly<00:02:06.850> worn

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
up if the rings are really badly worn

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.820 
up if the rings are really badly worn
the<00:02:07.420> oil<00:02:07.570> will<00:02:07.780> seal<00:02:07.990> up<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.289> Rings<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.770> our

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
the oil will seal up the Rings and our

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.190 
the oil will seal up the Rings and our
compression<00:02:09.220> reading<00:02:09.700> will<00:02:09.880> jump<00:02:10.149> way<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.509> if

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
compression reading will jump way up if

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.800 
compression reading will jump way up if
the<00:02:11.560> Rings<00:02:11.860> are<00:02:12.310> still<00:02:12.670> seating<00:02:13.060> well<00:02:13.239> it

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the Rings are still seating well it

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.060 
the Rings are still seating well it
might<00:02:14.019> change<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.410> little<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:14.890> not<00:02:15.010> much

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
might change a little bit but not much

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.100 
might change a little bit but not much
at<00:02:15.370> all<00:02:15.489> all<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.450> I'm<00:02:16.690> just<00:02:16.810> taking

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
at all all it is is this I'm just taking

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.410 
at all all it is is this I'm just taking
a<00:02:17.170> piece<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.380> hose<00:02:17.650> some<00:02:17.950> oil<00:02:18.330> putting<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
a piece of hose some oil putting the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.350 
a piece of hose some oil putting the
piece<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.780> hose<00:02:19.900> slowly<00:02:20.709> into<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.070> oil<00:02:21.360> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
piece of hose slowly into the oil so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.780 
piece of hose slowly into the oil so
that<00:02:22.390> it'll<00:02:22.690> fill<00:02:22.959> up<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> hose<00:02:23.610> put<00:02:24.610> my

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that it'll fill up the hose put my
