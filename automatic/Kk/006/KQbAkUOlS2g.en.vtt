00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.300
 I make cheese cake muffins today 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:30.869
 for that I give 250 grams of lean quark in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.140
 the mix pot the whole thing by weight 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.970
 watchers and indeed once for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:48.440
 after three points then come yet 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:52.940
 two eggs with 40 grams of sugar 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.830
 This is really a quick recipe 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.300
 if you have a quick visit announced 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.300
 you can do wonderful here 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:09.540
 1 packet of vanilla sugar and a few 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.700
 drop lemon oil and can be natural 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.760
 also homemade vanilla sugar 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.909
 Take half custard powder 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.909
 parcel 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:43.289
 dry soft wheat gravel and two 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.289
 tablespoons come to that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:00.860
 a quarter teaspoon of baking powder before 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:08.479
 I already preheated the oven 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:11.530
 at 180 degrees above bottom and a 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.530
 teaspoon oil 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 I now take sunflower oil because it 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.700
 is the most tasteless ssten 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.860
 now everything has to be mixed 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.860
 I give then in three minutes kneading stage 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.540
 Everything was wonderfully mixed into a dough 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.959
 that's how the mass looks like in the glass 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.040
 I drained mandarin before 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:11.549
 let it and shake it a bit 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:17.989
 now below it will just open 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.989
 split the muffin 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:44.390
 and takes about 30 to 35 minutes in 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.390
 the middle rail in the oven 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:56.200
 Let it cool and then you have it 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.200
 a pleasure for three points
