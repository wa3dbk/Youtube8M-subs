real quick and as you can see there's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.130 
real quick and as you can see there's
one<00:00:25.560> processor<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.609> four<00:00:26.849> cores<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.570> it's

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
one processor with four cores and it's

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.040 
one processor with four cores and it's
eight<00:00:28.349> threads<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:30.179> go<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> graph<00:00:30.720> things

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
eight threads if we go to graph things

eight threads if we go to graph things
you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.219> AMD<00:00:32.730> radeon

running<00:00:44.510> obviously<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> i7<00:00:46.520> 27-inch<00:00:47.520> we're

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
running obviously the i7 27-inch we're

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
running obviously the i7 27-inch we're
gonna<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.300> doing<00:00:48.420> benchmarks<00:00:49.170> now<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> am

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
gonna be doing benchmarks now I am

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.340 
gonna be doing benchmarks now I am
running<00:00:49.860> ScreenFlow<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:50.940> so

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
running ScreenFlow right now so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
running ScreenFlow right now so
benchmarks<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.649> won't<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.219> best

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
benchmarks probably won't be the best

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.090 
benchmarks probably won't be the best
but<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> am<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> run<00:00:55.350> them<00:00:55.500> anyways<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
but I am going to run them anyways and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.029 
but I am going to run them anyways and
I'm<00:00:56.219> running<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.879> 64-bit<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.320> let's<00:00:58.800> run

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
I'm running them a 64-bit so let's run

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.209 
I'm running them a 64-bit so let's run
them<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.520> oh<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.120> um<00:01:00.829> it's<00:01:01.829> powering

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
them right now oh and um it's powering

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
them right now oh and um it's powering
to<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.239> additional<00:01:04.140> displays<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.280> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to just two additional displays so I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
to just two additional displays so I
don't<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.729> has<00:01:05.850> any<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:07.380> know

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
don't know if that has any you know

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.370 
don't know if that has any you know
makes<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.580> test<00:01:09.540> any<00:01:09.780> different<00:01:10.290> because

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
makes the test any different because

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.649 
makes the test any different because
it's<00:01:10.710> powering<00:01:11.100> extra<00:01:11.490> displays<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.119> we'll

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it's powering extra displays but we'll

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
it's powering extra displays but we'll
see<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> scores<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.729> should<00:01:14.939> still

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
see what it scores and I should still

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.230 
see what it scores and I should still
score<00:01:15.450> pretty<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.170> after<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.240> I'll

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
score pretty good and after this I'll

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780 
score pretty good and after this I'll
show<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> scores<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.430> not

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
show you what it scores would not

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.670 
show you what it scores would not
running<00:01:21.060> stream<00:01:21.330> flow<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.869> let's<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.380> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
running stream flow so let's see and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.359 
running stream flow so let's see and
right<00:01:23.250> there<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> guy<00:01:23.790> 12<00:01:24.330> 451<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.979> very

right there a guy 12 451 so that is very

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.810 
right there a guy 12 451 so that is very
impressive<00:01:27.110> um<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.680> eight<00:01:28.890> core<00:01:29.280> or<00:01:29.430> not<00:01:29.579> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
impressive um like eight core or not I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
impressive um like eight core or not I
don't<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.450> mountain<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.020> year<00:01:31.200> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
don't think this mountain this year but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.240 
don't think this mountain this year but
last<00:01:32.040> year's<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:33.090> core<00:01:33.540> mac<00:01:34.290> pros<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.950> around

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
last year's a core mac pros get around

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.850 
last year's a core mac pros get around
that<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.790> let's<00:01:36.030> run<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.960> more<00:01:37.200> time

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.240 

and<00:01:41.840> even<00:01:42.840> though<00:01:42.900> this<00:01:43.080> is<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> geekbench<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and even though this is just geekbench I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.440 
and even though this is just geekbench I
say<00:01:44.700> editing<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.570> imovie<00:01:45.900> and<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:47.150> final<00:01:48.150> cut

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
say editing in imovie and a final cut

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.410 
say editing in imovie and a final cut
and<00:01:48.480> after<00:01:49.110> effects<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.700> blazing<00:01:50.700> fast<00:01:50.730> and<00:01:51.300> i

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and after effects is blazing fast and i

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.630 
and after effects is blazing fast and i
can't<00:01:51.660> wait<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.530> next<00:01:52.650> final<00:01:53.100> cut<00:01:53.400> a

it's<00:02:02.940> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> taking<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.810> um<00:02:05.150> well<00:02:06.150> I<00:02:06.180> say

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it's going to be taking a um well I say

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's going to be taking a um well I say
advantage<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.410> grand<00:02:07.800> central<00:02:08.040> dispatch<00:02:08.610> so

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
advantage of grand central dispatch so

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
advantage of grand central dispatch so
use<00:02:09.270> more<00:02:09.450> cores<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.100> right<00:02:11.100> there<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> got

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
use more cores and right there I got

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.780 
use more cores and right there I got
pretty<00:02:11.940> much<00:02:12.120> 12<00:02:12.540> x<00:02:12.900> 400<00:02:13.830> let<00:02:14.459> me<00:02:14.550> show<00:02:14.760> you

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
pretty much 12 x 400 let me show you

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.350 
pretty much 12 x 400 let me show you
this<00:02:15.300> screenshot<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.700> without

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
this screenshot and that is without

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.350 
this screenshot and that is without
running<00:02:18.840> ScreenFlow<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.920> got<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> 12<00:02:20.490> 8<00:02:20.730> 22

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
running ScreenFlow and I got a 12 8 22

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.020 
running ScreenFlow and I got a 12 8 22
and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.120> got<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> 12<00:02:24.720> 8<00:02:25.020> 32<00:02:26.030> also

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
and then this one got a 12 8 32 also

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.820 
and then this one got a 12 8 32 also
let's<00:02:27.270> open<00:02:27.540> up<00:02:27.660> safari

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.890 

and<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.560> my<00:02:34.970> results<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.180> geekbench<00:02:36.630> and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
and this is my results for geekbench and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.200 
and this is my results for geekbench and
as<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:38.130> my<00:02:38.310> macbook<00:02:38.850> pro

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
as you can see I have my macbook pro

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.630 
as you can see I have my macbook pro
back<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.840> day<00:02:40.070> early<00:02:41.070> two<00:02:41.190> thousand<00:02:41.490> eight

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
back in the day early two thousand eight

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.810 
back in the day early two thousand eight
and<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.090> scored<00:02:42.450> 236<00:02:42.800> 73<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.070> that<00:02:44.520> was<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
and that scored 236 73 and that was a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.970 
and that scored 236 73 and that was a
2.4<00:02:45.750> gigahertz<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:47.720> core<00:02:48.720> two<00:02:48.870> duo<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.410> also<00:02:49.650> have

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
2.4 gigahertz a core two duo I also have

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.350 
2.4 gigahertz a core two duo I also have
my<00:02:50.010> power<00:02:50.370> bank<00:02:50.610> g5<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.510> scored<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> 350<00:02:52.650> five

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
my power bank g5 that scored a 350 five

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.320 
my power bank g5 that scored a 350 five
that's<00:02:54.360> 32<00:02:55.110> bit<00:02:55.410> here's<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:55.950> yeah<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:56.580> 64<00:02:57.150> bit

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
that's 32 bit here's a yeah here 64 bit

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.460 
that's 32 bit here's a yeah here 64 bit
right<00:02:57.450> here<00:02:58.100> 365th<00:02:59.600> 3655<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.990> that's

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
right here 365th 3655 and that's

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.010 
right here 365th 3655 and that's
obviously<00:03:01.680> four<00:03:02.220> cores<00:03:02.550> two<00:03:03.240> processors<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
obviously four cores two processors and

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.530 
obviously four cores two processors and
then<00:03:04.230> right<00:03:04.410> here<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> highest<00:03:06.030> benchmark

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
then right here is the highest benchmark

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.110 
then right here is the highest benchmark
I've<00:03:06.690> done<00:03:06.990> with<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:07.350> imac<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.010> far<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.610> that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
I've done with my imac so far and that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.630 
I've done with my imac so far and that
is<00:03:09.300> 12<00:03:10.220> 897<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:12.500> benchmarks<00:03:13.500> for<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:14.010> new

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
is 12 897 so benchmarks for this new

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.840 
is 12 897 so benchmarks for this new
Thunderbolt<00:03:15.480> 27-inch<00:03:16.260> imac<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.950> blazing<00:03:17.820> fast

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
Thunderbolt 27-inch imac is blazing fast

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.449 
Thunderbolt 27-inch imac is blazing fast
and<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.020> far<00:03:19.290> I've<00:03:19.350> been<00:03:19.440> loving<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.100> haven't

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
and so far I've been loving it I haven't

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.550 
and so far I've been loving it I haven't
been<00:03:20.550> able<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.940> test<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.390> everything<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.410> it

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
been able to test out everything on it

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.440 
been able to test out everything on it
so<00:03:22.740> far<00:03:22.950> like<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.280> haven't<00:03:23.640> been<00:03:23.790> able<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.180> test

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
so far like I haven't been able to test

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.410 
so far like I haven't been able to test
out<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.900> lot<00:03:25.680> of<00:03:26.010> after<00:03:26.370> effects<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.940> lot<00:03:27.240> of

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
out a lot of after effects or a lot of

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.510 
out a lot of after effects or a lot of
compressor<00:03:28.080> but<00:03:28.650> i<00:03:28.680> will<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:28.980> doing<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.459> very

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
compressor but i will be doing that very

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.030 
compressor but i will be doing that very
shortly<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:31.050> has<00:03:31.170> been<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.380> fro<00:03:31.590> pin<00:03:31.800> kit

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
shortly so this has been a fro pin kit

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.650 
shortly so this has been a fro pin kit
and<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.610> videos<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.390> way<00:03:33.650> peace
