00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.930 

I<00:00:05.109> love<00:00:06.109> designing<00:00:06.590> with<00:00:06.920> twisted<00:00:07.460> stitches

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:07.940 
I love designing with twisted stitches

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.360 
I love designing with twisted stitches
but<00:00:08.809> sometimes<00:00:09.290> it<00:00:09.440> can<00:00:09.530> be<00:00:09.590> a<00:00:09.710> little<00:00:09.920> tricky

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
but sometimes it can be a little tricky

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.140 
but sometimes it can be a little tricky
to<00:00:10.490> know<00:00:10.700> how<00:00:11.030> to<00:00:11.090> hide<00:00:11.840> the<00:00:12.320> decreases<00:00:13.039> so<00:00:13.969> I'm

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
to know how to hide the decreases so I'm

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.820 
to know how to hide the decreases so I'm
going<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.420> show<00:00:14.600> you<00:00:14.629> what<00:00:14.990> I<00:00:15.020> use<00:00:15.379> for<00:00:15.680> my

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
going to show you what I use for my

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.540 
going to show you what I use for my
patterns<00:00:16.570> there<00:00:17.570> are<00:00:17.930> two<00:00:18.470> kinds<00:00:18.980> that<00:00:19.130> I<00:00:19.160> use

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
patterns there are two kinds that I use

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.460 
patterns there are two kinds that I use
and<00:00:19.939> what<00:00:20.150> I<00:00:20.179> call<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.689> knit<00:00:21.050> two<00:00:21.289> together

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
and what I call the knit two together

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.079 
and what I call the knit two together
twists<00:00:22.130> and<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:23.060> other<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.660> SSK<00:00:24.439> twist

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.089 
twists and the other is the SSK twist

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.599 
twists and the other is the SSK twist
now<00:00:26.089> the<00:00:26.150> knit<00:00:26.539> two<00:00:26.779> together<00:00:27.050> twist<00:00:27.740> uses<00:00:28.310> the

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
now the knit two together twist uses the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.239 
now the knit two together twist uses the
twisted<00:00:29.300> stitch<00:00:29.599> first<00:00:30.019> and<00:00:30.349> then<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.890> hides

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:31.249 
twisted stitch first and then it hides

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.150 
twisted stitch first and then it hides
the<00:00:31.640> purl<00:00:32.360> stitch<00:00:32.509> behind<00:00:33.110> it<00:00:33.260> I'll<00:00:33.890> show<00:00:34.100> you

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
the purl stitch behind it I'll show you

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.230 
the purl stitch behind it I'll show you
how<00:00:34.370> I<00:00:34.400> do<00:00:34.550> this<00:00:35.350> my<00:00:36.350> patterns<00:00:36.800> call<00:00:37.040> to<00:00:37.370> insert

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
how I do this my patterns call to insert

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.470 
how I do this my patterns call to insert
the<00:00:38.420> right<00:00:38.600> needle<00:00:39.220> purlwise<00:00:40.220> into<00:00:41.090> the<00:00:41.210> first

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
the right needle purlwise into the first

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.740 
the right needle purlwise into the first
stitch<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.760> then<00:00:43.760> while<00:00:44.030> it's<00:00:44.240> still<00:00:44.450> in<00:00:44.600> this

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
stitch and then while it's still in this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.430 
stitch and then while it's still in this
stitch<00:00:44.990> you<00:00:45.260> insert<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.790> needle<00:00:47.410> through<00:00:48.410> the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
stitch you insert the needle through the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.730 
stitch you insert the needle through the
front<00:00:48.950> loop<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:50.570> next<00:00:50.750> stitch<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.470> it

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740 
front loop of the next stitch and it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.670 
front loop of the next stitch and it
sort<00:00:52.280> of<00:00:52.310> crosses<00:00:52.520> it<00:00:52.880> over<00:00:53.150> like<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:53.680> you're

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
sort of crosses it over like that you're

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.970 
sort of crosses it over like that you're
going<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.980> come<00:00:55.220> over<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.470> draw<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.680> loop

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
going to come over and draw a loop

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.760 
going to come over and draw a loop
through<00:00:58.310> both<00:00:58.340> stitches<00:00:59.260> sort<00:01:00.260> of<00:01:00.320> like<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.650> if

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
through both stitches sort of like it if

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.060 
through both stitches sort of like it if
it<00:01:00.950> was<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.490> regular<00:01:02.180> knit<00:01:02.630> two<00:01:02.810> together<00:01:03.070> and

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
it was a regular knit two together and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.120 
it was a regular knit two together and
you'll<00:01:05.030> see<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.780> hides<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.409> decrease

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
you'll see that it hides the decrease

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.999 
you'll see that it hides the decrease
behind<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.030> newly-formed<00:01:08.740> twisted<00:01:09.740> stitch

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
behind the newly-formed twisted stitch

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:21.390 
behind the newly-formed twisted stitch
and<00:01:10.670> then<00:01:10.939> you<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.329> go<00:01:12.049> on<00:01:12.229> your<00:01:12.259> way

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.610 

the<00:01:22.060> next<00:01:22.390> decrease<00:01:22.840> I'm<00:01:23.050> going<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:23.350> show<00:01:23.560> you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
the next decrease I'm going to show you

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.470 
the next decrease I'm going to show you
is<00:01:24.190> what<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.460> call<00:01:24.820> an<00:01:25.030> SSK<00:01:25.540> twist<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.480> even

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
is what I call an SSK twist and even

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.070 
is what I call an SSK twist and even
though<00:01:28.570> it's<00:01:28.720> called

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
though it's called

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.800 
though it's called
SS<00:01:29.470> cave<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:30.430> decrease<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.150> going<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.510> lean

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
SS cave this decrease is going to lean

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.910 
SS cave this decrease is going to lean
to<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.770> right<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:34.150> is<00:01:34.330> SSK<00:01:34.750> about<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.470> is<00:01:35.620> its

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
to the right what is SSK about it is its

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.830 
to the right what is SSK about it is its
construction<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.880> I'll<00:01:37.090> show<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.300> how<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> do

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
construction and I'll show you how to do

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.590 
construction and I'll show you how to do
that<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:39.190> first<00:01:39.460> set<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.670> instruction<00:01:40.330> says

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
that the first set of instruction says

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.680 
that the first set of instruction says
to<00:01:41.070> slip<00:01:42.070> one<00:01:42.490> stitch<00:01:42.520> under<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.360> cable

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
to slip one stitch under the cable

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.890 
to slip one stitch under the cable
needle<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.140> hold<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.950> back<00:01:45.900> next

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
needle and hold it in the back next

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.990 
needle and hold it in the back next
we're<00:01:47.290> going<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.680> slip<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.280> next<00:01:48.430> stitch<00:01:48.610> on

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
we're going to slip the next stitch on

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.960 
we're going to slip the next stitch on
the<00:01:49.120> Left<00:01:49.330> needle<00:01:49.680> purlwise<00:01:50.680> under<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.790> right

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
the Left needle purlwise under the right

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.969 
the Left needle purlwise under the right
needle<00:01:53.430> next<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:55.030> take<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:56.080> stitch<00:01:56.470> that's<00:01:56.710> on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
needle next we take the stitch that's on

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.850 
needle next we take the stitch that's on
the<00:01:57.130> cable<00:01:57.490> needle<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:57.910> slip<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.660> knit<00:01:59.590> wise

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
the cable needle and slip it knit wise

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.980 
the cable needle and slip it knit wise
this<00:02:00.220> time<00:02:00.520> onto<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.900> right<00:02:02.080> needle<00:02:03.990> yeah

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
this time onto the right needle yeah

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.380 
this time onto the right needle yeah
just<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.650> would<00:02:05.860> with<00:02:05.890> a<00:02:06.070> regular<00:02:06.580> SSK

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
just like you would with a regular SSK

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.100 
just like you would with a regular SSK
we're<00:02:08.320> going<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.500> slip<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.100> left<00:02:09.580> needle

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
we're going to slip the left needle

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.690 
we're going to slip the left needle
through<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.140> front<00:02:11.440> loops<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.520> two

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
through the front loops of the two

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.720 
through the front loops of the two
stitches<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.300> your<00:02:13.480> right<00:02:13.660> needle<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.730> knit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
stitches on your right needle and knit

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.340 
stitches on your right needle and knit
them<00:02:15.970> together<00:02:16.120> just<00:02:16.660> like<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.959> would<00:02:17.170> with<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
them together just like you would with a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.670 
them together just like you would with a
regular<00:02:17.830> SSK<00:02:18.490> and<00:02:18.870> you'll<00:02:19.870> see<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.440> hides

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
regular SSK and you'll see that it hides

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.340 
regular SSK and you'll see that it hides
the<00:02:20.980> decrease<00:02:21.459> then<00:02:21.790> behind<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.930> twisted

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
the decrease then behind the twisted

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.190 
the decrease then behind the twisted
stitches<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.240> love<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.660> method<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:28.269> then

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
stitches so I love that method and then

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.900 
stitches so I love that method and then
we<00:02:29.320> keep<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.709> with<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> twisted<00:02:30.580> stitch

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
we keep going with the twisted stitch

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.360 
we keep going with the twisted stitch
and<00:02:31.239> then<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.769> purl<00:02:33.010> background<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:36.100> show<00:02:36.310> you

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and then the purl background to show you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.580 
and then the purl background to show you
that<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.880> more<00:02:36.910> time<00:02:37.120> I'm<00:02:38.050> going<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> start

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
that one more time I'm going to start

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.860 
that one more time I'm going to start
again<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.430> knit<00:02:39.700> two<00:02:39.970> together<00:02:40.180> twist

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
again with that knit two together twist

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.110 
again with that knit two together twist
at<00:02:41.320> least<00:02:41.560> that's<00:02:41.830> what<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.040> call<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:44.820> now<00:02:45.820> it's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
at least that's what I call it now it's

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.320 
at least that's what I call it now it's
going<00:02:46.360> to<00:02:46.450> form<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:47.019> lean<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.550> left<00:02:48.580> even

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
going to form a lean to the left even

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.780 
going to form a lean to the left even
though<00:02:49.450> it's<00:02:49.630> called<00:02:49.810> knit<00:02:50.080> two<00:02:50.290> together<00:02:50.790> but

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
though it's called knit two together but

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.070 
though it's called knit two together but
that's<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.480> its<00:02:52.630> construction

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
that's because of its construction

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.190 
that's because of its construction
rather<00:02:53.650> than<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.130> way<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.610> leans<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.080> this

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
rather than the way it leans so for this

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.890 
rather than the way it leans so for this
one<00:02:56.440> we're<00:02:56.590> going<00:02:56.769> to<00:02:56.890> go<00:02:57.130> purl<00:02:58.120> wise<00:02:58.390> into<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
one we're going to go purl wise into the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.350 
one we're going to go purl wise into the
first<00:02:59.200> stitch<00:02:59.730> twist<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:01.120> needle<00:03:01.690> tip<00:03:01.930> around

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
first stitch twist the needle tip around

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.240 
first stitch twist the needle tip around
go<00:03:04.360> through<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.780> front<00:03:05.049> loop<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.980> purl

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
go through the front loop of the purl

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.270 
go through the front loop of the purl
stitch<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.850> comes<00:03:07.030> next<00:03:07.360> on<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.720> needle

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
stitch that comes next on the needle

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.190 
stitch that comes next on the needle
knit<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> two<00:03:09.670> together<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.870> like<00:03:10.959> you

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
knit the two together just like you

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.180 
knit the two together just like you
would<00:03:11.440> predict<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.400> two<00:03:12.459> together<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:14.190> drop

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
would predict a two together and drop

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.210 
would predict a two together and drop
them<00:03:15.400> off<00:03:15.549> your<00:03:15.730> needle<00:03:16.080> so<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.380> decrease<00:03:17.920> is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
them off your needle so the decrease is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.650 
them off your needle so the decrease is
hidden<00:03:18.730> nicely<00:03:19.660> behind<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.140> twisted<00:03:20.590> stitch

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.840 

Oh<00:03:27.260> keep<00:03:28.260> going<00:03:28.290> over<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.100> next<00:03:29.300> decrease

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
Oh keep going over to the next decrease

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.940 
Oh keep going over to the next decrease
and<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:33.930> I<00:03:34.140> call<00:03:34.440> an<00:03:34.620> SSK<00:03:35.160> decrease<00:03:36.950> even

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
and this one I call an SSK decrease even

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.920 
and this one I call an SSK decrease even
though<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.190> really<00:03:38.490> leans<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
though it really leans to the right the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.290 
though it really leans to the right the
SSK<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.280> construction<00:03:41.850> that<00:03:42.180> I'm

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
SSK is the construction that I'm

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.330 
SSK is the construction that I'm
conferring<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.350> rather<00:03:43.590> than<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.100> way<00:03:44.190> it's

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
conferring to rather than the way it's

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.000 
conferring to rather than the way it's
leaning<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.660> we're<00:03:45.870> gonna<00:03:45.960> slip<00:03:46.380> 1<00:03:46.620> purlwise

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
leaning so we're gonna slip 1 purlwise

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.560 
leaning so we're gonna slip 1 purlwise
onto<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:47.910> cable<00:03:48.300> needle<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.360> hold<00:03:51.360> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
onto the cable needle like that hold it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.800 
onto the cable needle like that hold it
in<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> back<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:53.430> next<00:03:53.700> stitch<00:03:54.000> we're<00:03:54.780> going

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
in the back the next stitch we're going

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.110 
in the back the next stitch we're going
to<00:03:54.960> slip<00:03:55.200> purl<00:03:55.530> wise<00:03:55.800> onto<00:03:56.460> the<00:03:56.580> right<00:03:56.850> needle

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
to slip purl wise onto the right needle

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.250 
to slip purl wise onto the right needle
like<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:59.000> then<00:04:00.000> we<00:04:00.240> take<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.510> stitch<00:04:01.020> that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
like that then we take that stitch that

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.100 
like that then we take that stitch that
was<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.710> cable<00:04:02.130> needle<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:06.690> we're<00:04:06.960> going

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
was on the cable needle and we're going

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.630 
was on the cable needle and we're going
to<00:04:07.280> slip<00:04:08.280> it<00:04:08.900> knit<00:04:09.900> wise<00:04:10.370> onto<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.490> right

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
to slip it knit wise onto the right

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.039 
to slip it knit wise onto the right
needle<00:04:12.410> like<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:14.660> then<00:04:15.660> we're<00:04:15.840> going<00:04:15.990> to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
needle like that then we're going to

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.110 
needle like that then we're going to
insert<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.560> tip<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.220> left<00:04:17.400> needle<00:04:17.730> into

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
insert the tip of the left needle into

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.780 
insert the tip of the left needle into
the<00:04:18.270> front<00:04:18.600> loops<00:04:18.959> of<00:04:19.290> both<00:04:19.950> those<00:04:20.250> right<00:04:20.520> hand

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
the front loops of both those right hand

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.420 
the front loops of both those right hand
needle<00:04:20.970> stitches<00:04:21.800> just<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.100> would<00:04:23.280> with

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
needle stitches just like you would with

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.150 
needle stitches just like you would with
a<00:04:23.460> regular<00:04:23.880> SSK<00:04:24.600> get<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.500> cable<00:04:25.830> needle<00:04:25.920> out

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
a regular SSK get the cable needle out

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.470 
a regular SSK get the cable needle out
of<00:04:26.310> there<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:28.400> then<00:04:29.400> knit<00:04:29.940> those<00:04:30.120> two

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
of there and then knit those two

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.310 
of there and then knit those two
together<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:32.130> you'll<00:04:32.310> see<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.580> forms<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.390> nice

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
together and you'll see it forms a nice

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.370 
together and you'll see it forms a nice
decrease<00:04:34.830> hidden<00:04:35.190> behind<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:36.380> twisted

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
decrease hidden behind the twisted

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.310 
decrease hidden behind the twisted
stitch<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.820> it's<00:04:42.000> a<00:04:42.090> little<00:04:42.240> unorthodox<00:04:42.510> but

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
stitch so it's a little unorthodox but

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.720 
stitch so it's a little unorthodox but
this<00:04:43.530> is<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.830> way<00:04:43.919> I<00:04:43.950> like<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.460> do<00:04:44.580> my

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
this is the way I like to do my

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.970 
this is the way I like to do my
decreases<00:04:45.390> for<00:04:45.600> things<00:04:45.810> like<00:04:45.900> hats<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.770> use

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
decreases for things like hats that use

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.150 
decreases for things like hats that use
