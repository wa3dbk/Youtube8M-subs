00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 the most interesting thing is that today 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.299
 day is the only country in the world that 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.370
 warns pregnant women on that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 that alcohol can be dangerous for their 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 future children this is France in their 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.830
 Bottled with alcohol is worth a little 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.869
 true but the emblems of the curve icon 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.869
 crossed pregnant really 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.119
 it's no secret that such an opinion exists 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 she actually existed throughout 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.750
 in general, quite a long time 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.899
 about the fact that even the expectant mother is nothing 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 so bad to have a glass 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.110
 there may be two wines at dinner not 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 something bad is not the opposite 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 baby sleep tightly injected there inside in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 tummy something else something really it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.870
 totally inconsistent 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 reality today already 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.949
 proved unfortunately that the so -called 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.449
 fetal alcohol syndrome is this 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.899
 group condition arising from 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.960
 action on the developing child 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:10.530
 future baby in utero even 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.510
 small doses of alcohol any and here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.320
 no longer fundamentally mom drank 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.820
 a stack of vodka or 2 glasses of beer or 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.920
 one and a half glasses of wine 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.560
 the action will be almost the same 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 toxic effect of alcohol 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.100
 the colossal brain of the unborn child 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 which is affected by toxic effects 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 alcohol in utero he never 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.990
 can develop fully and from this 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.659
 man unfortunately never grows 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 nor einstein they are even a little bit 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.500
 decently successful 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.399
 in any profession a person is young 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.979
 women who want to be moms they 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.850
 should naturally do for themselves 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 the choice that is more important to them here it is 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.250
 their way of life and the reluctance 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.000
 yourself personally loved in something to infringe 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.000
 or all the same 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.600
 opportunity to give birth and give opportunity 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 live a healthy and full life 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 to your own child
