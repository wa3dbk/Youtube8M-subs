00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
covered with the ring finger let's say I

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.470 
covered with the ring finger let's say I
jumped<00:03:06.220> right<00:03:06.370> in<00:03:06.549> there<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.180> index

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
jumped right in there with the index

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.210 
jumped right in there with the index
finger

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.530 

that's<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.370> cool<00:03:12.579> sound<00:03:12.909> there<00:03:13.120> instead<00:03:13.480> of

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
that's a cool sound there instead of

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.800 
that's a cool sound there instead of
adjusted<00:03:15.540> notes<00:03:16.540> by<00:03:16.720> themselves

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
adjusted notes by themselves

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.039 
adjusted notes by themselves
we<00:03:19.810> play<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.170> two<00:03:20.379> of<00:03:20.620> 4th<00:03:21.430> fret<00:03:21.909> notes<00:03:22.239> the

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
we play the two of 4th fret notes the

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.170 
we play the two of 4th fret notes the
interval<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.650> 4th<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.459> coincidentally

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
interval is a 4th just coincidentally

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.830 
interval is a 4th just coincidentally
and<00:03:25.360> then<00:03:26.489> there's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.609> third<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:28.390> interval

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and then there's a third the interval

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.270 
and then there's a third the interval
when<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.290> add<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.950> fourth<00:03:30.670> string<00:03:31.120> sixth<00:03:31.900> fret

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
when I add the fourth string sixth fret

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.680 
when I add the fourth string sixth fret
and<00:03:33.790> it's<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.150> second<00:03:35.370> when<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.460> add<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.420> fourth

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
and it's a second when I add the fourth

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.170 
and it's a second when I add the fourth
string<00:03:37.900> seventh<00:03:38.350> fret<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.580> the<00:03:39.670> Harmony

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
string seventh fret so the Harmony

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:49.370 
string seventh fret so the Harmony
changes<00:03:40.630> even<00:03:40.780> though<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.140> note<00:03:41.380> doesn't

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
