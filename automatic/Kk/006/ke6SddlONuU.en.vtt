00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.130
 very good everyone again 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.360
 in this new video I'm going to record a 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.110
 exercise following the dynamics a bit 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.910
 of the previous year also reference 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.830
 to the issue of warming to the issue of 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.060
 first embouchure exercises 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.060
 sound and the whole subject 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.100
 exercise 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.470
 It is very similar to the previous ones 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.660
 simply that we are going to do 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.779
 different notes but always using 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.180
 same piston position 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.590
 starting for example with all the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.079
 air pistons 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.019
 starting with sun and then let's go 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.600
 going down a semitone down to 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.390
 follow the same dynamic has sustained fa 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.900
 natural my natural we must run 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.290
 sharp of natural 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.270
 those obtained and 2 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.520
 so you can see a bit the kind of 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.180
 exercise that is the exercise begins 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:01.060
 being white I'm going to do a couple of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.520
 them in white and then the others the 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.500
 I'm going to do to go a little faster 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.900
 I 'm going to do it 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.630
 but logically with every combination of 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.510
 piston would ideally be that first what 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.850
 do white as it is in the 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 written in the year that you also 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.280
 I will spend it as always in the part of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.140
 below the description of the video and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.800
 then I 'll give it a little bit of 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.890
 speed 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.890
 exercise would be like this 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 ah 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.840
 that would be the sun then it would go to the fa 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 sustained 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:02.480
 country pa country country country 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.710
 once you do it all more or 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.690
 less in this way this speed 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.500
 you if you can put them 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 metronome because it would even be better that way 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.910
 he is taking everything at the same time and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.000
 validate also wings by own 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.480
 control of the fingers and a little 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.700
 from also speaking the language of the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.750
 pronunciation of the note then the others 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.270
 others 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.400
 exercises that come because I'm going to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.020
 do a little bit faster but they would be 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.580
 following the scales we have said that 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.470
 We started with sun then by fa 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.470
 sharp now would come natural 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.460
 and now 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.069
 then my 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.030
 for dad 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.730
 would not come flat 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:27.040
 to my dad 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.770
 would then re 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.610
 ah 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.990
 and then I would have been told that it was coming 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.440
 those obtained by forgiving sharp comes 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.440
 natural gift 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:10.950
 ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.850
 and then the exercise ends as we have 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.329
 returned we have started at the beginning in 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.329
 Sun 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.180
 a a 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.639
 well, this would be this exercise 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.310
 full 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.889
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.080
 I already tell you it 's repeated in the same way 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.270
 first do it with white then yes 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.219
 you want to do it with blacks and 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.650
 two if you want then you can do it with 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.419
 corcheas well that you are going 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.099
 putting a bit of the same exercise what 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.020
 you can take a lot and you can 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.520
 get pretty much the same 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.000
 exercise for example if you do it with 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.750
 quaver 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.750
 and something like that 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.000
 and thus progressively with 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:53.009
 exempt more speed and until 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.009
 you want so good this 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:06:00.650
 exercise we leave it here and see you in 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.650
 the next video of the channel a greeting
