 it's a mission I believe this loneliness in the facts have been 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.820
 destroyed yes by the way we broke the balls plucking at least five thousand 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.210
 pau call centers 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030

 cost the ai did not make the plug 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.860
 at the time the card now on the quarter you will see produce 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.030
 above 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.020
 like the pentagon seen from the sky 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 nothing exceptional right you could see houses described like that with 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.380
 a little bit of forest and mountains 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.710
 Vietnamese series side 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.950
 okay then down left 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.490
 bottom right okay e you can see do it 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.790
 we call to a Flemish man does that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.790
 I do not know, I will tell you when we arrive 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 the artilleryman wherever I go to see I finally believe a new day we will close 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.860
 will close his retirement and hop down left making an aerial view of a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.090
 base of the word to the mysteries listen this is the base 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.369
 not to mention a little bit of ethics 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:19.169
 Deaneba Dassin remains secret in the middle of the Nevada desert that you do not 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.169
 not find on google maps if you are looking for m 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.149
 in the locker room I have no report 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:28.900
 but in big theft auto san andreas if he does not pause and east 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.089
 by plane 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.469
 in the bass and avoid that there is too much 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.909
 patrick that exactly 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.829
 I do not know who has a big new room% yes so I talked about a portrait 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.359
 who comes back several more times here and so that total authors you can 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.819
 to see him 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.029
 at the n-va were deported and you arrive in a room 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:52.480
 of the Pentagon in celebration after teleporter there watching - 1 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.829
 but a portrait that depicts a man a military pm 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.870
 who seems to like it enough or was known from people 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.879
 and it's quite strange because this soldier appeared several times 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.879
 in several places in this map is so a total there is mans 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.619
 and besides we do not understand why the attacked did weird 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:12.719
 in the facts 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.459
 tables it's now 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 see how I am still 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.139
 a flight to spread the us open 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.459
 here 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.099
 in the after the clique 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.059
 because we're going to talk about portraits 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.919
 hornets side in the normal pentagon whether it's wing history 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.189
 normal that this is the story of the American presidents who is 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:36.749
 great men one can see a drama of a calm one who had lost a 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.719
 ear I believe 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.229
 for the 16th president of the united states 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.799
 here in the jama franklin 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.279
 the founding father I liked it well what was baptized a pretty little 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:46.979
 mug 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.209
 for 100 m alexander hamilton the first treasurer of the usa 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:54.540

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.559
 philips 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.559
 so sentence just to see a trick look here on machines 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.930
 I marked the symbol very strong treyarch next to marked three parks 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.079
 thibault while elsewhere we are at the c 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.469
 in fact that's parts for those who do not know and there are different 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.259
 sports shops matrix cutter it's too much but I can not master the 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:19.180
 alvarez time aside in fact these reels would equate to treat the 33 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.699
 minors where they are the little door 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.919
 and that's the holy stone recipe motivated this idea 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.519
 this cleric you are motivated some vector residents 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.479
 who takes peach the zombies to live and not humans so for the sequel but 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.879
 everything starts to hear 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.919
 as long as I think about it 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.809
 in the great hall 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.249
 e 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:44.890
 to manage after oil 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.030
 look over in German the two screens shows them cards 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.480
 loaned to greece who died yeah 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.130
 and apparently it would be mission debriefing because yahve of 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.840
 strategic locations on 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.850
 the whole team of the little tricks other lure the marker to say that 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.310
 plus we'll say it's a click 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.529
 on the small prices on the desks and pieces of the being 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.819

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.330
 we will do a little bookkeeping account of Mexican authors president didier 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.220
 Wacogne 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.220
 the least excuse to find it we will show you 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.020
 so welcome to the main room 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.289
 hard 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.919
 pentagon 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.789
 with a table david actors 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.990
 keep sr 71 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.580
 actually make them feel lonely the minister 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.240
 the finding the black block for most 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.509
 which displays the friends in triangle on your map 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:37.949
 of 1963 apparently 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.360
 so we can see dates with pilots 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.949
 and at the distance they traveled in place of hours 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.759
 we can see that gascoyne 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.720
 in the midst of the markets for which black or white means survivors 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.289
 drafted 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.599
 our backcountry departure 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.339
 davies listen to the water and we picked it up

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.369
 averna abdel 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.969
 in the north of Mali in minutes its marks in Spanish 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.339

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.889
 and the river we have 33 or lower wages 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.959

 the boxing cladding a great vietnam river that furnish climatic 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.749
 percent yes here 

00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:35.779
 the stairs leading up with traces of blood nothing amazing but 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.759
 strange enough as m 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.490
 it's hectic for me yeah 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.820
 at the back of the room I put in the times square area the 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.360

 another quarter of a century 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.610

 and what I think he will have relations between countries where he is held just 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.330
 it surprises you 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.349
 yes for the cruise 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:18.969
