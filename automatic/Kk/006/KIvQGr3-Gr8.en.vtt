00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.330
 maybe already in the background 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 I can not go to Hamburg at the moment 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.030
 altona where else it is done but 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.350
 about 23 hours of flight with its 9000 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 kilometers away from hamburg-altona 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.970
 i can choose colorado thats 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.170
 actually a winter sport, however 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
 summer is also extreme 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.380
 important about 30 degrees we are up 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 2500 meters altitude in these days could 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.710
 you actually want gold per ton 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 call why just that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 Mountain bikes take place this is one 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.180
 get together for extreme sports from the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.399
 Area mountain bike kayaking stand up 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:49.050
 paddling bmx and many more now 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 you ask yourself what does exist say 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.160
 if the people with the cameras 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 want to test real heart and kidneys 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.829
 on whether they are water-resistant if they 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.079
 dust is whether they can in the slush from 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.690
 then we want to bid or it works 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.860
 and I really look for what coco is with 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.680
 the technological stock whole 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.970
 Weekends instead of and the program means 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.720
 It starts at 39 with a kayak 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.720
 deliver down 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.109
 two and a half times in the kayak does not go 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.390
 I know it will continue after that 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:29.979
 bed it is that is an obstacle more 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.829
 Safety is the name of the game 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.280
 be with the most extreme exige warrior 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.640
 allowed 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.810
 the gopro will be there all the time 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.439
 heart and kidney testing i am very 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.840
 curious; excited 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.819
 Above all, I'm curious if I am 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 it was by holding because everyone on 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.270
 certain height from 2000 was 3000 meters 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.649
 who knows it is pretty good on the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.250
 lunge that goes pretty well on the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.200
 circulation 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.509
 I will do my best I hope 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.259
 The group also holds and I'm happy 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 me animal on sievert 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.360
 that was 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.920
 my change 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.050
 that with 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.209
 so 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.169
 With 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.890
 back at the hotel what brought once 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.380
 this one 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.380
 and once 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.130
 this one 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.040
 that means I had 44 kilometers 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.440
 character lip and about 13 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.990
 kilometer battlestations midway the cash 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.150
 this is an obstacle in cross-country skiing with 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.229
 hindered me as announced 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.500
 but 32 and with lots of snow with a lot 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.710
 Mud with a lot of pull-ups with a lot 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.080
 sandbags drag pretty worn 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.370
 is 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.750
 and I promised that we would 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.729
 test affair for them for human and 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.840
 machine 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.250
 I believe I can do it right and right 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.380
 it has also become known 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.510
 I am now the biggest fan agoco 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.889
 I had one with me all the time 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:47.139
 chest strap around a so-called trustee 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.210
 does not have to worry about anything else starts the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:52.210
 recording everything 2 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.880
 But I also noticed that the coco 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.450
 for beginners 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.730
 A slight hurdle applies that means 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.740
 when i use the gopro apples smartphone 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.420
 or tablet then I have all 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.160
 I can do settings directly 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:11.760
 I immediately change the resolution, the 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.170
 Resolving the photos change I have all 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.430
 Modes I need to prepare directly only in 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.590
 many situations in which I have a cow 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.000
 pro would use mine 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.380
 Do not exclude smartphone when I go to 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.600
 example in a river am i if 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.680
 I'm going for the obstacle course 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.540
 just press the button quickly 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.490
 and press this on the blog 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.080
 Sounds easy in such 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.240
 but not so easy 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.970
 and it takes a few days to get there 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.440
 the house has but then makes a lot 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.020
 fun 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:40.210
 I am quite taken with the gopro 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.139
 elaborate what is there 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.030
 to say in the Wendland 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.460
 It's a great event 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.259
 have fun and great people i could 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.069
 also say I do not have mine 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:56.279
 Colleagues from China from London from Paris 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.499
 already allowed to drive so much yesterday 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:59.220
 I was already hungover many 

00:06:58.499 --> 00:07:00.780
 other 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.800
 And that was not the best preparation 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.380
 for the ident I think today is life 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.700
 take it a bit easier 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.700
