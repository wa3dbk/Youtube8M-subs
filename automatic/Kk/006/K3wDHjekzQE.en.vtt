I<00:00:25.390> use<00:00:25.869> really<00:00:26.829> often<00:00:27.220> it's<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.759> cradle<00:00:28.060> jig<00:00:28.449> for

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
I use really often it's a cradle jig for

cutting slots for spline miter joints

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.079 
cutting slots for spline miter joints
which<00:00:35.199> are<00:00:36.300> splines<00:00:37.300> that<00:00:37.930> reinforce<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:39.309> case

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
which are splines that reinforce a case

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.270 
which are splines that reinforce a case
miter<00:00:40.540> which<00:00:40.870> needs<00:00:41.290> reinforcement<00:00:42.190> because

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
miter which needs reinforcement because

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.770 
miter which needs reinforcement because
it's<00:00:42.519> kind<00:00:42.730> of<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.850> weak<00:00:43.059> joint<00:00:43.360> in<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.720> of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
it's kind of a weak joint in and of

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.990 
it's kind of a weak joint in and of
itself<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.320> nice<00:00:44.500> thing<00:00:44.830> about<00:00:44.860> spline<00:00:45.640> miter

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
itself the nice thing about spline miter

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.229 
itself the nice thing about spline miter
joints<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:47.019> that<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.830> can<00:00:48.040> make<00:00:48.640> them<00:00:48.850> out<00:00:49.119> of

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
joints is that you can make them out of

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.509 
joints is that you can make them out of
contrasting<00:00:50.080> wood<00:00:50.350> as<00:00:50.619> you<00:00:50.650> see<00:00:50.979> here<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.400> this

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
contrasting wood as you see here in this

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.509 
contrasting wood as you see here in this
jewelry<00:00:52.000> box<00:00:52.440> glue<00:00:53.440> them<00:00:53.589> in<00:00:53.710> place<00:00:53.739> cut<00:00:54.369> them

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
jewelry box glue them in place cut them

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.490 
jewelry box glue them in place cut them
flush<00:00:54.850> and<00:00:55.239> you've<00:00:55.360> got<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.570> really<00:00:55.809> nice<00:00:56.110> look

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
flush and you've got a really nice look

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.520 
flush and you've got a really nice look
at<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.799> very<00:00:57.010> strong<00:00:57.400> joint<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.989> I<00:00:59.019> make<00:00:59.350> this

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
at a very strong joint so I make this

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.060 
at a very strong joint so I make this
cradle<00:01:00.040> jig<00:01:00.309> for<00:01:00.879> cutting<00:01:01.839> the<00:01:02.080> slots<00:01:02.439> now<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
cradle jig for cutting the slots now the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.940 
cradle jig for cutting the slots now the
jig<00:01:03.610> itself<00:01:03.970> is<00:01:04.330> pretty<00:01:04.659> simply<00:01:05.140> made<00:01:05.350> it's<00:01:05.650> a

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
jig itself is pretty simply made it's a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.859 
jig itself is pretty simply made it's a
panel<00:01:06.909> basically<00:01:07.330> that<00:01:08.200> has<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:09.640> zero<00:01:10.509> play

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
panel basically that has these zero play

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.850 
panel basically that has these zero play
guide<00:01:11.439> bars<00:01:11.799> attached<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:13.830> after<00:01:14.830> you've

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
guide bars attached to it after you've

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.010 
guide bars attached to it after you've
adjusted<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.640> guide<00:01:15.880> bars<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.570> installed

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
adjusted the guide bars and installed

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.680 
adjusted the guide bars and installed
them<00:01:17.290> as<00:01:17.650> it's<00:01:17.890> explained<00:01:18.370> elsewhere<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.540> can

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
them as it's explained elsewhere you can

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.720 
them as it's explained elsewhere you can
see<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.990> there's<00:01:20.170> no<00:01:20.410> play<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.920> all<00:01:21.040> in<00:01:21.100> the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
see that there's no play at all in the

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.840 
see that there's no play at all in the
jig<00:01:22.360> which<00:01:22.870> ensures<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.530> nice<00:01:23.860> clean<00:01:24.430> slot

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
jig which ensures a nice clean slot

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.670 
jig which ensures a nice clean slot
that's<00:01:25.060> very<00:01:25.360> important<00:01:25.870> other<00:01:26.290> than<00:01:26.530> that

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
that's very important other than that

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.950 
that's very important other than that
the<00:01:26.860> jig<00:01:27.100> is<00:01:27.130> pretty<00:01:27.760> simply<00:01:28.180> made<00:01:28.420> it's<00:01:28.659> just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the jig is pretty simply made it's just

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.010 
the jig is pretty simply made it's just
a<00:01:29.050> couple<00:01:29.380> pieces<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.880> half-inch<00:01:30.880> plywood<00:01:31.240> set

up our zero play stop so to use the jig
you<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:09.629> cut<00:02:10.629> your<00:02:10.750> miters<00:02:11.200> glue<00:02:12.099> your<00:02:12.760> case

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you just cut your miters glue your case

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.600 
you just cut your miters glue your case
miters<00:02:13.540> all<00:02:13.720> together<00:02:13.959> then<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.220> cut<00:02:15.459> your

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
miters all together then you cut your

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.949 
miters all together then you cut your
slots<00:02:16.000> by<00:02:17.670> placing<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> box<00:02:19.029> in<00:02:19.689> its

the blade and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.790 
the blade and
it's<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.940> zero<00:02:25.150> place<00:02:25.510> stop<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:26.680> you're

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
it's the zero place stop now if you're

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.960 
it's the zero place stop now if you're
doing<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.280> bunch<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:28.230> evenly<00:02:29.230> spaced<00:02:29.970> spline

slots like this what I do is I set up I
set<00:02:35.830> up<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:36.040> stop<00:02:36.840> once<00:02:37.840> I've<00:02:38.080> determined<00:02:38.260> my

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
set up a stop once I've determined my

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.870 
set up a stop once I've determined my
distance<00:02:39.520> from<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.000> end<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:41.490> just<00:02:42.490> set<00:02:42.670> up<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
distance from the end I just set up a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.460 
distance from the end I just set up a
stop<00:02:43.120> here<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:44.370> feed<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> workpiece<00:02:45.940> across

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
stop here and feed the workpiece across

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.440 
stop here and feed the workpiece across
after<00:02:47.470> I've<00:02:47.830> passed<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.310> blade<00:02:48.550> take<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.210> box

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
out move to the next corner same thing

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.160 
out move to the next corner same thing
quick<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.400> easy<00:02:54.580> once<00:02:55.480> I've<00:02:55.660> done<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.900> all

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
the way around from the box around all

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.440 
the way around from the box around all
the<00:02:59.680> slots<00:03:00.630> when<00:03:01.630> I'm<00:03:01.750> done<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.700> make<00:03:03.700> my<00:03:04.690> little

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
the slots when I'm done I make my little

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.660 
the slots when I'm done I make my little
triangular<00:03:07.450> shape<00:03:07.900> spline<00:03:08.650> slots<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:09.640> that

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
triangular shape spline slots so that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.910 
triangular shape spline slots so that
splines<00:03:10.480> rather<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.200> they<00:03:11.350> fit<00:03:11.530> snugly

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
splines rather so that they fit snugly

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.080 
splines rather so that they fit snugly
into<00:03:12.190> slots<00:03:13.170> glue<00:03:14.170> them<00:03:14.380> in<00:03:14.500> place<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:15.580> trim

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
into slots glue them in place then trim

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.570 
into slots glue them in place then trim
them<00:03:16.330> with<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.960> chisel<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.710> a<00:03:17.830> sharp<00:03:18.160> block

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
them with a chisel and a sharp block

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.660 
them with a chisel and a sharp block
plane<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.830> end<00:03:20.830> up<00:03:20.950> with<00:03:21.070> these<00:03:21.250> decorative

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
plane I end up with these decorative

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.320 
plane I end up with these decorative
very<00:03:22.210> strong<00:03:22.660> joints
