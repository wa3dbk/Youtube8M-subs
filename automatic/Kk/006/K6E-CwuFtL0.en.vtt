there<00:00:39.219> are<00:00:39.370> commonly<00:00:39.760> two<00:00:40.000> ways<00:00:40.210> for<00:00:40.539> this<00:00:40.660> to

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
there are commonly two ways for this to

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.600 
there are commonly two ways for this to
happen<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.289> first<00:00:41.440> method<00:00:42.039> is<00:00:42.160> to<00:00:42.309> openly

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
happen the first method is to openly

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.060 
happen the first method is to openly
purge<00:00:42.879> a<00:00:43.059> proven<00:00:43.600> pair<00:00:43.840> of<00:00:43.930> angels<00:00:44.290> in<00:00:44.469> this

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
purge a proven pair of angels in this

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.529 
purge a proven pair of angels in this
manner<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.399> will<00:00:45.640> have<00:00:45.760> an<00:00:45.879> instant<00:00:46.269> pair<00:00:46.420> of

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
manner you will have an instant pair of

manner you will have an instant pair of
angelfish<00:00:46.930> this<00:00:47.860> can<00:00:48.070> be<00:00:48.160> very<00:00:48.399> expensive<00:00:48.730> to
