00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
little adapter right here that screws

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.139 
little adapter right here that screws
into<00:01:03.629> threads<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.800> here<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.000> got

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
threads over here for your smaller

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.160 
threads over here for your smaller
bottles<00:01:11.789> that<00:01:11.910> use<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.479> your<00:01:12.690> stove<00:01:12.960> or

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
bottles that use with your stove or

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.670 
bottles that use with your stove or
Lantern<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.560> whatever<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> just<00:01:16.080> screw

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
Lantern or whatever so you just screw

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.639 
Lantern or whatever so you just screw
this<00:01:16.860> into<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.690> left-handed<00:01:19.050> thread

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
this into here it's a left-handed thread

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.100 
this into here it's a left-handed thread
so<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.070> backwards<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.210> normally

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
so it's backwards from what you normally

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.749 
so it's backwards from what you normally
would<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.570> found<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.289> just<00:01:25.759> screw

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
would do and I found I can just screw

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.139 
would do and I found I can just screw
that<00:01:26.789> in<00:01:27.119> hand<00:01:27.420> tight<00:01:27.690> and<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.649> good<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.920> go

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.330 
that in hand tight and I'm good to go
now<00:01:30.149> I've<00:01:30.330> got<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:30.720> scoot<00:01:31.020> into<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.590> you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
now I've got this scoot into here you

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
now I've got this scoot into here you
have<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.670> start<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.210> with<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.660> big<00:01:33.899> bulk

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
have to start out with your big bulk

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.999 
have to start out with your big bulk
cylinder<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.180> upright<00:01:36.180> position<00:01:37.009> just

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
cylinder in the upright position just

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.690 
cylinder in the upright position just
screw<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.869> cylinder<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.170> into<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
screw that cylinder there into it and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.589 
screw that cylinder there into it and
we're<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.209> to<00:01:42.240> turn<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.690> upside<00:01:43.170> down<00:01:47.599> now

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
we're going to turn this upside down now

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.440 
we're going to turn this upside down now
that<00:01:48.840> that's<00:01:48.959> upside<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.160> just<00:01:50.849> reach<00:01:51.270> up

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that that's upside down I just reach up

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.529 
that that's upside down I just reach up
under<00:01:51.720> here<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.700> turn<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.849> the<00:01:54.000> gas<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
under here and turn on the gas and you

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.089 
under here and turn on the gas and you
can<00:01:54.750> hear<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.080> running<00:01:55.289> into<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:58.099> now

00:01:59.089 --> 00:01:59.099 
can hear it running into here now

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.940 
can hear it running into here now
basically<00:01:59.729> about<00:02:00.599> a<00:02:00.660> minute<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.259> something

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
basically about a minute or something

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.639 
basically about a minute or something
like<00:02:02.099> that<00:02:02.399> then<00:02:03.209> there<00:02:03.539> your<00:02:03.780> cylinder<00:02:04.560> will

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
like that then there your cylinder will

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.219 
like that then there your cylinder will
be<00:02:04.770> full<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.360> usually<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.660> listen<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
be full and usually I just listen and

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
be full and usually I just listen and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you can hear when it quits running into

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.960 
you can hear when it quits running into
there<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> just<00:02:10.590> give<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.860> another<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
there now I just give it another a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.690 
there now I just give it another a
little<00:02:12.480> bit<00:02:12.630> beyond<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.190> alright<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.459> this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
little bit beyond that alright now this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.140 
little bit beyond that alright now this
thing<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.230> full<00:02:16.230> there's<00:02:16.590> nothing<00:02:17.150> running

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
thing is full there's nothing running

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.880 
thing is full there's nothing running
anymore<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.660> there<00:02:18.840> so<00:02:19.110> we<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.260> flip<00:02:19.680> this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
anymore in there so we just flip this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.870 
anymore in there so we just flip this
right<00:02:20.630> side<00:02:21.630> up<00:02:21.840> turn<00:02:22.140> off<00:02:22.370> well<00:02:23.370> turn<00:02:23.610> off<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
right side up turn off well turn off the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.550 
right side up turn off well turn off the
valve<00:02:24.060> flip<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.450> right<00:02:24.599> side<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:25.020> case<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.440> now

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
valve flip the right side up case so now

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.490 
valve flip the right side up case so now
you've<00:02:25.770> got<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.400> thing<00:02:26.700> filled<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.349> turn<00:02:28.349> it

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
you've got this thing filled up turn it

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.750 
you've got this thing filled up turn it
back<00:02:28.680> right-side<00:02:29.160> up<00:02:30.890> there<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.010> got<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.220> it's

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
