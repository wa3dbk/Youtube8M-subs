00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey guys my name is suited noob and I'm

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.789 
hey guys my name is suited noob and I'm
gonna<00:00:02.820> give<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.270> guys<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.780> rough<00:00:04.110> guide<00:00:04.500> on

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
gonna give you guys a rough guide on

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.360 
gonna give you guys a rough guide on
Street<00:00:05.609> layouts<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.299> SimCity<00:00:07.069> now<00:00:08.069> there<00:00:08.280> are

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
Street layouts for SimCity now there are

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.070 
Street layouts for SimCity now there are
three<00:00:08.670> Street<00:00:09.210> layout<00:00:09.360> types<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.840> going<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
three Street layout types I'm going to

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.049 
three Street layout types I'm going to
cover<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:10.620> guy<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.790> standard

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
cover in this guy one is the standard

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.419 
cover in this guy one is the standard
grid<00:00:12.630> another<00:00:13.259> was<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.530> cartwheel<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
grid another was the cartwheel and the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.890 
grid another was the cartwheel and the
last<00:00:14.639> one<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:14.910> called<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.299> loop<00:00:15.630> or<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
last one is called the loop or the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.439 
last one is called the loop or the
lollipop<00:00:16.619> which<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> basically<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.300> more

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
lollipop which is basically the more

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.240 
lollipop which is basically the more
contemporary<00:00:18.960> Street<00:00:19.619> layout<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.070> have

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
contemporary Street layout that we have

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
contemporary Street layout that we have
now<00:00:20.869> now<00:00:21.869> before<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.170> jump<00:00:22.260> straight<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
now now before I jump straight into the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
now now before I jump straight into the
guides<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.609> gonna<00:00:23.820> give<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.090> guys<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.570> rough

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
guides I'm gonna give you guys a rough

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.929 
guides I'm gonna give you guys a rough
introduction<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.980> some<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> terminology

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
introduction to some of the terminology

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.790 
introduction to some of the terminology
that<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> use<00:00:27.650> one<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that I'm going to use one of the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.140 
that I'm going to use one of the
terminology<00:00:29.250> I'm<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> use<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> permit

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
terminology I'm going to use is permit

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.389 
terminology I'm going to use is permit
permeability<00:00:31.080> now<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.949> become<00:00:32.130> across

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
permeability now if you become across

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
permeability now if you become across
the<00:00:32.550> board<00:00:32.790> permeability<00:00:33.360> before<00:00:33.899> basically

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the board permeability before basically

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
the board permeability before basically
means<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.219> ability<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.090> mayor<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.660> move

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
means the ability of one mayor to move

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
means the ability of one mayor to move
through<00:00:37.079> another<00:00:37.320> such<00:00:37.680> as<00:00:37.710> water<00:00:38.340> through

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
through another such as water through

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
through another such as water through
soil<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.660> case<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.290> people

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
soil but in this case it's people

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.170 
soil but in this case it's people
through<00:00:41.250> streets<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.030> how

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
through streets you know how

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.170 
through streets you know how
permeability<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.079> easy<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.820> me<00:00:44.820> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
permeability is how easy is it for me to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.880 
permeability is how easy is it for me to
walk<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.719> move<00:00:45.930> throughout<00:00:46.289> these<00:00:46.469> streets

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
walk or move throughout these streets

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
walk or move throughout these streets
and<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.090> matters<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.450> Sim<00:00:48.660> City

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and that's what matters in Sim City

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
and that's what matters in Sim City
because<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.980> need<00:00:50.160> your<00:00:50.640> sims<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.030> move

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
because you need your sims to move

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.279 
because you need your sims to move
around<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> street<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:51.930> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> use

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
around the street so I'm going to use

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.540 
around the street so I'm going to use
that<00:00:52.469> term<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.219> quite<00:00:53.430> an

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that term a lot because it's quite an

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
that term a lot because it's quite an
important<00:00:53.969> term<00:00:54.860> now<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> start<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> grid

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
important term now I start with the grid

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
important term now I start with the grid
layer<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.390> grid<00:00:57.600> layout<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> basically<00:00:58.379> 100

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
layer the grid layout is basically 100

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.490 
layer the grid layout is basically 100
meter<00:00:59.039> by<00:00:59.250> 100<00:00:59.820> meter<00:00:59.969> squares<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:01.079> spread

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
meter by 100 meter squares that spread

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
meter by 100 meter squares that spread
outwards<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> I've<00:01:02.699> filled<00:01:02.969> with

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
outwards and I've filled with

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.200 
outwards and I've filled with
residential<00:01:03.719> commercial<00:01:04.140> industrial<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
residential commercial industrial and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.520 
residential commercial industrial and
there's<00:01:06.210> no<00:01:06.360> set<00:01:06.780> layout<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> where<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
there's no set layout as to where that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.469 
there's no set layout as to where that
is<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> advantage<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.970> having<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.299> grid

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
is now the advantage of having a grid

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
is now the advantage of having a grid
layout<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:10.020> highly<00:01:10.350> permeable<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
layout is it's highly permeable your

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
layout is it's highly permeable your
Sims<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.970> move<00:01:12.119> throughout<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> roads<00:01:12.869> they

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
Sims can move throughout the roads they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.649 
Sims can move throughout the roads they
know<00:01:13.229> where<00:01:13.380> they<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
know where they go and they can see it

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
know where they go and they can see it
grid<00:01:15.659> layout<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:16.080> direct<00:01:16.500> sight<00:01:17.009> lines<00:01:17.220> as<00:01:17.369> to

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
grid layout has direct sight lines as to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.590 
grid layout has direct sight lines as to
where<00:01:17.640> they're<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.150> they<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.420> where

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
where they're going so they know where

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.370 
where they're going so they know where
they're<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.049> they're<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
they're going and they're going to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
they're going and they're going to
follow<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.860> travel<00:01:20.310> very<00:01:20.850> permeable<00:01:21.150> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
follow that travel very permeable and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
follow that travel very permeable and
it's<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:21.810> moving<00:01:22.110> sums<00:01:22.530> around<00:01:22.860> because

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's good for moving sums around because

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.280 
it's good for moving sums around because
it<00:01:23.250> has<00:01:23.400> lots<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.119> access<00:01:24.540> points<00:01:24.930> there's<00:01:25.140> no

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it has lots of access points there's no

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
it has lots of access points there's no
dead<00:01:25.470> ends

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
dead ends

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.280 
dead ends
there's<00:01:26.520> just<00:01:26.700> straight<00:01:27.270> lines<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:28.049> places

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
there's just straight lines going places

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
there's just straight lines going places
and<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.950> matters<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.460> Simms

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and that's what matters for Simms

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.880 
and that's what matters for Simms
however<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> catches<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> guru<00:01:31.560> Daz<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
however the catches with a guru Daz it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.710 
however the catches with a guru Daz it
doesn't<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> central<00:01:32.790> point<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.630> if

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
doesn't have a central point and if

services<00:03:13.920> can<00:03:13.980> go<00:03:14.250> in<00:03:14.400> there<00:03:14.579> you<00:03:14.760> might<00:03:14.940> only

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
services can go in there you might only

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.569 
services can go in there you might only
be<00:03:15.299> able<00:03:15.569> to<00:03:15.720> have<00:03:15.870> low-density<00:03:16.260> houses<00:03:16.829> fit

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
be able to have low-density houses fit

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.069 
be able to have low-density houses fit
in<00:03:17.730> there<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> size<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
in there because of the size of the

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.140 
in there because of the size of the
blocks<00:03:19.349> not<00:03:20.010> because<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.519> road<00:03:20.700> density

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
blocks not because of the road density

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.120 
blocks not because of the road density
sizes<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.109> is<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.380> catch<00:03:22.680> when<00:03:22.889> you<00:03:22.980> have

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
sizes so that is a catch when you have

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.540 
sizes so that is a catch when you have
the<00:03:23.250> sort<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.459> cartwheel<00:03:23.880> plan

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
the sort of cartwheel plan

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.060 
the sort of cartwheel plan
and<00:03:25.700> finally<00:03:26.690> there<00:03:26.960> is<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.350> lollipop<00:03:27.530> plan

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
and finally there is the lollipop plan

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.640 
and finally there is the lollipop plan
this<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.970> most<00:03:29.150> contemporary<00:03:30.020> one<00:03:30.320> that<00:03:30.620> I

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
this is the most contemporary one that I

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.730 
this is the most contemporary one that I
have<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.130> my<00:03:31.250> country<00:03:31.460> basically<00:03:32.500> colder<00:03:33.500> sex

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
have in my country basically colder sex

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.930 
have in my country basically colder sex

everywhere nice big loops
it's<00:03:35.300> very<00:03:35.540> pretty<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.080> look<00:03:36.170> at<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.710> go

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
it's very pretty to look at you can go

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.380 
it's very pretty to look at you can go
wherever<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.280> want<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.730> just<00:03:37.820> it's<00:03:38.120> pure

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
creative freedom you can just draw

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.550 
creative freedom you can just draw
squiggly<00:03:40.310> road<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:41.450> somewhere<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:42.080> it

squiggly road and in somewhere and it

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.230 
squiggly road and in somewhere and it

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
looks it looks really nice strong to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.670 
looks it looks really nice strong to
look<00:03:44.420> at<00:03:44.570> from<00:03:44.780> above<00:03:45.020> because<00:03:45.200> it's<00:03:45.500> just

that's bad for traffic and there's bad

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.170 
that's bad for traffic and there's bad

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
necessarily a focal point in the center

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.110 
necessarily a focal point in the center
where<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.430> build<00:04:16.610> a<00:04:16.700> commercial

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
where you can build a commercial

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880 
where you can build a commercial
district<00:04:17.480> it<00:04:17.900> might<00:04:18.049> be<00:04:18.170> focused<00:04:18.560> around<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
district it might be focused around the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.010 
district it might be focused around the
outside<00:04:19.280> where<00:04:19.940> Sims<00:04:20.360> have<00:04:20.510> to<00:04:20.600> drive<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
outside where Sims have to drive all the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.450 
outside where Sims have to drive all the
way<00:04:21.049> around<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:21.590> get<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.950> their

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
way around just to get to their

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.550 
way around just to get to their
workplace<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.120> that's<00:04:23.870> bad<00:04:24.050> because<00:04:24.470> that's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
workplace and that's bad because that's

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.320 
workplace and that's bad because that's
going<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:24.860> increase<00:04:25.010> traffic

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
going to increase traffic

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.339 
going to increase traffic
so<00:04:28.330> now<00:04:28.449> that<00:04:28.509> we've<00:04:28.720> looked<00:04:28.870> at<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.080> three

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
so now that we've looked at the three

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.320 
so now that we've looked at the three
Street<00:04:29.889> types<00:04:30.129> individually<00:04:30.819> what<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.210> their

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
Street types individually what are their

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.600 
Street types individually what are their
advantages<00:04:31.530> when<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.650> squish<00:04:33.280> them<00:04:33.460> together

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
advantages when you squish them together

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.659 
advantages when you squish them together
I<00:04:34.060> mean<00:04:34.210> obviously<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:35.319> cartwheel<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:36.009> the

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
I mean obviously the cartwheel and the

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.670 
I mean obviously the cartwheel and the
grid<00:04:36.970> have<00:04:37.210> their<00:04:37.569> separate<00:04:37.960> advantages<00:04:38.470> at

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
grid have their separate advantages at

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.249 
grid have their separate advantages at
one<00:04:39.460> being<00:04:39.729> is<00:04:40.150> highly<00:04:40.479> permeable<00:04:40.690> but

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:41.259 
one being is highly permeable but

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.469 
one being is highly permeable but
doesn't<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.560> focal<00:04:41.979> point<00:04:42.220> yeah<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:43.360> other

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
doesn't it focal point yeah the other

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.360 
doesn't it focal point yeah the other
one<00:04:43.690> being<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.259> has<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> focal<00:04:44.889> point<00:04:44.919> but<00:04:45.250> it

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
one being it has a focal point but it

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.899 
one being it has a focal point but it
doesn't<00:04:45.669> have<00:04:46.020> standard<00:04:47.190> blocks<00:04:48.190> block<00:04:48.639> sizes

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:48.909 
doesn't have standard blocks block sizes

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.059 
doesn't have standard blocks block sizes
and<00:04:49.240> you<00:04:49.389> can<00:04:49.569> have<00:04:49.720> odd<00:04:49.870> shaped<00:04:50.139> buildings<00:04:50.530> so

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
and you can have odd shaped buildings so

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:53.309 
and you can have odd shaped buildings so
if<00:04:51.129> we<00:04:51.250> combine<00:04:51.520> those<00:04:51.940> two<00:04:52.240> together<00:04:52.389> we're

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
if we combine those two together we're

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.020 
if we combine those two together we're
definitely<00:04:53.470> going<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.800> have<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.190> more<00:04:54.400> likely<00:04:54.819> a

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
definitely going to have a more likely a

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.510 
definitely going to have a more likely a
highly<00:04:55.569> permeable<00:04:55.810> City<00:04:56.259> that<00:04:56.949> allows<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.490> to

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
highly permeable City that allows you to

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.390 
highly permeable City that allows you to
have<00:04:57.789> a<00:04:57.849> focal<00:04:58.270> point<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.720> in<00:04:59.469> most<00:05:00.190> cases

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
have a focal point and in most cases

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.670 
have a focal point and in most cases
gives<00:05:00.849> you<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:01.060> standardized<00:05:01.659> block<00:05:02.199> structure

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
gives you a standardized block structure

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.610 
gives you a standardized block structure
and<00:05:02.800> type<00:05:02.949> a<00:05:03.219> blocks<00:05:03.909> block<00:05:04.330> shape<00:05:04.599> and<00:05:04.900> for

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
and type a blocks block shape and for

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.680 
and type a blocks block shape and for
your<00:05:05.770> bonus<00:05:06.009> a<00:05:06.190> got<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.580> go<00:05:06.699> over<00:05:06.849> then<00:05:07.030> now

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
your bonus a got to go over then now

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.790 
your bonus a got to go over then now
basically<00:05:07.870> I'm<00:05:08.199> gonna<00:05:08.409> say<00:05:08.530> look<00:05:08.710> at

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
basically I'm gonna say look at

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.930 
basically I'm gonna say look at
Washington<00:05:09.250> again<00:05:09.460> because<00:05:09.759> they're

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
Washington again because they're

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.790 
Washington again because they're
basically<00:05:10.270> done<00:05:10.539> it<00:05:10.719> you've<00:05:11.289> got<00:05:11.500> your<00:05:11.650> nice

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
basically done it you've got your nice

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.070 
basically done it you've got your nice
little<00:05:12.069> cartwheel<00:05:12.520> design<00:05:12.909> with<00:05:13.719> the<00:05:13.870> grid

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
little cartwheel design with the grid

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.719 
little cartwheel design with the grid
basically<00:05:14.530> laid<00:05:14.740> out<00:05:14.889> over<00:05:15.219> the<00:05:15.340> top<00:05:15.550> and

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
basically laid out over the top and

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.339 
basically laid out over the top and
that's<00:05:15.879> done<00:05:16.090> really<00:05:16.270> well<00:05:16.539> and<00:05:16.750> in<00:05:17.199> this

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
that's done really well and in this

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.080 
that's done really well and in this
example<00:05:17.710> you<00:05:17.949> can<00:05:18.129> see<00:05:18.280> how<00:05:18.490> everything<00:05:18.729> works

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
example you can see how everything works

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.540 
example you can see how everything works
together<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:20.229> problem<00:05:20.620> here<00:05:20.860> is<00:05:21.009> though<00:05:21.310> is

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
together the problem here is though is

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.839 
together the problem here is though is
industry<00:05:22.469> because<00:05:23.469> of<00:05:23.590> pollution<00:05:23.800> because<00:05:24.460> of

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
industry because of pollution because of

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.700 
industry because of pollution because of
air<00:05:25.210> were<00:05:25.750> the<00:05:25.840> way<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.110> air<00:05:26.259> gotta<00:05:26.560> go

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
air were the way the air gotta go

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.770 
air were the way the air gotta go
applause<00:05:27.069> you<00:05:27.610> have<00:05:27.879> to<00:05:28.000> put<00:05:28.180> all<00:05:28.210> those<00:05:28.449> into

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
applause you have to put all those into

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.469 
applause you have to put all those into
consideration<00:05:29.440> as<00:05:29.530> well<00:05:30.120> so<00:05:31.120> sometimes

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
consideration as well so sometimes

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.180 
consideration as well so sometimes
permeability<00:05:32.110> even<00:05:32.500> though<00:05:32.590> it's<00:05:32.740> amazing

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
permeability even though it's amazing

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.980 
permeability even though it's amazing
might<00:05:33.759> not<00:05:33.940> work<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.330> much<00:05:34.479> with<00:05:34.719> heavy

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
might not work so much with heavy

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.570 
might not work so much with heavy
industry<00:05:35.130> initially<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.400> there's<00:05:36.550> just

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
industry initially so there's just

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:37.890 
industry initially so there's just
something<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:36.969> think<00:05:37.000> about<00:05:37.240> before<00:05:37.539> you<00:05:37.750> go

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
something to think about before you go

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.890 
something to think about before you go
crazy<00:05:38.289> with<00:05:38.680> I'm<00:05:39.159> grid<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.029> and<00:05:40.180> then<00:05:40.389> put<00:05:40.870> a

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
crazy with I'm grid it and then put a

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.719 
crazy with I'm grid it and then put a
focal<00:05:41.259> point<00:05:41.469> is<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:42.130> can<00:05:42.279> have<00:05:42.400> to<00:05:42.520> think

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
focal point is you can have to think

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.790 
focal point is you can have to think
where<00:05:42.940> does<00:05:43.029> industry<00:05:43.449> go<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:44.620> there's

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
where does industry go and there's

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.459 
where does industry go and there's
something<00:05:45.009> to<00:05:45.130> consider<00:05:45.599> because<00:05:46.599> as<00:05:47.080> amazing

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
something to consider because as amazing

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.140 
something to consider because as amazing
is<00:05:47.590> to<00:05:47.680> have<00:05:47.770> everything<00:05:48.009> close<00:05:48.490> and<00:05:48.699> walkable

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
is to have everything close and walkable

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.029 
is to have everything close and walkable
if<00:05:49.479> your<00:05:50.169> industries<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:50.740> walk<00:05:50.860> were

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
if your industries and walk were

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.409 
if your industries and walk were
distance<00:05:51.370> that<00:05:51.580> means<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:51.969> the<00:05:52.060> germs<00:05:52.330> from

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
distance that means that the germs from

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.240 
distance that means that the germs from
the<00:05:52.630> industry<00:05:53.080> is<00:05:53.139> also<00:05:53.469> for<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.039> more

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
the industry is also for the more

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.420 
the industry is also for the more
distance<00:05:54.759> homes<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.840> water<00:05:56.110> supplies<00:05:56.500> so<00:05:57.400> you

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
distance homes to water supplies so you

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.850 
distance homes to water supplies so you
have<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.729> think<00:05:57.969> how<00:05:58.539> will<00:05:58.719> this<00:05:58.840> folk<00:05:59.080> affect

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
have to think how will this folk affect

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.230 
have to think how will this folk affect
that<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:00.569> about<00:06:01.569> long-term<00:06:01.990> thinking

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.120 

so<00:06:06.240> I<00:06:06.270> hope<00:06:06.480> this<00:06:06.720> kind<00:06:06.900> of<00:06:07.020> very<00:06:07.530> rough<00:06:07.800> guide

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
so I hope this kind of very rough guide

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.520 
so I hope this kind of very rough guide
gives<00:06:09.030> you<00:06:09.180> an<00:06:09.360> idea<00:06:09.540> of<00:06:09.960> what<00:06:10.169> you<00:06:10.380> didn't

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
gives you an idea of what you didn't

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.040 
gives you an idea of what you didn't
want<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.740> do<00:06:10.950> with<00:06:11.100> your<00:06:11.190> streets<00:06:11.540> because<00:06:12.540> all

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
want to do with your streets because all

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.990 
want to do with your streets because all
you<00:06:13.260> could<00:06:13.440> do<00:06:13.590> with<00:06:13.740> some<00:06:13.770> city<00:06:14.130> 4<00:06:14.430> before<00:06:14.639> was

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
you could do with some city 4 before was

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 
you could do with some city 4 before was
grid<00:06:15.210> it<00:06:15.330> that's<00:06:15.600> all<00:06:15.780> you<00:06:15.870> could<00:06:16.020> do<00:06:16.230> but<00:06:16.860> now

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
grid it that's all you could do but now

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.560 
grid it that's all you could do but now
that<00:06:17.220> we<00:06:17.310> have<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.580> option<00:06:17.880> with<00:06:18.000> curvy<00:06:18.330> roads

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
that we have the option with curvy roads

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.420 
that we have the option with curvy roads
with<00:06:18.870> circle<00:06:19.260> roads<00:06:19.440> we<00:06:19.980> could<00:06:20.160> be<00:06:20.250> a<00:06:20.280> little

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
with circle roads we could be a little

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.890 
with circle roads we could be a little
bit<00:06:20.639> more<00:06:20.760> creative<00:06:21.240> with<00:06:21.270> our<00:06:21.450> street

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
bit more creative with our street

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.620 
bit more creative with our street
designs<00:06:22.260> and<00:06:22.700> so<00:06:23.700> we<00:06:23.910> need<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.150> think<00:06:24.360> what

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
designs and so we need to think what

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.240 
designs and so we need to think what
what<00:06:25.320> are<00:06:25.410> the<00:06:25.440> advantages<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:25.980> what<00:06:26.100> are<00:06:26.190> the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
what are the advantages and what are the

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.970 
what are the advantages and what are the
disadvantages<00:06:26.430> of<00:06:26.880> each<00:06:27.090> street<00:06:27.389> design<00:06:27.690> I

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
disadvantages of each street design I

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.200 
disadvantages of each street design I
hope<00:06:28.980> this<00:06:29.100> helped<00:06:29.430> and<00:06:29.639> thank<00:06:29.820> you<00:06:29.910> very<00:06:29.940> much
