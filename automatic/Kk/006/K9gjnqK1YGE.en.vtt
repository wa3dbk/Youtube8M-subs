00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.189
 we tested the mitsubishi asx a vehicle 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.150
 Compact attractive urban crossover and 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.150
 high body 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.580
 automotive experience dealers and 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.400
 official services 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:46.120
 Mitsubishi on the Costa del Sol left us 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.840
 try the asx 1.8 day of 180 moxos 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.840
 ah 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.790
 a slightly sporty design with a 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.760
 front feline that stands out more for its 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.530
 backside which is more basic the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:16.380
 xenon headlights illuminate so 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:19.259
 spectacular when entering and sitting is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 wide despite its outer size of 4 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 with 29 meters long although perhaps what 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.130
 let's find a little austere as almost 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.700
 all mitsubishi we miss 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 a screen the chromed of the controls of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.200
 air conditioning give some light to the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.200
 interior that looks a bit dark 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.789
 This crossover has an engine 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.820
 diesel 1.8 that generates a power of 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.729
 116 horses can reach a 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.650
 maximum speed of 188 kilometers per 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.240
 hour and accelerates from 0 to 100 in 11 seconds 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.670
 we tested the version with gearbox 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.610
 6 speed manual 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.869
 its combined consumption is 55 liters 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.869
 every 100 kilometers 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.250
 the capacity of the trunk is wide 442 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.300
 liters and about 1200 liters folding down the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.300
 backs 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.170
 in short the asx is a tall car 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.269
 that goes great for surfaces 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.189
 asphalted making us feel quite 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.040
 security but it does not defend itself 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:48.040
 when we change asphalt by land
