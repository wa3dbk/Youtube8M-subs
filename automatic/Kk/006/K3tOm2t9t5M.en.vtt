are using ATVs these days as opposed to
let's<00:00:39.660> say<00:00:39.750> twenty<00:00:39.989> years<00:00:40.020> ago<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.309> find<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
let's say twenty years ago you find a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
let's say twenty years ago you find a
big<00:00:42.120> market<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.780> ATVs<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> big<00:00:43.920> usage<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
big market of ATVs or a big usage and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
big market of ATVs or a big usage and
out<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.610> hunting<00:00:44.879> absolutely<00:00:45.629> makes<00:00:46.110> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
days or do you is it a majority of guys

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.910 
days or do you is it a majority of guys
are<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.719> using<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:01.050> ATVs<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.590> hunt<00:01:01.770> from

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
are just using our ATVs to hunt from

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
are just using our ATVs to hunt from
let's<00:01:02.460> say<00:01:02.550> point<00:01:02.789> A<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> point<00:01:03.030> B<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.629> do<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
let's say point A to point B or do you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.359 
let's say point A to point B or do you
find<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> lot<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> people<00:01:04.680> hunting<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.189> their

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
find a lot of people hunting from their

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.480 
find a lot of people hunting from their
ATVs<00:01:06.229> I<00:01:07.229> guess<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.950> depends<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.430> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ATVs I guess it really depends on the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
ATVs I guess it really depends on the
style<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> hunter<00:01:09.450> some<00:01:09.750> people<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
style of the hunter some people like to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
style of the hunter some people like to
you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> certain<00:01:11.250> point<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.610> then

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you know get to a certain point and then

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.940 
you know get to a certain point and then
walk<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> swamp<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.200> depending<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.860> what

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
that like to just drive around and cover

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.890 
that like to just drive around and cover
a<00:01:17.159> lot<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> ground<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.270> step<00:01:18.540> off<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
a lot of ground you have to step off the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
a lot of ground you have to step off the
travel<00:01:19.200> portion<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.710> roadway<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> shoot<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
travel portion of a roadway to shoot and

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.660 
travel portion of a roadway to shoot and
you<00:01:20.729> can't<00:01:20.939> shoot<00:01:21.090> across<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> roadway

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
you can't shoot across the roadway

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
you can't shoot across the roadway
you're<00:01:23.670> able<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.439> been<00:01:25.439> shoot<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:25.860> an

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
you're able to been shoot from an

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
you're able to been shoot from an
unmaintained<00:01:26.759> Road<00:01:27.799> so<00:01:28.799> common<00:01:29.369> sense<00:01:29.460> with

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
unmaintained Road so common sense with

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
unmaintained Road so common sense with
that<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> road<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:30.960> maintained<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that is a road that is not maintained so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
that is a road that is not maintained so
we<00:01:32.250> could<00:01:32.400> say<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> logging<00:01:32.909> road<00:01:32.939> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
we could say a logging road is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
we could say a logging road is
maintained<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> logging<00:01:34.439> company<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
maintained by a logging company so that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.609 
maintained by a logging company so that
you<00:01:35.220> can't<00:01:35.400> shoot<00:01:35.579> from<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.960> trail<00:01:37.439> or

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you can't shoot from but a trail or

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.870 
you can't shoot from but a trail or
something<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.009> doesn't<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.310> culverts<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
something that doesn't have culverts and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.640 
something that doesn't have culverts and
things<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
things like that

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.460 
things like that
you<00:01:39.710> need<00:01:39.890> an<00:01:40.010> all-terrain<00:01:40.280> vehicle<00:01:40.370> that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
you need an all-terrain vehicle that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.120 
you need an all-terrain vehicle that
that<00:01:42.470> would<00:01:42.590> be<00:01:42.680> considered<00:01:42.950> now

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that would be considered now

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.830 
that would be considered now
unmaintained<00:01:43.940> Road<00:01:44.000> but<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.480> groomed

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
unmaintained Road but a groomed

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.930 
unmaintained Road but a groomed
snowmobile<00:01:45.530> trail<00:01:45.800> that's<00:01:46.340> basically

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
snowmobile trail that's basically

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.220 
snowmobile trail that's basically
there's<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.210> lot<00:01:47.360> of<00:01:47.450> times<00:01:47.600> it's<00:01:47.810> shut<00:01:48.020> down

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
there's a lot of times it's shut down

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.200 
there's a lot of times it's shut down
