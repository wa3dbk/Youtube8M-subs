00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 from youtube I hope very well 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.619
 I bring this new design that I made them 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.520
 I want to share is something already 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.520
 Summery and 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 fresh and then right now we are giving 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.760
 they all go to the beach so they 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.660
 I wanted to deliver a proposal and I'm not going 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.300
 for the beach I just share them and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 using the colors blue and red 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.440
 with the blurred here I show you 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.629
 I used type 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.719
 these are the tones that you use in this 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.620
 from Coban and Vanessa de Lampang lit that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.620
 it was a mint green 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.120
 I always try to put acrylic 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.800
 Translucent before any color 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.900
 I feel that there is better adhesion and so not 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 pigmented our nail that is forum 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.679
 appointment 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.840
 but be careful not to let it reach the 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.020
 cuticle so you do not leave them is 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520
 say no sting salts in ten bits 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.890
 especially in cuticle area that goes so 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.069
 thin there if you touch put it directly 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.549
 in natural tinea here they see me using 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:28.610
 the color acrylics very wet but 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.590
 that is to achieve this style because it 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.079
 they call hunger in English man but then 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 is a blur is a blur and not 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.039
 more very moistened so that they can 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.630
 and colors merge primarily as 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.560
 we go from blue to mint green it's excellent 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.270
 excellent blur 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.530
 and then I already read the thickness with 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.530
 crystal acrylic 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 obviously how can you see the way in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.130
 which accommodates the acrylic is not going to be the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.079
 same in all the nails I 'm already 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.710
 thinking where I'm going to put the decoration 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.250
 and notice that I felt like this guy 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.709
 I nail them I tell them to look at me 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.390
 here I am why I used tip because the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.900
 tip leaves your nails a little more 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.780
 square more I do not know to me in my way 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.690
 I think of personal thinking 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.019
 little bit more curved more I like more 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.440
 when I make this kind of striking nails 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.210
 with you is my personal opinion since 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.450
 final 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.460
 I will use a color that is not a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.150
 red will look red here but it's not 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.940
 exactly one red is a red to pink 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.150
 I do not know how to explain it as a watermelon color 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.760
 and it was very cool and very summery 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.770
 also clear thinking about the fire that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm going to use it made me perfect 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.600
 I have already been asked about the rams in 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.160
 leeds I love them I always have 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.340
 recommended are very pigmented 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.280
 I buy them here locally at a supplier 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.950
 of nails and it costs me five dollars each 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.300
 one and they bring a good amount 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.380
 they bring like an ounce and I do not have a website 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.360
 I recommend the only times that 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.390
 I have seen them on the internet I have seen them 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.980
 for very high the price compared to 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.340
 that I buy them here then has never 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.500
 agreed to buy them online 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.900
 after sure that after this video 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.849
 someone will share us as soon as I 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.720
 I found out something I'm going to put there 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:36.370
 on facebook I promise good and after 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.500
 of filing and polishing I show you that the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.230
 nail is not so thick there is so 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.239
 see 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.739
 These steps advanced them because 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.750
 remember I know it's a lot of loss of 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.269
 time I show you here this is the fire 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.260
 that I ordered I chose it verÃ³n piris 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.150
 lathe gave a coupon there they have it 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.120
 use it they will give you 10% discount on 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.209

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.950
 free now I'm going to start and use 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.200
 the same resin that you used to paste 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.900
 the tips I leave it for a while and I'm going 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.760
 taking off is my first time that I use 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.700
 the chicken is not very good for it to the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.590
 better do not wait for me enough but today 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.109
 they're going to see me do a bus for 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.329
 all sides but then diaz the claw of 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.039
 the wave and more or less to the next and 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.870
 I think I'll do better but here 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.010
 I show you how I battle for myself 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.890
 you battle do not sit 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.500
 kings 3 to all of you not everything is 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.380
 perfect and I start on 3 that are 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.690
 a few Hawaiian flowers 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.970
 remember I advance the shot so that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.880
 we are not so long here I put it 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.890
 double quick so that's why you 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.080
 they are going to see how my pearls are 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.110
 melt fast but it's because 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.880
 place it moves fast takes it and not 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.710
 it's like that 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.130
 at last they can see the texture that 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.860
 it looks good is the big date 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.050
 with five petals 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.270
 also easy these flowers I 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.639
 matthysse with watermelon color from a 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.620
 strong rose with a watermelon and then it was a 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.790
 little coffee and yellow we do the 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.610
 pistil well simple 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.940
 and the leaves use some lemon greens 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.120
 as neon quoted and lemon a little yellow 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.390
 and good and good shades pretty much 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.650
 so that they are well shrieking the 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.650
 bright colors 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.410
 the brush that I'm using here is 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.139
 the one of neutral christ the most chiquitito 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.630
 that I have already told them before and 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.220
 this brush they find in glass 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:46.510
 news.com costs no more than 12 dollars 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:49.419
 I think and it's great is the 3d mini this 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.250
 It has been a long time since I used it 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.889
 I went to the seminar with more surprise 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.110
 this brush and if it helps you to do the 3d 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.600
 the little ones this is going to be more 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.280
 little girl so I throw myself 23 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.770
 pearls of a milestone in what goes 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.250
 taking out one I make another petal and so 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.860
 then very quickly we have a 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.310
 little flower of five petals there are tiny 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:15.460
 with little one 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.740
 same with a pistolita and its little leaves 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.530
 the rest is pure to those who ask me 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.539
 I know where to go bought the rhinestones 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.780
 friends and friends remember that I do not 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.979
 I have a business I do not have a salon 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.000
 then I do not buy in large quantity 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.580
 really no 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.010
 I went to wal mart and wal mart had the 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.250
 Northern Lights Northern Lights or Birds 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.990
 are those that shine like rainbows and 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.060
 They had a different packet of 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.889
 three different sizes to seven dollars 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.800
 in the area of 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.289
 which will be crafts and good as 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.909
