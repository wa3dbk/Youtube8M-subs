okay<00:00:01.439> video<00:00:01.709> number<00:00:01.890> two<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.550> Martin

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
okay video number two on this Martin

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay video number two on this Martin
project<00:00:03.380> sorry<00:00:04.380> about<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.710> lighting<00:00:05.029> but

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
project sorry about the lighting but

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.880 
project sorry about the lighting but
there's<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.270> reason<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.690> have<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:07.020> like<00:00:07.259> this<00:00:07.620> i'm

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
there's a reason I have it like this i'm

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.370 
there's a reason I have it like this i'm
right<00:00:08.280> now<00:00:08.460> i'm<00:00:10.340> seeing<00:00:11.340> what<00:00:11.610> kind<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
right now i'm seeing what kind of a

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.350 
right now i'm seeing what kind of a
deflection<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.519> sound<00:00:14.910> board<00:00:15.089> has

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
deflection that the the sound board has

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.400 
deflection that the the sound board has
up<00:00:15.630> at<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.500> at<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.220> bridge<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.230> way<00:00:19.230> it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
up at the at the bridge and the way it's

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.970 
up at the at the bridge and the way it's
sitting<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.640> I've<00:00:21.119> got<00:00:21.570> two<00:00:22.439> quarters

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
sitting right now I've got two quarters

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.900 
sitting right now I've got two quarters
these<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.369> Canadian<00:00:23.760> quarters<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:25.910> stacked

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
these are Canadian quarters and stacked

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.970 
these are Canadian quarters and stacked
on<00:00:27.180> either<00:00:28.429> outer<00:00:29.429> limit<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.920> at<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
on either outer limit at the at the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
on either outer limit at the at the
binding<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:34.399> that's<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:37.129> balances

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
binding and that's where it balances

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.330 
binding and that's where it balances
with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:40.070> see<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> straight<00:00:41.820> edge<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
with the see this is a straight edge I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.729 
with the see this is a straight edge I
hope<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.489> shows<00:00:44.730> up<00:00:44.969> okay<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.270> about

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
hope this shows up okay so that's about

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.939 
hope this shows up okay so that's about
70<00:00:49.739> three<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> half<00:00:51.949> millimeters

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
70 three and a half millimeters

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.340 
70 three and a half millimeters
approximately<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.510> two<00:00:54.690> quarters<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.199> don't

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
approximately the two quarters I don't

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
approximately the two quarters I don't
know<00:00:55.410> exactly<00:00:55.800> what<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.610> don't

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
know exactly what that is but I don't

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.950 
know exactly what that is but I don't
really<00:00:56.910> care<00:00:57.180> i<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.660> it's<00:00:57.840> two

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
really care i just know it's two

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.000 
really care i just know it's two
quarters<00:00:59.840> so<00:01:00.840> that's<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.260> much<00:01:01.649> deflection

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
quarters so that's how much deflection

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.600 
quarters so that's how much deflection
there<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> at<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> moment<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:06.260> i'm<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
there is at the moment and i'm going to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.039 
there is at the moment and i'm going to
step<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> make<00:01:09.330> sure<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> bracing

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
step one is to make sure the bracing

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.679 
step one is to make sure the bracing
underneath<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.680> fixed<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.400> fine<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.030> think

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
underneath is fixed and fine I think

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.670 
underneath is fixed and fine I think
step<00:01:12.930> number<00:01:13.170> two<00:01:14.930> whether<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.409> see

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
step number two whether or not the see

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.760 
step number two whether or not the see
this<00:01:16.830> bridge<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> cracked<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> split<00:01:18.770> totally

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this bridge is cracked and split totally

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
this bridge is cracked and split totally
down<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> middle<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.450> intact

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
down the middle and when that's intact

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
down the middle and when that's intact
that's<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> change<00:01:23.150> how<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that's going to change how much this is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.810 
that's going to change how much this is
going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> deflect<00:01:25.320> also<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:25.979> that'll<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.580> I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
going to deflect also so that'll be I

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.429 
going to deflect also so that'll be I
think<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.810> first<00:01:28.020> gig<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:30.320> get<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
think the first gig is to get the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
think the first gig is to get the
bracing<00:01:31.860> fixed<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> get<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> new<00:01:32.880> bridge<00:01:33.360> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bracing fixed and get a new bridge on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.060 
bracing fixed and get a new bridge on
and<00:01:35.659> then<00:01:36.659> tighten<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.110> up<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.409> concert<00:01:37.829> pitch

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and then tighten it up to concert pitch

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
and then tighten it up to concert pitch
and<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:39.180> there's<00:01:39.600> any<00:01:39.810> difference<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and see if there's any difference like I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.219 
and see if there's any difference like I
just<00:01:41.189> need<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> set<00:01:41.610> point<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.030> go<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.869> I'm

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
just need a set point to go out if I'm

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
just need a set point to go out if I'm
going<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.470> trying<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.880> reset<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.030> neck<00:01:45.299> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
going to be trying to reset this neck I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.510 
going to be trying to reset this neck I
don't<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.799> any<00:01:46.979> guesses<00:01:47.490> about

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
don't want to have any guesses about

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.300 
don't want to have any guesses about
what<00:01:48.110> things<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.590> things<00:01:49.619> are<00:01:49.979> going<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.159> do

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
what things what things are going to do

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.819 
what things what things are going to do
at<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> end<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.939> guitar<00:01:51.829> when

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
at this end of the guitar when

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.139 
at this end of the guitar when
everything<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> ready<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.969> my

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
everything is ready to go so that's my

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.389 
everything is ready to go so that's my
line<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.390> thinking<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.049> any<00:01:58.829> comments

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
line of thinking right now any comments

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.090 
line of thinking right now any comments
on<00:01:59.640> it<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> try<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> hold<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
on it I'm going to try and get a hold of

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.240 
on it I'm going to try and get a hold of
these<00:02:02.250> guitar<00:02:02.969> repair<00:02:03.600> types<00:02:04.380> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
these guitar repair types and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.400 
these guitar repair types and
get<00:02:05.460> them<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.700> comment<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.870> and

get them to comment on this and and
we'll<00:02:07.740> see<00:02:08.450> where<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.960> kind<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.979> feedback

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
we'll see where what kind of a feedback

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.220 
we'll see where what kind of a feedback
we<00:02:12.150> can<00:02:12.300> get<00:02:12.510> anyway<00:02:13.290> wish<00:02:13.530> me<00:02:13.590> luck<00:02:13.800> bye
