00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.029
 there are 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.509
 yakubu come back to the arena 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.469
 a 9 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.050
 more than a year after year goodbye as a footballer 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.039
 your goodbye at ajax too 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.119
 how do you look back 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.039
 on that period at ajax 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.560
 at ajax looks back on it with great pleasure 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.669
 unfortunately it is not 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.189
 not so long ago that you want of course and I came across a contract 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.040
 up for two years 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.380
 then I will stop shortening a bicycle 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.890
 but good by certain 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.300
 Of course we know that this is a stop shop for your own vision of course 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.430
 Anyway it's a fantastic club and I have to play with you 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 lots of fun 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.640
 played during that period 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.980
 fantastic people 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.370
 regular supporters 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 I think it's one 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.930
 he was in a difficult period 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.480
 until a difficult decision to stop 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.960
 yes anyway 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.500
 paler surprised many people in any case 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.980
 the club by cutting the knot 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.450
 then a week earlier many people follow, but so do themselves 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.640
 a little 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.870
 that I myself normally never have a type of band incubus 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.490
 helped the side to continue 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.910
 I was allowed for myself 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.400
 we can give 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.450
 I've done it once in a supermarket at the top of the football player 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090
 the flight to the decision 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.330
 There he could have an emotional press conference 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.710
 and also a special farewell competition 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.750
 ajax vitesse 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.620
 how do you look back at those moments level the amount that i am holding the press conference 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.460
 good that he is a charity 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.000
 you know that it is those things that are coming we never do easy 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.150
 to give in and take to put it down there will be mainly 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.870
 not with such a decision 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.540
 but well that comes then and then do well 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.340
 what do you do and then the reaction of the press is of course very nice that 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 so they respond to broadway saying goodbye to the active 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.680
 a very big soccer player 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.680
 but also from a very large person 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.629
 and where you actually train for the home game against vitesse 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.189
 so already had actually stopped saying goodbye to public 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.659
 that was partly thanks 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.540
 well well you know well of course I also know that the research planned 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.870
 of course one like me was a bit rid of men 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.009
 number of weeks thereafter 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.749
 in the week that that decision just reject what is coming 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.389
 naturally want to start 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.389
 but you will always wait to see how people react 

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:43.219
 to come to compare says to have to deal with it tonight 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.359
 you have to think for yourself 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.649
 you can not because in all it was not always to another I think 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:48.789
 the audience was good 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.649
 the athletes have fantastic 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:53.009
 supported me in it 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.689
 yes good and even when you saw it 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.689
 but the banners and the people 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.339
 all things are 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.479
 well after that race and vitesse follow the race at fc zwolle 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.449
 so that floats all around you 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:14.919
 world stars the field 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.859
 Jaap tribe 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.359
 against ajax too 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.749
 later in the evening year it was a certainty as I was sitting bags anyway 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:21.980
 well 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.179
 guests of the for a bit wary of how it should go 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.589
 when it came in the right direction the idea this time just couldn't be there for myself 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:31.589
 van henk van ginkel business agent can finish the job a little more 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.519
 well in india who could at the beginning i had something like that yes i don't know 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.789
 winning poland the netherlands may know your country from culture in the netherlands is not 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.789
 so for marketing competitions and look in the UK it is just very different 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.259
 classify that it is very normal of course with a little modesty 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.639
 dislodge yes that is true that I do not know but I do not know but well you hope 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.619
 of course that if you do something like that, it is of course good 

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:54.619
 approach and and assume that it is already going well for you for all people 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.849
 and I am a type that participated in the supporters, she had strangled after sentence 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:59.930
 have more than that 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.769
 at his departure I think it is important 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.469
 but not a good yacht in that match at the zwolle stadium 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:08.069
 completely missed 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.979
 which in that period was a gesture it nevertheless impressed impressively me 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:14.379
 say so was sold out and 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.609
 sultry supporters of course and and people who have a warm heart for me 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.639
 and people who like to go to a group 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.719
 come to look at ajax and 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.900
 ask for other good nature football players 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.860
 from the team composed of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.189
 a bit big Dutch team say 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.710
 people also get involved f 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.289
 it was also surprising 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.590
 the group follows in the competition 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.930
 I think the supporters and all the ajax fans have those that are still adult 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.629
 applying 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.789
 the still active Japanese soccer player 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:45.710
 I played football with amateurs the most street fighter both have the 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.819
 veterans the veterans yes so it runs nicely behind the ball and the balls 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.279
 a little 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.150
 know how to divide your game and the ntr goes 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.470
 it is not about keeping fit, the just afraid of being tasty 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110
 play football for fun and 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.659
 after the facts the site once with 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.729
 how opponents like feyenoord react too much to you they know 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.569
 so it was all a marketing start 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.569
 believe from brasschaat 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.069
 the members will be coming soon with lucky ajax 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.069
 I don't know maybe this year it didn't matter then 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.430
 the trade I am open for advice is because of course I am lucky as well 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.539
 ajax of course you also have old internationals and 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.809
 and things like that 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:31.210
 there will always be competitions for which you will be asked of course 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.699
 it's always fun to participate 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.569
 still trainers ambitions 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.169
 well not really in control at the moment 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.169
 I already admitted that I enjoy working with young people 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.229
 Yesterday the children were supervised 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.210
 with the police 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.580
 another try out in the future 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.900
 first team players around 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.199
 later you would effortlessly fit yes yes what I can maybe realized 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.840
 no but good to work i never say never and it is in a different field 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.860
 his solutions said after a career of the brit never to 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.759
 we are planning to quit 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.589
 no so I say but I don't say it anyway 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.099
 at the moment at the moment 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.180
 yes first choice is after all a player coach 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.150
 brokerage not cold broker but more in scouting game the season 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.090
 to keep that bond with the game 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.629
 yes well that 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:21.709
 you've almost done that all your life is that it stays that way twice and so 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.129
 then everything comes one of the nicest sports the animals out there
