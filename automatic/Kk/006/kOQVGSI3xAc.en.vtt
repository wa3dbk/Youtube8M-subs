think Oregon needs to do something about

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.809 
think Oregon needs to do something about
that<00:02:18.910> problem<00:02:21.220> there's<00:02:22.220> basic<00:02:22.730> things<00:02:23.030> like

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
that problem there's basic things like

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.580 
that problem there's basic things like
not<00:02:25.390> then

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
not then

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.119 
not then
foursquare<00:02:27.519> another<00:02:28.480> two<00:02:28.900> squares<00:02:29.260> basic<00:02:29.920> I

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
foursquare another two squares basic I

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.990 
foursquare another two squares basic I
know<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.269> over<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.900> have<00:02:32.110> I<00:02:33.000> guess

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
know but I'm over here we have I guess

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.830 
know but I'm over here we have I guess
it<00:02:34.510> would<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:35.310> four<00:02:36.310> circles<00:02:36.910> even<00:02:37.480> though<00:02:37.599> I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it would be four circles even though I

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.410 
it would be four circles even though I
mean<00:02:38.110> a<00:02:38.140> top<00:02:38.410> four<00:02:38.620> square<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.970> not<00:02:40.150> exactly

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
mean a top four square it's not exactly

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.150 
mean a top four square it's not exactly
four<00:02:40.629> circles<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.170> there's<00:02:41.349> only<00:02:41.530> one<00:02:41.769> circle

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
four circles so there's only one circle

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
four circles so there's only one circle
with<00:02:42.310> lines<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.959> would<00:02:44.170> that<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.610> from

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
with lines in it so would that be from

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.910 
with lines in it so would that be from
for<00:02:46.720> pie<00:02:47.080> slices<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.980> guess<00:02:48.160> I<00:02:48.400> don't<00:02:48.700> know

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
for pie slices I guess I don't know

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.690 
for pie slices I guess I don't know
right<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.849> lil<00:02:52.209> exactly<00:02:52.629> game<00:02:52.900> but<00:02:53.200> I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
right here is a lil exactly game but I

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.250 
right here is a lil exactly game but I
mean<00:02:54.700> you'd<00:02:55.030> think<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.510> we<00:02:55.660> weren't<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.080> year

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
mean you'd think that we weren't in year

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.990 
mean you'd think that we weren't in year
two<00:02:56.410> thousand<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:56.860> six<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.459> we<00:02:57.549> didn't<00:02:57.879> have

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
two thousand and six and we didn't have

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.360 
two thousand and six and we didn't have
any<00:02:58.209> other<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.599> to<00:02:58.630> tell<00:02:58.750> time<00:02:59.140> but<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.739> guess

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
any other way to tell time but I guess

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.630 
any other way to tell time but I guess
you<00:03:00.400> stand<00:03:00.970> on<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.239> month<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:02.370> neater<00:03:03.370> shadow

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
you stand on the month and neater shadow

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.300 
you stand on the month and neater shadow
is<00:03:03.910> supposed<00:03:04.269> to<00:03:04.420> be<00:03:04.540> at<00:03:04.690> what<00:03:04.840> time<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
is supposed to be at what time it is and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.130 
is supposed to be at what time it is and
there's<00:03:06.459> currently<00:03:06.819> I<00:03:07.120> think<00:03:07.750> felt<00:03:07.930> five

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
there's currently I think felt five

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.390 
there's currently I think felt five
o'clock<00:03:08.410> so<00:03:08.590> i<00:03:08.650> guess<00:03:08.799> it's<00:03:08.950> pretty<00:03:09.160> clear

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
o'clock so i guess it's pretty clear

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.089 
o'clock so i guess it's pretty clear
because<00:03:09.810> five<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.110> though<00:03:12.090> yes<00:03:13.090> happy<00:03:14.099> on

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
because five is it though yes happy on

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.589 
because five is it though yes happy on
this<00:03:15.310> wall<00:03:15.610> right<00:03:15.640> here<00:03:15.849> people<00:03:16.360> used<00:03:16.510> to

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
this wall right here people used to

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.170 
this wall right here people used to
always<00:03:16.750> play<00:03:16.989> handle<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.489> it's<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.760> very<00:03:18.790> short

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
always play handle and it's a very short

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.910 
always play handle and it's a very short
long<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.690> that's<00:03:19.870> why<00:03:19.989> we're<00:03:20.200> pop<00:03:20.410> out<00:03:20.680> there

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
long so that's why we're pop out there

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.800 
long so that's why we're pop out there
alone<00:03:21.040> i<00:03:21.310> think<00:03:21.519> every<00:03:21.760> day<00:03:21.940> oh<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.420> lost<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
alone i think every day oh and lost the

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.050 
alone i think every day oh and lost the
ball

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060

look<00:03:26.020> tell<00:03:26.380> me<00:03:26.530> what

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.899 

to<00:03:30.599> not<00:03:30.780> see<00:03:30.810> an<00:03:31.319> honor<00:03:31.650> around<00:03:32.129> or<00:03:32.340> occupy<00:03:32.879> a

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
to not see an honor around or occupy a

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.170 
to not see an honor around or occupy a
container<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.719> any<00:03:33.900> pitcher<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:35.030> honor<00:03:36.030> of

container for any pitcher in honor of

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.780

you<00:03:36.359> I<00:03:36.420> was<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.140> play<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.680> one<00:03:37.980> or<00:03:38.340> one

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
you I was going to play the one or one

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.569 
you I was going to play the one or one
tone<00:03:39.030> pinecone<00:03:39.719> bowling<00:03:40.439> thing<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.400> there

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
tone pinecone bowling thing but there

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.099

aren't any pine cones around here i

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:44.330 
aren't any pine cones around here i
think<00:03:43.349> i<00:03:43.439> would<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.709> go<00:03:43.859> across<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
think i would have to go across the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.149 
think i would have to go across the
field<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.819> both<00:03:45.060> so<00:03:46.049> i'll<00:03:46.349> try<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.709> find

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
field to get both so i'll try to find

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:56.450 
field to get both so i'll try to find
something<00:03:47.430> else

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.520
