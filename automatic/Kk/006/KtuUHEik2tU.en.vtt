00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.910
 imagine that we live in a universe 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 full of life and that within this vast 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.300
 universe in our life or the life that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.910
 is there outside of our planet have 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.360
 intelligence imagine that this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.570
 intelligence had millions of years 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.989
 more evolution than we that the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.980
 human beings what would it be like to have 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 we will be interested 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.200
 contact us that would be important in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.660
 this planet so that we could 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.840
 be contacted at the same time and each 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 more and more information is emerging 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.320
 scientists that support it 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.430
 scientists who still question it 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 that suggest or hypothesize hypotheses 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 where they tell us that beings 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 humans we could have been from some 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 way planted and if we enter now 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.540
 same in the world of speculation of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.580
 the hypotheses of the imagination of the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:27.300
 science fiction but it is true that 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:31.210
 human beings from ancestral times 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.030
 have spoken of gods that come from 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.190
 heaven not even in holy books of 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.520
 most, but since all the 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.030
 religions speak at some point like 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.479
 beings who sometimes come from heaven 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.660
 even talking about specific objects 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.050
 that land on our planet and that 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.170
 let's say they give us origin or even origin 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.110
 to life on this planet 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.049
 according to a group of scientists led 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.140
 by Professor Chang who speaks 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.540
 about that 97% of the sequence does not 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.940
 codifies the human being and of all 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.600
 other species could have been 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.830
 some way affected or introduced 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.480
 to the planet for more evolved beings 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.390
 that we who in some way 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.180
 would have planted this possibility not 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 this hypothesis that they are taking in 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.440
 serious a group of scientists led 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.900
 as I tell you by the teacher chang but 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.989
 there is in there and from people from 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.170
 mathematical computer programming 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.239
 geneticists who are endorsing the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.540
 possibility that we have been 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.310
 seeded even doctor chang speaks 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.239
 about the DNA as it marks all its 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.069
 sequence was repeatedly modified not 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.100
 evolutionarily or very large advances 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.030
 many faster than other species and 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.959
 that he believes 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.330
 say things that somehow we 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.880
 they helped evolve in a way 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.400
 much faster for what purpose 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.910
 she starts to ask if there is any 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.310
 type of purpose not if it was a fact for 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.560
 return later to a future to colonize 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.270
 he does not begin to speculate with ideas that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880
 well they already come to science fiction such 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.410
 time but they are interesting not also 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.840
 talks about the possibility that 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.959
 just be somehow to go 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.030
 sowing life on other planets in the 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.570
 universe as a kind of project to 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.030
 long- term life growth not in 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.760
 everywhere not everywhere possible 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.410
 no growth when the 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.870
 speculations can be many the 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.980
 imagination can overflow can 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.410
 we can even talk about another type of 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.790
 human beings no more evolved than 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.150
 us who are somehow 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.840
 looking for how to generate 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.299
 more possibilities to live in case 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.760
 that they stop having a place 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.390
 where I live speculation good 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.269
 it can be going to many sides what 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.180
 important thing is that there is already 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.859
 people scientists who are interested 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.840
 in this subject they are determined to 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.699
 talk because there's a lot of science that 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.769
 let's say it's inexplicable and when it arrives 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.750
 the point of the inexplicable when it arrives 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.570
 to the point that there is no 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:30.430
 concrete possibility of how to define 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.740
 certain situation we start to say 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.979
 deny its existence not many times the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.979
 science becomes as dogmatic as a 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.310
 religion not then we need to start 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.750
 to listen to this type of scientists 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.139
 who are open to give us this 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.479
 information and start opening our 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.760
 mind and see where it is 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.710
 addressing all this information by 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.380
 now I await your comments on facebook 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.479
 on twitter and obviously here in the video 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.520
 from youtube see you next hangout 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.240
 that we will be integrating the 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.729
 two 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.729
 per week and good until then
