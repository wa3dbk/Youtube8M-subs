happy<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.720> up<00:01:19.170> in<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> 38<00:01:19.830> hundreds

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
happy to see that up in the 38 hundreds

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.320 
happy to see that up in the 38 hundreds
and<00:01:20.400> let's<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.729> ahead<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> check<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.180> our

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
and let's go ahead and check out our

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
and let's go ahead and check out our
next<00:01:21.450> base<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.830> next<00:01:22.979> base<00:01:23.250> here

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
next base all right so next base here

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
next base all right so next base here
this<00:01:23.939> one<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.200> simple<00:01:25.650> base<00:01:25.979> design

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
this one is a pretty simple base design

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.950 
this one is a pretty simple base design
looks<00:01:26.759> like<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.240> has<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:27.659> main

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
looks like it just has three main

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
looks like it just has three main
compartments<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.860> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> very<00:01:29.250> bottom

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
compartments and on the very bottom

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.069 
compartments and on the very bottom
there's<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> random<00:01:30.450> archer<00:01:30.900> tower

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
there's like a random archer tower

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
there's like a random archer tower
that's<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.590> compartment<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.189> let's<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.490> go

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that's in a compartment so let's just go

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.310 
that's in a compartment so let's just go
ahead<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.820> attack<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.329> do<00:01:33.780> pretty<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
ahead and attack and do pretty much the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890 
ahead and attack and do pretty much the
same<00:01:34.470> exact<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:35.090> alright<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
same exact thing alright so going in I

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
did bring a witch on this one gonna drop

my king in my Queen I've sort of just

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
my king in my Queen I've sort of just
been<00:01:40.140> experimenting<00:01:40.799> with<00:01:41.100> different<00:01:41.220> army

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
been experimenting with different army

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
been experimenting with different army
combinations<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.869> something<00:01:43.350> pretty

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
combinations and something pretty

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.899 
combinations and something pretty
important<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.130> this<00:01:44.310> raid<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> guys

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
important about this raid that you guys

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.249 
important about this raid that you guys
might<00:01:45.180> notice<00:01:45.540> if<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> bottom

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
might notice if you look on the bottom

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.499 
might notice if you look on the bottom
right<00:01:46.619> those<00:01:46.860> golems<00:01:47.340> rather<00:01:47.939> than<00:01:48.149> going<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
right those golems rather than going to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.850 
right those golems rather than going to
the<00:01:48.630> left<00:01:48.840> hand<00:01:48.990> side<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.619> would<00:01:49.770> have

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the left hand side where they would have

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
the left hand side where they would have
just<00:01:50.040> gone<00:01:50.520> all<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> way<00:01:51.030> around<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> circle

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just gone all the way around in a circle

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
just gone all the way around in a circle
they<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.649> went<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> bottom<00:01:53.250> right

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
they actually went to the bottom right

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.069 
they actually went to the bottom right
and<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.240> now<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.810> start

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and then now they're just gonna start

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.660 
and then now they're just gonna start
hopping<00:01:55.409> over<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.860> walls<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.369> golems

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
hopping over to the walls and the golems

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
hopping over to the walls and the golems
are<00:01:56.820> actually<00:01:57.180> gonna<00:01:57.299> make<00:01:57.479> their<00:01:57.659> way<00:01:57.780> into

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
are actually gonna make their way into

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.459 
are actually gonna make their way into
the<00:01:58.229> center<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.939> sort<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.060> realizing<00:02:00.540> or

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the center so sort of realizing or

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.840 
the center so sort of realizing or
something<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.920> I've<00:02:02.009> sort<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.280> realized<00:02:02.640> as

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
something that I've sort of realized as

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
something that I've sort of realized as
I've<00:02:03.000> been<00:02:03.090> pushing<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.899> golem

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I've been pushing is that golem

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.380 
I've been pushing is that golem
placement<00:02:04.829> during<00:02:04.950> gowipe<00:02:05.399> probably<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
placement during gowipe probably is the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880 
placement during gowipe probably is the
most<00:02:06.420> important<00:02:07.049> thing<00:02:07.200> nowadays<00:02:07.590> because

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
most important thing nowadays because

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.350 
most important thing nowadays because
you'll<00:02:08.009> find<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.340> lot<00:02:08.489> of<00:02:08.610> bases<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.149> just

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you'll find a lot of bases that just

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
you'll find a lot of bases that just
have<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> ring<00:02:09.810> design<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.349> get<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.590> goals<00:02:10.770> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
have a ring design to get your goals to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.589 
have a ring design to get your goals to
run<00:02:11.099> around<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> circle<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.090> they<00:02:12.420> pretty

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
run around in a circle and they pretty

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.780 
run around in a circle and they pretty
much<00:02:12.690> provide<00:02:12.989> no

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
much provide no

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.790 
much provide no
helped<00:02:14.150> during<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.780> raid<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.590> rate<00:02:15.769> I

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
helped during a raid but for this rate I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.290 
helped during a raid but for this rate I
actually<00:02:16.069> had<00:02:16.400> all<00:02:16.580> of<00:02:16.640> my<00:02:16.760> golems<00:02:17.150> go

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
actually had all of my golems go

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.880 
actually had all of my golems go
straight<00:02:17.629> into<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.959> center<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.500> because<00:02:18.860> of

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
straight into the center and because of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.020 
straight into the center and because of
that<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.310> see<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.580> was<00:02:19.790> pretty

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
that you can see this was pretty

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.530 
that you can see this was pretty
dominating<00:02:20.690> I'm<00:02:21.019> at<00:02:21.140> 45%<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:22.069> saw<00:02:22.250> my<00:02:22.430> queen<00:02:22.730> who

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
dominating I'm at 45% I saw my queen who

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.390 
dominating I'm at 45% I saw my queen who
can<00:02:23.720> deal<00:02:23.870> damage<00:02:24.080> from<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.530> back<00:02:24.739> so<00:02:25.069> yeah

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
can deal damage from the back so yeah

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.119 
can deal damage from the back so yeah
pretty<00:02:25.700> simple<00:02:26.120> 50%<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.290> think<00:02:27.830> I'm<00:02:27.920> just<00:02:27.980> gonna

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
pretty simple 50% I think I'm just gonna

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.199 
pretty simple 50% I think I'm just gonna
wrap<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.340> up<00:02:28.489> there<00:02:28.670> since<00:02:28.879> I<00:02:28.970> really<00:02:29.180> don't

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
wrap it up there since I really don't

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.690 
wrap it up there since I really don't
have<00:02:29.450> too<00:02:29.690> many<00:02:29.810> people<00:02:30.170> left<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.920> do<00:02:31.459> damage

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
have too many people left to do damage

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.640 
have too many people left to do damage
besides<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.480> Queen<00:02:32.720> in<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.959> back<00:02:33.170> plus<00:02:33.470> she

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
besides the Queen in the back plus she

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.320 
besides the Queen in the back plus she
doesn't<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.010> her<00:02:34.040> ability<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.849> in<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.180> end

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
doesn't have her ability and in the end

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.449 
doesn't have her ability and in the end
that<00:02:35.540> one<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:36.110> massive<00:02:36.799> whale

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that one was a massive whale

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.520 
that one was a massive whale
I<00:02:37.489> got<00:02:37.849> 32<00:02:38.450> trophies<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.140> raid<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
when he logs back onto his base alright

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.830 
when he logs back onto his base alright
let's<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.180> go<00:02:47.329> ahead<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.480> check<00:02:47.629> out<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
let's just go ahead and check out the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.229 
let's just go ahead and check out the
next<00:02:47.959> base<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.440> psychopath<00:02:49.010> here<00:02:49.519> pretty

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
next base so psychopath here pretty

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.089 
next base so psychopath here pretty
classic<00:02:50.810> base<00:02:50.959> design<00:02:51.349> you<00:02:51.560> notice<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.950> Town

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
classic base design you notice the Town

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.009 
classic base design you notice the Town
Hall<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.459> on<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.790> very<00:02:53.000> top<00:02:53.269> but<00:02:53.599> since<00:02:53.870> this

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
Hall is on the very top but since this

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.270 
Hall is on the very top but since this

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
trophies it's actually worth it to drop

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.900 
trophies it's actually worth it to drop
the<00:02:57.739> rest<00:02:57.859> of<00:02:58.010> my<00:02:58.069> troops<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.489> get<00:02:58.579> try<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.790> get

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
50% on this guy's base so whenever you

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.220 
50% on this guy's base so whenever you
see<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.090> base<00:03:02.299> like<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:02.569> where<00:03:02.989> they<00:03:03.079> have

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
see a base like this where they have

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.960 
see a base like this where they have
their<00:03:03.379> town<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.799> on<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.220> side<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.819> then

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
their town all on like the side and then

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.309 
their town all on like the side and then
they<00:03:05.090> have<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.329> rest<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.660> their<00:03:05.750> defenses<00:03:06.230> in

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
they have the rest of their defenses in

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.270 
they have the rest of their defenses in
the<00:03:06.410> center<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.829> they're<00:03:06.950> pretty<00:03:07.040> much<00:03:07.160> just

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
the center and they're pretty much just

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.059 
the center and they're pretty much just
trying<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.730> give<00:03:07.849> up<00:03:07.970> a<00:03:08.060> single<00:03:08.299> star<00:03:08.769> if<00:03:09.769> they

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
trying to give up a single star if they

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.890 
trying to give up a single star if they
do<00:03:10.129> have<00:03:10.519> more<00:03:10.730> than<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.940> couple<00:03:11.000> trophies<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
do have more than a couple trophies and

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.420 
do have more than a couple trophies and
you<00:03:11.989> want<00:03:12.140> to<00:03:12.230> get<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.410> second<00:03:12.890> star<00:03:13.040> rather

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
you want to get that second star rather

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.250 
you want to get that second star rather
than<00:03:13.670> doing<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.000> standard<00:03:14.420> attack<00:03:14.750> strategy

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
than doing a standard attack strategy

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.650 
than doing a standard attack strategy
the<00:03:15.709> best<00:03:15.739> way<00:03:16.069> to<00:03:16.099> get<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.310> 50%<00:03:17.060> at<00:03:17.209> least<00:03:17.480> when

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
the best way to get to 50% at least when

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.180 
the best way to get to 50% at least when
you're<00:03:17.780> using<00:03:17.959> go<00:03:18.260> wipe<00:03:18.440> or<00:03:18.650> gowiwi<00:03:18.889> or

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
you're using go wipe or gowiwi or

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.470 
you're using go wipe or gowiwi or
something<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:19.579> that<00:03:19.730> rather<00:03:20.209> than

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
something like that rather than

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.909 
something like that rather than
attacking<00:03:20.780> from<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.139> single<00:03:21.440> point<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.650> attack

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
attacking from a single point of attack

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:23.379 
attacking from a single point of attack
I<00:03:22.130> actually<00:03:22.340> like<00:03:22.639> attack<00:03:22.940> them<00:03:23.090> from<00:03:23.180> all

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
I actually like attack them from all

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.240 
I actually like attack them from all
sides<00:03:23.419> of<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:23.840> base<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.290> as<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.560> guys<00:03:24.680> saw<00:03:24.950> I

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
sides of the base so as you guys saw I

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.940 
sides of the base so as you guys saw I
dropped<00:03:25.760> one<00:03:25.880> golem<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.690> think<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.440> had<00:03:27.530> 3<00:03:27.739> golems

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
dropped one golem I think I had 3 golems

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.440 
dropped one golem I think I had 3 golems
I<00:03:28.190> dropped<00:03:28.430> one<00:03:28.519> on<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.790> bottom<00:03:28.910> right<00:03:29.180> one<00:03:29.329> of

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
I dropped one on the bottom right one of

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.940 
I dropped one on the bottom right one of
the<00:03:29.510> bottom<00:03:29.750> left<00:03:29.959> one<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.349> top<00:03:30.560> left<00:03:30.590> and

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
the bottom left one on the top left and

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.559 
the bottom left one on the top left and
then<00:03:31.069> I<00:03:31.190> dropped<00:03:31.430> my<00:03:31.519> heroes<00:03:31.849> on<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.120> very<00:03:32.299> top

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
then I dropped my heroes on the very top

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.120 
then I dropped my heroes on the very top
right<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.019> because<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.620> even<00:03:33.919> though

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
right and because of that even though

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.259 
right and because of that even though
I'm<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.310> getting<00:03:34.579> into<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:34.819> center<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
I'm not getting into the center of the

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.210 
I'm not getting into the center of the
base<00:03:35.450> I'm<00:03:35.900> having<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.380> really<00:03:36.650> easy<00:03:36.859> time<00:03:37.190> to

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
base I'm having a really easy time to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.860 
base I'm having a really easy time to
get<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.519> percentage<00:03:37.910> points<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.329> need<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.780> get

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
get the percentage points I need to get

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.020 
get the percentage points I need to get
to<00:03:38.989> 50%<00:03:39.380> it's<00:03:39.769> almost<00:03:40.130> guaranteed<00:03:40.430> and

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
to 50% it's almost guaranteed and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.819 
to 50% it's almost guaranteed and
because<00:03:41.750> that<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.989> ended<00:03:42.319> up<00:03:42.410> getting<00:03:42.530> two

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
because that I ended up getting two

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:44.559 
because that I ended up getting two
stars<00:03:43.099> fairly<00:03:43.519> easily<00:03:43.730> I<00:03:44.000> ended<00:03:44.510> up

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
stars fairly easily I ended up

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.839 
stars fairly easily I ended up
surrendering<00:03:45.560> after<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:46.099> to<00:03:46.519> save<00:03:46.700> my

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
surrendering after that to save my

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.129 
surrendering after that to save my
hero's<00:03:47.180> health<00:03:47.389> because<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.750> knew<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:47.930> wasn't

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
hero's health because I knew I wasn't

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.379 
hero's health because I knew I wasn't
gonna<00:03:48.290> get<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.620> 100%<00:03:49.010> using<00:03:49.579> that<00:03:49.700> tactic<00:03:50.150> and

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
gonna get to 100% using that tactic and

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.789 
gonna get to 100% using that tactic and
I<00:03:50.510> ended<00:03:50.690> up<00:03:50.810> getting<00:03:50.900> 9<00:03:51.169> trophies<00:03:51.530> for<00:03:51.650> that

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
I ended up getting 9 trophies for that

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.379 
I ended up getting 9 trophies for that
raid<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.730> one<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:53.030> had<00:03:53.180> absolutely

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
raid and for one that had absolutely

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.449 
raid and for one that had absolutely
zero<00:03:53.810> risk<00:03:54.380> because<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.859> Town<00:03:55.040> Hall<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.370> on

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
zero risk because the Town Hall is on

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.979 
zero risk because the Town Hall is on
the<00:03:55.549> outside<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.150> was<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> pretty

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
the outside that was actually a pretty

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.690 
the outside that was actually a pretty
good<00:03:57.200> trade<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.739> I<00:03:58.040> was<00:03:58.160> pretty<00:03:58.310> happy<00:03:58.489> with

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
good trade and I was pretty happy with

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.009 
good trade and I was pretty happy with
that<00:03:58.879> one<00:03:59.030> all<00:03:59.209> right<00:03:59.510> so<00:03:59.660> if<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.780> look<00:03:59.959> at

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
that one all right so if you look at

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.240 
that one all right so if you look at
this<00:04:00.169> base<00:04:00.319> here<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.739> guys<00:04:00.829> are<00:04:00.889> gonna<00:04:01.040> notice

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
this base here you guys are gonna notice

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.039 
this base here you guys are gonna notice
this<00:04:01.400> is<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.669> same<00:04:01.760> exact<00:04:02.299> base<00:04:02.480> design<00:04:02.810> from

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
this is the same exact base design from

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.180 
this is the same exact base design from
I<00:04:03.109> think<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.379> second<00:04:03.739> person<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.069> I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
I think the second person that I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.309 
I think the second person that I
attacked<00:04:04.639> where<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:05.180> got<00:04:05.359> 32<00:04:05.780> trophies<00:04:06.200> so

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
attacked where I got 32 trophies so

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.390 
attacked where I got 32 trophies so
let's<00:04:06.440> go<00:04:06.560> ahead<00:04:06.620> and<00:04:06.799> try<00:04:06.859> to<00:04:06.950> take<00:04:07.129> them<00:04:07.250> out

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
let's go ahead and try to take them out

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400 
let's go ahead and try to take them out
you<00:04:07.669> notice<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.359> one<00:04:08.599> of<00:04:08.720> my<00:04:08.810> golems<00:04:09.230> is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
you notice that one of my golems is

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.890 
you notice that one of my golems is
going<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:09.859> bottom<00:04:10.010> right<00:04:10.359> this<00:04:11.359> time<00:04:11.569> and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
going to the bottom right this time and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.809 
going to the bottom right this time and
I'm<00:04:12.440> dropping<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.889> second<00:04:13.250> golem<00:04:13.489> right<00:04:13.669> now

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
I'm dropping that second golem right now

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.339 
I'm dropping that second golem right now
to<00:04:13.879> jump<00:04:14.180> over<00:04:14.449> the<00:04:14.540> wall<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.870> hopefully<00:04:15.049> go

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
to jump over the wall and hopefully go

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.140 
to jump over the wall and hopefully go
to<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.650> center<00:04:15.980> but<00:04:16.190> one<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.760> golems<00:04:17.030> is

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
to the center but one of the golems is

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.460 
to the center but one of the golems is
gonna<00:04:17.329> make<00:04:17.449> his<00:04:17.599> way<00:04:17.720> into<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.019> core<00:04:18.260> the

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
gonna make his way into the core the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.810 
gonna make his way into the core the
golem<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:18.949> dropped<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.310> little<00:04:19.430> bit<00:04:19.549> later

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
golem that I dropped a little bit later

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.460 
golem that I dropped a little bit later
actually<00:04:20.299> went<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.660> left<00:04:20.840> as<00:04:21.049> well<00:04:21.199> as<00:04:21.260> one

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
actually went to the left as well as one

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.380 
actually went to the left as well as one
of<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.620> pekka's<00:04:21.979> so<00:04:22.520> not<00:04:22.729> as<00:04:22.880> clean<00:04:23.120> as<00:04:23.270> the

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
of the pekka's so not as clean as the

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.120 
of the pekka's so not as clean as the
last<00:04:23.630> raid<00:04:23.930> and<00:04:24.169> because<00:04:24.469> this<00:04:24.560> guy<00:04:24.740> does<00:04:25.010> have

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
last raid and because this guy does have

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.740 
last raid and because this guy does have
a<00:04:25.190> single<00:04:25.490> target<00:04:25.700> Inferno<00:04:26.180> to

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
a single target Inferno to

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.300 
a single target Inferno to
that<00:04:27.020> one<00:04:27.140> actually<00:04:27.260> worked<00:04:27.620> out<00:04:27.800> really<00:04:28.040> well

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
that one actually worked out really well

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.740 
that one actually worked out really well
and<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:28.580> ended<00:04:28.790> up<00:04:28.940> destroying<00:04:29.090> my<00:04:29.480> King

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
and it ended up destroying my King

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.600 
and it ended up destroying my King
because<00:04:30.140> my<00:04:30.260> King<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> first<00:04:31.010> person<00:04:31.430> to

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
because my King was the first person to

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.520 
because my King was the first person to
jump<00:04:32.120> over<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.450> walls<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:33.050> within<00:04:33.350> range

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
jump over the walls and get within range

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.230 
jump over the walls and get within range
of<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.890> but<00:04:34.220> luckily<00:04:34.460> he's<00:04:34.730> still<00:04:34.910> able<00:04:35.060> to

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
of that but luckily he's still able to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.220 
of that but luckily he's still able to
destroy<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.660> Town<00:04:35.810> Hall

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
destroy the Town Hall

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.600 
destroy the Town Hall
have<00:04:36.500> plenty<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.800> wizards<00:04:37.100> left<00:04:37.310> plenty<00:04:37.460> of

have plenty of wizards left plenty of

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.190 
have plenty of wizards left plenty of
witches<00:04:37.910> left<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.330> because<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:38.900> inferno

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
witches left and because the inferno

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.690 
witches left and because the inferno
tower<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.620> set<00:04:39.770> on<00:04:39.890> this<00:04:40.070> single<00:04:40.220> target

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
tower is set on this single target

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.880 
tower is set on this single target
they're<00:04:40.910> not<00:04:41.030> really<00:04:41.180> able<00:04:41.540> to<00:04:41.660> deal<00:04:42.020> with<00:04:42.200> it

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
they're not really able to deal with it

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.980 
they're not really able to deal with it
as<00:04:43.130> fast<00:04:43.670> as<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.000> could<00:04:44.120> have<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:44.510> after<00:04:44.870> that

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
as fast as it could have so after that

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
air sweeper yet so for me I actually

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.530 
air sweeper yet so for me I actually
haven't<00:04:55.190> been<00:04:55.310> using<00:04:55.520> any<00:04:55.700> air<00:04:56.000> attacks<00:04:56.330> with

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
haven't been using any air attacks with

haven't been using any air attacks with
it<00:04:56.660> I've<00:04:56.810> heard<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.170> it's<00:04:57.350> not<00:04:57.500> too<00:04:57.680> big<00:04:57.800> of<00:04:57.950> a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
it I've heard that it's not too big of a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.500 
it I've heard that it's not too big of a
deal<00:04:58.130> from<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.430> lot<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.700> players<00:04:58.880> who<00:04:59.120> say<00:04:59.330> it's

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
deal from a lot of players who say it's

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.240 
deal from a lot of players who say it's
just<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.930> little<00:05:00.560> bit<00:05:00.680> different<00:05:01.040> that<00:05:01.100> you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
just a little bit different that you

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.410 
just a little bit different that you
have<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.430> attack<00:05:01.640> from<00:05:01.820> different<00:05:02.120> sides<00:05:02.270> of

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
have to attack from different sides of

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.760 
have to attack from different sides of
the<00:05:02.540> base<00:05:02.690> but<00:05:02.720> I<00:05:02.930> might<00:05:03.140> try<00:05:03.230> doing<00:05:03.500> some<00:05:03.650> air

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
the base but I might try doing some air

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.680 
the base but I might try doing some air
attacks<00:05:04.070> after<00:05:04.310> I<00:05:04.460> hit<00:05:04.610> 4,000<00:05:05.210> trophies<00:05:05.540> and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
attacks after I hit 4,000 trophies and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.120 
attacks after I hit 4,000 trophies and
just<00:05:05.840> test<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.140> out<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.500> see<00:05:06.650> how<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:07.100> it

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
just test that out and see how I like it

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.700 
just test that out and see how I like it
but<00:05:07.700> as<00:05:07.940> you<00:05:07.970> guys<00:05:08.120> can<00:05:08.300> see<00:05:08.360> I'm<00:05:08.630> at<00:05:08.750> 3900<00:05:09.560> and
