the cookies you made but today we are
drinking<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.750> gorgeous<00:00:37.200> thing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
drinking this gorgeous thing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.330 
drinking this gorgeous thing
it's<00:00:38.250> called<00:00:38.489> derailed<00:00:39.059> Porter<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.340> won't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
it's called derailed Porter I won't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.639 
it's called derailed Porter I won't
spawn<00:00:41.579> surprise<00:00:42.059> great<00:00:42.899> why<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> called

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
spawn surprise great why is it called

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.299 
spawn surprise great why is it called
derailed<00:00:44.280> Porter<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.360> took<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.309> standard

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
derailed Porter so we took a standard

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.459 
derailed Porter so we took a standard
Porter<00:00:47.700> after<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> traditional<00:00:48.719> London<00:00:48.930> Porter

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Porter after a traditional London Porter

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.200 
Porter after a traditional London Porter
and<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> introduced<00:00:50.100> Protandim<00:00:50.610> Isis<00:00:50.969> which

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and we introduced Protandim Isis which

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
and we introduced Protandim Isis which
is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> wild<00:00:52.170> yeast<00:00:52.410> essentially<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.489> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
is a wild yeast essentially which we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.010 
is a wild yeast essentially which we
introduced<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> cask<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.780> we've<00:00:54.870> led

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
introduced into the cask and we've led

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.479 
introduced into the cask and we've led
an<00:00:55.110> aged<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.530> five<00:00:55.739> months<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:57.780> can<00:00:58.079> consume

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
an aged for five months it can consume

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
an aged for five months it can consume
more<00:00:59.489> far<00:00:59.760> more<00:00:59.789> complex<00:01:00.180> sugars<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
more far more complex sugars and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
more far more complex sugars and
standard<00:01:01.079> brews<00:01:01.260> East<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> lot

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
standard brews East so you get a lot

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
standard brews East so you get a lot
more<00:01:02.280> different<00:01:02.460> flavor<00:01:03.329> compounds<00:01:03.660> and

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
more different flavor compounds and

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.080 
more different flavor compounds and
aroma<00:01:04.320> compounds<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.159> lot<00:01:05.519> stronger<00:01:05.790> beer

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
aroma compounds and a lot stronger beer

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500 
aroma compounds and a lot stronger beer
from<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.100> sugars<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> beer<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> yeah

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
from it the sugars in beer that it yeah

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170 
from it the sugars in beer that it yeah
so<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:10.220> in<00:01:11.220> terms<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.610> brewers<00:01:11.820> yeast<00:01:11.909> you've

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
so in in terms of brewers yeast you've

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.850 
so in in terms of brewers yeast you've
got<00:01:12.330> fermentable<00:01:12.720> sugars<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.170> unmentionable

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
got fermentable sugars and unmentionable

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.520 
got fermentable sugars and unmentionable
sugars<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> essentially<00:01:15.479> rosie's<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.409> eat

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sugars and essentially rosie's can eat

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
sugars and essentially rosie's can eat
up<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> maximum<00:01:17.310> where<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.909> commentable

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
up to the maximum where the commentable

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
up to the maximum where the commentable
sugars<00:01:18.960> stop<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.830> batana<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.280> C's<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.670> eat

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
sugars stop but batana my C's can eat

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.480 
sugars stop but batana my C's can eat
far<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.119> complex<00:01:21.450> sugars<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:26.070> depends<00:01:26.430> on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
far more complex sugars it depends on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
far more complex sugars it depends on
the<00:01:26.610> strain<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> Brettanomyces<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.930> like

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the strain of Brettanomyces like like

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.260 
the strain of Brettanomyces like like
flavors<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> Romans<00:01:29.700> depend<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
flavors of the Romans depend on the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
flavors of the Romans depend on the
strain<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.810> brewing<00:01:31.350> yeast<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:31.860> this

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
strain of brewing yeast but this

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
strain of brewing yeast but this
particular<00:01:32.340> strain<00:01:32.970> has<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.990> sort

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
particular strain has got very much sort

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
particular strain has got very much sort
of<00:01:34.380> cherry<00:01:34.710> pie<00:01:34.950> aromas<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.759> flavors<00:01:36.329> very

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
of cherry pie aromas and flavors very

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.380 
of cherry pie aromas and flavors very
slightly<00:01:37.470> tart<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> sour<00:01:38.820> beer<00:01:39.210> as

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
slightly tart but not not a sour beer as

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.620 
slightly tart but not not a sour beer as
such

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
such

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
such
it's<00:01:42.630> adds<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.990> layer<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.260> complexity<00:01:43.710> also

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it's adds a layer of complexity also

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
it's adds a layer of complexity also
dries<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.670> bear<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:45.060> from<00:01:45.840> our<00:01:45.990> sort<00:01:46.229> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
dries to bear out from our sort of

standard<00:01:46.710> Porter<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> quite<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> bit<00:01:48.600> more

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
standard Porter this is quite a bit more

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
standard Porter this is quite a bit more
of<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> dryer<00:01:49.110> beard<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.650> those<00:01:49.770> sugars

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
of a dryer beard because those sugars

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.910 
of a dryer beard because those sugars
are<00:01:50.310> being<00:01:50.580> consumed

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
are being consumed

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.109 
are being consumed

Rutina sin the sweetness of light

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.219 
Rutina sin the sweetness of light
disappears<00:01:54.570> yeah<00:01:59.990> it's<00:02:00.990> quite<00:02:01.170> an

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
disappears yeah it's quite an

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.780 
disappears yeah it's quite an
interesting<00:02:01.380> used<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.830> use<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.640> mean

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
interesting used to use because I mean

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.120 
interesting used to use because I mean
the<00:02:03.060> years<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.049> all<00:02:04.320> there<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the years it was in all there and so in

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.560 
the years it was in all there and so in
Victorian<00:02:05.549> times<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.909> porters<00:02:06.299> would<00:02:06.450> have

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Victorian times all porters would have

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.180 
Victorian times all porters would have
tasted<00:02:06.899> slightly<00:02:07.380> like<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.560> obviously

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
tasted slightly like this obviously

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.960 
tasted slightly like this obviously
people<00:02:09.060> take<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> bit<00:02:10.370> Louie<00:02:11.370> Pasteur<00:02:11.550> came

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
people take a bit Louie Pasteur came

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.699 
people take a bit Louie Pasteur came
along<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.330> isolated<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> different<00:02:13.500> strains

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
along and isolated the different strains

that<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.330> tricky<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.780> mean<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.170> were<00:02:40.560> very

that it's tricky I mean we were very

that it's tricky I mean we were very
