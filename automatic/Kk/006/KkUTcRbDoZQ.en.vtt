00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
as much weight as I could on my board so

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.960 
as much weight as I could on my board so
it<00:02:43.770> wouldn't<00:02:44.070> slide<00:02:44.220> out<00:02:44.430> in<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.580> foam<00:02:44.790> ball

it wouldn't slide out in the foam ball
and<00:02:45.180> my<00:02:46.170> board<00:02:46.560> slid<00:02:46.920> out<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.640> just

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
and my board slid out like this just

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.790 
and my board slid out like this just
sideways<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.930> little<00:02:49.020> bit<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.470> end<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.739> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
sideways a little bit at the end of the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.000 
sideways a little bit at the end of the
wave<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.610> catches<00:02:51.299> and<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:52.680> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
wave and then it catches and at that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.610 
wave and then it catches and at that
