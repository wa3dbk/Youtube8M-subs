and<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.859> decided<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.510> more<00:00:27.960> robust

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and we decided to get a more robust

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
and we decided to get a more robust
machine<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.070> thought<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> digital<00:00:30.449> press

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
machine and thought of digital press

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
machine and thought of digital press
might<00:00:30.869> go<00:00:31.019> well<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.640> originally<00:00:32.640> we

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
might go well with it originally we

a<00:00:45.420> machine<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.260> talked<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> HP<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a machine and we talked to HP about it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.770 
a machine and we talked to HP about it
he<00:00:47.250> said<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.550> needed<00:00:47.730> machine<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.629> do

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
