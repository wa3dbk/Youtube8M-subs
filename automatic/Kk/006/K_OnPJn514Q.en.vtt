00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.270 
subtle so you're going to take the first
front<00:02:51.150> section<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.500> you're<00:02:52.709> gonna<00:02:52.890> start

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
front section and you're gonna start

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.840 
front section and you're gonna start
with<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.970> straightener<00:02:54.510> up<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:56.430> too<00:02:56.670> close

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
with the straightener up not too close

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.780 
with the straightener up not too close
to<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.150> route<00:02:57.480> bus<00:02:57.959> at<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.890> start<00:02:59.310> up<00:02:59.550> the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
to your route bus at the start up the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.520 
to your route bus at the start up the
hit<00:02:59.970> expansion<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.840> you're<00:03:00.959> going<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> twist

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
hit expansion and you're going to twist

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:20.510 
hit expansion and you're going to twist
it<00:03:01.920> round<00:03:02.220> as<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.930> pull<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.320> dead<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:20.160> little

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
it round as you pull it dead a little

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.580 
it round as you pull it dead a little
bit<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.910> hairspray<00:03:21.180> you're<00:03:21.989> going<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> do<00:03:22.380> that

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
bit of hairspray you're going to do that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.370 
bit of hairspray you're going to do that
again<00:03:23.030> it's<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.209> next<00:03:24.510> section<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.050> wee<00:03:25.230> bit

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
again it's the next section a wee bit

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.960 
again it's the next section a wee bit
further<00:03:25.709> back

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.170 

now<00:03:31.600> Megan's<00:03:32.230> cuddles<00:03:32.590> can<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:32.860> start<00:03:33.280> next<00:03:33.850> to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
now Megan's cuddles can I start next to

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.900 
now Megan's cuddles can I start next to
her<00:03:34.300> ears<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.920> that's<00:03:36.160> what<00:03:36.460> we're<00:03:36.640> doing

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
her ears so that's what we're doing

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.110 
her ears so that's what we're doing
we're<00:03:37.090> replicating<00:03:37.300> best<00:03:38.020> Luke<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.970> you

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
we're replicating best Luke and if you

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000 
we're replicating best Luke and if you
were<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.270> be<00:03:40.540> carlin<00:03:40.930> extensions<00:03:41.620> under<00:03:41.740> here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
were to be carlin extensions under here

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.990 
were to be carlin extensions under here
separately<00:03:42.720> before<00:03:43.720> you<00:03:44.080> put<00:03:44.290> them<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
separately before you put them in the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.240 
separately before you put them in the
curls<00:03:46.360> would<00:03:46.630> basically<00:03:46.870> start<00:03:47.740> from<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.070> top

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
curls would basically start from the top

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.520 
curls would basically start from the top
of<00:03:48.310> your<00:03:48.610> head<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.690> that's<00:03:49.930> why<00:03:50.170> we're<00:03:50.380> doing

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
of your head so that's why we're doing

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.430 
of your head so that's why we're doing
it<00:03:50.740> when<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.520> extensions<00:03:52.060> are<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.960> here

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.080 

you<00:03:56.440> may<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.800> to<00:03:56.980> hold<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.340> heat<00:03:57.520> extension

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
you may have to hold the heat extension

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.700 
you may have to hold the heat extension
like<00:03:58.270> this<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.780> doesn't<00:03:58.900> pick<00:03:59.440> too<00:03:59.680> much

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
like this so it doesn't pick too much

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.290 
like this so it doesn't pick too much
for<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.760> pull<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.090> over<00:04:01.360> you're<00:04:01.780> here

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
for it and pull it over you're here

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.370 
for it and pull it over you're here
obviously<00:04:04.300> we've<00:04:04.420> got<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.660> lot<00:04:04.840> here<00:04:05.080> here

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
obviously we've got a lot here here

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.790 
obviously we've got a lot here here
we're<00:04:05.560> just<00:04:05.740> going<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:05.950> take<00:04:06.390> sections<00:04:10.800> to

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
we're just going to take sections to

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:25.590 
we're just going to take sections to
make<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.100> more<00:04:12.250> manageable<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.910> iock<00:04:25.270> men

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
make it more manageable the iock men

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.040 
make it more manageable the iock men
using<00:04:25.870> a<00:04:26.230> protective<00:04:27.100> spree<00:04:27.490> or<00:04:27.820> see<00:04:28.300> them<00:04:28.360> to

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
using a protective spree or see them to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.780 
using a protective spree or see them to
protect<00:04:29.320> your<00:04:29.650> hair<00:04:29.800> from<00:04:29.830> heat<00:04:30.220> when<00:04:30.610> you're

straighten<00:04:33.250> earth<00:04:33.430> and<00:04:33.700> that<00:04:34.120> means<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.570> will

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
straighten earth and that means it will

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.300 
straighten earth and that means it will
last<00:04:34.930> longer<00:04:35.320> they<00:04:35.620> won't<00:04:35.800> dry<00:04:36.070> out<00:04:36.100> your
