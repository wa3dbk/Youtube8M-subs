 produce 7 minutes 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.259
 something on the subject that seems to me 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.549
 most relevant today 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.929
 thrilling i won't try to pronounce 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.349

 first time study is honored 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.009
 this morning I was in the Oleg Kashin hospital 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.189
 he had another surgery 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.919
 surgical restored direct and 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.109

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.280
 Russian journalism 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.270
 brutal beating of a reporter 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.340
 Kommersant newspapers were assigned to the field 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.210
 wide resonance in society 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.930
 professional environment whose all others 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.600
 attempt on the life and health of Russian 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.860
 of journalists 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.740
 in a number of federal TV channels smoothly 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.080
 the truth could be heated for 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.700
 givenness and whaler immediate response 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.360
 head of state on what happened 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.170
 different from the first 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 face after the murder of anna politkovskaya 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.550
 before attacking him Oleg Kashin for 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.450
 federal broadcast did not exist 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.990

 opposition protest movements and street 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.540
 youth leaders and these themes and heroes 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.110
 unthinkable on tv 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.130
 marginal kind of environment starts something 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.850
 change in a public situation 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.420
 creates a new trend but among 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.380
 TV journalists from Kashin simply do not have 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.630
 colleagues was one andrey losak and that 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.740

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.000
 finally shared on 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.310
 passable on tv and impassable on tv 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.890

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.049
 lets feel 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.649
 self-confidence of the prime minister and his 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:18.949
 mood 2012 year and ignorance 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.749
 unpleasant topics 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.359
 we presented in the mouth 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.279
 domestic television journalist and then 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.959
 in domestic television question 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.679
 given by the chariot Putin 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.599
 why have you cornered michael 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.789
 Khodorkovsky 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.599
 These are the words of the premiere from the merchant at times 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.629
 it seems that 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.199
 leading social and political newspaper 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.229

 Herald is not a program 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.009
 opposition and federal 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:40.319
 TV channels talk about different 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.559
 russia 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.869
 and leading business newspaper bills 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:45.759
 speaker gryzlov actually equated 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:47.079
 accomplice of terrorists in that 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.839
 amongst its habitual context 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.739
 Russian media television before 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.109
 Total 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.969
 on these the current president and prime minister 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.589
 estimated at about 75 percent 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:58.139
 federal television they are not 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.939
 audible critical skeptical or 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.589
 ironic judgments 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:03.609
 silenced to a quarter of the spectrum 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.759
 public opinion 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.689
 higher authority appears expensive 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.189
 dead they are just good or nothing 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.979
 despite the fact that the audience clearly 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:12.889
 claimed other opinions what 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:14.669
 Furor caused almost the only 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:15.460
 an exception 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.750
 televised show 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.079
 dialogue between Yuri Shevchuk and Vladimir Putin 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.229
 evergreen receptions familiar to everyone who 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.549
 caught the central television of the USSR 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:25.599
 then reporting replaces 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.159
 protocol shooting meeting in the Kremlin 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.930
 the text contains information 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:30.859
 support 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.769
 when there are canons of the show 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 first person accepts minister or chapter 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.510
 the region goes to the people 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.909
 it is conducted successfully by colleagues 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.219
 This is not news but old age 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.819
 a repetition of how it is accepted in such 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.279
 cases of substances 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.449
 Impressions at all possible without 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.529
 proven prominent beds of any help 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.339
 will look like a figure of just everything 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.809
 regular appearance on the screen 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:54.709
 having worked so much in ostankino 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.489
 and for ostankino 24 years old i'm talking about this with 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.329
 bitterness 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.749
 I have no right to blame any of my colleagues myself 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.589
 no wrestler and no other feats 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:03.299
 waiting for 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.799
 but you should at least call your things 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.229
 by names 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.669
 for television journalism is doubly sad when 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.439
 obvious achievements 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.419
 large-scale television shows and domestic school 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:13.359
 serials 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.369
 our television is more sophisticated 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.139
 fascinates entertains and laughs but hardly 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.109
 call him 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.469
 civil public 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:22.029
 political institution 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.879
 convinced this is one of the main reasons 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.149
 dramatic dramatic decline 

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.520
 TV watching 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.639
 the most active part of the population when 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.949
 people of our club speak to you 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.330
 why does a box start it not do for me 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.000
 much worse than most 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.729
 population no longer needs 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:39.629
 journalism 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.240
 when perplexed 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.680
 Well, you could think 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.330
 will kill 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.889
 why from reporters attacking football 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.999
 millions of people don't understand what's on 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:50.330
 occupational risk 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.440
 journalists coming 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.050
 for your audience 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.190
 journalist byt not for what he wrote 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.180
 said or took off 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.759
 and for reading this 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.650
