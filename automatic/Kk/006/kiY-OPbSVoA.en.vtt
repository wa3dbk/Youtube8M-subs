 government to eat with a lie by 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.660

 that is going to end very soon 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.780
 interesting predictions and we're going to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.210
 welcome you to reinaldo the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.010
 saints the prophet of america who 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.110
 find satellite from the city 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.990
 from mexico and we have so many things 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.270
 to ask him welcome 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.430
 to hours thank you very much thank you to a 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.079
 Queen of the obviously good morning 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.270
 figures worked by the council 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.750
 national elections coincide with what 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.259
 you said the number of votes 250 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.840
 236 thousand votes or something like that now 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.580
 that the time that has given the reason that 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.680
 do you think that you are going to have from 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.540
 this moment 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.940
 well I think the prophecy is already 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.020
 made in fact I am saying that it is 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.930
 what is going to happen 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.660
 then 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.520
 to them for no reason in the world in 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.080
 want to accept that the votes are counted 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 so here is what you have left 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.560
 Capriles now is what he is going to do 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.260
 is to press and press and press 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.000
 until the votes are counted, be I 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.979
 I think the Venezuelan government the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 government in fact is not a government 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.280
 democratic the one who is now what 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.470
 affirms is a government in fact and always 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.060
 said that that is a dictatorship and I continue 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.700
 affirming that it is a dictatorship and will be and 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.680
 that in history history is going 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.810
 to tell in this way is going to tell 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.870
 in this way cappriles keep 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.820
 negotiating now because that is what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.980
 he will be left to him now in this 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.040
 moment but I tell you one thing go back to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.320
 repeat this is the last period of a 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.270
 Chavez government and it will be a very long period 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
 brief everyone is nicolÃ¡s was known as 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.870
 Nicholas the Brief 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 reinaldo we go quickie for barrier 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.760
 the holder there will be a recount or audit of the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.250
 100 percent of the vote if I do not 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.860
 impossible game there is not going to be a possible 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.630
 impossible impossible besides they are already 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 burning the votes in venezuela ok 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.849
 perfect that nobody tells us if arias 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 please change in some way the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.659
 result 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.010
 will not change the result now there 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.920
 the only thing that can be done is 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.510
 press press to make this 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.459
 government is finished because it is already 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.409
 written and that happened already what the 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.010
 same farewell of the year is transition 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.629
 according to your vision reinaldo according to your vision 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.989
 this atmosphere of tension that is lived in 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.989
 venezuela will happen to something greater 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.000
 unfortunately they have to say that 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.650
 if what comes to Venezuela now 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.110
 it's not good at all in the coming period 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.300
 it's not for nothing at all stories do not you 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.560
 I can I would like to get here to give good 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.570
 news for the people of venezuela 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.520
 but there is no way there is no way to give 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.620
 good news because because the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.690
 government so wanted so decreed 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.250
 mature sir and maybe it's not even 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.110
 the people who are close to 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.030
 he because he said I do not remember the votes 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.190
 because you lost because he said that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.110
 I was going to accept the vote count 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.120
 surely the back concession told him 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.950
 do not do it because he lost if 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.650
 we cut the votes will come out that that 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.290
 capriles won according to your opinion time 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.810
 real gentleman capriles of mature sir 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.330
 in the presidency 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.959
 during the referendum at most 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.180
 look 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.010
 here are two things one is to leave 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.890
 now what I see very difficult that is not going to 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.480
 accept the second there is an event 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.400
 let's talk about it after 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.290
 here about a year that's going to 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400
 completely change the panorama in 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.019
 Venezuela 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.730
 maybe it will be at the end of this year 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.260
 beginning of next year that is going to 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.750
 change completely can be the end 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.400
 of the government and the third option is the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.150
 referendum there does not happen if the government 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.130
 from Venezuela 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.830
 Rinaldo is very interesting and they are very 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.330
 your traditions are right and the truth is 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.070
 that we are going to return with you more 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.600
 forward because there is much more than 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.419
 ask you there are many more things that 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.979
 talk so please stay there with 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.380
 we who later returned 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.060

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.400
 lost deposits theme of boston and 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.650
 we also have about what he thinks 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.660
 about the family rivera blogs so 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.120
 later , the moment of the 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.560
 great premiere of the video something 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.560
