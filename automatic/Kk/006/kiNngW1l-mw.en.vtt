the cage
and<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:13.080> know<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.290> slowly<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.740> used<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.010> each

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
and you know and slowly get used to each

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.260 
and you know and slowly get used to each
other<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.430> then<00:02:14.550> after<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.850> couple<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.210> days

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
other and then after a couple of days

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.390 
other and then after a couple of days
there<00:02:15.630> will<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.900> out<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.980> rest<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
there will be out in the rest of the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.570 
there will be out in the rest of the
population<00:02:18.110> with<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> fiv<00:02:19.560> cats<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
population with the fiv cats and you

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.730 
population with the fiv cats and you
should<00:02:20.790> only<00:02:20.940> keep<00:02:21.300> them<00:02:21.570> with<00:02:21.780> other<00:02:22.050> FIV

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
should only keep them with other FIV

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.920 
should only keep them with other FIV
positives<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.790> their<00:02:23.940> own<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.300> course<00:02:24.330> and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
positives are on their own of course and

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
positives are on their own of course and
because<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.920> be<00:02:26.160> transmitted<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
because it can be transmitted and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.630 
because it can be transmitted and
usually<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.350> way<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> transmit<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.160> is<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
usually the way to transmit it is to a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.170 
usually the way to transmit it is to a
deep<00:02:30.120> bite<00:02:30.390> wound<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.820> always<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
deep bite wound and so it's always a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.540 
deep bite wound and so it's always a
good<00:02:33.360> idea<00:02:33.420> just<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.500> fiv<00:02:34.830> s<00:02:35.010> or<00:02:35.280> have

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
good idea just to have the fiv s or have

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:53.500 
good idea just to have the fiv s or have
them<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> single<00:02:36.600> cats
