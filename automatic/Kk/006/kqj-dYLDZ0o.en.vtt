00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
a great story I was being told from the
day<00:01:49.020> he<00:01:49.200> went<00:01:49.349> to<00:01:49.530> Miami<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:49.950> 2010<00:01:50.670> he<00:01:51.119> might<00:01:51.420> go

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
day he went to Miami in 2010 he might go

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.650 
day he went to Miami in 2010 he might go
back<00:01:51.959> don't<00:01:52.349> count<00:01:52.619> rule<00:01:53.220> out<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.429> return<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
back don't count rule out a return and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.300 
back don't count rule out a return and
here<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.989> is<00:01:55.110> he<00:01:55.440> said<00:01:55.679> in<00:01:55.800> an<00:01:55.920> interview<00:01:56.009> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
here it is he said in an interview I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
here it is he said in an interview I
think<00:01:56.429> it<00:01:56.640> was<00:01:56.729> 2012

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
think it was 2012

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.570 
think it was 2012
and<00:01:57.929> that's<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.590> Cleveland<00:01:58.979> first<00:01:59.220> started

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
and that's when Cleveland first started

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.699 
and that's when Cleveland first started
thinking<00:01:59.700> about<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.179> possibility<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
thinking about the possibility of a

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.650 
thinking about the possibility of a
comeback<00:02:02.069> he<00:02:02.640> said<00:02:02.849> something<00:02:03.270> along<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
comeback he said something along the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.520 
comeback he said something along the
lines<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.520> what<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.550> story<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.209> be<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.690> he

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
lines of what a story it would be if he

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.900 
lines of what a story it would be if he
goes<00:02:07.679> back<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> Cleveland<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.610> story

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
goes back to Cleveland and that story

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.029 
goes back to Cleveland and that story
has<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.330> come<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> fruition<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.560> challenge

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
has come come to fruition that challenge

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.710 
has come come to fruition that challenge
he<00:02:11.129> talks<00:02:11.370> about<00:02:11.489> there<00:02:11.819> that's<00:02:12.360> what<00:02:12.690> I

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
he talks about there that's what I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.210 
he talks about there that's what I
thought<00:02:13.020> was<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.500> keep<00:02:13.770> him<00:02:14.010> in

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
thought was going to keep him in

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.580 
thought was going to keep him in
Cleveland<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.850> 2010<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.720> mean<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.110> think<00:02:16.170> if

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
Cleveland in 2010 I I mean I think if

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.670 
Cleveland in 2010 I I mean I think if
you<00:02:17.070> grow<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.820> in<00:02:18.210> Ohio
