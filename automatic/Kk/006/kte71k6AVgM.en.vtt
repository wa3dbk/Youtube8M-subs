00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.189
 tram-pam-pa hello in touch 147 and in 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 this video tutorial I will tell you how 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.740
 start the engine VAZ 2115 very 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.789
 we have a hard frost 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 somewhere -37 degrees 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 i'm in the city ​​of suckers and that means 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.250
 together with me on in the speakers 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.790
 Moscow hit radio bit sounds and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.320
 columbia pictures presents 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.450
 so means to start us engine 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.239
 frost need to have in your box 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.579
 gears at least at least was flooded 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 semi synthetic engine synthetic 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 only necessarily candles new well and 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.750
 charged battery squeeze 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:01:02.789
 clutch 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:01:05.820
 squeeze the clutch insert the key in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.140
 Ignition switch a little tweak to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:19.770
 we were disappointed under sucked like a fuel 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:22.130
 then one more time and try to start it as 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.130
 heavy 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 again in this engine and it is a little bit 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.850
 converted to sports 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.850
 there is a lightweight piston group 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.150
 colleagues lightened crankshaft to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:45.540
 he could frost come back through 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.540
 stiffened engine oil 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.050
 he so well what does it mean if you for example 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.620
 will be flooded 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.300
 purely synthetic in the engine did not sleep 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.550
 unsportsmanlike how are you engine not 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.180
 made such an ordinary factory 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.430
 regular engine synthetics engines 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.259
 semi-synthetics in the box then I think in 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.380
 thirty- five you will start us 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.420
 minus 37 so for such up 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.200
 temperature then the car started it up 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 huge result done again 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.150
 general engine specifically for 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.590
 to wind up such huge Moros y 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.580
 we are almost never 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:40.780
 heat in the city suckers therefore fuel 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.780
 I don't have much luck
