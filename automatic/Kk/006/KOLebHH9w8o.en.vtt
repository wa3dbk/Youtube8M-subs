 let's go consume in our time of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
 enough 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.970
 meaty that gives us energy replenish 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 calories or those of us who are 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 missing but at the same time 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.859
 contribute to our organism not 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.149
 suffer health problems 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.890
 it is generally thought that in the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.600
 lunch time you can consume one 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.670
 large amount of carbohydrates and fats 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.920
 saturated since you're going to spend your 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.739
 energies either in your work or in 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.960
 everyday activities this is not very 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.000
 convenient since you give your body 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 a choice of saturated fat food 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.110
 and carbohydrates more than providing you 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 all the energy that is making you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.789
 lack will come to saturate your organism 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.620
 will make your metabolism slow down and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.329
 it will not give you the energies you would get 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.270
 If you had opted for a true 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.979
 healthy lunch some attribute the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.659
 little importance that you give to make a 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.579
 healthy lunch to lack of time 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.560
 who have live in a fast-paced world 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.390
 it has also come to impact our 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.950
 meal times 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.780
 It would seem that sitting at the table 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
 enjoy a good bowl of soup with 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.009
 vegetables or a succulent pasta with tuna 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.409
 made at home is something impossible to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.939
 achieve and it is easier to feed 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.770
 with a hamburger bought in the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.569
 window of some establishment of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.189
 fast food because you can eat it 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.039
 while you are driving or while 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.599
 return to your job optar 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.909
 for the food that will constitute 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:38.159
 your healthy lunch is not difficult 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.110
 but first you must remove from your mind 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.619
 that healthy eating means forgetting about 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 eat delicious and delicious because it's not like that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.099
 It is important that your healthy lunch 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.849
 It consists of foods rich in 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.739
 vitamins legumes vegetables and vegetables 

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:54.719
 and integrate with them some type of meat 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.310
 that gives you the necessary energies and 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.500
 that everything you eat in them is 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 varied is to say that do not do of the fact 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.399
 of eating pasta a daily habit because 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.679
 you would be giving your body alone 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.390
 carbohydrates at lunch but that 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.429
 You can incorporate a variety of 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.649
 meals and recipes so you do not find 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.390
 tedious or monotonous eating them 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.390
 same things at lunch
