00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
and I noticed on on this circuit is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.200 
and I noticed on on this circuit is
quite<00:01:48.450> fast<00:01:48.720> circuit<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.910> lots<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.000> really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
quite fast circuit with lots of really

quite fast circuit with lots of really
really<00:01:51.420> fast<00:01:51.810> corners<00:01:52.289> but<00:01:52.860> also<00:01:53.009> today<00:01:53.729> we've

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
really fast corners but also today we've

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.240 
really fast corners but also today we've
had<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:55.070> ride<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> version<00:01:56.910> with<00:01:57.179> a<00:01:58.190> couple<00:01:59.190> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really tiny kinds first game chicanes

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
really tiny kinds first game chicanes
and<00:02:02.090> they<00:02:03.090> sort<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.300> disturbed<00:02:03.720> my<00:02:03.929> riding<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
and they sort of disturbed my riding a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.900 
and they sort of disturbed my riding a
bit<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> first<00:02:04.860> session<00:02:05.099> but<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.550> such<00:02:05.789> as

Brembo rad deal caliper and it's also

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.770 
Brembo rad deal caliper and it's also
very<00:02:20.650> light<00:02:20.980> bike<00:02:21.189> so<00:02:21.430> so<00:02:22.360> I've<00:02:22.450> been<00:02:22.540> able<00:02:22.659> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
very light bike so so I've been able to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.380 
very light bike so so I've been able to
break<00:02:23.079> you<00:02:23.379> know<00:02:23.760> later<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.060> later<00:02:25.150> and

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
break you know later and later and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.839 
break you know later and later and
probably<00:02:26.079> still<00:02:26.439> not<00:02:26.650> light<00:02:26.829> enough<00:02:26.860> for<00:02:27.340> what

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
probably still not light enough for what

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.790 
probably still not light enough for what
this<00:02:27.970> bike<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.329> capable<00:02:28.689> of<00:02:28.750> doing

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.730
