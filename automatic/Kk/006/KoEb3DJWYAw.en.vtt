00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.990 
assume let's go off the point that ghost
only<00:03:34.590> hides<00:03:34.950> people<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.459> are<00:03:35.579> moving<00:03:35.880> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
only hides people that are moving and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.569 
only hides people that are moving and
not<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.959> Ghost<00:03:37.290> hides<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.829> from<00:03:37.860> this<00:03:38.280> but

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
not that Ghost hides you from this but

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.509 
not that Ghost hides you from this but
not<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.540> goes<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.530> used<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.280> but

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
not that and goes to used to do this but

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.860 
not that and goes to used to do this but
now<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.820> doesn't<00:03:42.150> do<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.359> let's<00:03:42.600> assume

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
now it doesn't do that let's assume

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.229 
now it doesn't do that let's assume
ghost<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.620> exact<00:03:44.130> same<00:03:44.549> from<00:03:45.000> call<00:03:45.209> of

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
that ghost only is effective when you

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
I I don't know a ghost was pretty damn

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.729 
I I don't know a ghost was pretty damn

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
duty black ops and I'm not sure that

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.650 
duty black ops and I'm not sure that
strictly<00:04:07.799> saying<00:04:08.220> okay<00:04:08.880> well<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.390> you're

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660

strictly saying okay well if you're
moving<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.200> works<00:04:10.410> but<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:10.739> you're<00:04:10.920> not<00:04:11.040> moving

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
moving it works but if you're not moving

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.069 
moving it works but if you're not moving
it<00:04:11.579> doesn't<00:04:11.970> because<00:04:12.299> here's<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.959> thing

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
it doesn't because here's the thing

because I thought about this for a long

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.729 
because I thought about this for a long
time<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:15.090> terms<00:04:15.239> of<00:04:15.390> countering<00:04:15.870> ghost<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.320> in
