00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.469
 from the name of mr no lag or so for the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.759
 little story but on our lips 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.300
 it's me or less like that things 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.190
 are said 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.630
 for this first podcast I decided to 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 tell you about the darwin awards to white 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.630
 the darwin awards what is it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
 it's a little reward 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.930
 sarcastic it must be recognized 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820
 awarded to earlier dead people 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.740
 following a behavior completely con 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.029
 even downright stupid and they are 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.340
 thanked and here I quote our friend 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.689
 wikipedia to have contributed to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.610
 the overall improvement of the heritage 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.780
 human 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.520
 yes these people are part of the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.719
 heritage of unesco a fault h of 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.280
 mouth yes a little bit 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.239
 basically if you find a little con 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 because sometimes it happens that you 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.180
 do things completely stupid 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.890
 know that there is always more when the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 roof is watching this podcast and you will be 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.469
 totally reassured yes the challenge tents 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.520
 for the dead who arrives is not for 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.450
 me ungulate species I saw you deny 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.450
 do not be smart, you're going to die 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.010
 refined this office or so nothing but my 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.540
 notice you already feel who has stuff not 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.070
 put this post there in fact the 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.450
 bubbles that does not sound to linda life 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.740
 huh it seems rather come we're gonna get the 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.640
 stick before committing suicide in class and 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.750
 yet it's not a city ​​at all 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 which is in germany and poland 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.450
 or even in Eastern Europe 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.680
 no no it's a city that's on 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.420
 the small island of saint martin in the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 antilles yes so for the little 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.180
 anecdote it's a life that was founded 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.970
 by john philip a dutch 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.810
 finally the Dutch capital Scottish 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.680
 the navy of the Netherlands which has 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.740
 installed in saint martin in the 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.020
 antilles yes it is possible but I rent 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.920
 a john phillips son ben hur the guy who 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.540
 gave the city its name 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.070
 you see a little melon of the type already 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.270
 short did not have the stories but already 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.920
 it tickles a little history of the guy 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.600
 the guy he lives in philippe burdy part 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.740
 with a hell of a handicap eh ben dit you 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.240
 that over there the guy who had all 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.860
 done fatally by swallowing a support 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 throat of a stripper he was trying 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.390
 to remove with his teeth this is a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.560
 bra 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.090
 I reassure you it's not good how 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.690
 can we really swallow this kind of 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.160
 things 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.240
 the guy he has a mental disability that's 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.690
 not possible otherwise he must have a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.950
 problem 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.509
 or he knows them but as 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.740
 never mind ingbert we find at 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.880
 phyllis goal is not surprising that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.440
 makes murge mouth before getting 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.940
 to commit suicide is a little the principle of 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.410
 city ​​what but from there to vallet a 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.670
 bra still a dude the test of 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.290
 this is noticeable is the guy 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.580
 it's john philip he did not have enough 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.780
 for giving his name to the city he has 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.850
 also wanted to have the most stupid mans 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 of the frozen continent russia finally man 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 all that is a hypothesis but that 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.340
 would be super cool anyway even two a 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.019
 employed in a dairy heard 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 that flatulence reels was in 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.860
 large part made of metal and so 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.250
 potentially explosive how they 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 say and still make the cow fart 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.180
 methane compound is one of the gases to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.620
 most harmful greenhouse effect 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 taking his courage with both hands he 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.890
 then cracked by the meter near a credit 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.970
 of cow only in call for air sucks 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.980
 to the flame in the bowels of 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.390
 the animal the exploded beast killing a 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.160
 employed on the spot struck by a 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.269
 finish flying so that you see in 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.709
 impossible investigations of stone 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.870
 bellemare servette totally his place 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.400
 the guy he's going to make videos like we've 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.540
 could see tons with a human p 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.820
 a match except that he said to himself 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.260
 I'm going to do that with Lynch waiting for that 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.519
 never been done on youtube french i 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.870
 am going to make mixes you you 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.160
 just imagine the name to admit that he has 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.870
 cracked before that eventually a 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.069
 cow wants well unleashed a kind and 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.840
 I liked it 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.189
 the belief the guy he wanted everything 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.349
 that to finish transferred by the nurse 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.819
 flying all this for science on 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.819
 notice a funeral that does not fit 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.139
 robert left too early lack in 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.459
 trying to understand how 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 was working the tarpaulins kill 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.209
 it has unfortunately suffered 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.769
 consequences a sad day for the 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.019
 family of the deceased and for washing who 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.969
 did not ask anyone 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.189
 what a 39 year old notary named scrubland 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.810
 fell from a 24th floor in the building 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.519
 by showing the strength of the windows to 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.049
 future buyers are shoulder elbows 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.329
 broke the window he passed workers 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.739
 so there stupidity level I think we 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.819
 reached nirvana it's not doc 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.980
 gynecologist who will say otherwise 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.060
 there is always this guy the guy he 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.859
 was sure he was not scared 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.209
 since sweat saschiz but even in 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.620
 being the guy most thoroughly his meaning 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.239
 tactical we come to think of being able to 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.650
 dark in the glass here we are to do 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.669
 the shoe of attention is not very 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.930
 top of which the Chinese author 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.699
 nannan insulated double glazing 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.799
 reinforced by a thickness of m of gas 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.239
 I can certify it you have 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.829
 deal with the rolls of the window is 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.299
 by the way to prove it to you I'm going 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.530
 to plunge into the window ah no no you 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.269
 you do not have to give me an advice 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.349
 speech 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.349
 watch out I know my job 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.750
 sir bombay ok I'll take it 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.340
 because he left too early dead in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.169
 testing the strength of a window to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.299
 double glazing with reinforced insulation by 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.669
 a thickness of gas soul some 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.139
 will say that he committed suicide 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.040
 others will simply say that he 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.979
 was very happy 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.239
 end of quote fourth post hiller 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:18.799
 and his wife gets bored on board 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.000
 their car at 2 am to 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.590
 kill the time they decided then 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.610
 of aline and a stick that limits the throw 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.199
 through the window to see what that 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.220
 did apparently they did not 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.630
 noticed that the windows of the car 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.039
 was closed when they launched the 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.570
 stick so there it is interesting to 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.949
 notice two things firstly he 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.599
 was bored then they wanted to throw it 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.710
 a dinner stick but I want to tell you but 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.120
 of course but like everyone who 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.169
 never thought of throwing a stick of 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.250
 dynamite through the window that was guarding 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.229
 preciously in his car in case 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.250
 of total boredom at 2 o'clock in the morning there 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.030
 who play ping pong has 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.080
 others who launch boats 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.310
 dynamic I do not see the problem I 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.810
 do this all the time and secondly 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.220
 they did not notice that the windows of 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.630
 mature strong terms they will have 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.950
 so how will that be concretely? 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.360
 happens and what they got the stick 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.380
 dynamics watched for a moment the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.370
 city ​​to find out if it was open 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.690
 he was so obsessed with 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.250
 the spark of the dynamics that they in 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.050
 forget to look at the trash window 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.920
 is awesome it's place they have you 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.490
 believe that if I get the price of an ass 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.510
 of a cow braked in the flames 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.320
 is it really possible can we 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.030
 really go further in the 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.470
 twenty-five already there we have a nice name 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.450
 who announces something good but 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.920
 month of madness it smells like 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.360
 22 year old barman who was 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.130
 cruelly shot by a gangster 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.170
 yes so sorry here I do not have his first name 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.910
 he wanted to remain anonymous brief this 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.530
 22 year old barman was shot for 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.070
 have gotten rid of the glass too early 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.810
 consumer 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.820
 the gangster we were so irritated 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.590
 which obliged the bartender to have 25 liters 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.060
 of coca cola ass dry what was it 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.500
 obviously fatal you see a little 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.700
 little pressure from sick Thursday a 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.780
 moment given the gangster he could have 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.010
 kill in many different ways 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.850
 but instead of that the guy telling him you 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.530
 go boxes of coca cola and you will die 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.270
 Yes 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.580
 yeah not terrible tortured because 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.780
 I was missing the idea actually yeah I like
