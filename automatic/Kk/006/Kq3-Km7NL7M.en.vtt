00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.610
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.290
 you are today I bring you a magnificent 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.410
 application that would try that when 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.720
 you're connected to your favorite Wi-Fi network or 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.360
 specific as the work or the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.190
 home because 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.130
 when we block 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.720
 and unlocked because right now we 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.280
 ask for the unlock pattern because no 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.040
 we have the application activated but 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.440
 let's activate the application we put the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.700
 specific network in favorites by clicking on 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.100
 the little star and now we are going to block and 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.650
 unlock and do not ask us for any class 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.530
 of key is not does not ask us the boss 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.320
 as before this application is too 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.460
 useful for when you're at home is this 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.800
 time with the ipad mobile when unlocking and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.430
 all the time I would ask you for the password and 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.860
 It is very very very very roll is so long 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.530
 putting the pattern in change when 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.120
 you are at a friend's house or an acquaintance 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.490
 you know you can do 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.710
 putada to catch of the mobile to write you 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.020
 nonsense out there or looking at you things that you do not 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.729
 you want them to look so it's very useful 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.890
 because automatically he would put the 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 pattern when you are out of what 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.290
 is the favorite Wi-Fi network you've put 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.049
 for example you are at your girl's house or 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.710
 of your girlfriend or just your wife 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.630
 Well, I would also pick up the Wi-Fi network 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.940
 would appear here below and you would give 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.540
 favorites and so every time you go to your 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.540
 home then 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.630
 I would not ask the boss or just in 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.240
 the work shows you what would be the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.760
 your work or office network or from 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.200
 where you work the brand is as favorite 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.960
 and so you do not have to be all time 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.120
 putting the pattern also when by 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.030
 example you are at home and you have 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.110
 applied the application for the wifi of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.479
 your house but you have mounted a small 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.400
 party or something so lest you 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.590
 take the phone and you start doing 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.460
 nonsense simply because the marks of 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.860
 favorites and they would be the locks what 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.500
 you unlock and the pattern 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.880
 what friends this application is very useful 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.550
 so I hope the download that is 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 totally free try it and the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.490
