the way down because there's another
button<00:01:05.939> too<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.810> hard<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> show<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.280 
Logan it goes high but when you tie it
it's<00:01:17.119> easier<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.360> tell<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> high<00:01:19.049> low

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290

green and I thought it went well with
the<00:02:06.259> outfit<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.770> colors<00:02:08.099> actually

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the outfit because the colors actually

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.850 
the outfit because the colors actually
kind<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.789> match<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.239> I'm<00:02:09.360> wearing<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.679> got
