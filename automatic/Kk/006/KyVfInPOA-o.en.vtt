00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.319
 I love 1000 ps fans I'm here 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.179
 the egg times in italy big motorcycle 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.030
 fair but accessories must not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.219
 missing beside me the rethemer one in 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 Austria takes both of us there too 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.480
 stand here before the fashion small 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.369
 entry- level motorcycle that her killer moderately 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.840
 had rises must tell you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 especially on the tongue parts on the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.170
 We only have seven earned 07 jobs 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 to change the face in front 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.899
 an aluminum block house milled 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.670
 comparatively manufactured upper part just 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.410
 the motorcycle from the front also one 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.840
 to give a more aggressive look 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.879
 on this motorcycle we have now 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.620
 especially the very small flashing so 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.660
 very small views mounted the new 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.670
 series already presented in linz 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.520
 He has not been there yet by motorcycle 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 We were shown from our side 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.350
 then combined with the substantial 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 blogs we originally pry for 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.670
 supersport motorcycles have been designed 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 but of course on the street wanted gas 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 give something on it too 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 So we also have these levers suitable 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.619
 made for the motorcycle and of course 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.770
 also a cfd accessory for the motorcycle 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.290
 then Hammer has created it 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 wonderful for me and will offer 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 of course, the rear a little 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.590
 embellished and all this 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.430
 Crane dismantled and a tender 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.320
 license plate holder also with the small ones 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.909
 turn signal mounted so small 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.710
 Crane boom more in the back 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.900
 So I find the work in the model 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.780
 for that an entry-level motorcycle 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 is or should be 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.840
 super sporty parts on it looks 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.189

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.850
