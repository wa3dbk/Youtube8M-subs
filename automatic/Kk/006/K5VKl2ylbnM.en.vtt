00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
fire retardant material it's also

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.510 
fire retardant material it's also
Dedinje<00:04:10.810> materials<00:04:11.230> well<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:12.040> event<00:04:12.400> that

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
Dedinje materials well it event that

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.670 
Dedinje materials well it event that
this<00:04:12.610> would<00:04:12.820> ever<00:04:13.030> catch<00:04:13.240> on<00:04:13.420> fire<00:04:13.660> here<00:04:14.020> these

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
this would ever catch on fire here these

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.949 
this would ever catch on fire here these
plastic<00:04:15.160> brackets<00:04:15.640> right<00:04:16.120> here<00:04:16.299> would<00:04:16.780> melt

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
plastic brackets right here would melt

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.460 
plastic brackets right here would melt
off<00:04:18.060> this<00:04:19.060> acts<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.570> blanket<00:04:19.750> smother<00:04:20.290> the
