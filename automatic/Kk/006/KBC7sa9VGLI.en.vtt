00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.290
 in the guitar class punto com.co 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.130
 today we are going to work on a police issue 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.869
 roxanne this theme is simple but it has 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.580
 some very interesting things in their 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.869
 voisins that I want us to look at we see 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 different ways of working 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.650
 chords first thing I want that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 Let's work on the introduction verse 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 and verse and let's look at the sequence of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.900
 chords that works on this topic we're going to 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650
 find the following we will find 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 a minor sun chord 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.820
 a first chord and then we have a re 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.350
 less 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.610
 then we have a flat 7 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.930
 we are going to find a smaller one ' 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.390
 C minor 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.180
 we have a curious chord that are fake 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.180
 four and one sun 724 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.260
 that will be the harmony is the put in 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.030
 a term to say it so basic harmony 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.140
 this song I want us to look and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.640
 let's analyze the boeing that are 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.680
 really using them all the 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.909
 precisely here we have a 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.649
 first chord one sun minor sun minor 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.280
 and this today are where it comes from 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:21.130
 they simply worked with complete 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.409
 only the fourth door but it's 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.770
 possible to find the types of chords 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.000
 looking for different voisin this is something 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.409
 simple 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.599
 in the next chord we have a re 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.079
 minor and what we did was annotated is 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.079
 a minor 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.790
 in this position as easy to confuse what 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 known 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.530
 next chords a level 7 in this 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.820
 position would have criticized root in fifth 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.280
 here the difference but of no 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.310
 now our next cut of the re - 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.020
 let's take now here is 30 and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
 change the position of your first minor 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.100
 of finding here we are going to find 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.399
 in this it comes with bass in which it is 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.909
 inverted too 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.439
 then we have C minor under the sun in 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.030
 position of the previous court those two 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.900
 positions come from the root chords in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.900
 fifth minor 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.299
 we are the under we invest them that have 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.380
 inverted our last chord is a fa 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.720
 its four 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.720
 and we finish with only seven his four 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.069
 here is interesting in these songs 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.780
 So much is not only we have two things 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.239
 particularly chÃ©veres that demonstrate 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 the quality of policies bones that I am 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.870
 in my company they were so successful they are 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.430
 very smart people to make music 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.900
 but that everything found something 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.230
 particular this last chord that I 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.230
 love 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.160
 make a his four to make a cut 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.080
 on the tonic chord on the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.780
 interesting first grade record that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.160
 sounds in a second those who have already 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.600
 studied something scales they know that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.110
 finally when we work on scales 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.180
 minors the fifth degree appears greater is 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.230
 the most normal thing if we are in G minor 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.480
 more logical would be that I agreed 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.010
 reappears higher in this song not 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.660
 this song is completely manners 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.930
 only wind so to speak and 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.330
 we found a bent minus two 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.920
 times that appear less appears 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.240
 these are two things you want that has 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.000
 this song apart the pockets that 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.320
 use as guitarists you can 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.550
 use when they are at the level of 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.250
 band can use investments 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.350
 quietly that they get those achieve 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.060
 investments different sounds but 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.110
 we could address a minor re seven one 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 you have to give them an example 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.290
 studying investments is always 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.290
 Useful 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.620
 that can be done on all 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.600
 groups of strings sixth fifth string and 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.180
 fourth string and it generates us different 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.190
 sonorities and the chord does not remain 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.980
 inverted within the band if the bass 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.690
 is making a note above 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.400
 in a band the bassist is the one who has 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.260
 the power to invest a chord 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.700
 completely in a song that if not 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.290
 causes the bassist to touch any of the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.690
 notes of the chord different from the tonic 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.100
 the whole chord is reversed in the band 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.690
 us as guitarists or the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.070
 pianists can also do it can 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.600
 be investments different provisions 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.370
 of the chords to find different 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.229
 effects if the bass is doing well 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.540
 downing we are in fundamental 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:29.220
 we are always playing the chord 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.750
 literally as it should be and it works 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.030
 very good is a very good trick this is what 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.889
 I recommend as for the rhythm here the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.760
 rhythm because if it is really very easy they are 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.760
 four blacks 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.180
 you already know like the rest of the nation 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.569
 we are now with the next part that 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.569
 it is the choir 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.870
 well we continue the chorus of this song 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.849
 It is one of the most ironic things that I 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.139
 I've heard it, because after 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:11.910
 have done all that amount of voicing 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.710
 nice here our guitarist was passed 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.970
 to be power corts 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.970
 it's interesting 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.740
 do not 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.900
 On the 7th let's see what is happening 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.900
 here we start with sun 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.370
 then I see myself in many tablatures 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.700
 even an original table the 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.700
 police 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:10.560
 it's a little bit darker if you 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:13.260
 feels more like working perfectly 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.190
 a sortu 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.190
 he has not died 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.480
 or not 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.630
 these are the two figures that this 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.460
 song working is a very good subject and 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.690
 I suggest to me particularly in 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.150
 I like polis a lot of work 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.980
 drummer this guy with a very style 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.010
 very very interesting it is recommended that 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.750
 I check it and personally sting very great 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.370
 music then nothing guys are still 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.630
 looking here the channel welcome 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.590
 anything that the comment already 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.690
 you know this space is yours 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.160
 any question and see you the 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.450
 next week with the technical team 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.900
 have a very interesting choice 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.900
 the other week
