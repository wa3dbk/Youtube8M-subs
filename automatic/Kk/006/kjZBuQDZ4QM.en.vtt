00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
muscles then chances of injury become

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.789 
muscles then chances of injury become
extremely<00:01:15.760> high<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:17.049> way<00:01:17.200> this<00:01:17.409> exercise

it fully now if you lifting very heavy
weight<00:01:39.640> that's<00:01:39.820> going<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.120> put<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.300> lot<00:01:40.480> of

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
weight that's going to put a lot of

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.330 
weight that's going to put a lot of
pressure<00:01:40.780> onto<00:01:41.200> your<00:01:41.650> tendons<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.070> ligaments

around<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.670> shoulder<00:01:42.940> region<00:01:43.090> thereby

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
around the shoulder region thereby

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.640 
around the shoulder region thereby
increasing<00:01:45.070> chances<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:46.120> shoulder<00:01:46.840> injury<00:01:47.080> so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
increasing chances of shoulder injury so

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.230 
increasing chances of shoulder injury so
you<00:01:47.710> have<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> be<00:01:48.040> very<00:01:48.280> careful<00:01:48.790> while
