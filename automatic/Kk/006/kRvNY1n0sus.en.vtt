00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.150 
free motion quilting can be done on this

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.300 
free motion quilting can be done on this
machine<00:00:04.360> with<00:00:04.750> a<00:00:04.780> breeze<00:00:05.170> now<00:00:05.590> the<00:00:05.950> foot<00:00:06.220> that

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.310 
machine with a breeze now the foot that

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.360 
machine with a breeze now the foot that
comes<00:00:06.490> with<00:00:06.820> it<00:00:07.060> is<00:00:07.270> what<00:00:08.139> letter<00:00:08.590> R<00:00:08.950> which

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
comes with it is what letter R which

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.669 
comes with it is what letter R which
works<00:00:09.669> okay<00:00:10.269> but<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.990> foot<00:00:11.320> that<00:00:11.469> you'll

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
going to get into a free motion quilting

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.120 
going to get into a free motion quilting
quite<00:00:15.429> a<00:00:15.459> bit<00:00:15.759> is<00:00:16.030> the<00:00:16.480> open<00:00:16.990> toe<00:00:17.260> free<00:00:17.830> motion

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
quite a bit is the open toe free motion

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.490 
quite a bit is the open toe free motion
spring<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:19.210> foot<00:00:19.539> and<00:00:19.779> that<00:00:19.840> one<00:00:20.349> will

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
spring the foot and that one will

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.050 
spring the foot and that one will
actually<00:00:20.679> screw<00:00:21.189> into<00:00:21.369> the<00:00:21.640> side<00:00:21.849> of<00:00:22.000> the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
actually screw into the side of the

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.910 
actually screw into the side of the
machine<00:00:22.359> so<00:00:22.480> I'm<00:00:22.570> going<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:22.750> show<00:00:22.900> you<00:00:22.960> both<00:00:23.259> so

that you have kind of a little vertical
part<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.630> foot<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.289> place<00:00:29.500> where<00:00:29.740> it

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
part of the foot and the place where it

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.130 
part of the foot and the place where it
sticks<00:00:30.039> on<00:00:30.220> this<00:00:30.759> vertical<00:00:30.970> part<00:00:31.509> part<00:00:31.839> does

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
sticks on this vertical part part does

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.290 
sticks on this vertical part part does
need<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.349> sit<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:32.830> front<00:00:33.160> of<00:00:33.490> the<00:00:33.760> white<00:00:33.969> ankle

here's a little bit of a quick how-to
free<00:01:00.519> motion<00:01:00.699> quilt<00:01:01.210> so<00:01:01.809> go<00:01:01.989> ahead<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.170> and<00:01:02.469> as

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
free motion quilt so go ahead and and as

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.979 
free motion quilt so go ahead and and as
you<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.429> it's<00:01:04.120> gonna<00:01:04.300> go<00:01:04.510> ahead<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.720> take<00:01:04.930> a

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
you so it's gonna go ahead and take a

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.890 
you so it's gonna go ahead and take a
few<00:01:05.080> stitches<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.340> as<00:01:06.490> soon<00:01:06.790> as<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.240> move<00:01:07.630> the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
few stitches but as soon as you move the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.560 
few stitches but as soon as you move the
fabric<00:01:08.200> you<00:01:08.950> need<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.400> kind<00:01:09.640> of<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.850> in<00:01:09.880> control

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
fabric you need to kind of be in control

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.380 
fabric you need to kind of be in control
of<00:01:10.900> how<00:01:11.530> fast<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.159> move<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.520> so<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.850> get<00:01:13.090> nice

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
of how fast you move it so you get nice

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.050 
of how fast you move it so you get nice
even<00:01:13.659> stitches<00:01:14.350> set<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> Machine<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:15.939> the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
even stitches set the Machine so the

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.999 
even stitches set the Machine so the
needle<00:01:16.330> stops<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.900> down<00:01:16.930> position<00:01:17.439> and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
needle stops in the down position and

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.280 
needle stops in the down position and
utilize<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.090> speed<00:01:19.450> control<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.170> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
utilize this speed control of the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.960 
utilize this speed control of the
machine<00:01:20.619> so<00:01:20.829> you<00:01:20.860> can<00:01:21.100> actually<00:01:21.340> maybe<00:01:21.729> reduce

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
machine so you can actually maybe reduce

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.450 
machine so you can actually maybe reduce
it<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.479> maybe<00:01:22.630> half<00:01:22.960> way<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.100> means<00:01:24.340> as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
it to maybe half way so that means as

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.810 
it to maybe half way so that means as
you<00:01:24.490> step<00:01:24.850> on<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.090> foot<00:01:25.119> control<00:01:25.299> full<00:01:26.020> speed

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you step on the foot control full speed

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.090 
you step on the foot control full speed
it's<00:01:27.820> not<00:01:28.150> as<00:01:28.390> full<00:01:28.810> speed<00:01:29.200> as<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.530> could<00:01:29.860> be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
it's not as full speed as it could be

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.050 
it's not as full speed as it could be
and<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.880> start<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.299> match<00:01:31.540> your<00:01:31.930> hands<00:01:33.060> to

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
and you can start to match your hands to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.300 
and you can start to match your hands to
the<00:01:34.210> speed<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.810> needle<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.649> start<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.159> get

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
the speed of the needle to start to get

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
the speed of the needle to start to get
some<00:01:36.579> nice<00:01:36.850> even<00:01:37.659> stitches<00:01:38.079> as<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.890> go<00:01:39.070> around

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
some nice even stitches as you go around

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.179 
some nice even stitches as you go around
you<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.570> kind<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.840> see<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.409> foot<00:01:41.890> is

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
you can kind of see that that foot is

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.260 
you can kind of see that that foot is
kind<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.820> just<00:01:43.030> hovering<00:01:43.710> over<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.860> fabric

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
kind of just hovering over the fabric

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.149 
kind of just hovering over the fabric
and<00:01:46.270> then<00:01:46.420> as<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.719> can<00:01:46.899> see<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.860> have<00:01:47.890> a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
and then as you can see that you have a

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.660 
and then as you can see that you have a
nice<00:01:48.490> kind<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.240> working<00:01:50.020> stitch<00:01:50.890> as<00:01:51.189> you<00:01:51.490> go

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
nice kind of working stitch as you go

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.370 
nice kind of working stitch as you go
now<00:01:51.880> if<00:01:52.000> you<00:01:52.060> go<00:01:52.240> too<00:01:52.299> slow<00:01:52.450> you'll<00:01:52.960> get<00:01:53.110> tiny

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
now if you go too slow you'll get tiny

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.050 
now if you go too slow you'll get tiny
stitches<00:01:53.740> if<00:01:54.009> you<00:01:54.100> move<00:01:54.280> too<00:01:54.460> fast<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.939> get

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
stitches if you move too fast you get

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.270 
stitches if you move too fast you get
longer<00:01:55.420> stitches<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.740> isn't<00:01:57.070> something

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
longer stitches so this isn't something

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.679 
longer stitches so this isn't something
that<00:01:57.430> you're<00:01:57.640> going<00:01:57.789> to<00:01:57.880> learn<00:01:58.030> in<00:01:58.390> ten

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
that you're going to learn in ten

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.300 
that you're going to learn in ten
minutes<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.289> is<00:01:59.439> something<00:01:59.799> that<00:01:59.829> every

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
minutes this is something that every

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.160 
minutes this is something that every
time<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.579> sit<00:02:00.880> down<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.180> free<00:02:01.360> motion<00:02:01.539> quilt<00:02:01.960> I

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
time I sit down to free motion quilt I

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.709 
time I sit down to free motion quilt I
get<00:02:02.680> better<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.280> better<00:02:03.820> but<00:02:04.210> without<00:02:04.509> the

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
get better and better but without the

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.569 
get better and better but without the
practice<00:02:05.140> you<00:02:05.350> don't<00:02:05.649> get<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:05.979> accuracy<00:02:06.549> that

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
practice you don't get the accuracy that

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.520 
practice you don't get the accuracy that
you're<00:02:06.850> looking<00:02:07.180> for<00:02:07.420> let<00:02:07.869> me<00:02:08.020> show<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.259> how

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.050 
foot actually kind of bounces and taps
the<00:03:35.140> fabric<00:03:35.650> helping<00:03:36.310> for<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.610> way<00:03:36.880> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the fabric helping for the way the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.880 
the fabric helping for the way the
stitches<00:03:37.450> come<00:03:37.480> together<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:38.350> really<00:03:38.650> a

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
stitches come together and it's really a

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.850 
stitches come together and it's really a
better<00:03:39.820> source<00:03:40.360> instead<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.530> foot

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
better source instead of that foot

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.130 
better source instead of that foot
hovering<00:03:42.550> all<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.300> time<00:03:43.570> you're<00:03:43.780> gonna<00:03:43.870> get<00:03:44.080> a

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
hovering all the time you're gonna get a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.410 
hovering all the time you're gonna get a
better<00:03:44.350> looking<00:03:44.800> stitch<00:03:45.250> alright<00:03:46.090> let's<00:03:46.300> go

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
better looking stitch alright let's go

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.480 
better looking stitch alright let's go
ahead<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.780> take<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.960> look<00:03:47.260> sometimes<00:03:48.160> on<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
ahead and take a look sometimes on the

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.640 
ahead and take a look sometimes on the
back<00:03:48.700> we<00:03:49.030> do<00:03:49.270> need<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.540> adjust<00:03:50.020> the<00:03:50.170> tension<00:03:50.380> a

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
back we do need to adjust the tension a

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.350 
back we do need to adjust the tension a
little<00:03:50.800> bit<00:03:50.950> actually<00:03:51.580> this<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.120> looking

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
little bit actually this is looking

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.720 
little bit actually this is looking
really<00:03:52.660> good<00:03:52.840> here<00:03:53.290> um<00:03:53.800> this<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.430> one<00:03:54.460> we

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
really good here um this is the one we

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.520 
really good here um this is the one we
just<00:03:54.760> did<00:03:55.270> with<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.840> spring<00:03:56.140> action<00:03:56.320> foot

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
just did with the spring action foot

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.190 
just did with the spring action foot
this<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.400> one<00:03:57.610> we<00:03:57.760> did<00:03:57.940> with<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.390> our<00:03:58.750> foot

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
this is the one we did with the our foot

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.110 
this is the one we did with the our foot
earlier<00:03:59.440> now<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:00.490> we're<00:04:00.640> seeing<00:04:00.670> right<00:04:01.060> here

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
earlier now what we're seeing right here

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.790 
earlier now what we're seeing right here
is<00:04:01.360> where<00:04:01.570> you're<00:04:01.690> starting<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.080> see<00:04:02.320> a<00:04:02.530> little

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
is where you're starting to see a little

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.130 
is where you're starting to see a little
bit<00:04:02.920> of<00:04:03.250> some<00:04:03.520> dots<00:04:03.820> getting<00:04:04.600> pulled<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.960> the

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
bit of some dots getting pulled to the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.960 
bit of some dots getting pulled to the
backside<00:04:05.350> where<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:06.010> don't<00:04:06.160> see<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.580> over<00:04:06.940> here

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
backside where we don't see it over here

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.750 
backside where we don't see it over here
so<00:04:07.810> with<00:04:07.990> this<00:04:08.260> case<00:04:08.530> or<00:04:08.830> if<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.220> sometimes<00:04:09.640> we

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
so with this case or if in sometimes we

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.430 
so with this case or if in sometimes we
see<00:04:09.940> more<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.240> it<00:04:10.450> because<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.080> different

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
see more of it because of the different

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.050 
see more of it because of the different
way<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.740> weight<00:04:12.040> of<00:04:12.280> thread<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.700> we're

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
way that weight of thread that we're

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.990 
way that weight of thread that we're
using<00:04:13.270> so<00:04:13.960> on<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.320> screen<00:04:14.710> what<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.040> do<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
using so on the screen what you do is to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.960 
using so on the screen what you do is to
get<00:04:16.180> this<00:04:16.390> to<00:04:16.630> be<00:04:16.840> smoother<00:04:17.590> we're<00:04:17.770> gonna

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
get this to be smoother we're gonna

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.310 
get this to be smoother we're gonna
increase<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.540> higher<00:04:19.840> number<00:04:20.140> of

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
increase go to a higher number of

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.830 
increase go to a higher number of
tension<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:21.609> go<00:04:21.790> ahead<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.030> turn<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.480> up<00:04:22.660> to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
tension so go ahead and turn that up to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.830 
tension so go ahead and turn that up to
like<00:04:23.080> a<00:04:23.110> whole<00:04:23.350> number<00:04:23.590> Plus

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
like a whole number Plus

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.870 
like a whole number Plus
try<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.080> again<00:04:25.230> see<00:04:25.740> how<00:04:25.889> you<00:04:25.949> like<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.610> see

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
try it again see how you like it and see

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.189 
try it again see how you like it and see
if<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.270> eliminate<00:04:27.540> some<00:04:28.020> of<00:04:28.050> those

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
if you can eliminate some of those

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.900 
if you can eliminate some of those
little<00:04:28.470> dots<00:04:28.650> on<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.010> back<00:04:29.160> that's<00:04:29.669> probably

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
little dots on the back that's probably

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.159 
little dots on the back that's probably
the<00:04:30.000> most<00:04:30.120> common<00:04:30.240> thing<00:04:30.720> is<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.050> we're

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
the most common thing is that we're

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.800 
the most common thing is that we're
increasing<00:04:31.919> the<00:04:32.070> top<00:04:32.250> tension<00:04:32.760> when<00:04:33.330> we<00:04:33.570> are

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
increasing the top tension when we are

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.560 
increasing the top tension when we are
using<00:04:34.620> it<00:04:34.770> for<00:04:34.800> free<00:04:35.190> motion<00:04:35.370> quilting<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.150> also

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
using it for free motion quilting I also

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.020 
using it for free motion quilting I also
like<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.169> top<00:04:37.500> stitch<00:04:37.770> needle<00:04:38.160> for<00:04:38.760> that

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
like a top stitch needle for that

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.930 
like a top stitch needle for that
particular<00:04:40.250> technique<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.790> way

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
particular technique and then that way

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.370 
particular technique and then that way
too<00:04:42.000> as<00:04:42.330> I'm<00:04:42.510> going<00:04:42.690> through<00:04:42.960> quilts

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
too as I'm going through quilts

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.080 
too as I'm going through quilts
stitching<00:04:44.130> where<00:04:44.280> I<00:04:44.310> would<00:04:44.639> have<00:04:44.820> a<00:04:44.850> lot<00:04:45.060> of

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
stitching where I would have a lot of

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.689 
stitching where I would have a lot of
intersections<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.199> piecing<00:04:46.620> going<00:04:46.889> on<00:04:47.040> where

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
intersections and piecing going on where

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.460 
intersections and piecing going on where
as<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.880> gets<00:04:48.030> really<00:04:48.330> thick<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:49.020> top<00:04:49.229> stitch

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
as it gets really thick that top stitch

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.710 
as it gets really thick that top stitch
needle<00:04:49.740> will<00:04:49.889> go<00:04:50.010> through<00:04:50.220> it<00:04:50.340> perfectly<00:04:51.090> but

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
needle will go through it perfectly but

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.360 
needle will go through it perfectly but
have<00:04:51.930> fun<00:04:52.169> free<00:04:52.440> motion<00:04:52.590> quilting<00:04:53.070> you've<00:04:53.220> got

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
have fun free motion quilting you've got

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.590 
have fun free motion quilting you've got
a<00:04:53.400> wonderful<00:04:53.699> machine<00:04:54.120> because<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.510> have

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
a wonderful machine because you have

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.719 
a wonderful machine because you have
lots<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:55.050> space<00:04:55.229> and<00:04:55.680> if<00:04:56.010> you<00:04:56.070> do<00:04:56.220> put<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.520> into

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
lots of space and if you do put it into

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.380 
lots of space and if you do put it into
a<00:04:56.760> cabinet<00:04:57.180> you're<00:04:57.330> gonna<00:04:57.419> love<00:04:57.750> it<00:04:57.810> even<00:04:58.110> more
