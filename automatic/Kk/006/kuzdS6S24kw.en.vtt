Bundesliga<00:01:02.699> side<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.650> was<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> very

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Bundesliga side and it was it was a very

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
Bundesliga side and it was it was a very
good<00:01:05.129> team<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:06.000> able<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.479> break<00:01:06.689> him

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
good team but I was able to break him

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.330

long shots off I haven't really done

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.820 
long shots off I haven't really done

power<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:22.950> tried<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.310> see<00:03:23.459> what

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
power and I just tried to see what

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.160 
power and I just tried to see what
they're<00:03:23.730> longshots<00:03:24.180> would<00:03:24.330> be<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.989> this

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
they're longshots would be like and this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.539 
they're longshots would be like and this
wasn't<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> best<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.920> teams<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.340> honest

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
wasn't the best of teams to be honest

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.100 
wasn't the best of teams to be honest
with<00:03:26.610> you<00:03:26.700> guys<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:26.880> put<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> lot<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.420> people<00:03:27.780> just

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
with you guys I put a lot of people just

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.960 
with you guys I put a lot of people just
don't<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.410> fit<00:03:28.680> their<00:03:28.860> position<00:03:29.340> Diego

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
don't really fit their position Diego

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.340 
don't really fit their position Diego
Milito<00:03:30.209> doesn't<00:03:30.750> really<00:03:30.870> fit<00:03:31.170> a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
Milito doesn't really fit a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.979 
Milito doesn't really fit a
centre-forward<00:03:31.680> role<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.420> think<00:03:33.630> both<00:03:33.810> my

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
centre-forward role and I think both my

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.720 
centre-forward role and I think both my
midfielders<00:03:34.440> had<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> high<00:03:34.830> work<00:03:35.280> rate<00:03:35.310> which

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
midfielders had a high work rate which

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.340 
midfielders had a high work rate which
isn't<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> best<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.540> teams<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.989> Jose<00:03:37.230> Enrique

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
isn't the best of teams and Jose Enrique

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.650 
isn't the best of teams and Jose Enrique
probably<00:03:38.160> would<00:03:38.310> play<00:03:38.459> better<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.910> 352<00:03:39.480> but

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
probably would play better in a 352 but

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.449 
probably would play better in a 352 but
we<00:03:39.720> come<00:03:39.840> up<00:03:39.959> against<00:03:40.200> this<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> BPL<00:03:41.250> team

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
we come up against this I a BPL team

we come up against this I a BPL team
four<00:03:41.760> three<00:03:41.970> two<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.180> usually<00:03:43.140> when<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.290> come

four three two one usually when I come

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
up against four three two one teams I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.270 
up against four three two one teams I
can<00:03:45.570> break<00:03:45.810> them<00:03:46.049> down<00:03:46.080> but<00:03:46.470> he<00:03:46.769> had<00:03:46.890> really

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
can break them down but he had really

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280 
can break them down but he had really
really<00:03:47.700> good<00:03:47.910> defense<00:03:48.390> he's<00:03:48.540> gonna<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:48.989> me<00:03:49.140> on

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
really good defense he's gonna get me on

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.840 
really good defense he's gonna get me on
the<00:03:49.320> counter<00:03:49.769> which<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> strength<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
the counter which is the strength of the

the counter which is the strength of the
four<00:03:51.090> three<00:03:51.330> two<00:03:51.540> one<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:51.959> he<00:03:52.500> crosses<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:53.160> in

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
four three two one and he crosses it in

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.610 
four three two one and he crosses it in
but<00:03:53.820> doesn't<00:03:54.269> really<00:03:54.330> get<00:03:54.690> any<00:03:54.870> power<00:03:55.350> on<00:03:55.590> that

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.280 
but doesn't really get any power on that
header<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.280> Reina<00:03:56.910> ends<00:03:57.510> up<00:03:57.690> saving<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.230> one

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290

for<00:03:58.410> us<00:03:58.680> we<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.890> an<00:03:58.980> over-the-top<00:03:59.340> through

for us we get an over-the-top through
ball<00:03:59.880> right<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.120> Milito<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.959> how<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
world that I missed that one I probably

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.199 
world that I missed that one I probably
should<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.860> finessed<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.549> went<00:04:05.760> for<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> power

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
should have finessed it went for a power

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.090 
should have finessed it went for a power
shot<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.989> was<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> mistake<00:04:07.440> try<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:07.950> go

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
shot and that was a mistake try to go

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.520 
shot and that was a mistake try to go
for<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> long<00:04:08.459> shot<00:04:08.640> with<00:04:08.880> Gerard<00:04:09.299> skies<00:04:10.049> way

for a long shot with Gerard skies way
over<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> crossbar<00:04:11.579> probably<00:04:12.239> not<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> best

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
over the crossbar probably not the best

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.210 
over the crossbar probably not the best
of<00:04:12.930> chances<00:04:13.350> there<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.739> was<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> poor

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
of chances there that was a poor

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.770 
of chances there that was a poor
decision<00:04:14.250> taken<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.150> shot<00:04:15.360> but<00:04:15.540> I<00:04:15.600> just

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
decision taken that shot but I just

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.360 
decision taken that shot but I just
wanted<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.260> what<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> shop<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.950> was<00:04:17.130> like
