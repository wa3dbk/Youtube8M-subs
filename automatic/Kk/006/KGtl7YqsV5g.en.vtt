00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.409
 the queens as he titled her community of 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.940
 Thousands of twitters for the first time opened 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.189
 the doors of the family house 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.600
 fails triumph and did it exclusively 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.600
 for the public of a new day 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.619
 first of all thank you for being here 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.979
 you are obviously invited this your home 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.220
 I am also happy to receive you here with 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.830
 my family obviously and so a greeting to 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.840
 all the drivers of this cute 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.790
 program harmonize interests so 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.220
 different as a politician and a 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.649
 actress is not easy victory ruffo and omar 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.740
 Fayad tell us his secret to carry 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.979
 a full and happy life on my part I think 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.580
 that we have many things in common 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.490
 example we do not handle schedules we have 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.950
 schedules rather our work does not 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.950
 has schedules and that complements a 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.679
 little we do not try to accomplish much with the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.860
 family that is definitive to be of 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.409
 give the spaces this to live with 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.260
 the guys to be with them do not 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.210
 they are very interested in politics 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.630
 but I respect her and I've learned to 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.080
 know her and respect the way I think 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.640
 that the secret is the tolerance this 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.800
 example carlos hosts the interview with 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:20.620
 phone and you usually when you know you do not 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.360
 must have it on screen victoria ruffo 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.580
 she has consecrated herself as a brave woman 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.190
 loving and even sacrificed as you 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.770
 mother but in real life she keeps a 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.860
 secret that only his family he knows 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.280
 I can not cook, it's not cooked in some 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.360
 moment of my life I try this one 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 I really liked this my grandmother she 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.400
 He cooked a lot and tried to teach us but 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 the only thing that I managed to learn from her was 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.280
 a this recipe for a corn cake 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.050
 but because it's very easy and it's a dessert 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.000
 what are the actresses that when making a 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.130
 balance of your personal life can 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.740
 talk about gratitude and fullness 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:10.120
 victoria ruffo is one of them very 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.620
 grateful to life because the 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.760
 I truly believe that I have a family 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.640
 wonderful starting with my husband for 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.530
 my children my mother my sisters my 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.650
 friends my work and I think I'm very 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.260
 full and very complete in all entities 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.110
 very grateful to life and to God 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.180
 many actors dream of dying in the 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 scenario but that is not the case 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.880
 victory ruffo 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.640
 I see his side but I would like 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.550
 live in a house or apartment 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.020
 tiny 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:51.150
 and for me but I want to sleep listening and 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.880
 watching the sea and waking up from the same 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.600
 way with my husband I would not like 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.460
 to die on a stage that I do 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.300
 God 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.520
 lets me like my bed or not 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:09.260
 I say die in my sleeping bed 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.260
 so waking up is no longer true 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.500
 then there is this expository 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.600
 He also told us that he is about to act 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 with his son José Eduardo Suarez Suarez 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.310
 gardenia perfume producer is 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.230
 already writing a script for them to 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:31.280
 that soon we can see the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.280
 exclusive theater I loved it
