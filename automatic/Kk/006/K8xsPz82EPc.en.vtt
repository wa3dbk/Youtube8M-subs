00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
song must be sang on its own language

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.570 
song must be sang on its own language
and<00:02:07.879> I<00:02:09.319> asked<00:02:10.319> cuz<00:02:10.500> i<00:02:10.739> also<00:02:10.979> asked<00:02:11.370> myself

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and I asked cuz i also asked myself

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.280 
and I asked cuz i also asked myself
maybe<00:02:12.330> two

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
maybe two

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.220 
maybe two
to<00:02:13.769> sing<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.129> last<00:02:14.310> course<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.879> English<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.170> I

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to sing the last course in English but I

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.009 
to sing the last course in English but I
think<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> will<00:02:16.739> be<00:02:17.569> straight<00:02:18.569> strange

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
think it will be straight strange
