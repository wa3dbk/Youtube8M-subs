side<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.669> road<00:04:13.849> it's<00:04:14.780> not<00:04:14.989> very<00:04:15.169> hard<00:04:15.379> rock

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620

I<00:04:15.769> so<00:04:15.829> it's<00:04:16.099> not<00:04:16.190> like<00:04:16.370> granite

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
I so it's not like granite
