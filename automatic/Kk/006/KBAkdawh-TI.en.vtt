00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
it really softens it up and it really

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.259 
it really softens it up and it really
makes<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.470> quite<00:00:37.710> wouldn't<00:00:38.699> say<00:00:38.760> over<00:00:39.030> sweet

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
but it's um it's very very good and you

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:42.759 
but it's um it's very very good and you
know<00:00:41.699> which<00:00:41.850> with<00:00:42.180> still<00:00:42.479> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.720> of

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
know which with still a lot of

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's basically a 90 proof Jim Beam

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
it's it's rocket fuel so to speak so

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.009 
it's it's rocket fuel so to speak so
it's<00:01:02.729> very<00:01:02.940> interesting<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> something
