00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello everyone in this video I will teach you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.500
 to put the cars to gta vice city 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 that I showed you in the other video have 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.870
 have to download a file that I uploaded to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.610
 megaupload which weighs 600 37 megabytes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.679
 but the weight and the delay are worth it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 since you will not regret it because it will be 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.419
 much more fun the download link 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 I leave you in the description of the video 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.909
 but before they get excited let them 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 I warn you should have at least 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:31.230
 128 megabytes of video card and one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.410
 RAM memory of at least 512 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.300
 megabytes but with indiga it is better if 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.220
 they install without these requirements the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.200
 game will be slow as ever and the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.510
 cars will look white and well 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.270
 streams once they have it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.250
 downloaded they run it but before they 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.410
 I do not recommend anything much to you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.360
 backup of your gta vice city 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.360
 since if they do not they will lose their record 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 once the backup is made, what 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.350
 they extract in the folder where they have the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.310
 game they give install and wait for 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.310
 I finished extracting 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.149
 since I finish extracting they go to the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.369
 gta vice city folder and look for the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.070
 new folder that was not before 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.020
 which is called gta starman last the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.049
 open and search the installer file 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.509
 setup they execute it and they will leave this 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.429
 installation window give you next and 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.340
 They seek the path where you have 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.380
 installed the game but attention if not 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.329
 they choose the path well they do not 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.060
 will give the option of ok to start 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.430
 install the mods since they have the route 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.349
 correct access they give ok and start 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.269
 to be installed but this is a process 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.670
 slow since at this time they are 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.380
 replacing all old textures 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.910
 by new and all cars by 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.260
 complete so wait patiently 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.450
 will appear for a moment that locked 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 because the installation will be stopped by a 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.430
 moment but everything is normal do not close 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.530
 the window for nothing only when I say the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.810
 option to gift only thus close the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.090
 window the time it took me in 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.980
 settle with me was because I cut the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.980
 video to not occupy so much time 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.360
 As I finish, go to the folder where 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.760
 they installed the mods and there will be icons 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.769
 new blacks which are emulators 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.140
 for different games as is the need 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.390
 for speed the starman mode and the one that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.489
 I like which this is not a game is the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.739
 film 'fast and furious' or 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.709
 says in the black icon fast furious you 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.819
 double click and start the game 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.769
 they wait a bit for the 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.500
 options and when they are inside they will see 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.910
 the cars that come out in the movie 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.940
 they can open the emulator that most 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.780
 like this is all we see in the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.780
 next video
