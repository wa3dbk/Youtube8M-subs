00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that it's individually numbered I'm

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.450 
that it's individually numbered I'm
assuming<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.740> gonna<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:55.979> numbered<00:01:56.280> by<00:01:56.399> the

assuming it's gonna be numbered by the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
assuming it's gonna be numbered by the
fact<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.820> there's<00:01:57.030> literally<00:01:57.390> only<00:01:57.659> 5000<00:01:58.350> of
