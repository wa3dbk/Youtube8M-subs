many problems with this the only thing

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.799 
many problems with this the only thing
that<00:00:45.040> might<00:00:45.190> be<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.370> bit<00:00:45.610> dangerous<00:00:45.790> would<00:00:46.660> be

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
that might be a bit dangerous would be

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.270 
that might be a bit dangerous would be
the<00:00:46.899> eye<00:00:46.930> attack<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.770> you're<00:00:47.920> watching

the eye attack that you're watching

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.310 
the eye attack that you're watching
right<00:00:48.430> here<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.570> there<00:00:49.719> is<00:00:49.750> a<00:00:49.809> raid<00:00:50.050> warning

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
right here but there is a raid warning

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.470 
right here but there is a raid warning
coming<00:00:50.770> with<00:00:50.890> it<00:00:51.040> something<00:00:51.550> like<00:00:51.730> ACOTA

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
coming with it something like ACOTA

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.590 
coming with it something like ACOTA
begins<00:00:52.840> to<00:00:52.989> cast<00:00:53.230> eyes<00:00:53.530> off<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.160> guitar<00:00:54.600> then

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
begins to cast eyes off a guitar then

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.510 
begins to cast eyes off a guitar then
there<00:00:56.020> is<00:00:56.110> some<00:00:56.320> rock<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:56.680> RSI<00:00:57.010> action

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
there is some rock with RSI action

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.470 
there is some rock with RSI action
starting<00:00:57.910> to<00:00:58.059> kick<00:00:58.239> in

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.180 

when<00:01:01.480> that<00:01:01.660> happens<00:01:02.080> one<00:01:02.650> of<00:01:02.680> those<00:01:02.920> eyes

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
when that happens one of those eyes

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.520 
when that happens one of those eyes
appear<00:01:03.730> near<00:01:03.940> each<00:01:04.150> player<00:01:04.480> except<00:01:05.199> near<00:01:05.380> the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
appear near each player except near the

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.610 
appear near each player except near the
tanks

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.380 

that's<00:01:09.620> why<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:10.010> gather<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:11.000> we<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.240> get

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's why we gather so that we can get

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.100 
that's why we gather so that we can get
all<00:01:11.600> eyes<00:01:11.960> focused<00:01:12.590> on<00:01:12.940> 1.2<00:01:13.940> then<00:01:14.090> destroy<00:01:14.510> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
all eyes focused on 1.2 then destroy the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.230 
all eyes focused on 1.2 then destroy the
eyes<00:01:15.260> with<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.650> AoE<00:01:15.920> spells<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:16.909> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
eyes with the AoE spells because the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.940 
eyes with the AoE spells because the
eyes<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.659> flicked<00:01:17.869> some<00:01:18.110> shadow<00:01:18.409> damage<00:01:18.650> on

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
eyes have flicked some shadow damage on

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.790 
eyes have flicked some shadow damage on
each<00:01:19.400> player<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.940> after<00:01:20.330> 10<00:01:20.540> seconds<00:01:20.990> if<00:01:21.409> they

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
each player and after 10 seconds if they

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.800 
each player and after 10 seconds if they
live<00:01:22.009> longer<00:01:22.190> than<00:01:22.400> 10<00:01:22.670> seconds<00:01:23.030> this<00:01:23.509> huge

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
live longer than 10 seconds this huge

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.730 
live longer than 10 seconds this huge
flame<00:01:24.110> area<00:01:24.500> emerges<00:01:24.979> around<00:01:25.310> them

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.560 

that's<00:01:28.740> why<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.070> gather<00:01:29.310> destroy<00:01:30.119> them<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that's why we gather destroy them and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
that's why we gather destroy them and
then<00:01:30.720> run<00:01:30.900> apart<00:01:31.200> quickly<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
then run apart quickly to get out of

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.550 
then run apart quickly to get out of
this<00:01:32.549> potentially<00:01:33.540> dangerous<00:01:33.570> fire<00:01:34.259> zone

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
this potentially dangerous fire zone

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.410 
this potentially dangerous fire zone
that<00:01:37.560> zone<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.190> indeed<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.790> most<00:01:38.970> dangerous

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that zone is indeed the most dangerous

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240 
that zone is indeed the most dangerous
during<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> attack<00:01:40.020> as<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> strikes<00:01:40.950> for

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
during this attack as it strikes for

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.969 
during this attack as it strikes for
approximately<00:01:42.229> 25,000<00:01:43.229> shadow<00:01:43.470> damage<00:01:43.710> on

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
approximately 25,000 shadow damage on

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.300 
approximately 25,000 shadow damage on
each<00:01:44.159> player<00:01:44.399> which<00:01:44.729> isn't<00:01:45.090> little

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
each player which isn't little

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.070 
each player which isn't little
you<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> get<00:01:48.760> out<00:01:48.940> of<00:01:49.119> there<00:01:49.299> as<00:01:49.479> fast<00:01:49.869> as

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
you have to get out of there as fast as

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.940 
you have to get out of there as fast as
you<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.440> you<00:01:50.680> don't<00:01:50.890> die<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.159> there

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.800 

beside<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.159> attack<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:57.120> appears<00:01:57.510> quite

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
beside this attack which appears quite

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.050 
beside this attack which appears quite
regularly<00:01:58.229> against<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> group<00:01:59.040> players<00:01:59.790> get

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
regularly against the group players get
