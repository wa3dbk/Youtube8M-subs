which we purchased from Amazon and it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.000 
which we purchased from Amazon and it
doesn't<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> same<00:00:25.320> kind<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> quality<00:00:25.769> as

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
doesn't have the same kind of quality as

doesn't have the same kind of quality as
you'd<00:00:26.189> expect<00:00:26.519> from<00:00:26.550> an<00:00:26.760> auto<00:00:26.939> Dux

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
what you can do to find out if the case

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.170 
what you can do to find out if the case
that<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.769> fake<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.030> do

that you have is a fake and what to do

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.910 
that you have is a fake and what to do
if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> find<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.380> here<00:00:34.590> are<00:00:34.680> three

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
if you do find them so here are three

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.540 
if you do find them so here are three
differences<00:00:35.399> between<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.630> fake<00:00:37.550> OtterBox

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
differences between the fake OtterBox

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
differences between the fake OtterBox
and<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.090> real<00:00:39.300> OtterBox<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:40.950> one

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
and the real OtterBox so the first one

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130 
and the real OtterBox so the first one
you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.640> pretty<00:00:41.910> clearly<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.930> has<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you can see pretty clearly this has a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.950 
you can see pretty clearly this has a
nice<00:00:43.410> green<00:00:43.980> tint<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> which<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> real<00:00:45.750> one

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
nice green tint to it which the real one

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
nice green tint to it which the real one
does<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.739> has<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.070> green

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
does not have this has some green

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
does not have this has some green
cellophane<00:00:47.520> around<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.270> screen<00:00:48.480> protector

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
cellophane around the screen protector

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.220 
cellophane around the screen protector
as<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.070> clear<00:00:50.989> turn<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> over

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
as this one is just clear turn it over

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.740 
as this one is just clear turn it over
the<00:00:52.649> second<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.129> indicator<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.300> texture

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the second big indicator is the texture

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
the second big indicator is the texture
of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> back<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.160> feel<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.879> kind<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
of the back you can feel this is kind of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.229 
of the back you can feel this is kind of
a<00:00:57.649> more<00:00:58.649> grippy<00:00:59.280> texture<00:00:59.730> while<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
a more grippy texture while this is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.150 
a more grippy texture while this is
quite<00:01:00.449> slick

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
quite slick

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.830 
quite slick
I'm<00:01:02.160> sure<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> difference<00:01:02.940> comes<00:01:03.180> across<00:01:03.390> too

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I'm sure the difference comes across too

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.690 
I'm sure the difference comes across too
much<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.559> look<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
much if you just look at them when you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.890 
much if you just look at them when you
feel<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.090> you'll<00:01:06.240> definitely<00:01:06.600> notice<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
feel them you'll definitely notice the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.450 
feel them you'll definitely notice the
difference<00:01:09.049> the<00:01:10.049> final<00:01:10.409> thing<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.830> low<00:01:11.070> media

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
difference the final thing is low media

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.969 
difference the final thing is low media
clips<00:01:11.850> you'll<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.229> real<00:01:13.590> version

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
clips you'll see that the real version

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
clips you'll see that the real version
which<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.840> much<00:01:15.840> thicker

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
which is this one as much thicker

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.300 
which is this one as much thicker
outline<00:01:17.000> around<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.450> letters<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
outline around the letters and the

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
outline around the letters and the
letters<00:01:20.610> themselves<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:21.330> also<00:01:21.740> slightly

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
letters themselves are also slightly

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.640 
letters themselves are also slightly
fatter<00:01:24.799> slightly<00:01:25.799> wider<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> see

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
fatter slightly wider so if you can see

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
fatter slightly wider so if you can see
that<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.880> font<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.720> slightly<00:01:31.079> different

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that the font is very slightly different

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.899 
that the font is very slightly different
again<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.130> have<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.640> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
again if you just have one of these it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.609 
again if you just have one of these it's
very<00:01:33.090> difficult<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> tell<00:01:33.750> which<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.439> why<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
very difficult to tell which is why the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
very difficult to tell which is why the
price<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.009> such<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> good<00:01:35.670> indicator<00:01:36.049> there<00:01:37.049> are

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
price is such a good indicator there are

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710 
price is such a good indicator there are
differences<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.920> our<00:01:38.189> look<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:39.299> kind<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.600> fit

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
differences in our look this kind of fit

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
differences in our look this kind of fit
is<00:01:39.840> cheaper<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.500> also<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.890> much<00:01:41.070> worse

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
is cheaper it's also of much worse

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.190 
is cheaper it's also of much worse
quality<00:01:41.479> inferior<00:01:42.479> materials<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:43.020> used

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
quality inferior materials are used

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
quality inferior materials are used
certain<00:01:43.770> details<00:01:44.100> are<00:01:44.250> off<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.030> course

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
certain details are off and of course
