limited to whatever jar they happen to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.140 
limited to whatever jar they happen to
give<00:00:11.700> you<00:00:11.880> or<00:00:13.429> if<00:00:14.429> you're<00:00:14.670> working<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.120> a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
side feed a bowl and one of the things I

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.260 
side feed a bowl and one of the things I
like<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.170> do<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.010> I'll<00:00:20.250> pre<00:00:20.609> thin<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> lot

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
like to do is that I'll pre thin a lot

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.730 
like to do is that I'll pre thin a lot
of<00:00:21.420> paints<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.900> put<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.170> back<00:00:22.320> into<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
of paints and put them back into the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.500 
of paints and put them back into the
bottles<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:23.340> is<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.640> model<00:00:23.970> masters<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
bottles this is the model masters in

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.769 
bottles this is the model masters in
this<00:00:24.660> case<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.730> if<00:00:26.730> they're<00:00:26.910> pre<00:00:27.119> thinned<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this case and if they're pre thinned the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.890 
this case and if they're pre thinned the
idea<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.830> pouring<00:00:29.220> this<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.000> new<00:00:30.240> jar<00:00:30.570> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
idea of pouring this into a new jar and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.290 
idea of pouring this into a new jar and
then<00:00:31.710> having<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> clean<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> later<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.270> I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
then having to clean this later when I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.090 
then having to clean this later when I
could<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.809> simply<00:00:34.140> stick<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> airbrush<00:00:34.950> in

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
could just simply stick the airbrush in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.030 
could just simply stick the airbrush in
here<00:00:35.460> kind<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> bugs<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.960> often<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:37.920> I'll

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
here kind of bugs me so often what I'll

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.590 
here kind of bugs me so often what I'll
do<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:39.350> simply<00:00:40.350> remove<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.820> top<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> jar

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
do is simply remove the top of the jar

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.790 
do is simply remove the top of the jar
and<00:00:43.640> then<00:00:44.640> simply<00:00:45.180> hold<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.230> color<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:46.739> using

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and then simply hold the color I'm using

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.330 
and then simply hold the color I'm using
in<00:00:47.399> place<00:00:48.230> spray<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> need<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> few

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
in place spray what I need for a few

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.959 
in place spray what I need for a few
seconds<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> call<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.110> done<00:00:52.550> thus<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.940> having

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
seconds and call it done thus not having

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.229 
seconds and call it done thus not having
to<00:00:54.449> clean<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.140> main<00:00:55.350> jar<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> finally

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to clean the main jar so what I finally

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470 
to clean the main jar so what I finally
hit<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.469> idea<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.090> spare

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hit on is the idea that I have a spare

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.380 
hit on is the idea that I have a spare
bottle<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.020> paint<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> model<00:01:02.039> masters<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
bottle of paint for the model masters so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.840 
bottle of paint for the model masters so
what<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.019> did<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> take<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> scissors

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
what I did here was to take the scissors

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060 
what I did here was to take the scissors
and<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.180> started<00:01:06.720> carving<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.200> hole<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.680> really

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and just started carving a hole I really

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.859 
and just started carving a hole I really
should<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.280> taken<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> drill<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
should have taken a drill bit of the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.289 
should have taken a drill bit of the
appropriate<00:01:10.409> size<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.180> if

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
appropriate size here I don't know if

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.109 
appropriate size here I don't know if
it'll<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.630> show<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:14.119> shelf

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it'll really show but there's a shelf

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.980 
it'll really show but there's a shelf
basically<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> bottom<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.869> once<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
basically on the bottom there and once I

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.070 
basically on the bottom there and once I
got<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> whole<00:01:19.560> set<00:01:20.330> what<00:01:21.330> I'm<00:01:21.450> gonna<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.869> now

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
got that whole set what I'm gonna do now

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.870 
got that whole set what I'm gonna do now
is<00:01:22.439> simply<00:01:22.950> glue<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.820> end<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:26.280> think

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
is simply glue this end and I think

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.590 
is simply glue this end and I think
what's<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.299> happen<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.600> model

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
what's gonna happen is I have a model

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.890 
what's gonna happen is I have a model
masters<00:01:31.049> adapter<00:01:31.619> basically<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:33.600> thing<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
masters adapter basically one thing to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.539 
masters adapter basically one thing to
keep<00:01:34.049> in<00:01:34.229> mind<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.920> there<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> very

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
keep in mind is that there is a very

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.560 
keep in mind is that there is a very
small<00:01:35.850> air<00:01:36.119> vent<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:38.729> must<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.299> through

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
small air vent here that must go through

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950 
small air vent here that must go through
and<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.439> case<00:01:40.790> I've<00:01:41.790> dented<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> top<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and in this case I've dented the top of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.940 
and in this case I've dented the top of
the<00:01:43.049> lid<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.740> enough<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.790> should<00:01:45.270> be

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the lid just enough that it should be

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.499 
the lid just enough that it should be
good<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> air<00:01:47.640> hole<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.360> see

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
good for the air hole but you can see

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.560 
good for the air hole but you can see
this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> off-center<00:01:49.229> too<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.299> let's<00:01:51.299> actually

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
this is off-center too so let's actually

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
this is off-center too so let's actually
put<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.229> air<00:01:52.439> hole<00:01:52.680> closer<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
put that air hole closer to the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.819 
put that air hole closer to the
off-center<00:01:54.119> bit<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.790> voila<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:58.409> seems<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
off-center bit and voila it seems to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
off-center bit and voila it seems to
have<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> fairly<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.520> fit<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> stops<00:02:00.659> more

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
have a fairly good fit and stops more

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.830 
have a fairly good fit and stops more
glue<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.350> here<00:02:02.240> one<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> things<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
glue in here one of the things that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.920 
glue in here one of the things that
concerned<00:02:04.290> me<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:05.450> using<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> scissors

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
concerned me was in using the scissors

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.410 
concerned me was in using the scissors
to<00:02:07.140> carve<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.619> out<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.160> got<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> twisted

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to carve this out I got a lot of twisted

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.180 
to carve this out I got a lot of twisted
metal<00:02:09.539> around<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> edges<00:02:10.470> where<00:02:10.649> obviously<00:02:11.160> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
metal around the edges where obviously a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
metal around the edges where obviously a
drill<00:02:11.580> bit<00:02:11.760> would<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.209> have

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
drill bit would not have

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.440 
drill bit would not have
done<00:02:12.689> that<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:14.189> that's<00:02:14.579> one<00:02:14.849> downside<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
done that so that's one downside to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.830 
done that so that's one downside to
using<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:16.110> scissors<00:02:16.469> but<00:02:18.200> now<00:02:19.200> essentially

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
using the scissors but now essentially

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.690 
using the scissors but now essentially
with<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:22.049> cap<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.950> we'll<00:02:23.069> put<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.430> piece

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
with this cap and we'll put this piece

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.229 
with this cap and we'll put this piece
back<00:02:23.909> on<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:25.799> now<00:02:25.920> with<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.250> cap<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.879> can

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
back on here so now with this cap I can

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.000 
back on here so now with this cap I can
pretty<00:02:27.450> much<00:02:27.540> go<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> any<00:02:28.200> model<00:02:28.590> master's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
pretty much go to any model master's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.410 
pretty much go to any model master's
bottle<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.609> I've<00:02:29.730> got<00:02:30.319> simply<00:02:31.319> attach<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
bottle that I've got simply attach this

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.649 
bottle that I've got simply attach this
rock<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.659> paint<00:02:34.220> untwist<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:36.599> never

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
rock the paint untwist it and I never

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.460 
rock the paint untwist it and I never
have<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.200> clean<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.680> master<00:02:38.040> jar<00:02:38.280> again<00:02:39.470> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
have to clean the master jar again so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.869 
have to clean the master jar again so
I'm<00:02:40.590> thinking<00:02:40.889> this<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.189> fairly<00:02:41.639> clever

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
I'm thinking this is a fairly clever

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.580 
I'm thinking this is a fairly clever
idea<00:02:42.359> we'll<00:02:42.569> see<00:02:42.719> how<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.989> works<00:02:43.200> out<00:02:43.379> in

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
idea we'll see how it works out in

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.289 
idea we'll see how it works out in
practice<00:02:44.069> there<00:02:44.250> could<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.430> all<00:02:44.639> sorts<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:45.060> air

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
practice there could be all sorts of air

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.929 
practice there could be all sorts of air
leak<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.870> on<00:02:46.079> around<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.500> edges<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.010> my

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
leak going on around the edges and my

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.909 
leak going on around the edges and my
idea<00:02:48.359> for<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.409> get<00:02:49.709> some<00:02:50.040> silicon<00:02:50.669> and

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
idea for that is to get some silicon and

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.849 
idea for that is to get some silicon and
simply<00:02:52.919> fill<00:02:53.189> that<00:02:53.400> gap<00:02:54.169> and<00:02:55.169> additionally

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
simply fill that gap and additionally

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.119 
simply fill that gap and additionally
what<00:02:56.069> I'll<00:02:56.189> do<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.379> just<00:02:58.379> run<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.889> bead

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
what I'll do here is just run this bead

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.789 
what I'll do here is just run this bead
of<00:02:59.340> glue<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.819> around<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.799> hopefully

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
of glue right around it and hopefully

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.039 
of glue right around it and hopefully
give<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.129> something<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.730> liquid<00:03:03.090> seal<00:03:03.359> if

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
give it something of a liquid seal if

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.020 
give it something of a liquid seal if
anyone<00:03:04.439> sees<00:03:04.620> any<00:03:04.859> immediate<00:03:05.220> flaws<00:03:05.669> to<00:03:05.879> this

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
anyone sees any immediate flaws to this

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.830 
anyone sees any immediate flaws to this
idea<00:03:06.389> let<00:03:06.659> me<00:03:06.810> know<00:03:07.280> because<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.579> would<00:03:09.419> like<00:03:09.629> to

probably<00:03:11.400> would<00:03:11.939> too<00:03:12.180> but<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.629> seems<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.109> a

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
probably would too but it seems like a

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
along or even if I could extend the tube

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.879 
along or even if I could extend the tube
I<00:03:37.340> could<00:03:38.340> dip<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:38.760> into<00:03:38.909> this<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.739> really<00:03:40.739> have

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
I could dip it into this and really have

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.710 
I could dip it into this and really have
some<00:03:40.919> very<00:03:41.760> major<00:03:44.000> Wow<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.209> know<00:03:45.329> what<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
some very major Wow you know what that

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.930 
some very major Wow you know what that
happens<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.229> fit<00:03:46.409> model<00:03:46.919> masters<00:03:47.310> screw<00:03:47.699> top

happens to fit model masters screw top

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.159 
happens to fit model masters screw top
with<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.449> testers<00:03:48.900> enamel<00:03:49.349> thinner<00:03:51.049> that's<00:03:52.049> a

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
with the testers enamel thinner that's a

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.059 
with the testers enamel thinner that's a
pretty<00:03:52.349> sweet<00:03:52.590> fit<00:03:52.859> right<00:03:53.069> there<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.799> if<00:03:55.949> I

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
pretty sweet fit right there so if I

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.770 
pretty sweet fit right there so if I
extend<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.639> hose<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.120> it'll<00:03:57.299> go<00:03:57.419> all<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.689> way

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
extend the hose so it'll go all the way

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.619 
extend the hose so it'll go all the way
to<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.019> bottom<00:03:58.199> all<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.970> sudden<00:04:00.299> I've<00:04:00.419> got<00:04:00.449> a

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
to the bottom all the sudden I've got a

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.969 
to the bottom all the sudden I've got a
really<00:04:00.870> nice<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.349> easy<00:04:01.530> thinner<00:04:01.889> cleaner<00:04:03.979> so

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
really nice and easy thinner cleaner so

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.500 
really nice and easy thinner cleaner so
I<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.159> that's<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.669> for<00:04:05.699> this<00:04:05.970> tip<00:04:06.209> we'll<00:04:06.359> see

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I think that's it for this tip we'll see

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.319 
I think that's it for this tip we'll see
how<00:04:06.599> good<00:04:06.840> it<00:04:06.959> works<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:08.069> if<00:04:09.000> you've<00:04:09.209> already

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
how good it works and if you've already

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.999 
how good it works and if you've already
tried<00:04:09.599> this<00:04:09.840> yourself<00:04:10.290> definitely<00:04:10.859> let<00:04:10.979> me
