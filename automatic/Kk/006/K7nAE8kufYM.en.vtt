the front camera and proximity sensor
front<00:01:59.340> speakers<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.740> nothing<00:02:01.890> here

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
front speakers so you have nothing here

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.480 
front speakers so you have nothing here
explain<00:02:03.500> here<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.590> have<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.250> three<00:02:05.460> parts

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
explain here you have the three parts

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.040 
explain here you have the three parts
and<00:02:05.910> an<00:02:06.030> audio<00:02:06.420> jack<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.590> microUSB<00:02:07.920> slot

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.510 
and an audio jack and the microUSB slot
so<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.440> before

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
so this is before

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.020 
so this is before
that's<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:16.000> other<00:02:16.120> half<00:02:16.860> can't<00:02:17.860> yet<00:02:18.130> do<00:02:18.340> what

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
that's the other half can't yet do what

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:43.340 
that's the other half can't yet do what
the<00:02:19.240> back<00:02:19.420> cover

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.770 

we<00:02:43.860> have<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.370> SIM<00:02:44.580> card<00:02:44.610> slots<00:02:45.090> here<00:02:45.300> one<00:02:45.600> for

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
we have the SIM card slots here one for

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.920 
we have the SIM card slots here one for
duty<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.170> other<00:02:46.320> for<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.710> 3G<00:02:47.100> or<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.340> Fuji

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
duty and other for the 3G or the Fuji

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.760 
duty and other for the 3G or the Fuji
disconnecting<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:48.990> approach<00:02:49.290> for<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.620> so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
disconnecting this approach for this so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.860 
disconnecting this approach for this so
this<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.730> memory<00:02:50.880> card<00:02:51.210> slot<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.750> is

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this is the memory card slot and this is

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
this is the memory card slot and this is
the<00:02:52.020> battery<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.470> let's<00:02:52.980> put<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.460> battery

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:10.130 

so<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.080> phone<00:03:02.290> now<00:03:02.500> let's<00:03:02.770> switch<00:03:03.220> on

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140

good<00:03:43.830> security

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
good security

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.050 
good security
they<00:03:46.430> know

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
they know

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.870 
they know
you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.660> switch<00:03:48.930> between<00:03:48.959> teams

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.650

internet but I don't see action here I

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.470 
internet but I don't see action here I
think<00:04:02.010> there<00:04:02.190> will<00:04:02.340> be<00:04:02.400> an<00:04:02.640> ocean<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:03.030> will<00:04:03.240> also

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
think there will be an ocean I will also

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.750 
think there will be an ocean I will also

have image here attack see that from
then<00:04:05.880> also<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.330> think<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.930> order

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
then also I think in order

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:16.270 
then also I think in order
it's<00:04:09.940> sending<00:04:10.940> out<00:04:11.210> polish<00:04:11.660> for<00:04:11.900> sister<00:04:15.280> to
