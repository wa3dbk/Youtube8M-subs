00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.470 
what yeah the size the waves that day
were<00:00:16.490> they<00:00:16.700> were<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:16.910> biggest<00:00:17.060> face<00:00:17.300> I've

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
were they were the biggest face I've

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.630 
were they were the biggest face I've
ever<00:00:17.510> seen<00:00:17.990> hands<00:00:18.500> down<00:00:18.800> easy

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
ever seen hands down easy

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.510 
ever seen hands down easy
and<00:00:19.820> I<00:00:20.449> think<00:00:21.050> jaws<00:00:21.500> is<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.919> only<00:00:22.070> place<00:00:22.310> I've

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
and I think jaws is the only place I've

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.730 
and I think jaws is the only place I've
seen<00:00:22.550> where<00:00:22.910> I've<00:00:23.029> been<00:00:23.300> mmm<00:00:23.930> maybe<00:00:24.380> more

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
seen where I've been mmm maybe more

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.859 
seen where I've been mmm maybe more
scared<00:00:25.099> because<00:00:25.730> of<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.119> power<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.630> way<00:00:26.750> is

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
scared because of the power the way is

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.290 
scared because of the power the way is
at<00:00:27.140> jaws<00:00:27.410> and<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:27.950> first<00:00:28.160> time<00:00:28.400> I<00:00:28.430> surfed

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
at jaws and the first time I surfed

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.479 
at jaws and the first time I surfed
really<00:00:29.570> big<00:00:29.720> jaws<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.200> was<00:00:30.439> probably<00:00:31.040> even

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
really big jaws that was probably even

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.450 
really big jaws that was probably even
more<00:00:31.969> overwhelming<00:00:32.390> but<00:00:33.230> this<00:00:33.590> this<00:00:33.980> day<00:00:34.219> was

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
more overwhelming but this this day was

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.250 
more overwhelming but this this day was
this<00:00:34.880> last<00:00:35.090> Cortes<00:00:35.540> was<00:00:35.719> clearly<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.140> big

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
this last Cortes was clearly the big

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.010 
this last Cortes was clearly the big
biggest<00:00:36.620> way<00:00:36.829> as<00:00:36.950> I've<00:00:37.070> ever<00:00:37.219> seen<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:38.480> know<00:00:38.840> I

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
biggest way as I've ever seen I know I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.119 
biggest way as I've ever seen I know I
saw<00:00:39.379> waves<00:00:40.239> over<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.480> 70<00:00:41.870> foot<00:00:42.050> mark<00:00:42.320> 80<00:00:42.680> foot

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
saw waves over the 70 foot mark 80 foot

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.579 
saw waves over the 70 foot mark 80 foot
plus<00:00:43.579> waves<00:00:43.910> out<00:00:44.149> there<00:00:44.360> I<00:00:44.390> even<00:00:44.780> think<00:00:45.350> that

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
plus waves out there I even think that

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.919 
plus waves out there I even think that
there<00:00:46.249> might<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.519> been<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:46.760> wave<00:00:47.449> close<00:00:47.749> to

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
there might have been a wave close to

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.669 
there might have been a wave close to
100<00:00:48.230> feet<00:00:48.350> out<00:00:48.410> there<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:48.739> really<00:00:48.800> do<00:00:50.620> like<00:00:51.620> a

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
100 feet out there I really do like a

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.160 
100 feet out there I really do like a
surfable<00:00:52.039> theoretical<00:00:52.579> yes<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.999> do<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:53.780> believe

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
surfable theoretical yes I do I believe

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.419 
surfable theoretical yes I do I believe
someone<00:00:54.469> would<00:00:54.559> get<00:00:54.679> 100<00:00:54.800> foot<00:00:55.100> wave<00:00:55.249> out

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:55.429 
someone would get 100 foot wave out

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:58.209 
someone would get 100 foot wave out
there<00:00:55.780> for<00:00:56.780> sure<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.589> will<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:57.980> spot

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
there for sure and that will be the spot

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.189 
there for sure and that will be the spot
it'll<00:00:58.460> happen<00:00:58.699> because<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.870> reef<00:01:00.019> will

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
it'll happen because the reef will

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.410 
it'll happen because the reef will
handle<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.920> the<00:01:01.249> the<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.819> way<00:01:01.969> the<00:01:02.149> storm

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
handle it and the the the way the storm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.719 
handle it and the the the way the storm
in<00:01:02.600> my<00:01:02.629> opinion<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.289> way<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.559> storms<00:01:04.339> set<00:01:04.580> up

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
in my opinion the way the storms set up

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:05.980 
in my opinion the way the storms set up
there<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.089> North<00:01:05.239> Pacific<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.810> where

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
there in the North Pacific and where

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.990 
there in the North Pacific and where
it's<00:01:06.170> located

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
it's located

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.090 
it's located
it'll<00:01:08.000> happen<00:01:08.210> there<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.720> I<00:01:09.290> mean<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.010> was

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
it'll happen there and I mean it was

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.910 
it'll happen there and I mean it was
really<00:01:10.310> close<00:01:10.640> that<00:01:10.670> day<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.330> think<00:01:11.870> had<00:01:12.680> there

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
really close that day I think had there

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.290 
really close that day I think had there
have<00:01:13.010> been<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.159> few<00:01:13.280> more<00:01:13.580> people<00:01:13.940> out<00:01:14.060> there

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
have been a few more people out there

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.000 
have been a few more people out there
and<00:01:14.450> a<00:01:14.510> few<00:01:14.659> more<00:01:14.810> people<00:01:14.960> documenting<00:01:15.860> it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
and a few more people documenting it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.209 
and a few more people documenting it
someone<00:01:16.520> might<00:01:16.700> have<00:01:16.759> been<00:01:16.909> real<00:01:17.119> close<00:01:17.360> I

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
someone might have been real close I

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.740 
someone might have been real close I
mean<00:01:19.219> I<00:01:19.280> know<00:01:19.340> Greg<00:01:19.969> was<00:01:20.240> saying<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.600> same

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
mean I know Greg was saying the same

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.330 
mean I know Greg was saying the same
thing<00:01:21.020> Twiggy<00:01:21.409> was<00:01:21.560> saying<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> same<00:01:22.040> thing

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
thing Twiggy was saying the same thing

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.700 
thing Twiggy was saying the same thing
and<00:01:22.520> Brad<00:01:23.329> to<00:01:23.630> all<00:01:23.840> of<00:01:23.990> us<00:01:24.079> were<00:01:24.229> just<00:01:24.290> I

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
and Brad to all of us were just I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.330 
and Brad to all of us were just I
couldn't<00:01:25.340> believe<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.820> was<00:01:25.880> really<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.659> big

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
couldn't believe it was really that big

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.740 
couldn't believe it was really that big
we<00:01:28.340> thought<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.759> was<00:01:28.850> going<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.090> be<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.539> the

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
we thought it was going to be the the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.940 
we thought it was going to be the the
biggest<00:01:29.930> we'd<00:01:30.170> ever<00:01:30.289> seen<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.710> but<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.920> was

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
biggest we'd ever seen it but it was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.069 
biggest we'd ever seen it but it was
another<00:01:31.430> level<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:31.939> top<00:01:31.969> of<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:32.390> it<00:01:32.659> was<00:01:32.840> like

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
another level on top of that it was like

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.260 
another level on top of that it was like
okay<00:01:33.740> wait<00:01:34.009> I've<00:01:34.189> seen<00:01:34.219> waves<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.210> look

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
okay wait I've seen waves that look

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.480 
okay wait I've seen waves that look
about<00:01:35.689> 50<00:01:36.079> 60<00:01:36.439> feet<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:36.860> seemed<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.369> be

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
about 50 60 feet this seemed to be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.179 
about 50 60 feet this seemed to be
another<00:01:37.939> 20<00:01:38.299> 30<00:01:38.539> feet<00:01:38.719> bigger<00:01:39.020> and<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:39.920> way<00:01:40.039> of

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
another 20 30 feet bigger and the way of

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.520 
another 20 30 feet bigger and the way of
riding<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.030> waves<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.479> couple<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.109> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
riding the waves the couple of the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.770 
riding the waves the couple of the
really<00:01:42.829> big<00:01:42.979> waves<00:01:43.189> we<00:01:43.340> wrote<00:01:43.549> just<00:01:43.880> never

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
really big waves we wrote just never

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.499 
really big waves we wrote just never
ever<00:01:45.020> seem<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.409> end<00:01:45.649> you're<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:46.180> it<00:01:47.180> never

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
seemed like there was a bottom on them

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.920 
seemed like there was a bottom on them
it<00:01:49.430> was<00:01:49.579> amazing<00:01:49.939> and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.299> letting<00:01:50.689> go<00:01:50.899> of

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
it was amazing and then letting go of

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.029 
it was amazing and then letting go of
the<00:01:51.079> rope<00:01:51.259> I'm<00:01:51.409> you<00:01:51.500> know<00:01:51.590> in<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.710> wave<00:01:51.859> that

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
the rope I'm you know in a wave that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.980 
the rope I'm you know in a wave that
size<00:01:52.280> was<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.549> clear<00:01:52.909> when<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.299> let<00:01:53.420> go<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.630> rope

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
size was a clear when to let go the rope

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.139 
size was a clear when to let go the rope
no<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.859> wasn't<00:01:55.189> clear<00:01:55.369> you're<00:01:55.549> tracking<00:01:55.820> them

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
no it wasn't clear you're tracking them

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.270 
no it wasn't clear you're tracking them
from<00:01:56.509> so<00:01:56.869> far<00:01:57.170> out<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.619> you're<00:01:57.770> trying<00:01:57.920> you're

from so far out and you're trying you're
you're<00:01:58.549> on<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.939> rope<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.270> you're<00:01:59.390> trying<00:01:59.689> to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
you're on the rope and you're trying to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.050 
you're on the rope and you're trying to
see<00:02:00.079> where's<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:00.979> reef<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.520> know<00:02:01.850> where's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060

lose your speed the other last thing you
want<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> do<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.500> go<00:02:09.770> too<00:02:09.830> fast<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.640> get<00:02:10.910> out<00:02:10.940> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
want to do is go too fast and get out in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.550 
want to do is go too fast and get out in
front<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.630> have<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.780> catch<00:02:12.020> up<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.410> hit

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
front of it and have it catch up and hit

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800 
front of it and have it catch up and hit
you<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.890> your<00:02:13.070> your<00:02:13.550> timing<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.300> critical

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
you so your your timing is so critical

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.980 
you so your your timing is so critical
of<00:02:14.930> when<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.320> let<00:02:15.500> go<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:16.670> I've<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.900> know

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
driving the ski and tracking him from so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.600 
driving the ski and tracking him from so
far<00:02:20.330> out<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.659> was<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.409> the<00:02:22.069> biggest<00:02:22.159> wave<00:02:22.489> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
far out it was the the biggest wave I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.000 
far out it was the the biggest wave I
caught<00:02:22.909> we<00:02:23.269> where<00:02:23.989> we<00:02:24.140> were<00:02:24.290> kind<00:02:24.800> of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
caught we where we were kind of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.740 
caught we where we were kind of
during<00:02:25.280> back<00:02:25.430> out<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.879> Greg<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.300> Twiggy<00:02:26.450> we're

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
during back out in Greg and Twiggy we're

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.680 
during back out in Greg and Twiggy we're
inside<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.110> us<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:28.849> was<00:02:29.000> our<00:02:29.150> turn<00:02:29.360> to<00:02:29.540> go

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
inside of us and it was our turn to go

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.300 
inside of us and it was our turn to go
and<00:02:29.720> Brad<00:02:30.319> was<00:02:30.470> gonna<00:02:30.620> tell<00:02:30.920> me<00:02:31.040> into<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and Brad was gonna tell me into the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.670 
and Brad was gonna tell me into the
first<00:02:31.519> one<00:02:32.080> actually<00:02:33.080> wasn't<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.379> first<00:02:33.470> wave

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
first one actually wasn't the first wave

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.050 
first one actually wasn't the first wave
of<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.830> set<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.159> it<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> really<00:02:34.700> big<00:02:34.879> wave

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
of the set but it was a really big wave

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.119 
of the set but it was a really big wave
and<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.930> went<00:02:36.110> no<00:02:36.290> no<00:02:36.319> no<00:02:36.470> there's<00:02:36.739> there's

and and I went no no no there's there's

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.470 
and and I went no no no there's there's
something<00:02:37.430> behind<00:02:37.549> it<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.090> he<00:02:38.209> was<00:02:38.330> in

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
something behind it and he was in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.240 
something behind it and he was in
disbelief<00:02:38.659> that<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.319> wanted<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.739> go<00:02:39.890> over<00:02:40.190> it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
disbelief that I wanted to go over it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.680 
disbelief that I wanted to go over it
because<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> one<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:40.879> front<00:02:41.209> would<00:02:41.390> look<00:02:41.540> like

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
because the one in front would look like

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.470 
because the one in front would look like
such<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.019> big<00:02:42.860> perfect<00:02:43.220> wave<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.849> sure<00:02:44.420> enough

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
such a big perfect wave and sure enough

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.900 
such a big perfect wave and sure enough
we<00:02:44.780> went<00:02:44.900> over<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:46.190> was<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.580> one

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
we went over it and and it was just one

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.300 
we went over it and and it was just one
of<00:02:46.940> those<00:02:47.060> moments<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.660> like<00:02:47.870> oh<00:02:48.200> one<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.190> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.770 
anything like it when I let go I was
like<00:03:09.859> you<00:03:10.160> know<00:03:10.280> just<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.450> said<00:03:11.629> I<00:03:11.660> was

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
like you know just like you said I was

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.509 
like you know just like you said I was
trying<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:12.019> figure<00:03:12.170> out<00:03:12.290> where<00:03:12.650> where<00:03:13.220> to<00:03:13.370> let

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
trying to figure out where where to let

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.160 
trying to figure out where where to let
go<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.849> have<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.030> perfect<00:03:14.510> amount<00:03:14.599> of<00:03:14.870> speed

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
go and have that perfect amount of speed

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.640 
go and have that perfect amount of speed
and<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.700> the<00:03:17.299> drop<00:03:17.569> drop<00:03:17.810> just<00:03:18.109> never<00:03:18.349> end

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and the the drop drop just never end

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.039 
and the the drop drop just never end
never<00:03:19.280> ended<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.819> was<00:03:20.000> just<00:03:20.180> down<00:03:20.510> down<00:03:20.810> down

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
never ended it was just down down down

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.619 
never ended it was just down down down
down<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.590> was<00:03:21.769> really<00:03:22.040> bumpy<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.730> my

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
down and it was really bumpy and my

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.210 
down and it was really bumpy and my
board<00:03:23.870> cavitate<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.560> little<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.890> I<00:03:24.920> started

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
board cavitate it a little and I started

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
board cavitate it a little and I started
to<00:03:25.310> slide<00:03:25.579> back<00:03:25.849> up<00:03:25.879> a<00:03:26.209> little<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.569> then<00:03:26.720> keep

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
to slide back up a little and then keep

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.830 
to slide back up a little and then keep
going<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:28.040> kicked<00:03:28.819> out<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.299> wave<00:03:29.450> hit<00:03:29.690> me

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
going and I kicked out the wave hit me

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.930 
going and I kicked out the wave hit me
in<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.470> made<00:03:30.650> it<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:30.889> kicked<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.700> Greg

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
in and I made it and kicked out and Greg

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.059 
in and I made it and kicked out and Greg
was<00:03:32.150> Greg<00:03:32.840> long<00:03:33.019> came<00:03:33.260> up<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.530> me<00:03:33.620> on<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.769> ski

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
was Greg long came up to me on the ski

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.000 
was Greg long came up to me on the ski
just<00:03:34.540> screaming<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.750> yelling<00:03:35.900> saying<00:03:36.440> that

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
was unbelievable I never seen in a way

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.319 
was unbelievable I never seen in a way
of<00:03:39.049> that<00:03:39.200> big<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:40.220> was<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.849> was<00:03:41.000> pretty

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
of that big and it was it was pretty

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.629 
of that big and it was it was pretty
darn<00:03:41.780> exciting<00:03:42.319> you<00:03:42.500> know<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.430> that

darn exciting you know and and and that
was<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:44.030> was<00:03:44.180> kind<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.450> early<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:44.900> the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
was that was kind of early in the

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.860 
was that was kind of early in the
session<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.709> was<00:03:45.950> about<00:03:46.389> maybe<00:03:47.389> an<00:03:47.569> hour<00:03:47.690> and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
session that was about maybe an hour and

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.470 
session that was about maybe an hour and
a<00:03:47.900> half<00:03:48.079> in<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:48.799> we<00:03:49.220> all<00:03:49.459> rode<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:50.299> sure

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
a half in and and we all rode for sure

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.819 
a half in and and we all rode for sure
the<00:03:50.630> biggest<00:03:50.720> waves<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.169> our<00:03:51.290> lives<00:03:51.470> for<00:03:51.769> the

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
the biggest waves of our lives for the

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.879 
the biggest waves of our lives for the
next<00:03:52.040> three<00:03:52.400> hours<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.700> mean<00:03:53.090> I<00:03:53.180> saw<00:03:53.419> Greg<00:03:53.889> ride

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
next three hours I mean I saw Greg ride

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.220 
next three hours I mean I saw Greg ride
two<00:03:55.190> waves<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.760> were<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.900> know<00:03:56.930> probably

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
two waves that were you know probably

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.509 
two waves that were you know probably
bigger<00:03:57.500> than<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.799> one<00:03:57.950> he<00:03:58.099> didn't<00:03:58.340> get<00:03:58.400> it

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
bigger than the one he didn't get it

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.330 
bigger than the one he didn't get it
documented<00:03:59.120> but<00:03:59.269> they<00:03:59.450> were<00:03:59.510> they<00:04:00.200> were<00:04:00.340> they

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
documented but they were they were they

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.089 
documented but they were they were they
were<00:04:01.400> probably<00:04:01.970> 80<00:04:02.660> foot<00:04:02.870> waves<00:04:03.049> I<00:04:03.349> think<00:04:03.980> they

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
were probably 80 foot waves I think they

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.339 
were probably 80 foot waves I think they
were<00:04:04.269> they<00:04:05.269> were<00:04:05.359> just<00:04:05.450> reading<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.109> mean<00:04:06.230> on

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
were they were just reading I mean on

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.800 
were they were just reading I mean on
face<00:04:06.709> height<00:04:06.950> first<00:04:07.280> they<00:04:07.609> were<00:04:07.760> just<00:04:07.790> out<00:04:08.750> of

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
face height first they were just out of

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.659 
face height first they were just out of
this<00:04:08.930> world<00:04:08.989> big<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:09.859> making<00:04:10.340> that<00:04:10.459> first

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
this world big so you making that first

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.430 
this world big so you making that first
way<00:04:10.879> but<00:04:11.060> he<00:04:11.150> probably<00:04:11.389> helped<00:04:11.930> everyone<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.379> a

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
way but he probably helped everyone in a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.020 
way but he probably helped everyone in a
way<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.829> confidence<00:04:13.340> like<00:04:13.430> okay<00:04:13.730> he<00:04:13.879> made

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
way that confidence like okay he made

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.150 
way that confidence like okay he made
that<00:04:14.209> yeah<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.780> know<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.379> was<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.919> really

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
that yeah you know it was it really

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.990 
that yeah you know it was it really
helped<00:04:16.340> my<00:04:16.489> confidence<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:18.560> had<00:04:19.160> heel<00:04:19.609> straps

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
helped my confidence I had heel straps

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.849 
helped my confidence I had heel straps
on<00:04:20.180> my<00:04:20.299> board<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.750> none<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.199> those<00:04:21.260> guys<00:04:21.500> did<00:04:21.799> I

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
on my board and none of those guys did I

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.120 
on my board and none of those guys did I
felt<00:04:22.190> like<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.460> had<00:04:22.610> really<00:04:22.940> good<00:04:23.060> control<00:04:24.130> but

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
felt like I had really good control but

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.310 
felt like I had really good control but
at<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.520> same<00:04:25.729> time<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.720> never<00:04:26.870> on<00:04:27.110> those

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
at the same time you never on those

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.930 
at the same time you never on those
really<00:04:27.650> biggest<00:04:28.070> waves<00:04:28.310> at<00:04:28.520> almost<00:04:28.699> every

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
really biggest waves at almost every

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.580 
really biggest waves at almost every
time<00:04:29.150> I've<00:04:29.300> been<00:04:29.449> on<00:04:29.599> one<00:04:29.780> my<00:04:30.169> board<00:04:30.410> has

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
time I've been on one my board has

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.469 
time I've been on one my board has
slowed<00:04:30.889> down<00:04:30.919> a<00:04:31.130> little<00:04:31.430> or<00:04:31.610> cavitate<00:04:32.120> at<00:04:32.240> some

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
slowed down a little or cavitate at some

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.659 
slowed down a little or cavitate at some
because<00:04:32.870> he<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.830> so<00:04:33.979> hard<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.250> handle<00:04:34.460> the

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
because he it's so hard to handle the

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.490 
because he it's so hard to handle the
speed<00:04:35.000> I<00:04:35.240> actually<00:04:35.479> had<00:04:35.719> a<00:04:35.750> four<00:04:36.050> fin<00:04:36.260> on<00:04:36.469> the

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
speed I actually had a four fin on the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.330 
speed I actually had a four fin on the
on<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.700> boat

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
on the boat

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.890 
on the boat
brand-new<00:04:38.940> one<00:04:39.150> that<00:04:39.180> I<00:04:39.360> probably<00:04:39.630> should

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
brand-new one that I probably should

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.970 
brand-new one that I probably should
have<00:04:39.930> rode<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.380> think<00:04:40.590> it<00:04:40.680> would<00:04:40.800> have<00:04:40.890> worked

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
have rode I think it would have worked

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.310 
have rode I think it would have worked
even<00:04:41.340> better<00:04:41.460> but<00:04:41.970> I'm<00:04:42.450> gonna<00:04:42.600> I'm<00:04:42.960> gonna<00:04:43.050> try

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
even better but I'm gonna I'm gonna try
