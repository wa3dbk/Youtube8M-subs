00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.600
 hi all guys welcome back 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.950
 more to my channel this is the second video 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.690
 of the week I said that in August 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.730
 I would try to make a couple of videos to the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.830
 week to follow the content of the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.480
 channel and not fail in the videos and what 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.860
 I'm doing you can not complain about 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.779
 Truth is not for throwing flowers at me but 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.220
 good to what I was going 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.929
 I'm here with Mr. Edwin , you see 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.849
 that we are sunbathing here a 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:27.740
 little on the terrace you gave us 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.150
 account but good this is another way 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.220
 more than providing them the rays 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.599
 ultraviolet to the bearded dragons and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.269
 at my feet also what happens that I do not 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.449
 I have the shade is good because as I said 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.979
 you know that the bearded dragons and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.870
 all this kind of animals that are 

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.210
 diurnal bone that need light 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.940
 ultraviolet to metabolize calcium 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.860
 and vitamin d3 because it is never 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.290
 also be able to remove them if you have any 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.000
 some balcony some terrace or 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.470
 even the street depends on the temperature 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.780
 to do for example here now in 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.150
 Spain we are doing for example I'm going 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.879
 to put yesterday night here 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.949
 we were at 99 peak of the of the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 night and is doing 29 30 degrees 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.880
 we are talking about that at noon 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.290
 I could calmly take it out to give 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.970
 back to the street or even 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.760
 anywhere, so you see 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.310
 that the sun would be fine and always and 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.620
 when he notices that he is comfortable because 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.970
 what I do not like to do is also 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.910
 many people do if you do not have time 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.470
 but I'll leave it in a tupper or some 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.600
 site where there is only sun but also 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.190
 we have to think that when he wants 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.830
 sunbathe but when you do not feel like it 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.810
 we must always leave a 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 I put a jar with fresh water and with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.200
 a bit of shadow so he 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.980
 he wants to get out of the sun is not 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.780
 evident 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.070
 and I also have another thing to say to you 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.990
 I have prepared a video that I hope that 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.580
 you like the truth that makes enough 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.380
 days since you are asking me for some 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.540
 video that is a little bit longer or that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.730
 upload more often videos and I 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.650
 They believe that I try but I tell you that 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.480
 for next week I already have a 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.870
 video that you will like enough that 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.130
 I hope it is to your liking because 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.080
 round it seems to me that pretty much goes to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 stay about 10 minutes so you go 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.580
 in the afternoon to see my animals or what 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.290
 I can promise is to grow and good this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.450
 video was simply a complementary 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.130
 of the week so that you do not stay in 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.110
 the second video since I always do 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.150
 what i say i try i try 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.620
 meet there are many people who say yes yes 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.240
 yes blah blah blah but good in the end what 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.780
 what counts is that I made them not 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.550
 well, I hope you are liking this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.350
 Video neither is anything special you 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.540
 what happens that look many times I get 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.880
 desire to take the camera and record some 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.680
 little thing that is not just a very video 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.030
 specific as explained also if 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680
 you want some specific video of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.120
 bearded dragon of a particular subject 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.830
 You can also ask me without any 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.700
 problem and we'll talk about doing it to 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.700
 see what you think is worth 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.330
 and now let's move on with a little 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.640
 very refreshing clip 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 Nothing here, as you see, Baldwin is 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.240
 that I have told you here would be in your 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.400
 terrarium but is that nothing else take the 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.920
 Sun a little while the truth that has gone 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.870
 direct to the water to cool down a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.190
 little bit so good and you see it always 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.500
 caring ideal of any kind 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.880
 any question I always tell me the 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.560
 you can leave below in the comments and 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.880
 we talk quietly so 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.770
 I hope you liked this kind of 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.930
 videos and nothing thanks to what you see me 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.340
 once again for being there in each video 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.990
 to support me for leaving you 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.370
 comments and you know we'll see you in the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.690
 next video on victorious ticks 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.690
 until the next goodbye
