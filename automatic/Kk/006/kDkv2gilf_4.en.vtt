 that promises not to give in to our 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.770
 market is the ford fusion titanium 2013 that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.779
 already notice the visual

 fusion was inspired by the concept is you 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.840
 lost that car air 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.859

 examples of refinement 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.320
 the inner space remains good

 of the seat and the end of the console 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.290
 You just can not understand the trunk that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.500
 decreased from 530 liters of the old model 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.500
 to 453 in this 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.320
 security is evolving and should not

 front with a crash alert and clear 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.599
 three point belts and head restraints 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:57.340
 for all and a lot of embedded technology 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:02:00.459
 the panel looks like a video game 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.470
 are three lcd screens two in the frame 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.929
 instruments that are triggered by 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.959
 buttons on the steering wheel and allow you to 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.290
 the vehicle at the center is sensitive to 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:13.450

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.670
 beautiful voice command system in the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.079
 mechanical parts were also made

 evolutions 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:28.420
 to start the engine is the modern ecoboost 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:34.180
 2.0 form turbo delivers 240 horsepower and 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.650
 great 34.7 pounds of torque between 1750 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.000
 and 4 thousand revolutions per minute 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.519
 features that allow you to move 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.639
 almost 1,700 kilos of the end the game with 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.480
 tranquility in both accelerations and 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.480
 in speed resumes 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.120
 clear that the good automatic 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.840
 six marches have a large participation 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.300
 this result is staggered. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.820
 to the maximum engine and in case you want 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.400
 still enjoys riding a 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.170
 possibility of sequential exchanges in the 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.140
 letters behind the wheel 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.240
 son John is only 195 years old. 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.250
 maximum due to an electronic cut 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.300
 for greater security 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.100
 but the average consumption of 5.4 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.380
 kilometers per liter of gasoline in 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.080
 our circuit does not get to be a 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.910
 exaggeration for a car of this category 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.280
 but could be better by technology 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.860
 What can not you complain about? 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.410
 stability with permanent traction in 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.870
 four wheels and firm suspension and 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.600
 independent in front behind the son 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.730
 John makes curves safely and despite 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.580
 transfer some of the tires 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.250
 unevenness of the floor is comfortable 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.670
 but you need to be careful with 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.970
 springs and low garage entrances to 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.630
 your front the middle with ease to ham 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.450
 huh 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.810
 the cool thing is that in this titanium version everything 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.640
 What you saw is standard and what it costs. 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.180
 It will be a lot of work for the 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.180
 competition 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.400
 The vadio jan titanic costs 112/1990 reais 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.950
 The only thing you 're going to have to do is 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.470
 worry about choosing the color in 37 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.110
 available time to know what notes and 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.610
 where was the maximum score in 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.270
 let's go performance 8 with 15 and then 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.970
 insecurity note 10 stability 9 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.370
 finishing 9 inner space 8 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.250
 trunk 7 in cost - effective 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.250
 also earned the maximum score 10
