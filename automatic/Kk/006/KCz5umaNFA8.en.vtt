00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.750
 the albino only costs that I unfortunately have 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.450

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.460
 predator fishing net 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.200
 I mark the tall one against and it has 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:19.090
 made this play ripping for me 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.920
 really a very beautiful a beautiful thing 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.910
 so then I also go today 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.530
 fish unfortunately that the coast is just 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 did not get along very 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.510
 difficult understand not fully promoted 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.220
 it's a very good color but yes me 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.310
 hope this white 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.600
 from erik de lang it also it good too 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.980
 not even that I lose him in 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.970
 go give it a try it is a week 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.040
 recognize me from season will is that 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.810
 not really the best time here in the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.700
 polder 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.640
 and now especially what we have such a mild winter 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.470
 have it go faster nature is confused 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.620
 You even chance that the pike is already piped 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.000
 does have it all at night though 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.440
 quite old is but 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.440
 yes it could just be 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.310
 well i now have 45 minutes with cage 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.050
 fished none and it had a couple 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.280
 feeling 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:42.330
 so now put the white ones on it 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.330
 we look at how that works 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.910
 yes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.270
 takes a moment 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.670
 better and better we will just hair 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.680
 and and space 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.670
 I'd rather sit 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.700
 call candy one of today really stand up 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:05:01.070
 the point of going home 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:05:03.220
 I still know what 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.220
 here 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:13.949
 and gone he is so well it has been beautiful 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.190
 only one fish stopped 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.180
 also my one when it goes on again 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.030
 wrapper 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.030
 The cage color you do is always good 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.310
 we are going home until next time 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.860
 we are probably in your mouth then 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:35.430
 and we hope to see a few more beautiful ones 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.580
 to be able to make videos for you 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.580
