00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.129
 50 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.499
 how much chance to save 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.549
 fugitive again 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.560
 to use the words of formation from chicago fire max 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.519
 just before he dares to expel money when Israel stops 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.089
 worry about iraq 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.089
 and then you are just as difficult to estimate that is essential 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 also in this 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.260
 I feel that I am coming up again 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.530
 thus back in oslo 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.410
 got lots of opportunities 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.110
 and believe me 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.370
 maybe wait a little longer to flatten it first 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.770
 as the other side 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.860
 try to get tourists who charge points 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.170
 according to Volmer, that his players have come to this game 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.870
 in connection with a win 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 aggressively playing string of the big market 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.410
 and what better way to go 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.410
 everyone is playing 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.670
 and in that perspective and four other players that they are finally on all those 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.460
 Puppet theater are welcome because his sister England was the other 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.800
 protagonists with reasonable agreement 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.810
 the apples sometimes gossip in a press release during the course of next week 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.799
 and now I just do not check the bus who then not injury time 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210
 a photo by a mistake 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 who doesn't own them anymore 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 anticipate 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 you just need an engine that is full of people 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.830
 and that on a bar stool 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.440
 the wk sprint the case 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.780
 almere 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 fantastic in it 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.600
 if you were a deep crisis because we are our country 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 that ban 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
 just again on those three points 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730
 that is possible until the winter break 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.230
 a little 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.770
 sagging 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.929
 that two again players are sick 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.419
 it was going to be a bit how where and why 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.849
 the player group keen on the news that I sometimes get 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.849
 van persie ran in the dark show
