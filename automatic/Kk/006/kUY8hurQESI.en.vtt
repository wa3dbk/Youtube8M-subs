something hmm

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.749 
something hmm
and<00:01:17.340> you're<00:01:17.939> draining<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:20.159> removal<00:01:20.549> water

then<00:01:22.590> Emily<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.720> keep<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> color<00:01:25.920> nice

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
then Emily and to keep the color nice

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.240 
then Emily and to keep the color nice
and<00:01:26.460> white<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> keep<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and white and I think it's to keep the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
and white and I think it's to keep the
texture<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> texture<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.780> egg<00:01:30.869> as

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
texture it the texture of the egg as

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870 
texture it the texture of the egg as
well<00:01:31.049> that's<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> vinegar<00:01:32.310> helps<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
well that's right the vinegar helps the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.390 
well that's right the vinegar helps the
egg<00:01:33.119> white<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.540> coagulate<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> can

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
egg white to coagulate and then you can

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600 
egg white to coagulate and then you can
get<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.850> nice<00:01:36.060> shape<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.079> egg<00:01:37.610> again

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
get a really nice shape on the egg again
