couple problems i do have with the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.049 
couple problems i do have with the
figure<00:00:42.590> mainly<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.980> parts<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.820> wings

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
figure mainly the parts where the wings

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.690 
figure mainly the parts where the wings
go<00:00:45.450> into<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> back<00:00:46.079> its<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.520> fall

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
go into this back its they kind of fall

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.180 
go into this back its they kind of fall
out<00:00:47.969> pretty<00:00:48.210> easily<00:00:48.450> at<00:00:48.750> least<00:00:48.930> online<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
out pretty easily at least online it's a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
out pretty easily at least online it's a
little<00:00:50.280> hard<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.700> stand<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.420> again

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
little hard to stand up but then again

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.360 
little hard to stand up but then again
you<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> use<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.379> wings<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.309> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you kind of use the wings to kind of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
you kind of use the wings to kind of
angle<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.660> stand<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.350> correctly<00:00:55.910> so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
angle and to stand up correctly so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
angle and to stand up correctly so
that's<00:00:57.090> cool<00:00:57.360> about<00:00:57.649> how<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.710> wings<00:00:59.010> work<00:00:59.309> as

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that's cool about how the wings work as

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
that's cool about how the wings work as
they<00:00:59.640> pop<00:00:59.879> off<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.989> several

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
they pop off and they got several

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.799 
they pop off and they got several
different<00:01:01.890> points<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.399> articulation<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.629> guess

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
different points of articulation I guess

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
different points of articulation I guess
one<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.610> they're

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
one right here and you can see they're

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.310 
one right here and you can see they're
really<00:01:05.909> detail<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.869> even<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
really detail and we can even see the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.560 
really detail and we can even see the
little<00:01:07.439> spikes<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:08.100> down<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.420> know

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
little spikes going down here you know

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.870 
little spikes going down here you know
very<00:01:10.200> cool<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> they<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.540> move<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.320> then

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880

you can have lots of movement with the
wings<00:01:21.799> unfortunately<00:01:22.799> does<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> wings<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
my x-men classics Archangel review too

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.590 
my x-men classics Archangel review too
if<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.000> said<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.299> moves

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
if you want to so like I said this moves

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.719 
if you want to so like I said this moves
around<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:38.100> there's<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> part<00:01:38.700> right

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
around and then there's this part right

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.749 
around and then there's this part right
here<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.560> basically<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.520> goes

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
here so then basically this just goes

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.810 
here so then basically this just goes
straight<00:01:42.570> into<00:01:43.020> his<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.799> peg<00:01:44.100> hole<00:01:44.340> right

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
straight into his little peg hole right

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.289 
straight into his little peg hole right
here<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.310> stick<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:48.000> in

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
here so you just stick that right in

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
here so you just stick that right in
there<00:01:48.770> then<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.799> usually<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.570> group<00:01:51.590> these

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there then I usually like to group these

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.190 
there then I usually like to group these
two<00:01:52.979> little<00:01:53.220> parts<00:01:53.610> right<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:53.850> together<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
two little parts right here together so

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.959 
two little parts right here together so
it's<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.890> something<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.310> grab<00:01:56.520> whenever

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's kind of something to grab whenever

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's kind of something to grab whenever
you<00:01:57.119> pick<00:01:57.299> them<00:01:57.450> up<00:01:57.570> or<00:01:57.780> something<00:01:58.229> along<00:01:58.320> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
you pick them up or something along the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.530 
you pick them up or something along the
lines<00:01:58.680> like<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.880> it's<00:01:59.969> very<00:02:00.090> cool<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
lines like that but it's very cool you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.030 
lines like that but it's very cool you
can<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> wings<00:02:01.469> all<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> way

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
can have the the wings all the way

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
can have the the wings all the way
pushed<00:02:02.340> back<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.810> have

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
pushed back like that or you can have

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
pushed back like that or you can have
them<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.799> completely<00:02:05.280> spread<00:02:05.579> apart<00:02:05.969> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
them you know completely spread apart so

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.119 
them you know completely spread apart so
it<00:02:06.390> looks<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.750> menacing<00:02:07.259> put<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.069> in

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
it looks a little menacing put them in

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.820 
it looks a little menacing put them in
flight<00:02:08.399> poses<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.000> sure<00:02:09.349> actually<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.679> him

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
flight poses I'm sure actually have him

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.990 
flight poses I'm sure actually have him
at<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> top<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.340> my<00:02:11.580> shelf<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:12.120> above<00:02:12.450> that

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
at the top of my shelf right above that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520 
at the top of my shelf right above that
and<00:02:13.120> classics<00:02:13.660> are<00:02:13.840> dangerous<00:02:14.230> i<00:02:14.350> think

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
and classics are dangerous i think

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.560 
and classics are dangerous i think
that's<00:02:14.680> pretty<00:02:14.800> cool<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> actual

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
that's pretty cool but for the actual

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.200 
that's pretty cool but for the actual
figure<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:18.040> paint<00:02:18.250> application<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:18.940> them<00:02:19.090> is

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
figure the paint application on them is

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.720 
figure the paint application on them is
pretty<00:02:19.750> decent<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.350> little<00:02:21.160> at<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.280> pain<00:02:21.550> is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
pretty decent a little at the pain is

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.340 
pretty decent a little at the pain is
rubbing<00:02:22.030> on<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> blue<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> little<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
rubbing on to the blue a little at the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.950 
rubbing on to the blue a little at the
pink<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.800> rubbing<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.430> blue<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.780> then

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
pink is rubbing on to the blue but then

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.630 
pink is rubbing on to the blue but then
that<00:02:26.110> i<00:02:26.140> think<00:02:26.410> it's<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.220> pretty<00:02:27.430> nice

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
that i think it's a it's a pretty nice

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.490 
that i think it's a it's a pretty nice
figure<00:02:28.000> i<00:02:28.030> think<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.570> head<00:02:28.720> sculpt<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.170> really

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
figure i think the head sculpt is really

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.620 
figure i think the head sculpt is really
nice<00:02:31.140> very<00:02:32.140> nice<00:02:32.350> figure<00:02:32.650> I<00:02:33.360> don't<00:02:34.360> like<00:02:34.420> how

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
nice very nice figure I don't like how

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.500 
nice very nice figure I don't like how
that<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:35.200> wrist<00:02:35.620> is<00:02:35.800> angled<00:02:36.250> though<00:02:36.510> it's

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
that this wrist is angled though it's

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.760 
that this wrist is angled though it's
kind<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:37.870> he's<00:02:38.020> doing<00:02:38.290> some<00:02:38.500> type<00:02:38.740> of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
kind of like he's doing some type of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.730 
kind of like he's doing some type of
karate<00:02:39.340> Cobra<00:02:40.000> move<00:02:40.209> or<00:02:40.480> something<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.110> don't

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.310 
karate Cobra move or something I don't
know<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.250> he's<00:02:42.370> got<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.730> closed<00:02:43.420> fist<00:02:43.840> at<00:02:44.110> an

know so he's got the closed fist at an

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.780 
know so he's got the closed fist at an
angle<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.130> hand<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.670> then<00:02:46.450> he<00:02:46.720> has<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
angle for that hand and then he has a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
vit you know it's a smaller figure so

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580 
vit you know it's a smaller figure so
I'm<00:03:10.390> sure<00:03:10.750> they<00:03:10.900> did<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.200> best<00:03:11.230> they<00:03:11.470> could

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
with the paint job then again I

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.800 
with the paint job then again I
shouldn't<00:03:18.730> really<00:03:18.850> be<00:03:18.970> impressed<00:03:19.330> with<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.720> in

start<00:03:42.850> doing<00:03:43.060> that<00:03:43.150> in<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.269> future<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:44.590> have

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
start doing that in the future they have

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.530 
start doing that in the future they have
this<00:03:44.829> weird<00:03:45.130> thigh<00:03:45.430> joint<00:03:45.489> that's<00:03:45.940> just<00:03:46.150> one

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
this weird thigh joint that's just one

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.300 
this weird thigh joint that's just one
piece<00:03:46.840> straight<00:03:47.290> down<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> knee<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.190> that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
piece straight down to the knee so that

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.030 
piece straight down to the knee so that
goes<00:03:48.489> forward<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.030> back<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.540> i<00:03:49.600> decide<00:03:50.049> two

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
goes forward and back so i decide two

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.030 
goes forward and back so i decide two
points<00:03:51.370> at<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.549> knee<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.209> then<00:03:53.040> articulation

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
points at the knee and then articulation

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.699 
points at the knee and then articulation
is<00:03:54.190> this<00:03:54.400> weird<00:03:54.730> joint<00:03:55.209> at<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.420> foot<00:03:55.780> kind<00:03:56.560> of

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
it's very functional and it works but it

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.610 
it's very functional and it works but it
actually<00:04:03.790> doesn't<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.390> doesn't<00:04:04.840> stay<00:04:05.380> when

you<00:04:07.180> push<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.540> forward<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.709> just<00:04:08.890> goes<00:04:09.070> right

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
you push it forward it just goes right

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.819
