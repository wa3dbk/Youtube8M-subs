00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 how refined the politics sometimes is 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.400
 when it comes to disagreeable laws 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.379
 say goodbye and so on 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.269
 say goodbye that no one 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.090
 she is currently on the example 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.309
 they have the so-called reporting law 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.509
 yes determined by but that alone 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.430
 to push politics is one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.920
 just carry the media too 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.960
 a responsibility because they have yes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.119
 they are a so-called watchdog function 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 the fourth violence in the state how to do it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.180
 says nice and that is especially true for 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.320
 the public broadcaster ard 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.000
 and zdf 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.329
 because they entertain for expensive 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.040
 fees with capital studios 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.390
 specially created parliament 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.850
 Editors really wonder 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 what are they actually for when the im 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.379
 not paying attention to decisive moment 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 how could it happen that ard and zdf 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.879
 slept for more than a week 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 Before you finally get to this topic 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.559
 became attentive though it was more than 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.559
 has given enough hints 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.240
 the european championship is in these 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.010
 weeks yes for many theme number one 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 So football is almost everyone's favorite 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.340
 attention to yourself 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.110
 I bet you hear it now, for example 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.250
 hardly what I tell them and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.870
 pay attention only to the German 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.910
 punking and cheering 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.560
 And that's exactly one chance for everyone 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.360
 government because in this time you can 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 for example, new taxes and fees 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
 at all possible resolutions 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.930
 announce the normal times heated 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.030
 discussions or even protests 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.800
 they would have everything 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.020
 heard at all how clever 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.750
 Politicians distract the football time 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.619
 Benefit explained Eckert that's really 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.590
 remarkable 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.030
 the daytime topics whose task it is for us 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 to inform comprehensively 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 you're basically walking with yourself here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.830
 Criticized in the court in the admitted 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.570
 will that be at the 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.520
 football european championship like times 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 is used on the fast laws 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 to get rid of those 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.820
 if possible no one should notice something 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.440
 but the really bad thing is that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990
 one contributing nothing of its own 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.590
 learn this day's issue 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.260
 is from 26 june and 2 days later 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.430
 This is exactly what happened here 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.430
 was critically eyed 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.890
 the agenda item 21 second and 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.480
 third consultation of the of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.370
 federal government 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 Bill on the further development of the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000
 reporting system 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.580
 as stated in the agenda 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.459
 the talks are taken to protocol 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.020
 and we come to the vote of the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.610
 Committee recommends in its 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.780
 decision on printed matter 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.770
 10,000 158 the bill of the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.319
 Federal Government on printed matter 7 1746 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.319
 take in the committee-making 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.230
 I ask those who agree 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.050
 want to thank the hand sign who 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.390
 on the other hand, thanks, we abstain 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.990
 The bill is thus in second place 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.110
 Consultation accepted third consultation and 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.940
 circuit-vote 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.040
 I ask those who 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.410
 bill want to agree 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.350
 raise 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.880
 Thank you, we agree with the German 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.620
 Bundestag resolves during the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.569
 semi-final match Italy against 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.680
 Germany that the state in the future 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.170
 shops with the addresses of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.120
 Citizens can make citizens and these 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.660
 have hardly any options against it 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.360
 fight 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.670
 the original bill of the 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.930
 data protection should become short 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.880
 just before voting 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.209
 committee and modified into 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.239
 opposite runs 57 seconds 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.110
 the parliament deals with the matter 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.420
 prepared talk to the law 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.100
 are indeed taken to log but 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 not held in Bundestag 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.870
 pity because the spd seconded gabriele 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.940
 fograscher was one of the few 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.489
 active fighters against the 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.799
 amended bill in their not 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.420
 Last speech is said last 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.459
 minute you have in the committee 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.380
 amendment submitted by the 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.600
 positive beginnings of the original 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.940
 draft law to the contrary 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.100
 and that's a massive one 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 weakening the privacy of these 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.489
 Change therefore means a clear one 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.950
 relapse behind the rules of 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.190
 previous law and fograscher 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.500
 gives up on a day later on 29 june 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.600
 the spd Bundestag faction in their 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.460
 Name a press release out in 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.770
 again the criticisms of the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.990
 amended reporting law 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.330
 but watching TV is interesting 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.289
 nobody fograscher confirms this too 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.100
 in response to a request 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.610
 from tv review tv 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.500
 Of course we have this 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.600
 Facts about the media worn 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.650
 he found only at this time none 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.990
 great attention 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.060
 to the few media pages on the net the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.039
 autogas press release reacted 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.500
 belonged to heise.de 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.020
 there they also published on 29 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.630
 june an article on the topic of but 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.910
 no attention was possibly paid 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.740
 the headline too technocratic and so on 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.360
 passed several days and the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.840
 the lobbyists obviously the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.240
 had threaded plan 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.520
 already rubbed their hands too early 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.169
 hardly was the wm fever 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:11.030
 subsided the topic suddenly boiled 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:14.370
 up again and again on the internet 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.350
 on july 2nd time online in 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.729
 An article unfortunately also got it 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.440
 hardly anyone with diverse 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.630
 Data protection officers reported on the fourth of July 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.900
 that the Bundestag six days 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.669
 had previously secretly passed 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.590
 this was also the occasion for chip online 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.540
 to publish an article about it 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 how the data protection trampled 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.200
 this time at least one 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.479
 Heading the facts clearly 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.639
 made in the evening news of ard 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.520
 and zdf was still not an issue 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.669
 neither on the fourth of July nor on the fifth 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.590
 july on the 6th of july was the 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.810
 thematic days look today 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.220
 Safety has long been known for the topic 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.729
 was on the internet now in all 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.039
 munde 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.840
 whether on twitter whether on facebook or 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.760
 in various blogs only on the seventh july 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.620
 expect the ladies and gentlemen of 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.700
 suddenly watch TV from her 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.680
 sleeping beauty 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.300
 good evening my ladies and gentlemen me 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.430
 Welcome to the daily show 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.320
 the opposition just wants that 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.729
 decided new registration right in the 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.979
 Federal Council stop 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.380
 the new regulation allows private 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.479
 Companies like address traders in official 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.800
 register on personal data of 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.500
 citizens to access 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.570
 the transfer of private addresses too 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:30.120
 commercial purposes is for many 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.130
 already annoying enough if it too 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.200
 nor is the state itself the data 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.990
 makes his citizen money just like 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.240
 of deputies of the government coalition 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.820
 the decision is made by the indignation of the citizens 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.550
 and privacy protectors sure self-criticism 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.710
 little in the tagesthemen from 9 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.690
 even an almost cheeky one takes place on July 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.020
 Comment by the rbb journalist Anna 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.180
 curie read about 20 deputies sitting in the 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.280
 Plenary during the rest of the football apparently 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.440
 Nobody looks forward and storms 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.479
 By the way, the red card also shows the red card 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.240
 Opposition is not loud now 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:05.250
 indignant days later, they notice 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.780
 gradually involved as well 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.060
 an owner was shot 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.400
 but it's not just a stupid breakdown 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.770
 it is an embarrassing report of poverty 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.430
 there will be basic short term 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.710
 changes 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.630
 Done in the bill because knows 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.370
 one not what the other one is doing there 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.900
 things waved through without 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.480
 thinking about consequences 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.310
 I am afraid and who knows what 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.120
 the ladies and gentlemen still so bless 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.650
 without looking 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.140
 and then you wonder about 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:33.180
 This is not politics 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.980
 outrageous this lady leaves completely 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.780
 Under the table, it's up to you 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.630
 especially the public media 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.270
 would have been watching closely and how 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.550
 said the spd Bundestag faction had said 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.630
 a press release issued the 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.180
 certainly on the 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.550
 desks landed by ard and zdf 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.770
 was and quickly disappeared in the trash 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.500
