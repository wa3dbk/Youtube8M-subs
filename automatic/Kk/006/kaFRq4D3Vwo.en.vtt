00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
across the water barrier and it will die

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.550 
across the water barrier and it will die
in<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> lava<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.200> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> goes

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
in the lava one so it kind of goes

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.050 
in the lava one so it kind of goes
through<00:01:25.830> water<00:01:26.100> which<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.460> makes<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.790> sort<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
through water which it makes it sort of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
through water which it makes it sort of
waterproof<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.409> cool<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.369> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
waterproof and really really cool but in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.940 
waterproof and really really cool but in
case<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.240> sleeping<00:01:30.990> i<00:01:31.200> will<00:01:31.470> show

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
case you have been sleeping i will show

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.240 
case you have been sleeping i will show
that<00:01:32.159> again<00:01:32.490> demonstrate<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.420> again<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that again demonstrate it again and the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.340 
that again demonstrate it again and the
trickier<00:01:35.640> as<00:01:36.180> i<00:01:36.360> mentioned<00:01:36.750> earlier<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
trickier as i mentioned earlier is to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
trickier as i mentioned earlier is to
place<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.430> sort<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> weight<00:01:39.060> between<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
place it sort of weight between it so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
place it sort of weight between it so
patience<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> key<00:01:40.770> young<00:01:41.159> ones<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:42.030> as<00:01:42.119> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
patience is key young ones well as it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
patience is key young ones well as it
will<00:01:42.360> turn<00:01:42.570> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> glitchy<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.649> thoughts

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
will turn kind of glitchy and I thoughts

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.060 
will turn kind of glitchy and I thoughts
this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.670> already<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.210> glitch<00:01:45.540> itself<00:01:46.530> sort<00:01:46.979> of

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
this is already a glitch itself sort of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.819 
this is already a glitch itself sort of
a<00:01:47.189> glitch<00:01:47.880> technique<00:01:48.420> sort<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.560> will

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
a glitch technique sort of thing it will

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.819 
a glitch technique sort of thing it will
