have<00:01:43.869> thought<00:01:44.079> that<00:01:44.140> work<00:01:44.619> maybe<00:01:45.100> drive<00:01:45.369> down

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
have thought that work maybe drive down

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.550 
have thought that work maybe drive down
so<00:01:45.729> ever<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.000> does<00:01:46.179> what<00:01:46.899> I<00:01:46.929> can<00:01:47.140> interesting

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
so ever it does what I can interesting

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.690 
so ever it does what I can interesting
is<00:01:47.679> that<00:01:47.710> it<00:01:47.860> will<00:01:47.979> not<00:01:48.009> work<00:01:48.369> with<00:01:48.640> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
is that it will not work with the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.639 
is that it will not work with the
Genesis<00:01:49.149> game<00:01:49.329> might<00:01:49.569> have<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:49.990> specifically

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
thing that's what you're gonna do so as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.550 
thing that's what you're gonna do so as
you<00:02:24.370> can<00:02:24.459> see<00:02:24.519> mega<00:02:24.970> drive<00:02:25.180> side<00:02:25.560> quite

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you can see mega drive side quite

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.910 
you can see mega drive side quite
exciting<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.849> let's<00:02:28.000> just<00:02:28.450> jump<00:02:28.510> over<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
exciting so let's just jump over to the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.180 
exciting so let's just jump over to the
the<00:02:32.920> other<00:02:33.010> side<00:02:33.130> PC<00:02:33.730> side<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.829> just<00:02:35.980> flick

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the other side PC side so we just flick

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.559 
the other side PC side so we just flick
this<00:02:36.340> switch<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.790> front<00:02:37.000> Mega<00:02:37.329> Drive

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
switch it cuts power from what I can

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.420 
switch it cuts power from what I can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
joypad responds in PC mode so what I'll
