00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
a basically a special order this one is

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.339 
a basically a special order this one is
for<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.359> my<00:00:24.510> subscribers<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.500> YouTube<00:00:26.090> who

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
for one of my subscribers on YouTube who

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.019 
for one of my subscribers on YouTube who
request<00:00:28.349> me<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> build<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.310> him<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
request me to build one for him so I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
request me to build one for him so I
went<00:00:30.420> ahead<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.689> did<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.009> actually

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
went ahead and did it and I actually

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.470 
went ahead and did it and I actually
offered<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.770> air<00:00:34.770> foil<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.460> wings<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
offered to do air foil on the wings so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.260 
offered to do air foil on the wings so
this<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.930> half<00:00:37.110> actually<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.620> airfoil<00:00:38.270> this

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this one half actually an airfoil this

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.069 
this one half actually an airfoil this
wing<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.809> made<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.710> 1-inch<00:00:41.550> foam<00:00:42.079> you

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
wing was made is with 1-inch foam you

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.229 
wing was made is with 1-inch foam you
know<00:00:43.200> one<00:00:43.410> inch<00:00:43.590> thick<00:00:43.920> foam<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
know one inch thick foam and not just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.740 
know one inch thick foam and not just
sended<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.140> air<00:00:46.289> foil<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:48.120> does<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sended the air foil on it it does take a

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
sended the air foil on it it does take a
little<00:00:48.899> bit<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> time<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
little bit of time to do it but it's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.430 
little bit of time to do it but it's
worth<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> lot<00:00:51.989> easier<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
worth it because it's a lot easier to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.869 
worth it because it's a lot easier to
place<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> wind<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.699> don't

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
place the wind you know you don't

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
place the wind you know you don't
require<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.390> much<00:00:54.739> carbon<00:00:55.739> fiber<00:00:56.039> together

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
silver one okay look at the airfoil I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
silver one okay look at the airfoil I
don't<00:01:46.049> know<00:01:46.110> how<00:01:46.259> good<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.649> pick<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> up

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
don't know how good you can pick it up

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.510 
don't know how good you can pick it up
because<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.759> very<00:01:47.970> tangina<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.280> wind

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
because it's very tangina but this wind

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
because it's very tangina but this wind
is<00:01:50.579> very<00:01:50.640> strong<00:01:50.939> guys<00:01:52.280> hey<00:01:53.299> don't<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.450> how

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is very strong guys hey don't know how

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.959 
is very strong guys hey don't know how
good<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.140> their<00:01:55.290> photo<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.969> but

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
good you can see their photo on it but

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.010 
good you can see their photo on it but
it<00:01:57.540> works<00:01:57.810> good<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:59.369> plane<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.670> rock<00:02:00.119> solid<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it works good the plane is rock solid it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.219 
it works good the plane is rock solid it
tracks<00:02:01.380> very<00:02:01.740> good<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> air<00:02:03.229> actually

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
tracks very good on the air actually

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.210 
tracks very good on the air actually
some

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
some

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.630 
some
some<00:02:05.880> guys<00:02:06.120> are<00:02:06.150> already<00:02:06.630> building<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
some guys are already building it and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
some guys are already building it and
hopefully<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.270> seeing<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.780> videos

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
hopefully we will be seeing some videos

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.090 
hopefully we will be seeing some videos
