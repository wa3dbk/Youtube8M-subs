00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
it's shrunk by and increase it decrease

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.490 
it's shrunk by and increase it decrease
it<00:02:06.729> so<00:02:07.479> I'm<00:02:07.569> just<00:02:07.719> going<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:07.929> keep<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.319> around

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
it so I'm just going to keep it around

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.390 
it so I'm just going to keep it around
five<00:02:09.300> now<00:02:10.300> extrude<00:02:11.080> what<00:02:11.709> this<00:02:11.890> does<00:02:12.099> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
five now extrude what this does is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.880 
five now extrude what this does is
basically<00:02:12.640> pushes<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.630> your<00:02:14.260> selections

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
basically pushes out your selections

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.430 
basically pushes out your selections
from<00:02:15.220> your<00:02:15.430> object<00:02:15.790> as<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.870> over<00:02:16.900> here<00:02:17.080> as

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
from your object as you see over here as

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.160 
from your object as you see over here as
I<00:02:17.650> increase<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.400> offset<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:19.020> increases<00:02:20.020> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
I increase the offset it increases the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.350 
I increase the offset it increases the
amount<00:02:20.260> of<00:02:20.680> selections<00:02:21.610> pushed<00:02:21.850> out<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.270> is

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
amount of selections pushed out and is

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.540 
amount of selections pushed out and is
as<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.810> decrease<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.470> into<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.860> minus

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
as I decrease it into the minus

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.610 
as I decrease it into the minus
it<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.360> pushes<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.080> way<00:02:26.170> back<00:02:26.350> in

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
it just pushes it all the way back in

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.380 
it just pushes it all the way back in
and<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:27.340> couldn't<00:02:27.670> give<00:02:27.820> some<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.240> nice

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
and this couldn't give some really nice

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500 
and this couldn't give some really nice
effects<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.110> anything<00:02:29.650> you're<00:02:30.010> modeling<00:02:30.510> like

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
effects on anything you're modeling like

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.210 
effects on anything you're modeling like
so<00:02:31.990> so<00:02:32.230> let<00:02:32.350> me<00:02:32.440> just<00:02:32.590> put<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:32.830> up<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.250> 15<00:02:33.730> now

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so so let me just put this up to 15 now

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
so so let me just put this up to 15 now
so<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:37.390> we've<00:02:38.020> got<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.560> do<00:02:38.710> bevel<00:02:39.250> what<00:02:39.970> Bella

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
so now we've got to do bevel what Bella

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.850 
so now we've got to do bevel what Bella
does<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.720> basically<00:02:40.900> what<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> name<00:02:41.680> implies

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
does is basically what the name implies

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.780 
does is basically what the name implies
it<00:02:42.400> bevels<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.030> edges<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.720> selection

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
it bevels the edges of the selection

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.790 
it bevels the edges of the selection
extrusion<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:45.910> how<00:02:46.090> much<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.420> sticks<00:02:46.690> out<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
extrusion is how much it sticks out as I

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.830 
extrusion is how much it sticks out as I
as<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.400> increase<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:49.060> sticks<00:02:49.330> out<00:02:49.480> even<00:02:49.810> more

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
as I increase it it sticks out even more

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.230 
as I increase it it sticks out even more
and<00:02:50.140> inner<00:02:51.070> offset<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.730> how<00:02:51.880> much<00:02:52.030> it's

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
and inner offset is how much it's

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.190 
and inner offset is how much it's
beveled<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.230> put<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.680> as<00:02:53.860> 10<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.930> you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
beveled so if I put it as 10 like so you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.960 
beveled so if I put it as 10 like so you
can<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.130> increasing<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
can see that it's increasing and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.210 
can see that it's increasing and
decreasing<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:59.230> don't<00:02:59.410> want<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.620> overdo<00:02:59.920> this

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
decreasing you don't want to overdo this

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.950 
decreasing you don't want to overdo this
or<00:03:00.430> else<00:03:00.520> oh<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.940> give<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> really<00:03:01.360> bad<00:03:01.510> effect

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
or else oh just give a really bad effect

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.920 
or else oh just give a really bad effect
but<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.290> mean<00:03:02.730> experimental<00:03:03.810> experiment<00:03:04.810> with

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
but I mean experimental experiment with

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.190 
but I mean experimental experiment with
it<00:03:04.960> guys<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.500> see<00:03:06.370> what<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:06.640> get<00:03:07.200> generally

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
it guys and see what you get generally

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.610 
it guys and see what you get generally
this<00:03:08.350> at<00:03:08.560> five<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:10.330> at<00:03:10.540> 10<00:03:12.810> now<00:03:13.810> finally

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
this at five and this at 10 now finally

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.030 
this at five and this at 10 now finally
what<00:03:15.460> matrix<00:03:15.730> X<00:03:16.210> 2<00:03:16.420> does<00:03:16.690> is<00:03:16.960> basically<00:03:17.440> it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
what matrix X 2 does is basically it's

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.760 
what matrix X 2 does is basically it's
the<00:03:18.730> same<00:03:18.850> as<00:03:19.090> extrude<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.410> lot<00:03:20.590> more

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
the same as extrude just a lot more

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.740 
the same as extrude just a lot more
dynamic<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.490> a<00:03:21.610> lot<00:03:21.790> more<00:03:21.940> options<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.510> work

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
dynamic and a lot more options to work

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.830 
dynamic and a lot more options to work
with<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:24.040> as<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.730> see<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.060> increase<00:03:25.360> this

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
with so as you see as I increase this

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.220 
with so as you see as I increase this
day<00:03:25.900> 08<00:03:26.230> first<00:03:26.710> let<00:03:26.860> me<00:03:26.920> enable<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:27.610> as<00:03:28.230> I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
day 08 first let me enable this as I

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.930 
day 08 first let me enable this as I
increase<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.950> steps<00:03:30.280> let's<00:03:30.580> start<00:03:30.820> off<00:03:30.910> with

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
increase the steps let's start off with

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.210 
increase the steps let's start off with
that<00:03:31.180> other<00:03:31.360> increase<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.959> steps<00:03:32.220> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
that other increase of steps it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.790 
that other increase of steps it
increases<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.090> amount<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:35.110> sticks<00:03:35.410> out<00:03:35.590> and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
increases the amount it sticks out and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.490 
increases the amount it sticks out and
the<00:03:36.220> amount<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.580> progressions<00:03:37.209> like<00:03:37.420> so<00:03:37.660> so

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the amount of progressions like so so

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.120 
the amount of progressions like so so
let<00:03:38.620> me<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.800> bring<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.070> back<00:03:39.130> down<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.640> one

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
let me just bring this back down to one

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.430 
let me just bring this back down to one
what<00:03:42.130> move<00:03:42.400> does<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.420> first<00:03:43.810> one<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.290> brings

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
what move does the first one it brings

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.729 
what move does the first one it brings
it<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.950> moves<00:03:45.220> it<00:03:45.459> up<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.910> down<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:47.590> off

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
it it moves it up and down and first off

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.720 
it it moves it up and down and first off
you<00:03:47.860> want<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.040> make<00:03:48.190> sure<00:03:48.220> that<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
you want to make sure that you

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.280 
you want to make sure that you
understand<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.570> selections<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:50.170> the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
understand that the selections on the

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.020 
understand that the selections on the
tip<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.709> doesn't<00:03:50.770> it's<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:51.580> actually<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
tip it doesn't it's not actually the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.800 
tip it doesn't it's not actually the
whole<00:03:52.209> thing<00:03:52.510> it's<00:03:53.110> just<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.680> tip<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:55.360> just

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
whole thing it's just on the tip so just

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.960 
whole thing it's just on the tip so just
this<00:03:56.200> one<00:03:56.410> just<00:03:56.530> moves<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:57.010> out<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.550> moves<00:03:57.730> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
this one just moves it out and moves it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.320 
this one just moves it out and moves it
up<00:03:58.209> like<00:03:58.750> so<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.709> middle<00:04:00.100> one<00:04:00.130> twists<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.120> in

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
up like so the middle one twists it in

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.960 
up like so the middle one twists it in
either<00:04:01.660> direction<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:03.160> last<00:04:03.400> one<00:04:03.670> it

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
either direction and the last one it

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.930 
either direction and the last one it
sort<00:04:04.630> of<00:04:04.690> brings<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.170> in<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.670> brings<00:04:06.670> it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
sort of brings it in and brings it

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.979 
sort of brings it in and brings it
sticks<00:04:07.270> it<00:04:07.450> out<00:04:07.980> now<00:04:08.980> as<00:04:09.310> for<00:04:09.520> scale<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.780> one

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
sticks it out now as for scale this one

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.920 
sticks it out now as for scale this one
works<00:04:11.290> with<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.739> height<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:13.450> one<00:04:13.690> works

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
works with the height this one works

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.289 
works with the height this one works
with<00:04:14.110> width<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:15.489> one<00:04:15.700> really<00:04:15.880> doesn't

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
with width and this one really doesn't

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.830 
with width and this one really doesn't
do<00:04:16.359> anything<00:04:18.180> rotation<00:04:19.180> you've<00:04:19.419> got<00:04:19.720> to

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
do anything rotation you've got to

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.840 
do anything rotation you've got to
notice<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.290> it's<00:04:20.709> affects<00:04:21.130> only<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.609> tip<00:04:21.790> of

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
notice that it's affects only the tip of

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.620 
notice that it's affects only the tip of
this<00:04:22.230> so<00:04:23.230> rotation<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.340> first<00:04:24.640> one<00:04:24.880> it's<00:04:25.150> like

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
this so rotation the first one it's like

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.130 
this so rotation the first one it's like
up<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.290> down<00:04:26.350> rotation<00:04:27.100> like<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:28.660> second

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
up and down rotation like so the second

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.430 
up and down rotation like so the second
one<00:04:29.320> it's<00:04:29.620> from<00:04:29.950> side<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:30.490> side<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:32.200> last

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
one it's from side to side and the last

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.130 
one it's from side to side and the last
one<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.950> twists<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.729> whole<00:04:33.910> thing<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.330> this

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
one it twists the whole thing and this

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.659 
one it twists the whole thing and this
cancer<00:04:35.560> really<00:04:35.890> gives<00:04:36.100> some<00:04:36.280> really<00:04:36.490> nice

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669

that's how I found out what to do and
how<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.370> use<00:04:51.610> them<00:04:51.640> and<00:04:52.470> yeah<00:04:53.470> that's

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
how to use them and yeah that's
