00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.280
 from there we want to be helpful 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.970

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.520
 where he has Collin Benjamin 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.729

 to some people the children who sound Traina the tears of the eyes 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.009

 Namibia and Germany in Namibia used to be called German-southwest but that is 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:27.879
 long ago 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.150

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.529
