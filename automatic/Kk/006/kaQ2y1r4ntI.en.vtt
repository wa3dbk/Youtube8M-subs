00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.920
 the one side 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.329
 Violating Michael Jackson fans around the world 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.540
 all this from life 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.540
 helena do 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.950
 he does that because they come with limited resources at once and start participating 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.380
 on 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.539
 but then of course you have to look the creepy 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.120
 this record attempt is now being organized for the third time, also in 2006 and 2008 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.380
 was done in various countries of course if you did in all sorts of positions and on 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.170
 squares 8 to break this record must be more than eight hundred worldwide 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 People join in the reason they risk coming because everyone else 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.260
 unconsciously later on the game because they actually and actually a bit 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.820
 enjoy the king of pop of course 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.540
 so this year unfortunately go again 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.659
 subjects 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:02.810
 then the resident 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.780
 the first video clip was shot in all directions 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 that set meter came down 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.100
 I can still make it fatter it has a year earlier 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.290
 minister the club and 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.290
 well really abuse yes this was returned 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.400
 we don't have that I know what I can do there will be a type once 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.460
 before the country starts we have all dance passes through again 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.300
 taken 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.500
 2 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.500
 year 20 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 very handy for me because a small group has 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 he continues, except a few later 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.680
 and just too late 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.680
 I'm curious about it, I'm only a little bit there 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.580
 and then open 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.610
 holwerda 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.020
 both eventually won in particular while being able to drive they had better 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 than had been nullified so also known there 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 3 no and then really ended 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 because it's almost time 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.199
 the 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.279
 No 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.699
 yes and of course an introduction to laren the reasoning and yes i hope 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.029
 next year again 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:09.159
 completely fit 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.509
 to sue the judge 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.509
 which stipulates that also has to do with spending cuts and lead jobs 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.889
 I no longer had the goal, so that was the most important thing in the first one 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.599
 measurement idiot plan to 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.829
 together with all of them and nurses in the Amsterdam airport 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.329
 but I have to say that it was really great and I think it was quite often 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.379
 so very very bad 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.069
 and now to bed because 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.069
 I always start feeling more than without it 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.930
 the
