00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
dash of it all right and then we want a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.429 
dash of it all right and then we want a
wee<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.530> salt<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.900> remember<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
hoisin zhilie bit sweet so you need a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.980

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little bit more salt than you probably

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
little bit more salt than you probably
would<00:01:10.170> usually<00:01:10.409> pop<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> then

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
would usually pop it and then

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.780 
would usually pop it and then
bicarbonate<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.810> soda<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.610> use

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
bicarbonate of soda this is what we use

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
bicarbonate of soda this is what we use
to<00:01:14.820> tenderize<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> meat

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
to tenderize the meat

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
to tenderize the meat
yeah<00:01:16.049> relaxes<00:01:16.560> all<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> proteins<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
yeah relaxes all the proteins of the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
yeah relaxes all the proteins of the
meat<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:17.790> when<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> bite<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.720> there's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
meat so when you bite into it there's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
meat so when you bite into it there's
much<00:01:19.170> less<00:01:19.409> resistance<00:01:20.009> that's<00:01:20.159> just<00:01:20.340> really

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
much less resistance that's just really

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
much less resistance that's just really
succulent<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> helps<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> hold<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
succulent and it helps to hold all the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.370 
succulent and it helps to hold all the
moisture<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.210> amazing<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.780> then<00:01:25.080> corn

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
moisture in is amazing and then corn

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.880 
moisture in is amazing and then corn
flour<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> velvety<00:01:26.610> mouthfeel<00:01:27.710> wee<00:01:28.710> bit<00:01:28.860> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
flour for a velvety mouthfeel wee bit of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
flour for a velvety mouthfeel wee bit of
debt<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:29.880> finally<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.630> some<00:01:30.720> water<00:01:30.990> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
debt and then finally just some water to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
debt and then finally just some water to
bring<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.619> together<00:01:32.659> so<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.720> give<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
bring it all together so just give that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780
