00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 It is also true that as you told me 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.060
 when some parents already have a car and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.830
 a light chair 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.110
 It should be noted that obviously in the 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.410
 market there are many very good chairs in 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.330
 the market but nothing that can be 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.430
 resemble there is no market chair 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.170
 currently lighter than the combi 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.200
 I was using a chair that weighs 3 kilos 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.290
 600 that with the little finger we can 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.119
 lift easily and comfortably without any 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.759
 kind of problem I also think that if you 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 are approved for choosing it is 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.720
 absolutely nothing is incredible is that 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.640
 So there is a new standard of lightness and 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.989
 is what it is is something out of the ordinary to 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.820
 what are we to numbers in europe 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.460
 we also put it to the same 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.260
 when I told you that in Japan the subject 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.480
 of technology and then and new 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.730
 materials that are very light and sometimes 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.680
 very resistant this leading companies in 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 this kind of articles that's why I told you 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950
 before when the rest of the world is going 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.990
 the soaps of ya come back in two 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.550
 elections and here and here it shows 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.650
 for that type of product 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 first of all if we realize anything 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.820
 more the design that this chair has 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.619
 leaves the conventional of the common and of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.390
 any conventional chair that we can 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.670
 find in the European market that of 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.590
 entry after point number 2 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 It is a chair that apart from being very 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.619
 very light comfortable 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.720
 we are going to the same thing they are looking to see what 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.369
 handy the light with one hand 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.579
 we can take our baby to our 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.799
 child in a right arm caught and 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.600
 with one hand we simply do this the 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.600
 we use the chair and we can take it 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.840
 dragging with the same hand we open the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 chair we will take our children what 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.990
 we will place in the saddle and we 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.799
 we would march comfortably with the 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.890
 placing in the cav others in the hood 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.289
 but the important thing is the softness and 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.119
 handling makes one be so light clear is 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.740
 that the mother does not suffer absolutely 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.560
 nothing when it comes to driving a car 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.470
 down the street because it's a car that weighs 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.569
 to its use as it is in light does not cost 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.990
 nothing to wear is super super manageable 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.149
 very very easy to handle it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.549
 you can amazing and you can see it 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.950
 with an incredible lightness in what you 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.780
 you said here they take light did not push 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.599
 exactly takes and then the thing very 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.060
 important that being cane handlebar 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.830
 forgive the way the corrido is much more 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.599
 comfortable when handling it because the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.560
 mother can take a free hand to 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.440
 anything else 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.080
 and still carrying the perfect car 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.900
 well because what happens to us with many 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.330
 of the light carts that have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.310
 way of cane is that this is easy 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260
 you can not use it any more 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.570
 quite tends to leave aside 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.120
 towards the other agreed and as you have 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.640
 seen comfort with one hand 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.960
 we fold is that it is very compact 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.790
 I say to rogelio that I come for these 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.680
 things and what is amazing technology 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 that in such a simple gesture to leave 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.720
 of the technology that is there in fact 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.280
 there's a video that has a combi that looks 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 a mother who goes with a child and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.090
 simply this takes it kind bag and 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.980
 you take the code that could 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.360
 easily without any sport 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 because then absolutely nothing the 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.360
 car we open and with one hand
