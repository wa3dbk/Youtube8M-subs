nothing open it's been closed for a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
nothing open it's been closed for a
couple<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.760> days<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.420> um<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:22.440> just<00:02:22.980> seems<00:02:23.160> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
couple of days but um it just seems to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.110 
couple of days but um it just seems to
come<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.730> go

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
come and go

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.940 
come and go
sometimes<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.050> closed<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.470> days<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.830> then

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
sometimes it's closed for days and then

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.830 
sometimes it's closed for days and then
a<00:02:26.069> little<00:02:26.550> dragon<00:02:26.880> again<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.660> I'm

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a little dragon again and it's like I'm

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800 
a little dragon again and it's like I'm
telling<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.350> pinpoint<00:02:29.130> died<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.540> have<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
telling you a pinpoint died we have the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.949 
telling you a pinpoint died we have the
two<00:02:30.959> incisions<00:02:31.319> meet<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.720> think<00:02:33.720> I'd<00:02:33.900> have

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
two incisions meet so I think I'd have

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.320 
two incisions meet so I think I'd have
to<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.200> back<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.560> see<00:02:34.739> my<00:02:34.950> surgeon<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.090> few

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
