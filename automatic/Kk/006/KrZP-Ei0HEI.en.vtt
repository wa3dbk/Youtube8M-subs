00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.629
 when 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.170
 It's time 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:31.160
 this damian reminder castera g30 a game of the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.560
 Basque Country of Anglet 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.660
 I am a professional longboarder and 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.820
 for two or three years I've been in 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 the free surf I came back to 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.739
 small boards and the trip 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.660
 exploration 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.489
 I preferred the free surf or everything 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.070
 simply because we are more free to 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.900
 do what you want when you want 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 here is to choose your destination choose 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.989
 people and who have by and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 the possibility of ending up in a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 where njawe people is the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.040
 solution to be alone at the peaks 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 and to think outside the box 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.360
 to the adventurous far from the beaches with bikini 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.880
 fringed terrace where flows the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:15.900
 caipirinha I made a first 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 traveling between 18 and 20 with my 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.150
 first trip for his 1 2 - from indonesia 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.490
 so I knew how to put everything in 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.509
 more crazy after the virus learned 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.509
 and then I did not stop 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.790
 so he ended up finding himself 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.620
 in an old cuckoo flying over alaska 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.510
 and there for once is the destination 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.990
 for those who really want to be 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.250
 I went away all month 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170
 of August is the month of last September 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.910
 in alaska 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.460
 I passed the first time made 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.620
 visiting the country is the second month on 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 actually stayed in the south east of 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.260
 alaska we set up the camp and here we go 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.560
 discover new waves 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.800
 make a film and photos 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.240
 with 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.520
 so it's quite special because there is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.560
 white mountains covered with 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.070
 snow just a bottom so that's really 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.940
 magnificent 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.340
 and so that's one less autonomy 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.410
 danger will be fished to ride the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.950
 spots there is nobody is enough 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.690
 exceptional 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 I decided to go there because 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.370
 Alaska is a bit of the last bastion 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.120
 in fact there is that which is preserved at 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.500
 surf level 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.660
 there are just 2 3 2 or 3000 km of coastline 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.310
 it's crumpled wild and has not 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 a lot of road so it's true he 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.470
 There's nobody 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 - that's really the point that got me 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.350
 therefore motivated to find myself in 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.020
 beautiful places and surf alone 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.580
 for more than a month 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.750
 in addition to that it was the experience 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.730
 I really wanted to do a 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.570
 experience with and in the middle of sea urchins 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.920
 wilderness one so that there is no 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.750
 a lot of better places on earth for 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.750
 to meet the beasts like that 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.980
 at axis level redfish enough 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.840
 varied there are 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.209
 the palau finally in front of the camp and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.400
 had a break that was the jewel 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.900
 good hundred kilometers so 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.290
 really big beaches with 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.190
 spruce fir forests of it 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.750
 really beautiful 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.909
 so here it's beachbreak a bit like 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.209
 in the moors with tubes of the peaks 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.330
 everywhere else we surfed a very very 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.370
 beautiful wave on a sand point that 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.230
 is called graveyard and that runs on 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.170
 at least 200 m so that was really 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.700
 the most beautiful wave of the trip 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.299
 I rarely surf waves too 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.629
 as well here it is otherwise there was there is 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.519
 some spots with rock but good 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:52.790
 that is if there is no risk to launch 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.379
 it's not more jewel and spikes 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.269
 trips that leaves in mind the 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.469
 time to wander and to feather the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.390
 leisure to escape 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.819
 damien castera is the author of several 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.269
 books are our hobby his 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.269
 other passion 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.609
 I'm doing a training this winter on 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.840
 published in edition so to learn to 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.439
 to be a publisher or to work in an agency 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.940
 10 years publishing house this is it 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.949
 something that's voting me since 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.359
 a few years ago I had a little 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.190
 time between two trips 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.680
 so that's something 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.120
 would be on him me I do not have the project 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.830
 still the surf 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.750
 I would like there is a flower at the same 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.760
 time 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.990
 maybe publishing projects why 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.460
 no books 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.460
 beautiful photo books or even 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.719
 in the litterature 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.729
 indeed if words can count 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.379
 many wonders the images do 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.379
 to go from dream to reality 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.389
 and what a thankful reality damian good 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:50.779
 want to continue to offer us 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.779
 such clichÃ©s 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.550
 it
