00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
anything you just put it in there

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and wrap it up with a peg winder until

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.640 
and wrap it up with a peg winder until
it's<00:02:24.300> all<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> way<00:02:24.750> down<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> bottom<00:02:25.560> of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
it's all the way down to the bottom of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.620 
it's all the way down to the bottom of
the<00:02:25.739> peg<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> then<00:02:26.370> pull<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.910> each<00:02:27.150> one<00:02:27.420> of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
the peg and then pull on each one of

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.530 
the peg and then pull on each one of
them<00:02:27.980> I've<00:02:28.980> pulled<00:02:29.310> mine<00:02:29.580> before<00:02:29.790> here<00:02:30.390> but

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
them I've pulled mine before here but

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.890 
them I've pulled mine before here but
let's<00:02:31.069> see<00:02:32.069> how<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.280> went<00:02:32.430> flat

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.710 

so<00:02:36.409> you<00:02:36.500> have<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.739> do<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.159> each<00:02:37.190> one<00:02:37.720> now

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so you have to do that to each one now

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960 
so you have to do that to each one now
if<00:02:38.959> you've<00:02:39.200> put<00:02:39.500> new<00:02:40.250> strings<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.790> your<00:02:40.819> guitar

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
if you've put new strings on your guitar

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.509 
if you've put new strings on your guitar
and<00:02:41.569> you<00:02:41.750> can't<00:02:42.019> find<00:02:42.379> a<00:02:42.620> pitch<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:42.920> tune<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.489> to

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
and you can't find a pitch to tune it to

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.910 
and you can't find a pitch to tune it to
this<00:02:44.510> may<00:02:44.720> sound<00:02:44.989> strange<00:02:45.260> with<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.620> dial

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
this may sound strange with the dial

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.240 
this may sound strange with the dial
tone<00:02:46.159> on<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> telephone<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:47.120> f<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.950> if<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.129> pick

tone on a telephone is f so if you pick

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.430 
tone on a telephone is f so if you pick
up<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.459> phone<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.879> hear<00:02:50.120> f<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:51.049> can<00:02:51.080> tune

tuning method that's worked best for me
over<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.410> years<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.860> use<00:03:26.070> this<00:03:26.310> version<00:03:26.520> of

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
over the years is to use this version of

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.880 

and<00:03:32.239> here's<00:03:32.659> a<00:03:32.719> prime<00:03:32.959> example<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.590> what<00:03:33.739> it's

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
and here's a prime example of what it's

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.619 
and here's a prime example of what it's
good<00:03:34.099> for<00:03:34.129> my<00:03:34.790> first<00:03:35.120> rings<00:03:35.360> a<00:03:35.390> little<00:03:35.450> bit

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
good for my first rings a little bit

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.009 
good for my first rings a little bit
sharp<00:03:36.250> rather<00:03:37.250> than<00:03:37.640> tuned<00:03:38.209> down<00:03:38.540> on<00:03:38.900> the

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
sharp rather than tuned down on the

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.709 
sharp rather than tuned down on the
tuner<00:03:39.609> because<00:03:40.609> if<00:03:40.849> I<00:03:40.969> tuned<00:03:41.239> down<00:03:41.420> on<00:03:41.629> the

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:41.719 
tuner because if I tuned down on the

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:43.330 
tuner because if I tuned down on the
tuner<00:03:42.049> soon<00:03:42.230> as<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:42.409> wail<00:03:42.620> on<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:43.010> thing<00:03:43.189> it's

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
tuner soon as I wail on this thing it's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.990 
tuner soon as I wail on this thing it's
gonna<00:03:43.459> go<00:03:43.700> flat<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:46.010> if<00:03:46.219> you<00:03:46.310> have<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.670> tune<00:03:46.849> it

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
gonna go flat so if you have to tune it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.729 
gonna go flat so if you have to tune it
down<00:03:47.030> bring<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:48.760> bring<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.819> up<00:03:50.060> to<00:03:50.209> pitch<00:03:50.739> and
