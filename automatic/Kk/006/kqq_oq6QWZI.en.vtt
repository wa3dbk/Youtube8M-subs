00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 [MUSIC Playing] 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.660
 Hey, guys, my mom is Tim Schmoyer. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.190
 And just as we do every Thursday, 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.890
 I'm going to get a question from one of you guys 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.682
 and do my best to answer it to help you out 

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.140
 with channel audiences 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.690
 that you are growing here on YouTube. 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.110
 This question is from ChristineDoesDrama on Twitter, 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.909
 and she tweeted and asked me this. 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.450
 You probably get this question too, 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.630
 but it's true you can use 30 seconds 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.180
 of any song on your YouTube video? 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.980
 Christine, I know it's a common thing 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 that many people talk and believe to be true. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.710
 But that's absolutely 100% percent is not true. 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.640
 Whoever tells you is not clear 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.500
 familiar with copyright law, and you can definitely 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.220
 get in trouble just for use 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.960
 the second of a copyrighted music 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
 or sound effect or anything that does not actually belong to you. 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.539
 However, instead of just taking you 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.240
 dependent on that great disappointment, 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.450
 someone from the community video creators here, 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.340
 B. Chambers by Alloy Seven YouTube Video Channel, 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.960
 is here with us to tell you how you can use the author right 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.592
 content, whether it's music or gaming or movie footage 

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.800
 clips, whatever the case may be, how you can really 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.700
 use them legally and be clear on your YouTube channel. 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.780
 Here he is. 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.160
 Hey, what's up, other creators? 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.560
 My name is B. Chambers of the Seven Video Alloy. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.170
 And I'm mostly familiar with making gaming, gaming reviews 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.410
 editorials, and also lessons for people 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.450
 how to run a games channeled here on YouTube. 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.620
 So the first step in monetizing videos 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.880
 that you create that use the material that is 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.450
 copyrighted by someone else is very simple 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.690
 to determine who the copyright owner is. 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.570
 And in the field of games, movies and TV, 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.790
 this is usually quite easy. 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.490
 With games this is usually the developer of the game 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 or publisher of the game that owns the copyright. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 When this is not, usually a Google search 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960
 will figure out for you, or even Wikipedia. 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.505
 I've even made some legwork at alloyseven.com. 

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:47.740
 I will have a specific page link in the video description 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.690
 which shows you all the copyright owners 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.030
 which I have come to and what their responses were. 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.530
 When it comes to movies and TV shows, 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 it is usually very easy to determine that. 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.190
 Because people who own movies or TV shows, 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.760
 is found on their site. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.367
 When you step into the realm of music, 

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.950
 it gets a bit more complicated. 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.190
 And that's actually why I do not recommend it 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.330
 trying to use other author's righteous people 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.550
 music in your videos. 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.550
 Let's say a bunch of artists gathered and made the song 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.650
 that you are trying to use in your video. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.670
 Who Owns Copyrights? 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.844
 Is the record label? 

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:19.010
 Both artists may come from another record label. 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500
 Do writers, make composers, 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.050
 do people perform the song themselves the rights? 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.692
 Many times this is almost impossible to determine. 

00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:27.150
 And to take it a step further when 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.190
 you start talking about the content of identity matches, take for example 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.240
 album I've put out about two years ago. 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
 Even if I did write the Permit sign today by me 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.920
 said that you can use any song in my album in your video, 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.290
 I can guarantee that you will receive a content ID 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.700
 match from cdbaby.com. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.470
 That's what I went through to publish and distribute 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 my album. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.064
 You will have permission from me, but then you will 

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.374
 still have to deal with Baby CD at your back end, which 

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.040
 means that you will need to get in touch with me 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.581
 and then go to deal with Baby CD. 

00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:55.370
 This is a pain. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.230
 So if you're just really brave 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.980
 or for whatever reason you just can not get away 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.939
 from using someone is music in your video, 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.730
 I would recommend that you just leave it alone. 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.640
 OK, now that you have decided who the copyright owner is, 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.230
 step- second and I will admit that this second step is 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.697
 most connected to video gaming makers 

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:12.280
 than anyone else - but the second step 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.000
 is to go to the owner's copyright website, 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.750
 look to see if they have a Terms of Use that gives you 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.680
 permission to make and monetize YouTube Video. 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620
 A great example of this is Microsoft 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.790
 and Activision Blizzard. 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.642
 Microsoft, in their terms of use on the Internet, 

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.975
 gives you permission to make videos using their content, 

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.890
 as long as they are not offensive, 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.880
 but not coin the content. 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.950
 Activision Blizzard's website, on the other hand, 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.950
 it gives you permission not just to make videos 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.060
 but also to coin them. 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.907
 So if you are a video gaming creator that is 

00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:41.240
 trying to do something with her an Activision Blizzard game, 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.090
 your job is done. 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090
 It's right there on the Internet. 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.720
 I actually have links where you can 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.070
 find out from the alloyseven.com website. 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.737
 But I'm watching. 

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.944
 If you've found a game that maybe is not on my site 

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:52.550
 that you want to use, see if there is 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.390
 a condition of use there that responds to the mail. 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.180
 OK, so you've decided that the copyright owner is. 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.010
 In the second step, let's say you were not 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.160
 able to find any terms of use that I give you 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.660
 permission you are looking for. 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.510
 Your third step in whether the case is going 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.750
 be to find the best way to contact the copyright owner. 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.000
 And this usually happens to be through their web site. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.499
 They will have an e-mail address 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.665
 their PR or legal teams. 

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.290
 This is one of you will want to look for. 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.140
 Or they will have an online Form that you 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.079
 you can fill out and directly with your legal team or PR. 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.560
 Or maybe this is just a generic form 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.310
 that you fill and send out to them. 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.260
 And that's usually what happens in the gaming world. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.050
 I've found that with movies and TV shows, 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.070
 say how Universal Studios-- if you go to Universal Studios, 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.150
 they actually have a website dedicated to people like us, 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.225
 who are trying to use their video for commercial vehicles. 

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.270
 And you will subscribe to this website. 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.470
 You will fill out the necessary forms, get access. 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.950
 And this is almost like an Amazon shopping 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.390
 the cart where you go in and pick, i will 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.125
 how to get permission to use Jaws footage in my video. 

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.175
 And you will see. 

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.050
 And that's where I started talking about things 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.160
 as it may cost money. 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
 I did not go all the way through this process, 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.744
 so I do not know whether this cost or how much it costs. 

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:57.910
 But this is a great way the movie studios do it. 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.534
 And once you have all those who knocked, 

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:02.510
 your next step is to actually contact your author 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.736
 The owner through email, via Online form, or via a 

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:08.780
 la carte shopping line at universalstudios.com, 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.600
 and tell them that you want to use the footage in your videos 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.240
 to put on YouTube and potentially 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.320
 monetize that video using YouTube Partner Program. 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.280
 I will have a link where you can find the email that I actually do 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.090
 use to reach out to the Owners of the Author. 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.800
 It has been very successful over the course of time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.870
 that I've been using it. 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.740
 And you can get that email, and you can slice and dice it. 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.750
 Do what to do with it 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.610
 to make it suitable to the person 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.720
 that you are seeking a copyright from. 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.050
 OK, short side note, understand that most 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.230
 from what I've been talking about here so far 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.180
 Centers around asking the Permit Owners for permission 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.520
 to use their Materials via email. 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.260
 Understand that YouTube's automated system will not 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.950
 receive an e-mail as proof of permission 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.540
 you need to get a match ID content or a copyright strike. 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.500
 So here's what I suggest you do. 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.430
 When you request permission from copyright owners, 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.510
 ask them to do one of two things. 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.920
 One, to post permissions on their sites. 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.870
 Get them to put something in a public space 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.120
 that the YouTube system can go out and look 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.020
 and say: Roger that, good to go. 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.010
 Or ask to send you actual signed documentation via email. 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.090
 Not going through the process of film production 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.580
 company, I'm going to get that a la carte shopping 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.820
 line, which I had been telling you about security 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.007
 doles from some sort of documentation. 

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:30.590
 For those of you who have gone through this process, 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.910
 be sure to leave some comment in the comments 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.030
 section confirmed or denied that. 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.820
 OK, the fifth and the last step is followed up. 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.250
 I think many of you are going to be surprised 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.610
 from how responsive some of these companies 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.790
 that you reach out to it. 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.530
 I know I was. 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.930
 Receiving email from people at Square Enix 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.670
 and a lot of great name game companies producing outdoors 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.796
 it was not a surprise to me. 

00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:54.295
 But every time in a while, you're going to run into a company 

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:56.235
 where they either do not get right back to you, 

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:57.810
 or they will come back to you and say, hey, 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.620
 we need more information. 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.286
 And when you give them that information, 

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.640
 they can not go back to you. 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.840
 So the next thing to do is just simple, 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.850
 good old fashioned pursuits via email or via online form 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.272
 that they have available to you. 

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:10.730
 And that's a lot, friends. 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.270
 That's how I usually walk people through how 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.630
 coin their canals. 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.027
 Again, I mostly focus on the gaming world. 

00:07:17.027 --> 00:07:19.360
 If any of you guys there are specific questions 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.030
 about games or any other stuff I've talked about about 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.730
 Today, feel free to hit me. 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.470
 I want to thank Tim Schmoyer for giving me the opportunity 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.320
 to come here to Video Creators of the community 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.730
 and give you this information. 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.340
 I pray that you find it oh so useful in your endeavors 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.840
 out there. 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.210
 But I would like, before I let go, to ask you a whole question. 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.300

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.010

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.170

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.070
