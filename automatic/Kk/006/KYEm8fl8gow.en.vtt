00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:10.889
 Yes it will go to 40,000 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:13.930
 The problem with this fourth pattern is like this. The one with a certain minute is the closest to the meaning . 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.200
 I pattern of choosing from the top to say ah 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.360
 Yes What kind of problem is this? 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.160
 Well in each part 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:29.110
 Most of them are one or two, but it is almost one 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.010
 It is heard or does it mean to because collector m me for example this in say and keep 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.270
 It's just that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 And if it is the 12th, what is the meaning of idiomatic what made Berry part is 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.700
 It's just like listening to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 Idiom to be a point in it even but I was easy if you know what one syntax 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.320
 If properly understood the meaning of it there is an idiom expression so that Tadoritsukeru in politics 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.530
 It has become a 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.640
 For example, I this 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:03.640
 It says that you will never keep the right time 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.480
 What is the watch I got for my birthday 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.090
 I like this 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.690
 It is written that the watch I got on my birthday never keeps the right time 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.530
 From 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:20.150
 It always means that time is wrong 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 Is it always wrong Iso with a loan 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.909
 It's an outpost singer and this is different from what I expected, to say exactly 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.700
 If this is it will delay me 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.740
 This makes me on time 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.289
 It is always different that the clock time is not completely different 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.840
 I do not engrave but I am always wrong 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.610
 Moee in the fact that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.970
 I understand that it 's like this and it's just trying 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.830
 So of course you can not understand this idiom to some extent 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.350
 I can not solve it without knowing, but of course 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.430
 You should improve this problem with such awareness 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.510
 Well then let's try the 22nd or a maid believe free 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.880
 It is to say that 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.690
 It is a feeling that it made me believe I'm doing that kind of pretending to make me believe in the year I was 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.940
 That's why 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:22.080
 I speaker Chan can be in terms of other words sound Puritendo because I understand 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.080
 Pretend 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:30.220
 After that, only 50 is a little different 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.340
 I was pretending to be in a boat to travel to Hawaii 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 Something 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.920
 I'm such is the feeling when you pretend to be riding on the theater or something in it a little boat 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.319
 The answer is good or not 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.800
 It's pretty easy 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.830
 Know spring 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.830
 So I wonder what to do with this idiom 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:56.560
 I say if we increase the power of the idiom 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:01.610
 OK I'm just selling something like a collection of questions about idiom 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:06.550
 You can do that , but let's just give some tips on how to memorize idioms 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.550
 Sounds, for example, say the phrase 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.740
 When there was a put off, there were a lot of people who overcame and remembered quite well 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.220
 is not it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.220
 For example 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:31.569
 Because put off does not say what to postpone 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.739
 It was given this English put off by Hittsuke the postponing of about forced 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.670
 I have people to remember 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.680
 This is hard to remember and I will forget it 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:45.670
 So I can not remember how long I can not lose it 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:53.040
 Idioms, please put a translation in between once 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 Let's go put a 5 translation What is sent away and written 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.970
 If you know the place where the off is off , you will put it in place without leaving anything 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.610
 So I will postpone 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:09.650
 You know the feeling you are postponed beyond the away it was scheduled today baseball game 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:14.900
 So that's what it means 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.519
 We, for example, water also hear applications if you remember to do so 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.840
 What does it mean Kawakaru This is the say meme crosswind 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.830
 Success or failure 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:30.820
 korres put and see off together 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:35.920
 You'll also know of that away off is off just pass each other with a lifetime put 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:39.520
 Then I see him going to a distant place I will watch him going away so he 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.729
 I I I I Baibai that forgo 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:49.009
 You can understand the application, it feels like that 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:52.400
 Idiots are very easy to remember if you remember them like yes or not 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:56.389
 There is something called mook in to see the book 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.900
 That examine feeling looking at the medium or Naa'll not say a member 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.160
 Luke Queen ii is 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.050
 And then it was look after throwing also Te after in the nook same look 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.259
 Because we always have seen after 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.790
 Something I was poop when you see a trail, for example, that the dog walked tidied it 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:14.790
 That's is the Tteyuu have seen after kana will feel you are taking care have seen the care of the dog 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:18.009
 So take care of 6 clothes after 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.650
 It is the same as take care of 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.780
 finish 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:28.139
 That's how Idiots are translated once translated 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.169
 It's easy to remember , even if you 're Shibata 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:36.180
 I'll remember if I try it one more time 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:37.500
 Also I remembered that it was an Eputo ship and I wondered what happened to many who left. 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.480
 It is postponed 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.510
 Feeling 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.689
 If you train your idiom, you will be able to respond to this fourth . 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.400
 I from 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:55.660
 The rest is a question in the past . 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.660
 Well, that's why it's called the fourth measure.
