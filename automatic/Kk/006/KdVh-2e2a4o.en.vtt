00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 I say we hope to do the third 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.190
 video for to finish it so for that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 to see who will have won the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.850
 more kids or the million we hope 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.730
 of course here are the visits to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.470
 things adopted me no I think that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.710
 so you can tell you who see a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 point of view there I 96000 kama so 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.250
 I was 100000 I did a little tour 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.369
 hdd story to see some 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.890
 hints so I think we were talking 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.180
 from each of his own to start the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 little things and peas is this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 we're going to do for a video of 15 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 minutes to the club and I already have one 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.619
 twenty minute good that it will be a video 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.509
 closer to 16 to 17 minutes for me 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.619
 I think if leave there and what 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.909
 better war alone then story 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.909
 rather than the technique 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:43.259
 there's no problem we'll see we'll see I 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:50.009
 think it's going to be hot but not that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:51.479
 is still on it then 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.950
 document because each of the two sides 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.850
 on the anti effects also you you do not 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.079
 do not know what is talking 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.119
 do not hesitate to watch the video 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.719
 presentation because otherwise is 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.770
 completely let loose in the sea so 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:09.110
 here is the sail and everyone on his side 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 eat is apt to welcome people 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.630
 hello and good day to everything so we get 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.730
 found after a few 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.740
 a few seconds after leaving 8 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.240
 innovate so not all reveal him so 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.410
 we will base our techniques on the drop 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.970
 so that's why I brought back less 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.320
 our offer so we left on the 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.410
 basis we are entitled to 20 other stuff 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.400
 but no basic resource and without 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.660
 niqab so I need to start 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.640
 just because I bought a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.080
 something to do a quest but good 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 it does not matter we cook with wine we go 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.650
 the laminate so we're leaving so on 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.350
 on the drop 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.980
 so it's a place and pvp a so for nothing 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.390
 to see with an enemy of europe fulthorpe 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.120
 287 pp we are not here to search 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 peace we have beautiful little male forgiveness 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.990
 is here to beat weezy with our 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.490
 own person without changing anything 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.230
 Racing will be a little unfair 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.060
 so it's my personal favorite 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.770
 I had made kaka of friends and so we 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.780
 quadro to simply do 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.040
 to laminate it quickly and did these two 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.230
 works of bach so we will have just one 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.810
 drop ageless wood because without this forgiveness 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.640
 because I find a lot so 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.960
 meaning of beaucaire and so we will have 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.470
 a million cases so I'm going to go 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.030
 drops 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.220
 I will show you a little bit 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.720
 inviting himself seems not or baraki a 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.740
 half an hour on it then I'm going 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.730
 do it until tomorrow night and tomorrow 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.100
 evening we will see the progress 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.110
 we take advantage of this for a trick com and 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.640
 show you how we can be 2 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.190
 how many hours of game you 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.540
 indicate how much you will forgive 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.800
 of hours I played and how many I saw 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.360
 like that at the same time without loot for 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.410
 make a tip to me just like you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.890
 are used to doing with me 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.180
 so you went ozap crack time 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.130
 so a creative mill at least five 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.270
 month 8 so here I used my kids 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.500
 so the bad unions they leave as 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.600
 it really we have just a few 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 basic potions otherwise nothing else and 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.350
 so not like a lamb only to me 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.080
 which they will leave in the apps all 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.000
 this is in the charente de redon de 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.800
 resources or says m so in fact we did not 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
 not privileged 20 months I do not have 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.430
 privileges not at all in what to aim 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.410
 part but I have not at all 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.000
 favor kraft or sandisk accents 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.560
 of a cabal not really kraft and the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.150
 yellow of the blow I preferred to take a 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.360
 drop for the beginning and then tomorrow night 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.080
 So we can leave out of the craft 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.840
 see with sorry I'm just of us 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.780
 it is to be able to chain chained 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.640
 directly with that so these are so 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.500
 left in me it started 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.299
 have to click on this little sweater 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.240
 of wood wool chained easily 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.860
 the fights I know more the rate of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.480
 prospecting is nominated we have our 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.020
 body we see the bomb and have revived 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.310
 buddies as usual 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 and men turn or malraux it's 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.000
 nicely so there the check mark this end of 50 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.669
 minutes one pushes and the turn after 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.759
 you will be 50 is way more right on 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.319
 we're not going to finish it that turn 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.090
 history of clicks in entirely from 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:43.830
 booster here and so this turn if we 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.020
 finished 33 laps ie approximately 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.569
 I do not know I have to see how much 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.009
 time to bring back we did not optimize 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.560
 I did not play fast by their backs 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.930
 so we put 29 seconds and we 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.240
 wants to see i'm from europe so 1.9 to hugh 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.240
 jackman at the stand a little drop in sense 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.120
 to get 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.099
 to have the 1 million frames so 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.479
 we're going to chain this story sometimes 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.310
 that you see anyway ie 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.020
 easily no one can see my enemy 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:13.569
 optimized in. I still huh 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.460
 a staff more if wore so what 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.050
 is the maximum 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.900
 here is always the second bull then 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.919
 after we pass and 3rd round we finish 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.610
 quietly 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.610
 here 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.770
 So here is the tax collector 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.400
 many be equally missed attacked 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.389
 no more 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.210
 but in that case you have to have a 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.500
 perso h export and and we will not 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.910
 always a passage a few days more 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.009
 early techniques for the characters 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.289
 level goes away like monk like lydie 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.820
 t128 if you have a menu too 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.800
 do this technique is really very 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.330
 profitable of beaucaire and who leave 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.720
 so very good for one 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.190
 reason 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.249
 so there he made a video on it is 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.379
 past reminded us 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.909
 we will have for the cua headdress so 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:59.889
 that they have to mass-produce to obtain 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.879
 these ruins technically excellent it 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.000
 can also drop and your own your 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:07.470
 own eyes 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.370
 you want to do the stuff so it's 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.110
 normal the species of hills trees 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.730
 fold 2 million more and more clear 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.060
 and then you'll just have to change 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.129
 map 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.809
 if ever a little more click on it 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.729
 the whole of the right or left and 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.869
 your income I prefer three fights 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.209
 then we will leave each other beaten and I will 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:28.370
 so will have had a hand video for 

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:31.510
 show the progress of the drop of the eggs 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.510
 and so try so 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.380
 try to exceed 8 10 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.690
 so I terrorized that me for the 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.070
 million kama that I would play games 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.740
 drawn 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.270
 the person who will receive them so that's 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.730
 will pass the following way to shoot 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.410
 first the subscribers page so we have to 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.690
 have about thirty tarpaulins of the same 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.000
 over 40 50 pages years old and cultural at 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.250
 Lille where the column and so then 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.410
 so stay at the columns or line so that 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.560
 do I will do the result online 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:04.000
 tyrannosaurus vizier incident which actually 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.800
 random and so we can return 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.480
 for example from 1 to 40 mg will give a 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.190
 number pi belly 1,40 something like 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.020
 so what will I do while 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.210
 live and therefore can not be a
