00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.089
 more time to my channel as you know me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.580
 I'm tatiana uribe from the compass of fashion 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.410
 dotcom and here we have new video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
 every Thursday some time ago I've 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.009
 seen that many youtubers are 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.719
 making the tag that's in my bag and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.369
 through this they are giving many 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.660
 tips that we can take in 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.640
 our bag and how can we 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
 organize better it seems I put on 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 agreement with my blog blog sushi friend 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.949
 blogs that I leave here in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 little part below to be looked at and 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.490
 then together tenths of this tag 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.289
 what's in my bag she did in her 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.300
 channel and I do it here on this channel 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.250
 to start he wants to show you the bag 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 I'm using a lot these days and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.410
 is after putting his in the same I do not know if 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 they see it well it 's gray and it has a 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 very long strap that you can 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 record as you like and also because 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 has this part quote of the button and has 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.039
 a close that I love bags with 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.320
 close because it allows us not to be 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.600
 are losing things or someone 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.550
 we goal by washing the bag and is super 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.710
 wide but it does not look like a bag so 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.390
 exaggeratedly big but I think that a 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.309
 we all like what we like 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.500
 be constantly changing bag 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 and that's why inside my bag 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 this is a bag organizer that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.550
 get it then I have not seen it in 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.080
 many stores or in catalogs where 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.790
 they sell different products and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.560
 basically there is everything that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.240
 I need and what I take everywhere 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.800
 so when I have to change 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 bag the only thing I have to do is 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 get me organizer and put it to another 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.020
 bag already when I have an exit in the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.330
 night where I need something a little more 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 little boy then I take out my essentials 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.830
 but normally in everyday life 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 there is everything I need first 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.000
 that I always have to carry in my 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.369
 wallet is my cell phone that for me is very 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.070
 important but as you know this 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.340
 it downloads super fast then I have 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.320
 I my charger cable but I also carry 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.750
 this portable charger that the only thing that 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.210
 you have to do is connect the cable 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.460
 normal usb data and connect it to 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.110
 portable charger and your cell phone and you 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.630
 super fast loading the child for example 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.789
 Hard for two cell charges during 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.800
 the day also I always carry with me a 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.000
 I like this wallet a lot because it's 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.220
 long I do not like wallets 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.500
 short cuts because then the bills 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.269
 they come out as well as all curled up and I do not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.960
 like it and I liked it because I can 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.150
 bring all 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.890
 paper is my money or little things like that 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.200
 I need pieces of paper that I have to keep 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.300
 everything fits me there because it's almost like 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.070
 another little bag also always custom 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.990
 this notebook that I showed them in the 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.150
 video of how to better organize our 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.000
 time then here I have a space 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.610
 to schedule videos scheduled post on 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.170
 the blog or also in the back 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.270
 that was what we did in the video 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.760
 past is all my glider where 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.010
 I write what I have to do every day and 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.930
 in the end I have many post-it because 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.140
 for me it's very important to tell us and what 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.150
 see hope so mark as what 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.980
 I have to do with different colors and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.710
 I like it more and it entertains me 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.450
 more to organize my life by colors and I 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.370
 I feel super identified with them 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.320
 so I also have my notebook that is 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.060
 very important before I had a glider 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.590
 bigger and an agenda like super 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.540
 thick then I was too lazy 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.790
 load it because I'm usually like a 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.620
 little bit loose to carry so many things 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.020
 in the bag and withstand so much weight 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.900
 then I found is free ethics and as 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.820
 I did not find a glider to be able to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.950
 manage my tasks in a notebook 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.170
 small then the built itself was 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.710
 super easy here below I leave the video 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.870
 where 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.580
 It is the process for you to see that 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.260
 It's super easy to organize our 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.240
 life in a small notebook that does not 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.250
 occupy so much space here in my 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.140
 organizer I also have cloths 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.840
 humid that for me are very important 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.490
 to clean our hands or face 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.620
 because I'm often out of 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.170
 the house a lot of time and I have to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.970
 be very neat in this little bag I keep 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.570
 hair accessories then 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.160
 I have cachitos or bobby pins or others 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.950
 much bigger chulitos to do 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.890
 mexico the wings or tweezers so 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.300
 I can change my hairstyle some 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.950
 times in the day or if you're testing me 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.990
 I can also do my hair 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.250
 I always carry a small holster 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.560
 As you know, I do not get used to it 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.350
 much like writing by hand only 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 my agenda but here I have several colors 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.640
 and like things that I like to have 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.550
 more organized a time in the agenda 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.710
 that my hearing aids and a usb memory that 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.390
 it is fundamental many times we take 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.430
 one in the bag and we were like 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.200
 super stranded because we have to pass 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.700
 a file suddenly we no role in 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.790
 internet and we have to send to print 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.400
 something then there is that memory put if 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.919
 is there in the bag does not take much 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.530
 but here there are many troubles other than 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.630
 I carry is the antibacterial many 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.460
 people hang it there in the bag or 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.410
 put the hair clips on the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.780
 bag and the truth I do not like 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.090
 hang nothing from my portfolio just me 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.680
 I put it in my organizer to 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.479
 that does not look and I think it looks like 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.240
 a little more aesthetic I do not like 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.729
 hanging things in there in the wallet does not 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.770
 like almost never cosmetics charge what 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.479
 unique as that charge of cosmetics is a 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.090
 glitter to have hydrated the 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.100
 lips but I do need to touch up 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.380
 during the day that few times what 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.090
 I do then I carry this cosmetiquera 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.410
 I like it a lot because of the color that 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.810
 you know that I love the 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.090
 Fuchsia and I'll show you what I bring 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.810
 here for me this is fundamental is a 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.669
 thermal water 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.260
 this is a miniature as well as a 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.240
 shows and I like it because I can 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.340
 keep in my bag in the market and from 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.229
 many brands all seem super 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.449
 good I do not have as a favorite but 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.430
 that thermal water allows you to hydrate 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.349
 much your skin and that those 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.330
 redness then this seems super 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.979
 also recommended sometimes during the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.169
 day I want to refresh myself a little 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.150
 then rossi a little thermal water in 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.760
 my face and ready we were perfect 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.860
 I also take a powder a blush this 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.260
 like it because it 's cream then I 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.510
 it lasts a lot longer I have a concealer 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.030
 but it's very important I do not know to me I do not 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.040
 like for example apply me the concealer 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.930
 in the morning and then reapply 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.180
 over another layer of concealer because 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.950
 then we are getting the product 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.990
 between the wrinkles or the lines of 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.730
 expression and it's not cute then better 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.350
 first we clean that layer of 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.840
 corrector that's why I have the pañitos 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.390
 wet and then we apply the new 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.800
 corrector coat I have this sponge 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.230
 which is as an indication of the 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.510
 I will live and always take it to 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.880
 blur the concealer or the bases or 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.220
 these little things or in creator of tabs 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.170
 and a text or a washable proof of 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.540
 I do not like water, I just like to use it 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.340
 for the lower lashes because 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.870
 when we're going to wash our face and it's a 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.210
 water proof we have to hurt 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.040
 much lashes to clean all the 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.510
 good product this has been all for the 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.880
 today's video I hope you liked it 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.740
 as you can see I have so many things 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.840
 my bag is better than walking there 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.700
 baggage briefs and they are not 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.100
 forget that although we did videíto of that 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.750
 there is a stock market and we continue with the 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.910
