00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.820
 my salary get in the 11er mode 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.280
 animusx we can see starts 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
 fight as soon as you see the big ball in the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.780
 Center activated and the fmo the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 worked something different than in 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.820
 normal mode as in the beginning would have been easy 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 all standing together and the whole little one 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.760
 The wave approaching will be easy 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.529
 taken the tanks and the aoi the gone 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.689
 then so soon die down are the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
 next activated so on and so 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.719
 on and on and on and on 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.399
 simply activated from a small distance 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.290
 and for the beginning could still be together 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.520
 but after that you have to be 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 distribute and fix the fire which 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 you pursuing this now could just 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 look at me as soon as it was being persecuted 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.350
 you get two eyes over yours 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.309
 play character and then you should 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.109
 something from the weight run around just that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.289
 weight with the fire he pursues 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.940
 not immediately 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.270
 otherwise you will continue to kill diet 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 fight is quite simple of the whole 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.990
 opponents are successively activates the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.659
 first small nets to the middle then 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.610
 the large and the circuit animusX and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.229
 that's what killed them too 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.090
 first the small ones then the middle ones 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.790
 then kill the big ones and finally 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.470
 you then all else has to except for that 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.119
 You can all pursue fireworks 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 other abilities ignore that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.680
 You should just be around the boss 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 put up and do maximum damage on the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.930
 Post 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 for the highlight may still be 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.659
 relatively important players popkomm 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.400
 then get your short waits 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.150
 not in standish mellon the sooner 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.549
 this soon follows him to more 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.290
 this player loses life and he loses 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.820
 will then play with another player 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.920
 farthest from them 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 booted so there it just waits 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.250
 a bit and then this belgium 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.020
 there you can just a healer of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 I'll share that with the display 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.250
 survive or otherwise just the one 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.250
 just has time 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.429
 which is relatively important for the tanks 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.120
 as soon as the tank is around 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.920
 So gather balls he will 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 circled by bullets should be on 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.170
 best too fast as possible with one 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.900
 cd out there as they go together and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.060
 then practically explode and for the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.720
 all custom made as it is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.530
 has seen if only the ford is 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.599
 sometimes cast like that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.150
 shock wave and if you 're right in this 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.090
 something costs you then you will 14 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.319
 seconds and would have to wait 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.040
 you can be back afterwards 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.040
 to taste something 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.340
 I hope by a short insight 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.599
 What you are doing here in the experience he is doing 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.420
 as you can see 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.860
 Links here we have the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.390
 standards of money is consumed 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.580
 probably take a while there 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.950
 Post has it essential 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.720
 more difficult now but we are yours 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.280
 like to ask for and so easy in the 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.050
 comments by the people like to 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.349
 disposal and will help you so well 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.950
 It goes by bus as soon as possible 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.950
 then get
