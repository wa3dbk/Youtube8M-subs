00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.160
 talk about your morphology 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.480
 and to do that I invited pen 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.640
 image consultant to join us 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.770
 in the super the competition shop at 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.280
 nice going granby done the arranged 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.630
 Ansa 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.820
 so sometimes we have a few small ones 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.250
 difficulties in choosing the recovery of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.120
 stops for his wedding 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.560
 maybe we're already doing this 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.870
 which is best for your 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.850
 morphology all hacker florent site 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.160
 to identify his morphology we are 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.680
 watch if the shoulders his cabinet with 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.700
 hips and if the size marked and 4 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.619
 morphology that looks at me today 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.380
 we will look at the morphology of time 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.630
 so in we have them and hips 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.759
 which are wider than shoulders and 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.460
 it does not cut very little mark then the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.200
 morphology says remove where we have them 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.880
 shoulders that are wider than the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.979
 narrow basin and one size 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.470
 soon enough then marked on the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.740
 morphology says h place morphologies 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.840
 rather fine the size is not marked 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.210
 is nonexistent and the cost of deposits 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.040
 rather straight disappointed but rather sporty 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.680
 then on the morphology the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.360
 morphologies said oval or rounded so 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.370
 depending on whether the person is tall or 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.570
 small or there too there is no 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.400
 size but against it we have curves 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.530
 So then regarding 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.170
 morphologies that are rather slender 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 so who have no chest no 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.700
 hips instead of right morphology is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.989
 slim i chose from rome 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.549
 the first is what is needed 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.980
 because on a morphology that is 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.750
 thin and without chest and settles in 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.130
 in fact the idea is to rebalance the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.760
 silhouette that she is the most feminine 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.250
 possible more and more 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.689
 wedding coup we will add volume 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.450
 on the chest to draw a 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:34.400
 chest through the sale here is that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.159
 does a job on the place size so 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.470
 we draw a size and then the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.060
 tube work here will give volume 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 so we're going to draw a 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.370
 silhouette of pretty curves second 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.129
 model for this scene morphology 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.040
 so here I chose a bustier with 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.299
 a whole swarovski strass work and 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.069
 the petticoat that goes with 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.079
 so the point here is that all 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.450
 work on the upper body with chest 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.780
 will obviously add water volume 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.340
 the rhinestone side actually is going to attract the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.530
 light and send back the light so him 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.019
 also will work on the cheek of the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.000
 volume so all the work here he has 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.980
 of course also caught the eye on the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.739
 size of the designers and there of course 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.510
 we go on that very low for them 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.840
 to draw volume on the hips 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.150
 he was actually married for the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.010
 morphology actually remove that the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.930
 shoulders are wider than the pelvis 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.239
 that hips chords will take to 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.370
 brides who are beach a pool 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.530
 narrow and no hips can be 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.120
 a strong part first advise the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.160
 two choices that I had first is 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.919
 this one then already for the morphology 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.540
 of the lifted time it is necessary especially not all 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.610
 what's going to be strapless because it's going 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.260
 accentuate this detail 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.840
 the shoulders are pus volume so we're going 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.360
 break the shoulders with for example here 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.710
 braces and the pretty neckline that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.140
 will highlight the chest 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.450
 we go with the work of lace here 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.620
 well there are the angels to draw 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.070
 the size in fact 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.150
 and here I chose a dress so that 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.970
 change some of the traditional models 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.440
 short in front and long behind or 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.870
 blow we will work on the side 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 length and volume of the hips here and 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.250
 like shoulders are bulkier 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.610
 we will work with a little camisole in 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.210
 water and with a player working in the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.860
 back in the back with a button that 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.570
 will catch the eye in the back and 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.250
 give a sexy side to the dress 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.640
 so my second choice for this 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.440
 rambla concept morphology that's it 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.419
 only to one covered shoulders of others not 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.000
 take advantage of breaking the breadth of 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.460
 shoulders by drawing an asymmetry on 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.980
 shoulders also well drawn the 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.870
 waist with a belt work and 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.919
 the tulle at the end to give volume 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.570
 on the hips 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.550
 knowing that on this white dress can 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.410
 add a petticoat underneath so 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.240
 to his part a little more about 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.860
 outside who come for the most 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.070
 small of us as designer 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.250
 so I changed my mind 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.600
 so leave a mermaid dress so in fact 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.160
 so we're going to work because 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.500
 especially for the small to the right 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.020
 avoid it's too much volume that all that 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.060
 will go by when you murder have had to 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
 we will replay on the wavelength 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.470
 art the mermaid dress owes her suitcases to 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.930
 about level 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.550
 I like that we can go after 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.410
 work that is done on the bottom of 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.180
 slopes will tell of the bride's style and 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.310
 especially we will play on one side 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.980
 longiline to lengthen the silhouette 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.990
 refine the silhouette is given of 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.020
 their flowers can also play at once 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.820
 sure a short dress work and so of 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.180
 blow it will add attract the look 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.740
 on the morphology as such you 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.660
 win a very nice job of the dress 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.700
 and thus actually the fact that this 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.680
 be short the dress will be short and very 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.240
 of the body of the blow will lengthen the 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.250
 silhouette since we played on the 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.230
 leg length while the hype 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.820
 to actually correct the boards of the 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.690
 punctured shutter since we could angels 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.370
 that poor 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.160
 good I would recommend first dress this 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.840
 let's stop dressing up on both sides 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.400
 but is suitable to come add volume 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.560
 high level and poles and always 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.840
 add work or chest and we 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.540
 part escaped for not too marked and 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.140
 hip so always to balance the 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.450
 silhouette 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.360
 so we actually dressed 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.340
 times the shoulders with this semblance of 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.090
 cleavage with the lace that will come 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.620
 added catch the eye on the shoulders 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.210
 Hello chest well drawn 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.370
 to mark the size so we have a nice 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.960
 working on the belt and the same 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.690
 way you seem basic and with the 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.300
 tube not to flatten the hips 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.629
 our life 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.909
 tonight it is to the ball this model there either 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:39.620
 more draping it gave a glamorous side 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.810
 because suddenly the advantage of 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.550
 sellers it's finally on dresses 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.590
 married two draws to fill so for 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:48.070
 you have to completely dress it up 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.310
 symmetry of the dress broke 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:53.380
 the curvaceous told me a graceful little 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.300
 he draped it so with a game fell 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.490
 here we come to play on the 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.770
 chest so highlight it well 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.240
 drawn the size and by cons as 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.880
 it goes slightly flared we go no no 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.500
 more plates and hips 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.170
 to avoid accentuating 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.970
 round but play on it 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.770
 the second model including this one which is 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.570
 much more classical where we go 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.790
 once again showcase the 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:20.290
 neckline so but with a lot more 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:22.630
 of discretion is more classic put 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.280
 also worth the size and play 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.630
 also on artists volume without too much 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.370
 to add some, but what is 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.210
 rather right that makes it okay 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.040
 flatten hips 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:35.100
 but still drawn a silhouette 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.100
 harmonious thank you typhaine see you soon
