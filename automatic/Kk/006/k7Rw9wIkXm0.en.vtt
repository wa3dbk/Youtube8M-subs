00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 hello and today let's talk about the chi rata installment 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.730
 which are spaghetti made from 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.869
 jacques root that has a plant 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.660
 subtropical present in almost all of the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.789
 Asian territory from this tuber yes 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 it gets the yingluck flour gradually 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.900
 than a water-soluble polysaccharide 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.869
 used as a dietary fiber since 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.630
 two thousand years in Chinese cuisine 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.640
 however I leave the link to the post below 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 in the information box and I invite you 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
 anyway to look at the place where I do 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 an introduction to these issues 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.000
 because really important then me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.700
 I am absolutely not sponsored 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.379
 by the companies are bloggers in quotes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 atypical for ten years and certainly has not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.660
 no kind of collaboration then vi 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 I only speak of two of my experiences is 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.690
 nothing more than I shared on the blog 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.039
 together with my friends thanks to mine 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 dear friend who by the way a 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.760
 Dr. Francesca, however, you find 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.310
 all in the information box 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.260
 the first time I used the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.020
 ski installment that I used two types 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.259
 different that are on the market and I have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.909
 chosen these of this brand g6 I leave 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 also all those links where I have 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.860
 purchased the products and another one 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 instead zen pasta with regards to 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 the pasta gisa is pasta that is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.540
 sorry about the prices this is about turn 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 moist and therefore preserved in this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.520
 water while regarding the 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.090
 product of Zen pasta is 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.729
 cir atac i buckets means that i 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.979
 ski that the buckets must be 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.700
 on the contrary, hydrate them 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.110
 wet and this is their shape 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.230
 let's say that 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.680
 the calories are really paltry in 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.960
 as the gis and declares that for 100 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 grams of hydrated product we are 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.820
 speaking we talk about 6 calories while 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 in the paw st 28 calories precisely for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 this invitation to read all the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.030
 necessary information 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.430
 so as for the dry ones 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.230
 they should be hydrated in boiling water 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.830
 they will see as you see these 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.720
 gieseke are already stored in water and 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.800
 you simply must do it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.930
 simply remove from the envelope e 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.970
 deprive them of this puc or annoying 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.680
 residual marks an imperceptible odor 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
 attracted could not be annoying 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.239
 for some therefore they must be rinsed in 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.489
 plenty of hot water and then and yes 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.100
 they can use and with and already because 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.110
 they are already cooked so you go to the plague or 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.110
 vegetables any kind of seasoning then 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.060
 in the other episodes let's define them like this with 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.310
 we will say in many ways of skiing who 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.860
 instead these are the skis the atac i 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.200
 buckets or those design dough not 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.420
 they must cook in the water but they must 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.340
 just be hydrated so you can 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.560
 use a kettle or how he did it 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.630
 me in a classic pot left 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.830
 simmer a little salty water then 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.140
 turn it off and give it back for seven minutes 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.940
 life just in the gandoli and this 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.130
 less bad result after three minutes e 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.769
 half will become even softer 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.870
 difference as I wrote on the blog that 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.540
 while these stop precisely draining 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.329
 are those 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.959
 just dry or no taste let's say a little 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.659
 more flavorful and less intrusive to me 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.939
 liked the other milini more are 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.069
 good all the same even if I prefer the 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.239
 person and noodle of which I will speak the 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.370
 next time 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.769
 in short I sincerely prefer up 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.290
 for now the dried ones I have prepared here 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.150
 really a greenish cola recipe is one 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.859
 fresh tomato sauce 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.930
 nothing that is right to see with 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.109
 still life of basil just right for 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.349
 see some of the taste of these 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.269
 there was data that I find good for nothing 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.430
 not that my judgment is anything 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.430
 but frankly they are worth trying 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.000
 especially for those in a regime 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.099
 low calorie a controlled diet or chi 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.439
 is gluten intolerant because I am 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.659
 come in free for a whole series of 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.989
 reasons and too long from spinal well 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.180
 in the video, therefore, I invite you 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.099
 I reiterate to check the blog and not there 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.019
 see you next time with others 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.579
 preparations for the primrose show 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.150
