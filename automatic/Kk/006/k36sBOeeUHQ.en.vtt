different<00:01:00.329> effects<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.680> create<00:01:01.859> an

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
different effects so you can create an

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
one drone so the first thing I'm going

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.050 
one drone so the first thing I'm going
to<00:01:06.479> begin<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> demo<00:01:08.220> made<00:01:08.670> by<00:01:08.850> both

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
to begin with is a demo made by both

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.630 
to begin with is a demo made by both
claussen<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.100> I'm<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> play<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
claussen and I'm going to play it for

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.940 
claussen and I'm going to play it for
you<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> logic<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.650> various

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
you in logic so you can see the various

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.179 
you in logic so you can see the various
controls<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> possibility<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.830> working

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
controls and the possibility is working

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.570 
controls and the possibility is working
within<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.610> digital<00:01:18.030> audio<00:01:18.299> workstation<00:01:19.580> after

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
within a digital audio workstation after

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.140 
within a digital audio workstation after
the<00:01:20.729> musical<00:01:21.150> demo<00:01:21.509> I'll<00:01:22.110> demonstrate<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
the musical demo I'll demonstrate the

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.460 
the musical demo I'll demonstrate the
instrument<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.689> detail<00:01:25.110> page

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to show you a very nice demo made by Bo

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.830 
to show you a very nice demo made by Bo
claussen<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:34.369> I'm<00:01:35.369> playing<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.090> logic<00:01:36.570> for

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
claussen and I'm playing it in logic for

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.270 
claussen and I'm playing it in logic for
you<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:39.110> below<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.890> the
