today<00:00:01.939> we're<00:00:02.149> looking<00:00:02.270> at<00:00:02.570> installing<00:00:03.439> some

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.360 
today we're looking at installing some

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:13.350 
today we're looking at installing some
1.25<00:00:05.360> to<00:00:05.840> 1<00:00:06.490> rocker<00:00:07.490> arms<00:00:08.060> on<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:08.570> Baja<00:00:09.530> Bug

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.409 

pretty<00:00:14.360> uneventful<00:00:15.279> installation<00:00:16.279> I<00:00:16.609> did

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:17.419 
pretty uneventful installation I did

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.450 
pretty uneventful installation I did
discover<00:00:17.990> though<00:00:18.320> that<00:00:18.710> I<00:00:18.949> needed<00:00:19.189> to<00:00:19.429> add

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
discover though that I needed to add

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.359 
discover though that I needed to add
shims<00:00:20.829> behind<00:00:21.829> these<00:00:23.140> pedestals<00:00:24.140> to<00:00:25.390> get<00:00:27.369> the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
shims behind these pedestals to get the

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.399 
shims behind these pedestals to get the
correct<00:00:28.669> amount<00:00:29.029> of<00:00:29.149> threads<00:00:29.509> showing<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:30.169> at

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:30.409 
correct amount of threads showing it at

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.610 
correct amount of threads showing it at
both<00:00:30.679> ends<00:00:31.009> of<00:00:31.220> each<00:00:31.339> rocker<00:00:31.699> arm<00:00:32.350> there<00:00:33.350> was

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
both ends of each rocker arm there was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.130 
both ends of each rocker arm there was
no<00:00:34.030> prospect<00:00:35.030> of<00:00:35.570> getting<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:35.989> right

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
no prospect of getting the right

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.200 
no prospect of getting the right
adjustment<00:00:36.829> without<00:00:36.949> the<00:00:37.309> shims<00:00:37.609> installed

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
adjustment without the shims installed

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.080 
adjustment without the shims installed
why<00:00:39.109> these<00:00:39.170> are<00:00:39.800> different<00:00:40.280> than<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.699> stock

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
why these are different than the stock

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.869 
why these are different than the stock
rocker<00:00:41.840> arms<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.590> regard<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:43.429> don't<00:00:43.640> know

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
rocker arms in that regard I don't know

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.229 
rocker arms in that regard I don't know
I<00:00:44.210> took<00:00:44.809> each<00:00:44.960> adjuster<00:00:45.649> out<00:00:45.679> and<00:00:46.250> installed

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
I took each adjuster out and installed

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.439 
I took each adjuster out and installed
it<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.960> new<00:00:48.500> rocker<00:00:48.829> arms<00:00:49.370> so<00:00:50.120> the

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
it in the new rocker arms so the

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.020 
it in the new rocker arms so the
adjusters<00:00:51.170> are<00:00:51.379> with<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:52.010> same<00:00:52.249> valves<00:00:52.789> as

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
adjusters are with the same valves as

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.569 
adjusters are with the same valves as
they<00:00:53.390> were<00:00:53.449> before<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.230> that's<00:00:54.589> not<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.949> factor

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
they were before so that's not a factor

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.270 
they were before so that's not a factor
I<00:00:55.820> know<00:00:56.480> this<00:00:56.809> head<00:00:57.230> had<00:00:57.620> a<00:00:57.649> lot<00:00:57.949> of<00:00:57.980> material

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
I know this head had a lot of material

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.439 
I know this head had a lot of material
removed

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
removed

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.720 
removed
I<00:00:59.480> just<00:00:59.960> wanted<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.379> cleaned<00:01:00.829> up<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.460> shop

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
I just wanted to cleaned up and the shop

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.280 
I just wanted to cleaned up and the shop
removed<00:01:02.359> 30<00:01:02.690> thousandths<00:01:03.409> from<00:01:03.649> it<00:01:05.170> which<00:01:06.170> I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
removed 30 thousandths from it which I

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.320 
removed 30 thousandths from it which I
wasn't<00:01:06.590> too<00:01:06.710> happy<00:01:06.740> about<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:07.790> head<00:01:08.090> has

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
wasn't too happy about so this head has

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.500 
wasn't too happy about so this head has
moved<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:10.010> pushrods<00:01:10.550> I<00:01:11.030> just<00:01:11.270> measured

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
moved in the pushrods I just measured

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.840 
moved in the pushrods I just measured
her<00:01:11.900> 11<00:01:12.530> inches<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:15.070> 1/32<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.190> an<00:01:16.310> inch<00:01:16.490> long

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
her 11 inches and 1/32 of an inch long

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.430 
her 11 inches and 1/32 of an inch long
11<00:01:17.510> in<00:01:17.770> 1/32<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:19.130> an<00:01:19.580> inch<00:01:19.760> long<00:01:20.150> I<00:01:20.570> guess<00:01:21.290> I

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
11 in 1/32 of an inch long I guess I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.250 
11 in 1/32 of an inch long I guess I
could<00:01:21.620> make<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.950> push<00:01:22.160> rod<00:01:22.430> shorter

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
could make the push rod shorter

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.480 
could make the push rod shorter
accomplish<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.380> same<00:01:24.590> thing<00:01:24.860> as<00:01:25.040> putting<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
accomplish the same thing as putting the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.410 
accomplish the same thing as putting the
shims<00:01:25.790> behind<00:01:26.420> these<00:01:26.890> pedestals<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:28.460> tried<00:01:29.270> the

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
shims behind these pedestals I tried the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.030 
shims behind these pedestals I tried the
thin<00:01:29.690> shims<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.470> didn't<00:01:30.680> think<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:31.010> had

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
thin shims and I didn't think I had

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.120 
thin shims and I didn't think I had
enough<00:01:31.220> thread<00:01:31.820> showing<00:01:32.150> here<00:01:32.900> I<00:01:33.080> put<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:33.980> the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
enough thread showing here I put in the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.210 
enough thread showing here I put in the
thick<00:01:34.430> shims<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.210> I<00:01:35.840> couldn't<00:01:36.230> get<00:01:36.440> enough

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
thick shims and I couldn't get enough

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.420 
thick shims and I couldn't get enough
thread<00:01:37.550> showing<00:01:37.910> here<00:01:38.690> opposite<00:01:39.320> problem<00:01:39.770> so

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
thread showing here opposite problem so

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.470 
thread showing here opposite problem so
I<00:01:40.490> put<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.850> thin<00:01:41.090> ones<00:01:41.330> back<00:01:41.660> in<00:01:43.450> also<00:01:44.450> I

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
I put the thin ones back in also I

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.990 
I put the thin ones back in also I
noticed<00:01:45.700> where<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.910> stock<00:01:48.220> rocker<00:01:49.220> arm<00:01:49.610> has

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
noticed where the stock rocker arm has

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.050 
noticed where the stock rocker arm has
the<00:01:50.470> holes<00:01:51.470> in<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.860> tops<00:01:52.100> welded<00:01:52.730> shut

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
the holes in the tops welded shut

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.280 
the holes in the tops welded shut
on<00:01:53.630> these<00:01:56.350> 1.25<00:01:57.350> rocker<00:01:58.100> arms<00:01:58.580> those<00:01:58.820> holes

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
on these 1.25 rocker arms those holes

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.780 
on these 1.25 rocker arms those holes
were<00:02:00.290> not<00:02:00.470> welded<00:02:01.040> shut<00:02:01.070> may<00:02:01.610> be<00:02:01.670> a

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
were not welded shut may be a

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.570 
were not welded shut may be a
cost-saving<00:02:02.660> idea<00:02:03.620> of<00:02:03.890> some<00:02:04.160> ones<00:02:04.370> at

Volkswagen I still don't know I mean on
what<00:02:07.670> engines<00:02:08.179> were<00:02:08.360> these<00:02:08.539> stock<00:02:08.960> these<00:02:09.229> have

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
what engines were these stock these have

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.080 
what engines were these stock these have
the<00:02:09.619> VW<00:02:10.130> mark<00:02:10.429> on<00:02:10.670> them<00:02:10.940> but<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.690> don't<00:02:11.840> know<00:02:12.230> in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the VW mark on them but I don't know in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.990 
the VW mark on them but I don't know in
what<00:02:13.209> years<00:02:13.510> they<00:02:13.750> came<00:02:14.019> stock<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:15.250> idea<00:02:15.610> here

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
what years they came stock the idea here

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.360 
what years they came stock the idea here
is<00:02:16.030> we're<00:02:16.930> gonna<00:02:17.050> push<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.590> valves<00:02:17.950> open<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
is we're gonna push the valves open a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.080 
is we're gonna push the valves open a
little<00:02:18.550> farther<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:20.590> each<00:02:20.800> opening<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.970> I'm

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
little farther with each opening and I'm

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.670 
little farther with each opening and I'm
hoping<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.569> doesn't<00:02:22.629> break<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.110> springs

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
hoping it doesn't break the springs

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.750 
hoping it doesn't break the springs
there's<00:02:24.519> certainly<00:02:24.819> no<00:02:25.000> coil<00:02:25.360> bind<00:02:25.720> but<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
there's certainly no coil bind but it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.150 
there's certainly no coil bind but it
will<00:02:28.090> be<00:02:28.750> flexing<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> springs<00:02:29.620> more<00:02:29.950> than

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
will be flexing the springs more than

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.420
