 child's voices 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.760
 when one still called in shorts and the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.190

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.550
 was allowed to run now is that time 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.200
 passed 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.670
 we would be embarrassed to be still 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 dime to the man with his chubby 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.020

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.210
 pleasure on the white horses with the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.980
 sit in shiny mirrors 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.710
 the men's street would be him 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.480

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.910

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.680
 minutes longer eyes know would be fun 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.300
 we now have to do with a dime 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.550

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.900

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.450
 pleasure for a duppie 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.490
 permanently closed regret and not to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.860

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.590
 assume that we are right at the fair 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.390
 have thought back 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.920
 the easy chair has not been able to 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 prevent us from going to the fair anyway 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.260
 have gone with shiny shoes and 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.690
 extremely hardy guilders in our pocket 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 it was warm the ladies smiling brightly 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.250
 in a floral summer dress that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.989
 formed had not received fair dress 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.940
 an attraction 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.730
 and the men in their best suits with 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.080
 muscles in smooth face 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.790
 we started the fair very quietly 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.269
 in a wicker chair on a small 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.459
 terrace 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.569
 it gave us a sense of peace it was 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.160
 so familiar 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.319
 the friendly look and the smells 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.829
 raised hand a symbol of 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.890
 companionship and the café behind us 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.959
 the pros bear your name in the cattle trade 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.390
 the boys of the band play themselves in 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.700
 the sweat the drummer swept the rhythm 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.250
 high enjoyed the dancers followed 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.560
 with red heads are swirled and muscles 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.569
 and clashed and Philip's tongue again and again 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.019
 she danced like she never had enough 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.360
 got a few meters beside me he sat 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.010
 again that man who was always silent 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.480
 but was staring ahead in one 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.370
 red mess 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.950
 he has threw some for years 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.840
 some money for him were in side board 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.450
 written with white letters 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.430
 lamp his crutches were crooked 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.560
 him against the wall once we have those 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 man a dime and a whole one 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.220
 round we go for in the mallemolen 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.019
 sacrificed him when we were little 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.420
 it gave a great feeling of it 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.609
 satisfaction but that suddenly disappeared 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.739
 when we saw how he remarkably mercury 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.060
 and grabbed crutches and at the bar 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.280
 a smoker cafe 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.680
 the blind man also immediately changes his mind 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.299
 harmonica player is there that we still give 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.190
 always something because he is becoming one to us 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.180
 a little melancholy and because he is 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.230
 his eyes are really blind 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.849
 around the head of jut 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 is the silver screen that always has us 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.500
 The evidence became effective there 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.989
 delivered farmers who met here 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.299
 one were loaded with rivalry 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.709
 here what one does not meet each other to the state 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.709
 from his crops but to the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.569
 cleavage of his arms the girls 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.280
 without giggling aside March on 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.959
 a grateful and proud smile 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.389
 my lips like one or the other 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.650
 powerhouse who celebrate fair with them 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:18.780
 and the fire red or grass greener or 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.489
 they pegged them with the head 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.989
 from jut 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.210
 now it is dark the goofy mill 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.889
 is closed and the great they lived 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.410
 shiny parts and the golden ones 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.870
 cookies hidden from our eyes on the street 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.699
 has become a quiet in a cafes 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.919

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.080

 as soon as the twelve o'clock you will sleep 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.449
 music muted and the doors of the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.979
