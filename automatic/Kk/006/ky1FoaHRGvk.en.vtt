00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
so great about the rubber band is when

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
so great about the rubber band is when
you<00:01:17.700> first<00:01:17.939> start<00:01:18.270> pulling<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.650> rubber<00:01:19.830> band

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you first start pulling the rubber band

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
starts and stops rather than the tripod

works great with a slider as well let me
put<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.409> real<00:01:46.620> quick<00:01:46.860> no<00:01:47.550> matter<00:01:47.760> how

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
expensive you spend on a slider if it's

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.090 
expensive you spend on a slider if it's
not<00:01:50.550> motorized<00:01:51.530> it's<00:01:52.530> not<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.010> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
not motorized it's not going to be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.610 
not motorized it's not going to be
perfectly<00:01:53.549> smooth<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.780> rubber<00:01:54.990> band<00:01:55.290> is

it all the way around on the tripod head

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070 
it all the way around on the tripod head
go<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> quick<00:02:02.940> movement<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> smooth

tripod head down you can keep it on the
handle<00:02:09.539> back<00:02:09.659> here<00:02:10.400> get<00:02:11.400> your<00:02:11.489> smooth<00:02:11.849> slides

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.140 

it's<00:02:16.470> much<00:02:16.769> smoother<00:02:17.310> than<00:02:17.489> if<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.730> was<00:02:17.879> trying

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
it's much smoother than if I was trying

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.820 
it's much smoother than if I was trying
