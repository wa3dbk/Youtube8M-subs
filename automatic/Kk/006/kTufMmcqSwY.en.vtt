the<00:00:23.110> ditch<00:00:23.290> fairly<00:00:23.800> quickly

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
the ditch fairly quickly

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.070 
the ditch fairly quickly
driver<00:00:24.820> makes<00:00:25.060> a<00:00:25.150> good<00:00:25.330> save<00:00:25.540> right<00:00:25.750> there<00:00:25.900> not

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
driver makes a good save right there not

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.900 
driver makes a good save right there not
to<00:00:26.230> go<00:00:26.350> into<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.560> oncoming<00:00:27.250> lane<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.670> traffic

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
to go into the oncoming lane of traffic

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.990 
to go into the oncoming lane of traffic
ultimately<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.900> flips<00:00:29.260> over<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.910> is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
ultimately it flips over and here is

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.570 
ultimately it flips over and here is
another<00:00:31.119> version<00:00:31.600> slowed<00:00:32.590> it<00:00:32.710> down<00:00:32.739> in<00:00:33.280> key

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
another version slowed it down in key

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.240 
another version slowed it down in key
spots<00:00:34.059> so<00:00:34.360> let's<00:00:34.570> take<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> peek<00:00:35.080> here<00:00:35.920> is<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
spots so let's take a peek here is the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.729 
spots so let's take a peek here is the
RV<00:00:36.580> going<00:00:36.940> through<00:00:37.330> and<00:00:37.600> then<00:00:38.050> once<00:00:38.260> I<00:00:38.379> slow<00:00:38.590> it

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
RV going through and then once I slow it

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.170 
RV going through and then once I slow it
down<00:00:38.769> you'll<00:00:39.160> see<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.489> rear<00:00:39.699> end<00:00:39.850> kind<00:00:40.059> of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
down you'll see the rear end kind of

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.670 
down you'll see the rear end kind of
shake<00:00:40.420> I<00:00:40.570> believe<00:00:40.870> that's<00:00:41.110> when<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.410> blowout

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
shake I believe that's when the blowout

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.799 
shake I believe that's when the blowout
happens<00:00:42.370> then<00:00:43.030> we're<00:00:43.210> going<00:00:43.360> to<00:00:43.390> slow<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.780> down

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
happens then we're going to slow it down

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.500 
happens then we're going to slow it down
even<00:00:44.379> more<00:00:44.680> we're<00:00:45.640> going<00:00:45.729> it<00:00:45.909> up<00:00:46.030> close<00:00:46.269> whew

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
even more we're going it up close whew

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.939 
even more we're going it up close whew
you<00:00:46.659> can<00:00:46.780> see<00:00:46.960> that<00:00:47.140> light<00:00:47.379> come<00:00:47.589> on<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.920> is

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
you can see that light come on that is

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.829 
you can see that light come on that is
not<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.250> brake<00:00:48.580> light<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:49.180> is<00:00:49.330> his<00:00:49.449> turn<00:00:49.659> soon

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
not a brake light that is his turn soon

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.590 
not a brake light that is his turn soon
I<00:00:49.930> think<00:00:50.140> that's<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.409> RV<00:00:50.830> driver<00:00:51.699> trying<00:00:52.239> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
I think that's the RV driver trying to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.109 
I think that's the RV driver trying to
correct<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.379> steer<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:54.790> don't<00:00:54.940> know<00:00:55.030> if

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:55.119 
correct the steer and I don't know if

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:57.180 
correct the steer and I don't know if
you<00:00:55.210> let<00:00:55.360> up<00:00:55.449> on<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.690> gas<00:00:55.720> or<00:00:56.199> what<00:00:56.500> but<00:00:57.129> he

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
you let up on the gas or what but he

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.100 
you let up on the gas or what but he
gets<00:00:57.790> sucked<00:00:58.059> down<00:00:58.269> here<00:00:58.510> she<00:00:58.690> gets<00:00:58.809> sucked

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
gets sucked down here she gets sucked

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.410 
gets sucked down here she gets sucked
down<00:00:59.320> saves<00:01:00.100> these<00:01:00.339> two<00:01:00.549> cars<00:01:00.820> you<00:01:01.059> can<00:01:01.210> see

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
down saves these two cars you can see

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.660 
down saves these two cars you can see
how<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.659> try<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.080> get<00:01:02.320> it<00:01:02.470> he<00:01:03.010> or<00:01:03.129> she<00:01:03.309> tried<00:01:03.580> to

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
how we try to get it he or she tried to

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.570 
how we try to get it he or she tried to
get<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.970> lined<00:01:04.239> up<00:01:04.449> didn't<00:01:05.260> work<00:01:05.500> out<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.040> then

dealing with these tires the number one

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.910 
dealing with these tires the number one
cause<00:01:21.010> for<00:01:21.040> blowouts<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:22.410> over<00:01:23.410> exertion<00:01:23.710> of

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
cause for blowouts is over exertion of

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710 
cause for blowouts is over exertion of
the<00:01:23.980> tires<00:01:24.280> basically<00:01:24.880> putting<00:01:25.210> too<00:01:25.510> much

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
the tires basically putting too much

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.720 
the tires basically putting too much
weight<00:01:25.780> on<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.530> tires<00:01:26.800> past<00:01:27.250> what<00:01:27.520> they're

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
weight on the tires past what they're

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.030 
weight on the tires past what they're
rated<00:01:28.030> for<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.510> also<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.350> inflation<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:29.950> the

rated for and also the inflation of the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.030 
rated for and also the inflation of the
tires<00:01:30.310> it's<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> very<00:01:31.570> very<00:01:32.020> good<00:01:32.320> idea<00:01:32.380> to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
tires it's a very very good idea to

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.250 
tires it's a very very good idea to
check<00:01:33.280> your<00:01:33.340> tires<00:01:33.790> before<00:01:34.180> each<00:01:34.780> time<00:01:35.080> you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
check your tires before each time you

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.780 
check your tires before each time you
drive<00:01:35.500> what<00:01:35.710> happens<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.130> lot<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.370> time<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.700> the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
drive what happens a lot of time in the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.450 
drive what happens a lot of time in the
spring<00:01:37.090> people<00:01:37.930> will<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.380> their<00:01:38.770> their<00:01:39.070> RVs

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
spring people will have their their RVs

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.820 
spring people will have their their RVs
sitting<00:01:39.880> all<00:01:40.270> winter<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.810> when<00:01:41.380> they<00:01:41.530> go<00:01:41.770> to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
sitting all winter and when they go to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.470 
sitting all winter and when they go to
take<00:01:42.190> them<00:01:42.370> out<00:01:42.550> for<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.790> first<00:01:42.820> time<00:01:43.210> in<00:01:43.390> the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
take them out for the first time in the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.000 
take them out for the first time in the
season<00:01:43.659> they<00:01:44.020> don't<00:01:44.200> think<00:01:44.409> about<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.740> tires

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
season they don't think about the tires

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.130 
season they don't think about the tires
and<00:01:45.430> then<00:01:45.550> blowouts<00:01:45.940> happen<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.659> very<00:01:46.870> first

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
and then blowouts happen the very first

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.870 
and then blowouts happen the very first
time<00:01:47.320> I<00:01:47.350> watched<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.860> video<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.430> thought<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
time I watched the video I thought the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.460 
time I watched the video I thought the
driver<00:01:49.210> hit<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> brakes<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:50.020> thought<00:01:50.230> that's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
driver hit the brakes I thought that's

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.910 
driver hit the brakes I thought that's
what<00:01:50.740> caused<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:52.479> know<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.840> dive<00:01:53.620> down

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
what caused the you know the dive down

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.310 
what caused the you know the dive down
into<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.310> ditch<00:01:54.580> but<00:01:54.909> after<00:01:55.780> reviewing<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
into the ditch but after reviewing the

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.070 
into the ditch but after reviewing the
video<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.890> zooming<00:01:57.220> in<00:01:57.340> as<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.240> saw<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
video and zooming in as you just saw the

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.500 
video and zooming in as you just saw the
driver<00:01:59.409> didn't<00:02:00.159> hit<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.580> brakes<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:01.150> think

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
driver didn't hit the brakes I think

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.260 
driver didn't hit the brakes I think
that<00:02:01.870> the<00:02:02.350> light<00:02:02.650> that<00:02:02.770> we<00:02:02.920> saw<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.820> as<00:02:04.120> the

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
that the light that we saw is as the

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.420 
that the light that we saw is as the
driver<00:02:04.510> was<00:02:04.720> going<00:02:04.750> down<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.260> road<00:02:05.470> he<00:02:06.040> tried

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
driver was going down the road he tried

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.910 
driver was going down the road he tried
he<00:02:06.729> or<00:02:06.790> she<00:02:06.940> tried<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.330> correct<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.409> steering

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
he or she tried to correct the steering

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.850 
he or she tried to correct the steering
and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.610 
and
when<00:02:09.950> he<00:02:10.039> when<00:02:10.460> he<00:02:10.700> or<00:02:10.789> she<00:02:10.820> did<00:02:11.180> they<00:02:12.050> bumped

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
when he when he or she did they bumped

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.470 
when he when he or she did they bumped
the<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.400> turn<00:02:13.580> signal<00:02:13.940> that's<00:02:14.120> what<00:02:14.270> that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
the the turn signal that's what that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.150 
the the turn signal that's what that
flash<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:15.020> light<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.290> saw<00:02:15.470> those<00:02:15.680> were<00:02:15.920> not<00:02:16.130> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
flash of light we saw those were not the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.730 
flash of light we saw those were not the
brakes<00:02:16.930> what<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.960> think<00:02:18.260> may<00:02:18.560> have<00:02:18.710> happened

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
brakes what I think may have happened

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.520 
brakes what I think may have happened
I'm<00:02:19.160> not<00:02:19.310> too<00:02:19.550> sure<00:02:19.850> I'd<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.960> ask<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
I'm not too sure I'd have to ask the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.270 
I'm not too sure I'd have to ask the
driver<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.870> driving<00:02:24.320> at<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> time<00:02:24.530> but

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
driver that was driving at the time but

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.980 
driver that was driving at the time but
I<00:02:25.310> think<00:02:25.580> what<00:02:25.760> happened<00:02:26.120> was<00:02:26.150> they<00:02:26.570> let<00:02:26.810> off

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
I think what happened was they let off

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.400 
I think what happened was they let off
the<00:02:27.230> gas<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:29.420> reason<00:02:29.780> why<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.960> think<00:02:30.050> that

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the gas and the reason why I think that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.100 
the gas and the reason why I think that
is<00:02:30.590> when<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.220> blowout<00:02:31.760> happens<00:02:32.330> you're<00:02:33.080> not

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
is when that blowout happens you're not

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.480 
is when that blowout happens you're not
supposed<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.680> hit<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.830> brake<00:02:34.130> you're<00:02:34.370> not

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
supposed to hit the brake you're not

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.800 
supposed to hit the brake you're not
supposed<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.760> let<00:02:34.880> off<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> gas<00:02:35.180> pedal<00:02:35.360> you're

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
supposed to let off the gas pedal you're

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.320 
supposed to let off the gas pedal you're
actually<00:02:36.200> supposed<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.860> accelerate<00:02:37.610> and<00:02:37.850> let

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
actually supposed to accelerate and let

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.110 
actually supposed to accelerate and let
me<00:02:38.450> explain<00:02:39.160> if<00:02:40.160> I'm<00:02:40.490> driving<00:02:40.820> down<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
me explain if I'm driving down the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.600 
me explain if I'm driving down the
interstate<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:42.050> highway<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.860> this<00:02:43.340> tire

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
interstate or highway and this tire

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.600 
interstate or highway and this tire
blows<00:02:44.000> out<00:02:44.270> there<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.170> going<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.920> force

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
blows out there is going to be a force

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.810 
blows out there is going to be a force
pulling<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.600> RV<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.260> way<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.700> hit

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
pulling the RV this way and if you hit

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.960 
pulling the RV this way and if you hit
the<00:02:50.030> brakes<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.290> momentum<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.310> force<00:02:52.670> is

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the brakes the momentum that force is

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.960 
the brakes the momentum that force is
going<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.270> be<00:02:53.480> magnified<00:02:54.130> so<00:02:55.130> what<00:02:55.850> you're

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
going to be magnified so what you're

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.000 
going to be magnified so what you're
supposed<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:56.270> do<00:02:56.510> is<00:02:56.900> hit<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> gas<00:02:57.500> what<00:02:57.830> that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
supposed to do is hit the gas what that

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.490 
supposed to do is hit the gas what that
does<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.970> puts<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.450> momentum<00:02:59.870> forward<00:03:00.410> it

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
does is it puts the momentum forward it

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.199 
does is it puts the momentum forward it
keeps<00:03:00.680> you<00:03:00.800> going<00:03:01.100> straight<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.580> takes<00:03:01.820> away

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
keeps you going straight it takes away

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.360 
keeps you going straight it takes away
from<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.989> side<00:03:03.260> momentum<00:03:03.800> trying<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> pull

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
from the side momentum trying to pull

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.430 
from the side momentum trying to pull
you<00:03:04.550> down<00:03:04.580> now<00:03:05.540> if<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.200> driver<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:07.790> they<00:03:08.030> did

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
you down now if that driver if they did

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.140 
you down now if that driver if they did
we<00:03:09.440> know<00:03:09.709> they<00:03:09.830> didn't<00:03:10.040> hit<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.250> brakes<00:03:10.489> but

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
we know they didn't hit the brakes but

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.000 
we know they didn't hit the brakes but
what<00:03:11.330> they<00:03:11.480> might<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.750> done<00:03:12.110> was<00:03:12.739> let<00:03:12.950> off

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
what they might have done was let off

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.520 
what they might have done was let off
the<00:03:13.280> gas<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:14.209> puts<00:03:14.720> all<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.200> force

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
the gas so that puts all that force

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.140 
the gas so that puts all that force
that's<00:03:15.860> driving<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.370> forward<00:03:16.610> off<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.970> back

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that's driving it forward off the back

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.539 
that's driving it forward off the back
wheels<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.660> puts<00:03:17.840> all<00:03:18.049> that<00:03:18.200> force<00:03:18.560> down<00:03:19.250> on

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
wheels it puts all that force down on

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.180 
wheels it puts all that force down on
the<00:03:19.700> front<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.330> RV<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.110> pushes<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.769> RV

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the front of the RV it pushes the RV

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.310 
the front of the RV it pushes the RV
down<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:23.000> think<00:03:23.060> that's<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.750> happened<00:03:24.200> in

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
down and I think that's what happened in

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.470 
down and I think that's what happened in
that<00:03:24.350> video<00:03:24.830> so<00:03:25.549> I'm<00:03:25.640> not<00:03:25.790> saying<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.239> you're

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
that video so I'm not saying that you're

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
that video so I'm not saying that you're
supposed<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.930> accelerate<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.739> gain<00:03:28.010> speed

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
supposed to accelerate and gain speed

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.890 
supposed to accelerate and gain speed
you're<00:03:28.910> just<00:03:29.030> supposed<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.360> accelerate

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you're just supposed to accelerate

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.440 
you're just supposed to accelerate
enough<00:03:30.260> to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> point<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:31.310> where<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.640> regain

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
enough to the point to where you regain
