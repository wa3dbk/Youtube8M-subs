00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.089
 bongos i'm joshua eckert again 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.440
 app and we have the second today 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.740
 preview of the day at the start it is the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.870
 kwt massive yes we had already 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.609
 Tevez team obsessive at two o'clock 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 in the morning, if you have not already 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 has definitely looked up 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.650
 times in the channel over or I link 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 Yes, yes I will certainly a rehearsal 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.439
 do 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.230
 we will first look what ik the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 teams as it has to offer start 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.059
 we of course with the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.510
 negative sides of timo rossini kali 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.090
 and that's some for now 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.190
 it's a song foot of only three 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.629
 Of course strong stars are of course a pity 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.510
 for the striker definitely tevez 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 of course, had only three stars on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 the left foot 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.280
 but i have to say tennis changed my mind 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 a lot better in the aspect 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.110
 the caddies left foot you can get the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 push ass yes there brings nothing 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 and what especially with kali 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.359
 has excited are his, he is has 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.060
 two stars s applies to strikers and the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.680
 is of course less mega sad 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 I think I 'm really bad 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.180
 you can say so no, at all 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.189
 skills were the best way to do it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 but that's it 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.200
 unfortunately also and just as well 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.930
 dribbling i think its dribbling yes 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 pretty shabby change of direction yes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.189
 Always a certain amount of time, I say 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 not so smooth a lot 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.930
 at kali and what is also negative 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.659
 are his long shot and by that I mean 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.060
 not from 30 meters is clear I can 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.460
 These punish the 30 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.320
 but it is clear that metering in the gate is also clear 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.049
 outside the penalty area on the sixteenth 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 against his conclusions unfortunately not into 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.530
 gate 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.360
 but of course ikea has one too 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.549
 few positive pages 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 these were the one he makes pace 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.960
 Pace on the card feels up 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.399
 every case is quicker to be another 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.189
 not so blatant now but when he is in 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.829
 Run it feels really like 93 94 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.960
 ps definitely ghailani 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.270
 super send the next thing is his 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.369
 I 've talked a lot about 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.710
 urgent skills longchance that it 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.470
 bad but you have to say 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.750
 this is a clinic finisher like that 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.760
 english say yes a graduation striker 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.800
 if you have someone in the front of the storm 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.360
 those just want things 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.610
 he does not sink here freezing cold 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.070
 he just needs to play pipapo 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.110
 wanted in the penalty area is the ik on each 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.190
 the right man for you and 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.390
 Of course, that also depends on that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.790
 his positional game 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.740
 he has a very good work break and he is 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.380
 always there where you need them as said 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.890
 Perfect playoff player perfect 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.310
 striker 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.590
 source key finisher just conclude yes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.900
 You could really clean my Italy 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.480
 shit four negative qualities 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.420
 but I give him only three positives 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.610
 75 out of ten because he's just typical 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.220
 Striker characteristics is typical 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.120
 Finnish or final games 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.710
 properties 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.550
 his conclusion very good positional game 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.310
 up and that brings just a lot 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.530
 positive when it comes to just that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.420
 to be a striker not the creator 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.700
 but the one who is played on 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.200
 can and I can sink those things 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.330
 Hope you liked it if so 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.020

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.790

 There will be another one tonight 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.560
 Review.com is definitely following suit 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.000
 around 23 o'clock good if the thermo stoxx 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.360
 you have not seen yet you will find 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.360
 a canal until then he kicks off an ass 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.530
 very much
