make a deal all shout I'm going to do
this<00:02:50.480> put<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.900> nodes<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.230> charge<00:02:51.620> in<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this put the nodes in charge in the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.970 
this put the nodes in charge in the
middle<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:54.640> diamonds<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.940> every<00:02:56.360> corner<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
middle and diamonds in every corner and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.220 
middle and diamonds in every corner and
you<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.850> de<00:02:59.060> Oh<00:02:59.270> char<00:02:59.810> which<00:02:59.960> you<00:03:00.080> can

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
you get the de Oh char which you can

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.150 
you get the de Oh char which you can
make<00:03:00.410> tools<00:03:00.770> with<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.200> let's<00:03:03.740> give<00:03:03.980> an<00:03:04.130> example

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
make tools with so let's give an example

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.360 
make tools with so let's give an example
when<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.190> want<00:03:07.670> pick<00:03:08.150> X<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:08.780> example<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.500> there

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
when I want pick X for example and there

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.210 
when I want pick X for example and there
we<00:03:10.460> go<00:03:10.580> d<00:03:11.510> EO<00:03:11.780> pic<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.440> that's<00:03:12.710> kind<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:13.010> how<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
we go d EO pic so that's kind of how the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.940 
we go d EO pic so that's kind of how the
model<00:03:13.610> works<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.620> once<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:15.800> get<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:16.070> 9<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:17.950> an

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
model works and once you get to 9 of an

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.640 
model works and once you get to 9 of an
ingot<00:03:19.430> or<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:20.000> don't<00:03:20.060> know<00:03:20.300> if<00:03:20.450> they<00:03:21.200> are<00:03:21.470> even

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
ingot or I don't know if they are even

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.710 
ingot or I don't know if they are even
ingots<00:03:22.220> let's<00:03:22.520> see<00:03:22.790> if<00:03:22.910> they<00:03:23.030> are<00:03:23.150> ingots<00:03:23.570> or

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
ingots let's see if they are ingots or

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.170 
ingots let's see if they are ingots or
not<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:26.020> there<00:03:27.020> nothing<00:03:27.230> it's<00:03:27.709> nope<00:03:28.640> there

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
not and there nothing it's nope there

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.810 
not and there nothing it's nope there
nothing<00:03:29.630> is<00:03:29.780> there<00:03:30.590> are<00:03:30.770> gems<00:03:33.520> nevermind<00:03:34.520> so

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
nothing is there are gems nevermind so

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.210 
nothing is there are gems nevermind so
well<00:03:35.330> once<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:35.720> get<00:03:35.870> nine<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.500> them<00:03:36.680> i<00:03:36.860> think

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
well once you get nine of them i think

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.840 
well once you get nine of them i think
its<00:03:37.370> nine<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:39.020> put<00:03:39.320> one<00:03:39.590> in<00:03:39.890> every<00:03:40.160> slot<00:03:40.610> of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
its nine you put one in every slot of

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.930 
its nine you put one in every slot of
the<00:03:40.880> workbench<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.380> get<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:44.980> block<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.310> the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
the workbench and you get a block of the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.160 
the workbench and you get a block of the
same<00:03:47.270> one<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.580> they<00:03:49.580> work<00:03:49.760> just<00:03:49.790> like<00:03:50.330> every
