00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.160 
isn't too many levels and think it's a
little<00:02:09.630> repetitive<00:02:10.280> but<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.490> guess<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
little repetitive but I guess and you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.760 
little repetitive but I guess and you
can<00:02:13.350> get<00:02:14.130> gold<00:02:14.520> every<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:16.260> go<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.740> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
can get gold every time you go to a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.980 
can get gold every time you go to a
level<00:02:17.070> or<00:02:17.310> link<00:02:17.940> even<00:02:18.180> if<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.420> die<00:02:18.630> you<00:02:18.840> get

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
level or link even if you die you get

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.050 
level or link even if you die you get
some<00:02:19.170> good<00:02:19.350> which<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> can<00:02:20.400> use<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.580> upgrade

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
some good which you can use to upgrade

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.110 
some good which you can use to upgrade
your<00:02:21.330> units<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.850> do<00:02:23.970> better

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
your units so that you can do better

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.020 
your units so that you can do better
