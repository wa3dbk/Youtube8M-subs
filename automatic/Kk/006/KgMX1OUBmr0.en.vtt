00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
your camera lens one of its out of the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899 
your camera lens one of its out of the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
housing so that just pops on and off

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.460 
housing so that just pops on and off
right<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:20.540> your<00:01:21.540> camera<00:01:21.780> has<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.259> lens

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
right here your camera has the lens

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
right here your camera has the lens
itself<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> slightly<00:01:23.340> rubber<00:01:23.700> texture

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
itself has a slightly rubber texture

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.999 
itself has a slightly rubber texture
there<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.689> actually<00:01:24.900> fits<00:01:25.229> pretty<00:01:25.500> snugly

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
there so it actually fits pretty snugly

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.289 
there so it actually fits pretty snugly
and<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:28.369> again<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> same<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.000> soft

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and it is again the same kind of a soft

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.450 
and it is again the same kind of a soft
plastic<00:01:30.689> material<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> soft

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
plastic material that's not a soft

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.999 
plastic material that's not a soft
plastic<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> little<00:01:34.799> bit<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
plastic it's not it has a little bit of

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.469 
plastic it's not it has a little bit of
give<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:35.549> why<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.729> calling<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.150> soft

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
give so that's why I'm calling it soft

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.620 
give so that's why I'm calling it soft
it's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.810> slightly<00:01:37.290> flexible<00:01:37.770> material<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
it's a slightly flexible material and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.569 
it's a slightly flexible material and
that<00:01:39.630> will<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> number<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:40.920> protection

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
that will be the number one protection

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
that will be the number one protection
because<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.759> don't<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.329> lens<00:01:42.630> right

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because you don't want that lens right

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.600 
because you don't want that lens right
there<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.680> camera<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.310> scratched
