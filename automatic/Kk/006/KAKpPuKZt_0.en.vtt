00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
try that first line a couple times when

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.420 
try that first line a couple times when
you<00:01:40.690> get<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.020> that's<00:01:41.200> three<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:42.010> lines<00:01:42.220> of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430
