year looking again yeah what's it about

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.960 
year looking again yeah what's it about
the<00:06:19.900> fatter<00:06:20.110> they<00:06:20.290> had<00:06:20.530> in<00:06:20.710> here<00:06:20.920> it<00:06:21.490> was<00:06:21.730> it

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
the fatter they had in here it was it

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.130 
the fatter they had in here it was it
was<00:06:22.090> neat<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.510> mean<00:06:22.660> it<00:06:22.750> was<00:06:22.810> something

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
was neat I mean it was something

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.450 
was neat I mean it was something
completely<00:06:23.350> different<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:23.980> people<00:06:24.310> haven't

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
completely different that people haven't

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.850 
completely different that people haven't
done<00:06:24.670> before<00:06:24.870> so<00:06:25.870> that<00:06:26.440> made<00:06:26.590> it<00:06:26.620> interesting

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
done before so that made it interesting

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.270 
done before so that made it interesting
I<00:06:27.780> would<00:06:28.780> not<00:06:28.960> have<00:06:28.990> I<00:06:29.290> maybe<00:06:29.800> would<00:06:30.040> have<00:06:30.070> paid

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
I would not have I maybe would have paid

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.760 
I would not have I maybe would have paid
forty<00:06:30.640> dollars<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.120> do<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:31.360> I<00:06:31.590> think<00:06:32.590> about

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
forty dollars to do it I think about

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.110 
forty dollars to do it I think about
half<00:06:32.950> that<00:06:32.980> price<00:06:33.310> probably<00:06:33.790> would<00:06:33.910> have<00:06:33.970> been

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
half that price probably would have been

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.230 
half that price probably would have been
sufficient<00:06:34.650> but<00:06:35.650> if<00:06:35.950> they<00:06:36.160> pay<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:36.550> much<00:06:36.730> and

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
sufficient but if they pay that much and

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.060 
sufficient but if they pay that much and
they<00:06:37.870> probably<00:06:38.080> would<00:06:38.260> have<00:06:38.380> a<00:06:38.560> lot<00:06:38.890> more

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.070 
they probably would have a lot more

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.770 
they probably would have a lot more
penis<00:06:39.310> doing<00:06:39.640> it<00:06:39.730> and<00:06:39.820> it<00:06:39.970> would<00:06:40.270> have<00:06:40.419> control

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
penis doing it and it would have control

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.120 
penis doing it and it would have control
about<00:06:40.990> that<00:06:41.230> do<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.530> think<00:06:41.680> a<00:06:41.800> lot<00:06:42.010> of<00:06:42.040> the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
about that do you think a lot of the

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:43.800 
about that do you think a lot of the
people<00:06:42.490> that<00:06:42.640> actually<00:06:42.669> like<00:06:43.090> actively<00:06:43.540> set

people that actually like actively set
out<00:06:43.960> and<00:06:44.080> paid<00:06:44.230> for<00:06:44.470> it<00:06:44.560> would<00:06:44.770> have<00:06:45.070> said<00:06:45.460> the

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
out and paid for it would have said the
