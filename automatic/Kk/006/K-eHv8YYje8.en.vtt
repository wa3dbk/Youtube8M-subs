okay<00:00:01.070> this<00:00:02.070> is<00:00:02.280> pretty<00:00:02.730> easy<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.990> work<00:00:04.170> with

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
okay this is pretty easy to work with

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay this is pretty easy to work with
firstly<00:00:06.240> there<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.200> three<00:00:07.529> cards<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:07.980> are

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
firstly there are three cards that are

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.280 
firstly there are three cards that are
not<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.460> play<00:00:08.700> these<00:00:09.090> never<00:00:09.630> get<00:00:09.870> into<00:00:09.990> play

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
not in play these never get into play

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.890 
not in play these never get into play
these<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.860> mystery<00:00:11.219> cards<00:00:11.730> 3<00:00:12.330> out<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.480> 24

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
these are the mystery cards 3 out of 24

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.849 
these are the mystery cards 3 out of 24
I<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.830> that's<00:00:14.009> 1/8<00:00:14.429> or<00:00:14.670> 12.5%<00:00:15.619> there's<00:00:16.619> very

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I think that's 1/8 or 12.5% there's very

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.700 
I think that's 1/8 or 12.5% there's very
few<00:00:16.980> card<00:00:17.520> games<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.960> cards<00:00:19.470> out<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
few card games that have cards out of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.570 
few card games that have cards out of
play<00:00:20.100> or<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.090> kitty<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.600> mean<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.529> know<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> lot

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
play or in a kitty I mean you know a lot

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.160 
play or in a kitty I mean you know a lot
of<00:00:23.609> games<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.090> cards<00:00:24.359> at<00:00:24.449> tempera<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:24.960> kitty

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of games at cards at tempera into kitty

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.509 
of games at cards at tempera into kitty
and<00:00:25.320> somebody<00:00:25.590> bids<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> kitty<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.430> they

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and somebody bids for the kitty and they

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 
and somebody bids for the kitty and they
take<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> hole<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.660> hand<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
take it into the hole in the hand so you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.589 
take it into the hole in the hand so you
have<00:00:28.710> three<00:00:28.980> cards<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> game<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.510> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
have three cards out of the game so you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.120 
have three cards out of the game so you
don't<00:00:30.779> know<00:00:30.840> what<00:00:30.990> they<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.980> they

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
don't know what they are but they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't know what they are but they
certainly<00:00:32.340> impact<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> distribution<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
certainly impact the distribution of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
certainly impact the distribution of
hands<00:00:34.110> sometimes<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.680> think<00:00:34.860> oh<00:00:35.100> my<00:00:35.579> god<00:00:35.790> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
hands sometimes you think oh my god this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.190 
hands sometimes you think oh my god this
is<00:00:36.120> hopeless<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> lose<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.930> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
is hopeless I'm going to lose to the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
is hopeless I'm going to lose to the
right<00:00:37.410> lo<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> behold<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.670> rights<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
right lo and behold the rights in the

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.510 
right lo and behold the rights in the
kitty<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.350> sometimes<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.040> lucky<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
kitty so sometimes you get lucky and

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.740 
kitty so sometimes you get lucky and
there<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> certain<00:00:42.090> amount<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> luck<00:00:42.629> in

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
there is a certain amount of luck in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.180 
there is a certain amount of luck in
this<00:00:42.899> game<00:00:43.140> problem<00:00:43.590> perhaps<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.010> little

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
this game problem perhaps a little

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.770 
this game problem perhaps a little
higher<00:00:44.520> than<00:00:44.789> other<00:00:44.940> games<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.510> there's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
higher than other games but there's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
higher than other games but there's
still<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.260> great<00:00:46.469> skill<00:00:46.829> factor<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> working

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
still a great skill factor in working

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
still a great skill factor in working
with<00:00:47.700> partners<00:00:48.149> who<00:00:48.329> understand<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> meaning

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
with partners who understand the meaning

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
with partners who understand the meaning
of<00:00:49.739> how<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> cross<00:00:50.280> Trump<00:00:50.610> hands<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of how to cross Trump hands and do that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.100 
of how to cross Trump hands and do that
sort<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> thing

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
sort of thing

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.520 
sort of thing
so<00:00:52.590> if<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:52.949> turn<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.309> heart<00:00:54.289> normally<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so if we turn our heart normally and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
so if we turn our heart normally and
this<00:00:55.770> actually<00:00:56.219> holds<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.640> pretty<00:00:56.670> well

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this actually holds up pretty well

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
this actually holds up pretty well
you're<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> find<00:00:58.289> each<00:00:58.530> hand<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you're going to find each hand and I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
you're going to find each hand and I
mention<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.579> before<00:00:59.730> each<00:01:00.120> hand<00:01:00.390> will

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mention this before each hand will

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.180 
mention this before each hand will
usually<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.230> Trump<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> there

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
usually have one Trump and there

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
usually have one Trump and there
probably<00:01:02.489> will<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> Trump<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> kitty

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
probably will be a Trump in the kitty

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
probably will be a Trump in the kitty
let's<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.320> if<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.589> holds<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.640> two

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
let's see if this holds up we got two

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.320 
let's see if this holds up we got two
Trump<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.390> one<00:01:06.659> Trump<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.939> we<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.030> zero

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
Trump here one Trump here we have zero

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
Trump here one Trump here we have zero
Trump<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.110> happen<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.920> to

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
Trump here but we happen to have two to

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
Trump here but we happen to have two to
trump<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.060> if<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> turns<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> hearts<00:01:13.170> are

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
trump in here if it turns out hearts are

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
trump in here if it turns out hearts are
going<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.530> named<00:01:13.710> Trump<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.000> course

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to be named Trump and of course

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
going to be named Trump and of course
one<00:01:15.390> Trump<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> kitty<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.590> one

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
one Trump and the kitty so this one

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
one Trump and the kitty so this one
happens<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.400> two<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.509> two<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.930> one

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
happens to have two so it's two to one

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.929 
happens to have two so it's two to one
and<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> he<00:01:19.619> unfortunately<00:01:20.130> didn't<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.729> any

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and the he unfortunately didn't have any

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
and the he unfortunately didn't have any
but<00:01:21.150> normally<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.020> expect<00:01:22.049> each<00:01:22.530> person<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
but normally you expect each person to

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.170 
but normally you expect each person to
have<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> Trump<00:01:23.610> these<00:01:23.790> could<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.090> been

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
have a Trump these could have been

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.679 
have a Trump these could have been
easily<00:01:24.450> divided<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.189> well<00:01:26.689> secondly

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
easily divided this way as well secondly

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.780 
easily divided this way as well secondly
when<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> card<00:01:29.040> again<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> good

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
when this card again this is a good

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
when this card again this is a good
exercise<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.450> bidding<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.229> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
exercise in bidding when you have this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.350 
exercise in bidding when you have this
card<00:01:31.860> turn<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.430> goes<00:01:32.549> past<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.210> he

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
card turn and it goes past because he
