00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.240 
is that he's actually making his own
front<00:00:08.189> derailleur<00:00:08.670> now<00:00:09.559> he's<00:00:10.559> gone<00:00:10.769> back<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
front derailleur now he's gone back to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.950 
front derailleur now he's gone back to
using<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.639> hope<00:00:11.880> hubs<00:00:12.179> for<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> while<00:00:12.719> he<00:00:12.929> was

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
using the hope hubs for a while he was

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.839 
using the hope hubs for a while he was
using<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.469> gold<00:00:13.710> tech<00:00:13.950> hubs<00:00:14.219> which<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.700> an

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
using the gold tech hubs which was an

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.740 
using the gold tech hubs which was an
English<00:00:15.179> hub<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:17.029> actually<00:00:18.029> had<00:00:18.300> an<00:00:18.510> oil

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
English hub that actually had an oil

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.019 
English hub that actually had an oil
reservoir<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> pumped<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> oil

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
reservoir in it that it pumped the oil

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.090 
reservoir in it that it pumped the oil
through<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.630> freewheel<00:00:22.260> body<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:22.980> there

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
through the freewheel body because there

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.170 
through the freewheel body because there
was<00:00:23.250> no<00:00:23.430> bearings<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> was<00:00:25.160> no<00:00:26.160> no<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.849> you

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
was no bearings it was no no just you

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.570 
was no bearings it was no no just you
know<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.599> sensitized<00:00:28.590> bearings<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
know like sensitized bearings so the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.999 
know like sensitized bearings so the
body<00:00:29.849> itself<00:00:30.330> actually<00:00:30.570> ran<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.170> steel<00:00:31.619> or

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
body itself actually ran on steel or

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.340 
body itself actually ran on steel or
aluminum<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.640> coated<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.230> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
aluminum that was coated and so as you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.770 
aluminum that was coated and so as you
were<00:00:34.440> riding<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.980> was<00:00:35.160> pumping<00:00:35.670> oil<00:00:35.940> through

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
were riding it was pumping oil through

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.310 
were riding it was pumping oil through
the<00:00:36.899> hub<00:00:38.480> solution<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> non-problem<00:00:42.320> well

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the hub solution for a non-problem well

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
the hub solution for a non-problem well
they're<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:43.920> well<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> because

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
they're you know well there is because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190 
they're you know well there is because
see<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.450> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> do<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.020> get<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
see what you had to do to get a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.310 
see what you had to do to get a
nineteenth<00:00:46.739> cog<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> nine<00:00:47.820> ten<00:00:48.120> eleven<00:00:48.660> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
nineteenth cog on a nine ten eleven you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
nineteenth cog on a nine ten eleven you
had<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.800> make<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.399> had<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> special

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
had to make he had to have a special

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600 
had to make he had to have a special
freewheel<00:00:51.750> made<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.739> bollard<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> am

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
freewheel made to do that bollard I am

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.450 
freewheel made to do that bollard I am
the<00:00:53.760> small<00:00:54.000> ER<00:00:54.030> diameter<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> shorter<00:00:55.710> okay

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the small ER diameter and shorter okay

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.660 
the small ER diameter and shorter okay
and<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.239> there<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and so there that was one of the that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.090 
and so there that was one of the that
was<00:00:59.789> one<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> problems<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.260> pylon<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
was one of the problems this pylon is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.780 
was one of the problems this pylon is
actually<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:04.070> design<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> he<00:01:05.400> drew<00:01:05.640> up

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
actually a design that he drew up

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.510 
actually a design that he drew up
probably<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.540> thirty<00:01:06.900> years<00:01:07.260> ago<00:01:07.590> he<00:01:08.220> still

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

retail price on this is probably

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.789 
retail price on this is probably
somewhere<00:01:55.170> about<00:01:55.350> eighty<00:01:55.560> two<00:01:55.770> hundred

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
somewhere about eighty two hundred
