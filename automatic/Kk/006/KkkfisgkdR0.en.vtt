00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I think this is a big nerf but you might

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.539

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
I'm not so sure with this I think it's
honestly<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.159> big<00:01:11.369> nerve<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.880> honest<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.510> at

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
I feel like it was pretty big when this

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
I feel like it was pretty big when this
bug<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.680> introduced<00:01:35.189> because<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> did<00:01:36.390> my

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
bug is introduced because I did my

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
bug is introduced because I did my
research<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:37.049> looks<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.100> bad

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
research it looks like it's not that bad

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.640 
research it looks like it's not that bad
but<00:01:38.640> honestly<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.930> look<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.380> one

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
but honestly when you look at this one

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.889 
but honestly when you look at this one
rate<00:01:40.770> when<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> drops<00:01:41.490> two<00:01:41.970> percent<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.780> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
rate when it drops two percent as you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.100 
rate when it drops two percent as you
can<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> goes<00:01:43.350> from<00:01:43.439> 50<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.909> 250<00:01:44.909> %<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.930> or

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
just the landing phase not really in

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.250 
just the landing phase not really in
team<00:03:42.329> actually<00:03:42.720> some<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.989> them<00:03:43.109> are<00:03:43.230> in

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
team actually some of them are in

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.890 
team actually some of them are in
teamfights<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.919> I<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:44.430> he'll<00:03:44.579> still<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:45.780> at

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
teamfights but I think he'll still be at

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.470 
teamfights but I think he'll still be at
the<00:03:46.019> same<00:03:46.230> power<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.590> he<00:03:46.889> was<00:03:47.040> before<00:03:47.389> he'll<00:03:48.389> be

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
the same power as he was before he'll be

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.569 
the same power as he was before he'll be
a<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.840> stronger<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.500> that's<00:03:49.680> about<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:49.980> so

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
a bit stronger but that's about it so

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.509 
a bit stronger but that's about it so
you<00:03:51.030> might<00:03:51.209> seem<00:03:52.109> more<00:03:52.500> maybe<00:03:52.919> yeah<00:03:53.340> you'll

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
you might seem more maybe yeah you'll

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.069 
you might seem more maybe yeah you'll
probably<00:03:53.700> see<00:03:53.940> him<00:03:53.970> more<00:03:54.209> for<00:03:54.239> sure<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.720> think

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
probably see him more for sure I think

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.500 
probably see him more for sure I think
he'll<00:03:55.200> get<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.380> popularity<00:03:56.299> increased<00:03:57.299> for

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
he'll get a popularity increased for

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.039 
he'll get a popularity increased for
sure<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.500> shyvana<00:03:58.889> um<00:03:59.220> so<00:04:00.030> rank<00:04:00.299> 1<00:04:00.540> he's<00:04:00.900> the

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
sure so shyvana um so rank 1 he's the

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.890 
sure so shyvana um so rank 1 he's the
deal<00:04:01.260> 60<00:04:02.129> damage<00:04:02.459> or<00:04:02.700> sorry<00:04:03.000> 80<00:04:03.209> damage<00:04:03.450> but

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
deal 60 damage or sorry 80 damage but

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.599 
deal 60 damage or sorry 80 damage but
now<00:04:04.019> she<00:04:04.079> does<00:04:04.440> 60<00:04:04.799> because<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.099> was<00:04:05.190> some<00:04:05.370> bug

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
now she does 60 because it was some bug

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.330 
now she does 60 because it was some bug
and<00:04:05.849> you<00:04:06.780> know<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.200> might<00:04:07.530> seem<00:04:07.799> whatever

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
and you know this might seem whatever

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.379 
and you know this might seem whatever
but<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.359> think<00:04:09.810> it's<00:04:09.989> actually<00:04:10.169> pretty<00:04:10.620> big<00:04:10.980> ish

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
but I think it's actually pretty big ish

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.819 
but I think it's actually pretty big ish
because<00:04:12.389> let's<00:04:12.930> say<00:04:13.019> you're<00:04:13.260> against<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.590> bad

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
because let's say you're against a bad

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.619 
because let's say you're against a bad
matchup<00:04:14.069> and<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.669> got<00:04:14.819> a<00:04:14.849> farm<00:04:15.120> with<00:04:15.269> your<00:04:15.480> e

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
matchup and you got a farm with your e

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:17.449 
matchup and you got a farm with your e
now<00:04:16.260> last<00:04:16.500> hitting<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.859> going<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.039> be<00:04:17.160> more<00:04:17.400> of

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
now last hitting is going to be more of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.420 
now last hitting is going to be more of
a<00:04:17.609> bitch<00:04:18.079> Sophie<00:04:19.079> against<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.500> range<00:04:19.769> rise<00:04:20.039> and

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
a bitch Sophie against a range rise and

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.770 
a bitch Sophie against a range rise and
if<00:04:20.519> you<00:04:20.579> go<00:04:20.669> near<00:04:20.849> them<00:04:21.000> he's<00:04:21.150> got<00:04:21.180> those<00:04:21.449> stuff

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
if you go near them he's got those stuff

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.649 
if you go near them he's got those stuff
at<00:04:21.959> you<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.219> got<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> last<00:04:23.880> name<00:04:24.030> with<00:04:24.180> E<00:04:24.419> and

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
at you so you got a last name with E and

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.930 
at you so you got a last name with E and
now<00:04:25.530> it's<00:04:25.770> going<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.979> be<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.099> bit<00:04:26.400> hard

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
now it's going to be a bit hard

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.840 
now it's going to be a bit hard
and<00:04:27.590> yeah<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.740> next<00:04:28.890> time<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.220> rank<00:04:29.430> your<00:04:29.580> e

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
and yeah the next time you rank your e

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.650 
and yeah the next time you rank your e
is<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:31.020> level<00:04:31.530> eight<00:04:32.240> unless<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.480> are

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
is like level eight unless you are

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.660 
is like level eight unless you are
obviously<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.800> don't<00:04:34.920> know<00:04:35.070> i'm<00:04:35.280> not<00:04:35.430> sure<00:04:35.610> i

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
obviously I don't know i'm not sure i

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.700 
obviously I don't know i'm not sure i
don't<00:04:35.760> play<00:04:35.970> chef<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> top<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.170> just<00:04:37.350> know<00:04:37.530> I

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
don't play chef on the top I just know I

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.880 
don't play chef on the top I just know I
just<00:04:37.770> max<00:04:38.070> out<00:04:38.190> w<00:04:38.960> but<00:04:39.960> I'm<00:04:40.050> not<00:04:40.080> sure<00:04:40.200> if<00:04:40.650> the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
just max out w but I'm not sure if the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.030 
just max out w but I'm not sure if the
map<00:04:41.040> if<00:04:41.220> maxing<00:04:41.910> out<00:04:42.030> II<00:04:42.210> changes<00:04:42.770> if<00:04:43.770> you're

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
map if maxing out II changes if you're

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.530 
map if maxing out II changes if you're
against<00:04:44.220> like<00:04:44.370> a<00:04:44.400> range<00:04:44.760> or<00:04:44.970> something<00:04:45.300> so

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
against like a range or something so

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.110 
against like a range or something so
whatever<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:47.250> yeah<00:04:47.370> definitely<00:04:47.490> last<00:04:47.940> hitting

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
whatever so yeah definitely last hitting

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.440 
whatever so yeah definitely last hitting
is<00:04:48.240> going<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.420> be<00:04:48.540> harder<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.230> do<00:04:50.000> if<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.180> and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
is going to be harder to do if you and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.840 
is going to be harder to do if you and
if<00:04:51.690> your<00:04:51.900> last<00:04:52.380> inning<00:04:52.560> with<00:04:52.590> thee<00:04:52.800> so<00:04:53.430> silver

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
if your last inning with thee so silver

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.720 
if your last inning with thee so silver
the<00:04:54.270> range<00:04:55.020> change<00:04:55.410> nothing<00:04:56.280> she's<00:04:56.550> still

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
the range change nothing she's still

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.520 
the range change nothing she's still
going<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.970> be<00:04:57.120> outclassed<00:04:57.840> by<00:04:58.080> other<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.440> he

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
going to be outclassed by other it he

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.090 
going to be outclassed by other it he
carries<00:04:58.890> it's<00:04:59.460> nothing<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:01.080> guess<00:05:01.710> this<00:05:01.890> is

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
carries it's nothing I guess this is

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.700 
carries it's nothing I guess this is
kind<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.430> something<00:05:02.610> grander<00:05:03.510> more<00:05:03.720> increase

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
kind of something grander more increase

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.230 
kind of something grander more increase
on<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:04.860> projectile<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.610> she<00:05:05.790> probably<00:05:06.000> not

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
on the projectile and she probably not

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.140 
on the projectile and she probably not
but<00:05:06.780> we're<00:05:06.990> now<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:08.130> gets<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.460> GP<00:05:08.760> treatment

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
but we're now this gets a GP treatment

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.480 
but we're now this gets a GP treatment
when<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.330> kill<00:05:09.540> an<00:05:09.630> enemy<00:05:10.130> you<00:05:11.130> get<00:05:11.280> half<00:05:11.430> the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
when you kill an enemy you get half the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.090 
when you kill an enemy you get half the
mana<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:14.510> think<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:15.660> came<00:05:16.080> yeah<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.770> know<00:05:16.830> where

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
mana I think this came yeah I know where

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.310 
mana I think this came yeah I know where
this<00:05:17.190> happening<00:05:17.550> sometimes<00:05:18.080> but<00:05:19.080> whatever

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
this happening sometimes but whatever

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.250 
this happening sometimes but whatever
now<00:05:20.010> code<00:05:20.310> Ellen<00:05:20.550> goes<00:05:20.730> down<00:05:20.970> by<00:05:21.360> 10<00:05:21.810> seconds

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
now code Ellen goes down by 10 seconds

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.760 
now code Ellen goes down by 10 seconds
per<00:05:22.410> level<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.950> less<00:05:23.820> mana<00:05:24.060> and<00:05:24.480> I<00:05:25.020> ignore<00:05:25.350> I

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
per level and less mana and I ignore I

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.710 
per level and less mana and I ignore I
don't<00:05:26.190> think<00:05:26.280> this<00:05:26.490> means<00:05:26.550> that<00:05:26.820> much<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.510> don't

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
don't think this means that much I don't

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.740 
don't think this means that much I don't
think<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:27.900> was<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.020> much<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.290> a<00:05:28.440> problem<00:05:28.650> I

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
think it was that much of a problem I

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.600 
think it was that much of a problem I
think<00:05:30.750> this<00:05:30.900> one<00:05:31.080> was<00:05:31.290> pretty<00:05:31.770> interesting<00:05:32.160> so

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
think this one was pretty interesting so

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.659 
think this one was pretty interesting so
every<00:05:33.240> time<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.390> swapped<00:05:33.780> in<00:05:33.960> um<00:05:34.770> i<00:05:34.830> would

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
every time you swapped in um i would

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.550 
every time you swapped in um i would
think<00:05:35.880> that<00:05:36.120> then<00:05:36.630> we<00:05:36.780> tried<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.050> burst<00:05:37.290> you

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
think that then we tried to burst you

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.590 
think that then we tried to burst you
and<00:05:37.770> in<00:05:38.010> that<00:05:38.160> zero<00:05:38.669> point<00:05:38.850> 25<00:05:39.150> seconds<00:05:39.540> you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
and in that zero point 25 seconds you

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.810 
and in that zero point 25 seconds you
probably<00:05:39.930> take<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.110> lot<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.500> damage<00:05:40.890> since<00:05:41.700> you

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
probably take a lot of damage since you

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.420 
probably take a lot of damage since you
were<00:05:41.910> building<00:05:42.180> any<00:05:42.540> resist<00:05:42.900> or<00:05:43.110> whatever<00:05:43.430> you

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
were building any resist or whatever you

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.270 
were building any resist or whatever you
had<00:05:44.550> like<00:05:44.760> 90<00:05:45.750> armor<00:05:46.140> for<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.560> few<00:05:46.830> seconds<00:05:47.130> and

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
had like 90 armor for a few seconds and

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.080 
had like 90 armor for a few seconds and
finally<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:47.910> get<00:05:48.060> that<00:05:48.270> buffed<00:05:48.990> armor<00:05:49.500> but

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
finally you get that buffed armor but

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.330 
finally you get that buffed armor but
with<00:05:51.090> all<00:05:51.210> these<00:05:51.330> buffs<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.950> don't<00:05:52.950> think<00:05:53.040> ur

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
with all these buffs I don't think ur

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.190 
with all these buffs I don't think ur
got<00:05:53.520> is<00:05:53.760> going<00:05:54.330> to<00:05:54.419> be<00:05:54.510> good<00:05:54.690> i<00:05:54.750> still<00:05:55.080> think

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
got is going to be good i still think

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.010 
got is going to be good i still think
he's<00:05:55.380> going<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.530> be<00:05:55.620> the<00:05:55.770> lowest<00:05:56.010> win<00:05:56.430> rate<00:05:57.020> so

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
he's going to be the lowest win rate so

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.440 
he's going to be the lowest win rate so
far<00:05:58.230> so<00:05:58.500> yeah<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:59.490> don't<00:06:00.060> think<00:06:00.210> it's<00:06:00.300> gonna<00:06:00.390> be

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
far so yeah I don't think it's gonna be

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.320
