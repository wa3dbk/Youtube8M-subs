demonstrate<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> he's<00:01:23.820> supposed<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.240> get

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
demonstrate and you he's supposed to get

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.859 
demonstrate and you he's supposed to get
his<00:01:24.659> gas<00:01:25.409> at<00:01:25.680> 12<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:26.640> instead<00:01:27.240> chooses<00:01:27.720> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
his gas at 12 but he instead chooses to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.859 
his gas at 12 but he instead chooses to
get<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> around<00:01:28.860> 14<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:32.329> what<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.720> do

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
get it around 14 and what you want to do

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.640 
get it around 14 and what you want to do
then<00:01:34.350> as<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.250> blue<00:01:35.400> Protoss<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
then as the blue Protoss is you get to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.620 
then as the blue Protoss is you get to
put<00:01:37.860> two<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.549> three<00:01:38.759> probes<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
put two or three probes into the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450 
put two or three probes into the
assimilator<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.470> soon<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.860> warps<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
assimilator as soon as it warps in and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.469 
assimilator as soon as it warps in and
you<00:01:41.820> start<00:01:41.880> getting<00:01:42.860> gas<00:01:43.860> until<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> reach<00:01:44.670> 50

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you start getting gas until you reach 50

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.969 
you start getting gas until you reach 50
then<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> pull<00:01:46.020> all<00:01:46.200> your<00:01:46.259> pros<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
then you pull all your pros out and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
then you pull all your pros out and
start<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:47.790> mining<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.390> minerals<00:01:48.750> again<00:01:50.090> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
start start mining the minerals again so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.770 
start start mining the minerals again so
at<00:01:51.630> around<00:01:52.439> 15<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.909> should<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.210> throwing<00:01:54.479> down

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
at around 15 you should be throwing down

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.080 
at around 15 you should be throwing down
so<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.740> he's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.130> delayed<00:01:56.850> in

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so as you see he's a little delayed in

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
so as you see he's a little delayed in
he's<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.750> his<00:01:57.990> build<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:59.369> should<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
he's in his build you should be to a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.760 
he's in his build you should be to a
throwing<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.390> at<00:02:00.649> 15<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.189> chrono<00:02:02.490> boo

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
throwing down at 15 the chrono boo

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.760 
throwing down at 15 the chrono boo
the<00:02:04.130> cybernetics<00:02:04.759> core<00:02:05.259> so<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.439> he<00:02:06.560> can

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the cybernetics core so that he can

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.369 
the cybernetics core so that he can
start<00:02:07.130> researching<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.850> war<00:02:08.569> p<00:02:08.750> work<00:02:09.200> aid

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
start researching the war p work aid

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.360 
start researching the war p work aid
technology<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:10.190> soon<00:02:10.519> as<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.789> can<00:02:12.160> now<00:02:13.160> he's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
technology as soon as you can now he's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.710 
technology as soon as you can now he's
even<00:02:14.470> from<00:02:15.470> boosting<00:02:15.890> his<00:02:16.010> shot<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:17.060> which

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
even from boosting his shot on which

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.660

my<00:03:52.220> way<00:03:53.680> basically<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.010> principle<00:03:55.519> of<00:03:55.669> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
my way basically the principle of the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.659 
my way basically the principle of the
Korean<00:03:56.630> for<00:03:56.840> gate<00:03:56.989> is<00:03:57.169> you<00:03:57.470> have<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.040> since

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
Korean for gate is you have to since

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.699 
Korean for gate is you have to since
it's<00:03:58.849> in<00:03:58.970> all<00:03:59.090> all<00:03:59.359> all<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.139> build<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:00.470> have

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
it's in all all all and build you have

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.309 
it's in all all all and build you have
to<00:04:00.889> inflict<00:04:01.160> damage<00:04:01.310> early<00:04:01.819> on<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:03.139> have

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
to inflict damage early on and you have

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.520 
to inflict damage early on and you have
to<00:04:03.470> put<00:04:03.650> on<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.889> pressure<00:04:04.069> now<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:05.810> am<00:04:06.139> moving

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
to put on the pressure now I am moving

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.710 
to put on the pressure now I am moving
out<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.950> take<00:04:07.160> out<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:07.519> these<00:04:07.940> two<00:04:08.239> proxy

this build is notorious for warping in
pylons<00:04:43.700> inside<00:04:44.240> your<00:04:44.630> opponent's<00:04:45.080> base<00:04:45.729> when

they warp in when they're finished
working<00:04:48.350> in<00:04:48.639> you<00:04:49.639> can<00:04:49.820> just<00:04:50.030> start<00:04:50.210> working<00:04:50.570> in

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
working in you can just start working in

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.710 
working in you can just start working in
units<00:04:50.990> at<00:04:51.110> random<00:04:51.500> as<00:04:51.740> soon<00:04:52.610> as<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:53.479> warp

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720

warp<00:04:57.590> in<00:04:57.800> results<00:04:58.430> just<00:04:58.639> keep<00:04:58.850> working<00:04:59.210> them

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
warp in results just keep working them

warp in results just keep working them
and<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:01.610> have<00:05:01.880> basically<00:05:02.919> not<00:05:03.919> enough<00:05:04.220> to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
and I have basically not enough to

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.690 
and I have basically not enough to
thwart<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.350> I'm<00:05:06.530> even<00:05:06.830> asking<00:05:06.950> him<00:05:07.310> is

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
thwart this and I'm even asking him is

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.219 
thwart this and I'm even asking him is
this<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.210> Korean<00:05:08.540> for<00:05:08.750> gate<00:05:09.760> this<00:05:11.229> it'sit's

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
this the Korean for gate this it'sit's

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.460 
this the Korean for gate this it'sit's
he<00:05:12.620> his<00:05:13.430> gateway<00:05:14.180> his<00:05:14.419> build<00:05:14.690> order<00:05:14.810> wasn't

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
he his gateway his build order wasn't

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.920 
he his gateway his build order wasn't
exactly<00:05:15.860> as<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.340> Korean<00:05:17.030> forget<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.540> shoot<00:05:17.810> it

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
exactly as the Korean forget to shoot it

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.710 
exactly as the Korean forget to shoot it
then<00:05:18.190> but<00:05:19.190> it's<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.970> closest<00:05:20.390> thing<00:05:20.539> he<00:05:20.600> just

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
then but it's the closest thing he just

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.830 
then but it's the closest thing he just
went<00:05:21.050> for<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.289> little<00:05:21.470> more<00:05:21.680> macro<00:05:21.919> heavy<00:05:22.840> pre

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
went for a little more macro heavy pre

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.590 
went for a little more macro heavy pre
important<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.500> he<00:05:24.800> beat<00:05:24.979> me<00:05:25.010> anyways<00:05:27.160> so<00:05:28.600> it's

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
important and he beat me anyways so it's

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.630 
important and he beat me anyways so it's
an<00:05:29.780> extremely<00:05:30.289> potent<00:05:30.890> an<00:05:31.039> extremely

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
an extremely potent an extremely

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.610 
an extremely potent an extremely
powerful<00:05:31.820> build<00:05:32.300> that<00:05:32.510> is<00:05:32.690> designed<00:05:32.930> to<00:05:33.380> end

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
powerful build that is designed to end

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.750 
powerful build that is designed to end
the<00:05:33.860> game<00:05:33.890> very<00:05:34.880> early

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.420 

and<00:05:37.940> unless<00:05:38.630> you<00:05:38.810> Scout<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.230> out<00:05:39.350> which<00:05:39.830> I<00:05:40.130> did

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
and unless you Scout it out which I did

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.940 
and unless you Scout it out which I did
it's<00:05:40.670> not<00:05:40.880> a<00:05:40.910> hard<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.750> scout<00:05:41.990> out<00:05:42.140> at<00:05:42.320> all<00:05:42.650> and

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
it's not a hard to scout out at all and

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.230 
it's not a hard to scout out at all and
I<00:05:43.730> fly<00:05:44.000> out<00:05:44.120> of<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.300> game<00:05:45.700> you<00:05:46.700> should<00:05:46.760> be<00:05:47.120> able

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
I fly out of the game you should be able

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.430 
I fly out of the game you should be able
to<00:05:47.620> thwart<00:05:48.620> it<00:05:49.420> just<00:05:52.600> just<00:05:53.600> don't<00:05:53.990> fall<00:05:54.230> for

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
to thwart it just just don't fall for

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.340 
to thwart it just just don't fall for
the<00:05:54.500> same<00:05:54.530> trap<00:05:54.980> I<00:05:55.190> did<00:05:55.400> I<00:05:55.610> saw<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:56.540> gate<00:05:56.840> gaps

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
the same trap I did I saw the gate gaps

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.040 
the same trap I did I saw the gate gaps
I<00:05:57.590> saw<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.860> cyber<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.580> just<00:05:59.030> suspected<00:05:59.900> that

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
I saw the cyber I just suspected that

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.960 
I saw the cyber I just suspected that
something<00:06:00.410> wasn't<00:06:00.860> right<00:06:01.250> there<00:06:01.610> there<00:06:01.880> were

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
something wasn't right there there were

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.860 
something wasn't right there there were
just<00:06:02.150> too<00:06:02.450> early<00:06:02.480> they<00:06:03.140> were<00:06:03.200> just<00:06:03.530> too<00:06:03.830> early

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
just too early they were just too early

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.260 
just too early they were just too early
so<00:06:05.870> if<00:06:06.110> you<00:06:06.260> face<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.530> Korean<00:06:07.130> working<00:06:08.030> end

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
so if you face the Korean working end

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.200 
so if you face the Korean working end
lettering<00:06:09.640> hopefully<00:06:10.640> you<00:06:10.730> know<00:06:10.850> you'll<00:06:11.060> know

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
lettering hopefully you know you'll know

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.870 
lettering hopefully you know you'll know
what<00:06:11.390> to<00:06:11.420> do<00:06:11.660> and<00:06:11.840> i'll<00:06:12.290> probably<00:06:12.770> upload<00:06:13.160> how

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
what to do and i'll probably upload how

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.730 
what to do and i'll probably upload how
to<00:06:13.940> counter<00:06:14.450> that<00:06:14.600> for<00:06:14.780> aquarium<00:06:15.350> for<00:06:15.500> gates

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
to counter that for aquarium for gates

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.370 
to counter that for aquarium for gates
soon
