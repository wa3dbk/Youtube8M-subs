00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.171
 This is the president. 

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:21.923
 Mr. President, 

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:23.799
 we have a problem. 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.450
 Trained killer. 

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:32.574
 The CIA, the FBI, the DEA, decide on wars. 

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:34.720
 Left behind. 

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.407
 I know what they did to your family. 

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:38.756
 Now coming back ... 

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:39.512
 Machete. 

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:41.802
 ... and the most dangerous mission awaits him! 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.133
 FROM ROBERT RODRIGUEZE 

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:46.022
 We need you Machete. 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.601
 FILM DIRECTOR SIN CITY 

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:49.719
 Beyond the South is a revolutionary 

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.880
 who has a missile aimed at Washington. 

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:55.669
 Noah had an ark and I have mine. 

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.974
 Machete, kick their asses. 

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:01.472
 I'll be your helper. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.739
 Ready? This is for phone calls, messages and tweets. 

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:06.640
 Machete doesn't tweet. 

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.444
 The enemy may have a rocket, 

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.433
 but we ... 

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:13.972
 we have Machete! 

00:01:17.762 --> 00:01:19.643
 Machete kills, he just does. 

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:20.675
 October 10th 

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.301
 You won't break my army of super soldiers. 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.845
 Bring me DD size. 

00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:28.552
 He curled his lips, lover. 

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:35.237
 You saw my face. 

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.161
 Very good. 

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:40.989
 I feel a fish taco. 

00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:44.521
 Machete! 

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:48.724
 Come! 

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:50.561
 You won't break me, 

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:54.423
 because I know your every move. 

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:56.307
 Nobody knows Machete. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.140
 Machete kills. 

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:05.619
 Machete! 

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:08.079
 Damn, you're good! 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:09.214
