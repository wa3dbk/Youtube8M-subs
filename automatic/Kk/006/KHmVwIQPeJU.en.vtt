00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good friends here is another video over 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.020
 curiosities of pokemon and where it starts 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.960
 the video and xddddd of curiosities of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.730
 pokemon 21 in pokemon soufflé for 3ds 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 there is a reference to the first 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.949
 generation since there are 150 levels and in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 the first generation had 151 the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.640
 difference is 1 but for some reason 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.230
 they put only 150 levels xdddd 2 the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.130
 actor who makes the voice of melut in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.470
 Latin America 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.349
 gerardo vazquez is the same one who does the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.390
 voice of the narrator of the series 3 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.219
 skeeter hates the color red but at 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 evolve to this did its color changes 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.620
 to red 4 the only elementary type of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 pokemon that does not have a gym in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 all generations to date is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.780
 the sinister type but maybe in the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.000
 seventh generation this change xddddd 5 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.789
 thanks to movements like metronome 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 transformation movement copulation mirror 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.289
 scheme and mimetic among others there is the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 possibility that the vast majority of 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.030
 the pokemon can use not learning almost 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.280
 all movements since with a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.930
 tutor or by breeding the vast majority 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.090
 can learn mimetic 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.040
 it was shown in fire red pokemon and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.610
 green leaf with cooking when you 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 you give the doll 6 the scream from the ics is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 shorter in the second generation and the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.320
 of it still emits a strange beep 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.120
 7 degree principle always maintains its 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.040
 mouth open while the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.200
 video game pokemon snap when using the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.420
 attack gone bomb in the penultimate world 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.250
 close your mouth and then launch the attack 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.930
 in which it is never closed also 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.300
 you can see that he closes his mouth in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.660
 spirits of hg ss bar and some 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.910
 chapters of the anime 8 when there is put 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.350
 evolves has another porsche queue that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.220
 it is added via the name of its evolution 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.229
 domain 9 most of the pokemon 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.479
 they increase in size as they evolve but 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.729
 polygon reduces its size the same 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.680
 way that technological evolution and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.440
 same way of josh homme is smaller 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 that his previous clone pre-evaluation 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.660
 10 in pokémon or bars maximum crests is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 the current champion of the pokemon league of 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.920
 today's region just like in pokemon 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.900
 ruby and sapphire pokemon even though in 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.140
 Emerald pokemon was replaced by 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.480
 club yo 11 focus part 2 is ning 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.980
 It stands out for its speed and ability to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.050
 take big jumps and float 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.750
 momentarily in the air moving his 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.450
 Your jumps will allow you to advance through 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.120
 areas with large slopes know the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.280
 movements 9 leaves and leaf cyclone 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.350
 his sprint attack is that he attacks 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.810
 with the stroke whip strain three times 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.900
 followed being the last blow a leaf 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.760
 acute and as not the most powerful she will do 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.760
 his baby leaves by pressing 1 and then 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.430
 releasing the button by shaking the knob to 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.320
 cyclone leaves sni and will continue to do 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 cyclone leaves until you stop shaking 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.840
 the command 12 in the same game osa watch 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.450
 it's ni 20 pit they seem to be based on 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.550
 the ace pokemon since the awards of the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.750
 game is very proud and has a great 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.640
 resistance 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.190
 he is neither well shadowed and is smart and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.130
 he tepic is very brave and does not give up 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.440
 13 in the video games of the first 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.540
 generation the sabrina gym leader 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.790
 it was more difficult because the only pokemon 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 strong that could be used were ghost 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.720
 -14 bar subtraction and arts between 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.650
 others learn movements only every 10 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.570
 15 levels in pokémon heartgold and soul 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.220
 silver red uses the spirit of pokemon 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.940
 fire network instead of the first 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.640
 remastered xdddd well it's turn of the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 theories have a good time waiting for x 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.730
 of should well stop saying nonsense 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.360
 and let's start now theory number 1 the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.760
 pokemon world is the earth until the 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.680
 fifth generation of pokemon there are games 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.530
 in which the description of arca ning 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.600
 is puzzling and almost anecdotal in 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.240
 the yellow edition says it's a pokemon 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.970
 legendary in china there they adore the 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.710
 grace and beauty that exists when running in 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.810
 silver what is said about him is this 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.570
 legendary Chinese pokemon is considered 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.150
 great many people love their 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.930
 great mane then came in turn of red 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.909
 fire the Chinese legends speak of this 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.579
 it is said that he is able to run to 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:15.439
 unimaginable speeds the last 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.329
 game in which this topic is appreciated 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.250
 it's the tree where he turns to 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.039
 use the description of the edition 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.710
 silver wants this to say that china exists 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.410
 in the pokemon world the answer is no 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.199
 it is possible that in the future a 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.110
 region set in china but nothing else 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.060
 beyond that , however, it is possible that 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.580
 In the beginning you would have had a 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.210
 different idea something similar to what 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.490
 occurs with the canine mt emerges the toad 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.550
 given the American ray when the pokemon 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.860
 theoretically there is no America in the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.169
 television series there are two occasions in 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.840
 which are real times both in the 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.820
 first season one of them occurs in 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.039
 the episode from which a ship sinks to 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.960
 titanic style taken is in is done 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.300
 in Spain and Santa Anna in Latin America 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.349
 when you look through the window and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.750
 that are under water 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.400
 the other situation is in the aquarium of 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.180
 celestial city also called city 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.610
 sure not just surround you 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.070
 in the next visit from Asia said 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.080
 aquarium these fish are no longer seen 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.449
 that instead they see septic pokemon 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.310
 water this can show that in a 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.259
 principle was intended that the world 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.650
 pokemon looked more like the real world 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:30.169
 I asked him comes from the opsis moon came 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.870
 from real space fourth life more 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.729
 beyond the ozone layer well and good 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.380
 they look like aliens 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.750
 but it was possible that not only them 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.729
 came from above in the third 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.740
 generation was allowed to glimpse an origin 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.229
 common extraterrestrial for pocket or 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.270
 the pokemon world could have been the 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:49.729
 land with all its animals and plants 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.740
 but a radiation coming from a 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.020
 meteorite had to alter its structure and 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.990
 made them what they are however 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.849
 this idea was discarded maybe because 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.250
 the existence of fossil pokémons 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.039
 contradicted this origin or maybe because 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.110
 be very controversial finally it 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:08.180
 decided to completely isolate the world 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.430
 pokemon of the earth and the myth was created 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.979
 of creation starring art 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.270
 to end once and for all with this controversy 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.150
 relationship 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.010
 theory number 2 the pokemon are pure 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.900
 energy some time ago it is 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.580
 debating on the internet how is it that a 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.950
 Pokemon can fit in a small 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.990
 pokemon one of the answers or 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.940
 presumed hypotheses to this question is 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.830
 that the pokemon are creatures of 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.470
 pure energy that can control the 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.270
 physics may sound strange but 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.690
 follow me a little in the approach to 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.820
 try to close all the points maybe 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.920
 have you ever seen that the bags 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.780
 they are covered inside a series 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.090
 of mirrors and that the pokemons once 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.580
 captured are stored as a ray of 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.199
 red light that enters them 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.879
 the theory says that these are left 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.919
 contained inside traveling to the 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.740
 speed of light within them 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:59.569
 being creatures of pure energy this 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.120
 would also explain how they can 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:05.270
 create matter like fire rays 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.680
 water and other elements on the other hand 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.139
 would also explain why other 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.150
 creatures like animals not pokemon and 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.500
 humans can not be stored in 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.419
 ship balls 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.340
 finally this would also explain the 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.560
 evolution of them which 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.479
 store experience in the form of 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.520
 energy and after a certain amount 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.639
 can release her to change her body 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.500
 definitively well I hope you 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:31.180
 I liked it, like the video and 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.180
 share it, goodbye goodbye
