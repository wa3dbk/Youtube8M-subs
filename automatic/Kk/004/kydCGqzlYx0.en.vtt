right out I just have a feeling I hope

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.050 
right out I just have a feeling I hope
that's<00:05:13.860> copper<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> need<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.580> cut<00:05:14.790> him<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:14.970> one

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
that's copper I need to cut him in one

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.090 
that's copper I need to cut him in one
of<00:05:15.090> those<00:05:15.210> pieces<00:05:15.449> because<00:05:16.350> sometimes<00:05:16.949> they

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
of those pieces because sometimes they

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.129 
of those pieces because sometimes they
use<00:05:17.300> aluminum<00:05:18.300> plated<00:05:18.570> copper<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.960> feels

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
use aluminum plated copper that feels

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.820 
use aluminum plated copper that feels
really<00:05:19.410> light<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:20.460> here<00:05:20.699> shiny<00:05:21.479> copper<00:05:21.830> and

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
really light this here shiny copper and

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.710 
really light this here shiny copper and
just<00:05:23.580> how<00:05:23.789> it's<00:05:23.940> just<00:05:24.030> together<00:05:24.300> notice<00:05:24.630> how

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
just how it's just together notice how

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.180 
just how it's just together notice how
it's<00:05:24.870> all<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.380> way<00:05:25.470> through<00:05:25.740> there<00:05:25.919> that

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
it's all the way through there that

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.850 
it's all the way through there that
epattern<00:05:26.810> goes<00:05:27.810> all<00:05:28.139> the<00:05:28.169> way<00:05:28.500> through<00:05:28.830> the

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
epattern goes all the way through the

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.250 
epattern goes all the way through the
copper<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.550> then<00:05:30.419> through<00:05:30.539> this<00:05:30.660> side<00:05:30.900> if<00:05:31.169> I

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
copper and then through this side if I

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.560 
copper and then through this side if I
had<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.500> cut<00:05:31.710> through<00:05:31.889> that<00:05:31.979> oh<00:05:32.340> man<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.419> could

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
had to cut through that oh man you could

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.260 
had to cut through that oh man you could
spend<00:05:33.780> hours<00:05:34.280> doing<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.550> stuff<00:05:35.789> but<00:05:36.000> some

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
that i got out of the microwave we get

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.969 
that i got out of the microwave we get
the<00:05:53.479> outer<00:05:54.479> casing<00:05:55.020> which<00:05:55.139> just<00:05:55.349> mixed<00:05:55.650> metals

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
the outer casing which just mixed metals

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.790 
the outer casing which just mixed metals
so<00:05:56.610> stuff<00:05:56.789> like<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:58.440> can<00:05:58.560> see<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.710> the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
so stuff like that you can see on the

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.110 
so stuff like that you can see on the
top<00:05:58.950> there's<00:05:59.250> a<00:05:59.370> little<00:05:59.520> bit<00:05:59.639> of<00:05:59.700> metal<00:05:59.910> that

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
top there's a little bit of metal that

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.570 
top there's a little bit of metal that
would<00:06:00.240> came<00:06:00.360> out<00:06:00.539> the<00:06:01.500> whole<00:06:01.710> outside<00:06:02.099> of<00:06:02.520> the

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
would came out the whole outside of the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.520 
would came out the whole outside of the
thing<00:06:02.870> this<00:06:03.870> want<00:06:04.139> to<00:06:04.200> show<00:06:04.349> you<00:06:04.410> guys<00:06:04.500> a

thing this want to show you guys a
little<00:06:07.530> bit<00:06:07.889> of<00:06:08.070> copper<00:06:08.220> in<00:06:08.370> there<00:06:08.639> it's

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
little bit of copper in there it's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.210 
little bit of copper in there it's
pretty<00:06:09.539> cool<00:06:09.720> actually<00:06:10.070> inside<00:06:11.070> of<00:06:11.160> that

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
pretty cool actually inside of that

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.700 
pretty cool actually inside of that
little<00:06:11.430> tape<00:06:12.110> hey<00:06:13.400> we're<00:06:14.400> here<00:06:14.639> is<00:06:15.349> that<00:06:16.349> metal

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
little tape hey we're here is that metal

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.870 
little tape hey we're here is that metal
that<00:06:16.800> a<00:06:16.950> pattern<00:06:17.250> that<00:06:17.280> I<00:06:17.400> was<00:06:17.520> telling<00:06:17.669> you

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
that a pattern that I was telling you

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.689 
that a pattern that I was telling you
about<00:06:17.910> that<00:06:18.060> comes<00:06:18.419> inside<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:19.620> i<00:06:19.650> took<00:06:20.310> my<00:06:20.460> saw

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
about that comes inside so i took my saw

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.960 
about that comes inside so i took my saw
and<00:06:21.199> got<00:06:22.199> it<00:06:22.289> out<00:06:22.349> of<00:06:22.410> there<00:06:22.789> get<00:06:23.789> this<00:06:23.910> piece

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
and got it out of there get this piece

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.270 
and got it out of there get this piece
of<00:06:24.240> copper<00:06:24.510> out<00:06:24.630> of<00:06:24.750> there<00:06:25.099> pretty<00:06:26.099> good

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
of copper out of there pretty good

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.290 
of copper out of there pretty good
little<00:06:26.460> piece<00:06:26.669> i<00:06:26.849> don't<00:06:27.000> know<00:06:27.060> how<00:06:27.120> much<00:06:27.180> a

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
little piece i don't know how much a

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.400 
little piece i don't know how much a
ways<00:06:27.449> will<00:06:27.599> put<00:06:27.720> on<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:27.840> scale<00:06:28.050> later<00:06:28.260> and

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
ways will put on the scale later and

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.469 
ways will put on the scale later and
find<00:06:28.500> out<00:06:28.880> that's<00:06:29.880> the<00:06:29.970> e<00:06:30.000> pattern<00:06:30.389> it

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
find out that's the e pattern it

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.080 
find out that's the e pattern it
actually<00:06:30.510> goes<00:06:30.870> inside<00:06:31.349> of<00:06:31.500> there<00:06:31.590> completely

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
actually goes inside of there completely

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.790 
actually goes inside of there completely
this<00:06:33.090> stuff<00:06:33.240> here<00:06:33.479> I'm<00:06:33.870> actually<00:06:34.080> afraid<00:06:34.289> of<00:06:34.620> I

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
this stuff here I'm actually afraid of I

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.200 
this stuff here I'm actually afraid of I
don't<00:06:34.860> think<00:06:35.160> that's<00:06:35.340> copper<00:06:35.820> it<00:06:35.910> looks<00:06:36.060> like

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
don't think that's copper it looks like

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:37.730 
don't think that's copper it looks like
kind<00:06:36.449> of<00:06:36.510> adult<00:06:36.870> copper<00:06:37.229> on<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.410> outside

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
kind of adult copper on the outside

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.010 
kind of adult copper on the outside
whenever<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.699> cut<00:06:38.910> into<00:06:39.180> it<00:06:39.330> it<00:06:39.419> was<00:06:39.599> shiny

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
whenever I cut into it it was shiny

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.900 
whenever I cut into it it was shiny
silver<00:06:40.620> so<00:06:40.830> makes<00:06:41.010> me<00:06:41.130> think<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.400> its<00:06:41.580> cycle

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
silver so makes me think that its cycle

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:43.760 
silver so makes me think that its cycle
Luminum<00:06:42.270> maybe<00:06:42.900> some<00:06:43.110> copper<00:06:43.410> coating<00:06:43.680> or

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
Luminum maybe some copper coating or

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.469 
Luminum maybe some copper coating or
something<00:06:44.039> like<00:06:44.099> that<00:06:44.160> did<00:06:45.090> get<00:06:45.210> that<00:06:45.330> good

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
something like that did get that good

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:46.969 
something like that did get that good
ball<00:06:45.660> a<00:06:45.690> copper<00:06:46.110> out<00:06:46.229> of<00:06:46.320> there<00:06:46.440> we<00:06:46.620> go<00:06:46.710> shiny

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
ball a copper out of there we go shiny

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.089 
ball a copper out of there we go shiny
that<00:06:47.130> is<00:06:47.190> nice<00:06:47.610> shiny<00:06:48.650> this<00:06:49.650> stuff<00:06:49.830> here<00:06:49.979> is<00:06:50.070> a

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
that is nice shiny this stuff here is a

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.430 
that is nice shiny this stuff here is a
little<00:06:50.280> bit<00:06:50.370> of<00:06:50.460> aluminum<00:06:50.910> that<00:06:51.389> cased<00:06:51.930> this

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
little bit of aluminum that cased this

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.750 
little bit of aluminum that cased this
round<00:06:52.919> thing<00:06:53.070> that<00:06:53.580> looks<00:06:53.789> like<00:06:53.849> copper<00:06:54.330> to<00:06:54.449> me

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
round thing that looks like copper to me

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.250 
round thing that looks like copper to me
but<00:06:56.760> whenever<00:06:57.120> I<00:06:57.300> got<00:06:57.599> into<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:57.900> you<00:06:57.990> can<00:06:58.110> see
