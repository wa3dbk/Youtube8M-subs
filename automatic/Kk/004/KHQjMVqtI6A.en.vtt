for being a panda so it's probably a
good<00:01:46.200> idea<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:47.010> or<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> stranger<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:47.909> you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
good idea to go get or a stranger if you

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.660 
good idea to go get or a stranger if you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
can do that once this comes out um

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
can do that once this comes out um
that's<00:01:51.390> about<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.140> cool<00:01:52.320> stuff<00:01:52.470> that's
