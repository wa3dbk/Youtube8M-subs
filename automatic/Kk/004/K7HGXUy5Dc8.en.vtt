00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
turns in quick and you can possibly

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.250 
turns in quick and you can possibly
think<00:01:51.640> about<00:01:52.090> it<00:01:52.210> actually<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.900> found<00:01:53.140> the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
think about it actually I found the

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.020 
think about it actually I found the
riding<00:01:53.620> position<00:01:53.740> somehow<00:01:54.520> even<00:01:54.790> more

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
cramped than the others it is slightly

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.050 
cramped than the others it is slightly
different<00:01:57.190> but<00:01:57.250> when<00:01:57.400> you're<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.640> squashed

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
different but when you're this squashed

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060 
different but when you're this squashed
up<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.450> slightest<00:01:58.930> change<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.290> angle<00:01:59.650> does

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
up the slightest change in angle does

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.560 
up the slightest change in angle does
make<00:02:00.250> a<00:02:00.280> big<00:02:00.550> difference<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.909> your<00:02:01.090> comfort

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
make a big difference to your comfort

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.240 
make a big difference to your comfort
once<00:02:02.110> you've<00:02:02.200> settled<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.590> though<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.979> is

once you've settled in though it is

once you've settled in though it is
again<00:02:03.670> superb<00:02:04.300> all<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.630> power<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:05.020> right<00:02:05.350> up

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
again superb all the power is right up

it<00:02:06.700> sounds<00:02:07.330> glorious<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.019> goes<00:02:08.440> like<00:02:08.649> fury

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
it sounds glorious and it goes like fury

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.420 
it sounds glorious and it goes like fury
perhaps<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> midrange<00:02:11.800> can<00:02:12.070> do<00:02:12.160> with<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.310> bit

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
perhaps the midrange can do with a bit

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.950 
perhaps the midrange can do with a bit
of<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.580> boost<00:02:12.790> but<00:02:13.030> then<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.660> as<00:02:13.810> we've

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
of a boost but then this is as we've

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.270 
of a boost but then this is as we've
said<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> most<00:02:14.440> flexible<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> four

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
whole idea of them and I think apart

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.570 
whole idea of them and I think apart
from<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> performance<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.190> partly<00:02:33.490> because
