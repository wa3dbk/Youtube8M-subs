00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.950
 this company is soft club 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.000
 so today I have prepared a review for you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.179
 programs 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 VibER here it is adapted to the top five 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.520
 hence it with two words that sit on 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.970
 This application This application allows 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.630
 is that you say this is a wolf client here 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.859
 practically has the same functionality 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 as skype but he has a few more 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.690
 many they have what advantages 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.540
 starting this application is not so much 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.059
 well that's how good really is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.520
 skype and at the time of first login and satisfying 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 you need to confirm but firstly 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 push notifications further push 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.780
 continue 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.030
 access to the address book naturally 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.030
 allow and enter your phone number 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.380
 so I'm 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.180
 there will be airplane modes here because i'm his 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
 usually set to not interfere 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.080
 when called and you press continue 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:14.740
 yes here you also confirm and wait 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:15.979
 until the message comes with the code code 2162 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.880
 2162 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.920
 push the input naturally to allow 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.110
 access to contacts is like 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.290
 understandably and here you are writing 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.590
 your name will be displayed in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.330
 all I'll give an example add isy not here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.280
 pressing ready after that goes 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.380
 synchronization with and contacts 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.630
 then where else can you view 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 the message that came to the code here you 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 so saw here 2362 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.789
 here I just saw it right away and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.000
 straight from looking in the app started in 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:52.160
 In principle, in principle, the interface of the vibe 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.369
 similar with standard interface normal 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.099
 date with calls from ios to 7 9 here 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.069
 for example call melts so i think 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.360
 that you are here a stain as if you are not confused 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.520
 if you want to keep some number 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.800
 phone output via the keyboard if 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.270
 you want to see your contacts yes 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.770
 then you naturally look at your own 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
 contacts if you want to see 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 latest last post message 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.730
 Additionally this is more detailed 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.380
 information naturally you have to draw from 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.410
 attention of 220 contacts that me 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.090

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.120
 write it and see then look 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.180
 Add to favorites 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.910

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.310

 either wi-fi ie he is capable 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.660
 work completely in the background 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.310
 so she means I mean if you 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.110
 let 's get out of it yes that is but 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 who knows I already told like that 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.410
 multitasking meaning you don't go out 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360
 before you just fold it 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.150
 here it is here if it hangs in 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.970
 Tray it still works, in what 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 the beauty of this application is not 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.900
 There is a load on the battery, that is, you 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.550
 can it can hang and you can not 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.230
 close it will constantly work 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.460
 while the batteries will not be discharged 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.840
 also this program works blue 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.160
 devices allows you to make calls through 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.880
 bluetooth also makes say through 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.770
 bluetooth 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.860
 meaning the type of walkie-talkie yes that is 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.080
 when it was such a connection is also possible 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.020
 brag in principle call speed 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.090
 caller and excellent sound quality 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.640
 will start at each time near the contacts if 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.730
 you see so contacts are all like that 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.410

 wear these people do not use vader 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.080
 also those people who use 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.590

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.750
 photograph before that is the logo and you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.250

 which allows you to install a vibe 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.060
 there is a vibera on this operating system 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.970
 there is then you can call mean if 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.500

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.990
 includes in principle from skype yes that is 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.690

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.430
 with someone naturally you need to add 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.840
 they are there to contact when to get 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.370
 confirmation that is a little different then 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.180
 have it take some gap 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.730
 of time 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.320
 that's when you get to 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.140
 the person already confirms no longer why 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.270
 call also what minus skype is then 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.790
 that if a person goes online then you tell him 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.190

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.500
 hears and does not see the work of the same skype 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.880
 this phone here goes binding to 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.720
 your phone number 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.820
 natural goes on verification sits 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.960
 confirmation via SMS that is 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.130
 if your number is unavailable 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.560
 natural not activate it 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.050
 can not here you can call someone 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.300
 if you know his phone number 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.180
 and he has installed 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.129
 that is, here the system happens a bit 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.830
 differently here calling you 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.810
 the user is sent 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.389
 push notifications through the apple server she 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.919
 appears on your screen you click

 sit down to confirm ok 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.470
 but the notifications at that moment are launched 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.430
 the application after which you both grit 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.319
 quickly start to communicate that is 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.270
 the call really happens very quickly 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.129
 in seconds you absolutely 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.650
 no matter what kind of person the operator is all 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.060
 occurs via the Internet binding to 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.460
 number but 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.719
 call via the Internet is all lovely 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.030
 is that you can 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.669
 make calls forward text 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.069
 text messages of this and multimedia yes 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.780

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:07.190
 floor that is, if you have internet there 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.289
 worth 5 hryvnia megabytes you will have 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.330

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.169
 Tariff if you are in the Wi-Fi zone at all 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.090
 free call 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.039

 telling but what we already somehow 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.110
 I had these lessons I think that questions 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.370
 you will not have 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.110

 Duck I already said sends also 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.479
 the message basically means everything 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.520

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.650

 the computers themselves are why I think that 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.990

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.970

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.130

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.140
 of course subscribe to our channel 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.150
