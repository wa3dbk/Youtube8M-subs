asked me on planet minecraft what I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.880 
asked me on planet minecraft what I
could<00:02:39.480> work<00:02:39.690> out<00:02:39.840> how<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.080> make<00:02:40.230> rice<00:02:40.470> paddies

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
could work out how to make rice paddies

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.510 
could work out how to make rice paddies
in<00:02:41.070> world<00:02:41.520> painter<00:02:41.910> itself<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:43.130> i<00:02:44.130> will

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
in world painter itself and i will

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.210 
in world painter itself and i will
picture<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.910> he<00:02:45.630> himself<00:02:46.350> is<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> whelping<00:02:47.010> it

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
picture this he himself is a whelping it

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
picture this he himself is a whelping it
was<00:02:47.370> quite<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> bit<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.910> world<00:02:48.180> painting<00:02:48.630> i<00:02:48.810> will

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
was quite a bit of world painting i will

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720 
was quite a bit of world painting i will
put<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.380> link<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.650> description<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.130> his<00:02:50.310> profile

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
put a link in description to his profile

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.340 
put a link in description to his profile
so<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.090> check<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.390> out<00:02:51.480> those<00:02:52.050> are<00:02:52.200> quite

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so you can check it out those are quite

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.350 
so you can check it out those are quite
a<00:02:52.380> few<00:02:52.440> maps<00:02:52.830> with<00:02:53.040> downloads<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:54.150> you're

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
a few maps with downloads so if you're

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.110 
a few maps with downloads so if you're
looking<00:02:54.630> for<00:02:54.660> world<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.830> guy<00:02:56.700> asked<00:02:57.060> me

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
looking for world but guy asked me

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.310 
looking for world but guy asked me
whether<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.480> could<00:02:57.540> work<00:02:57.840> out<00:02:57.989> how<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.140> make

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
whether I could work out how to make

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.470 
whether I could work out how to make
rice<00:02:58.560> paddies<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.160> world<00:02:59.430> painter<00:02:59.850> itself<00:03:00.239> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
rice paddies in world painter itself and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.720 
rice paddies in world painter itself and
she<00:03:01.380> would<00:03:01.530> assume<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> slope<00:03:02.459> field

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
she would assume that the slope field

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
she would assume that the slope field
the<00:03:02.790> detection<00:03:03.180> worked<00:03:03.660> perfectly<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.590> it

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
the detection worked perfectly and it

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.550 
the detection worked perfectly and it
would<00:03:05.130> be<00:03:05.160> easy<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.940> detect<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.350> height

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
would be easy to detect a one height

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.740 
would be easy to detect a one height
height<00:03:07.800> increment<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> map<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.180> sort<00:03:09.690> of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
height increment on a map and sort of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.360 
height increment on a map and sort of
replace<00:03:10.110> that<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.470> another<00:03:10.590> material<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.220> get

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
replace that for another material to get

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.850 
replace that for another material to get
sort<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> damn<00:03:12.200> surrounding<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.350> fields

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
sort of the damn surrounding the fields

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.710 
sort of the damn surrounding the fields
where<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.580> rice<00:03:14.790> would<00:03:15.000> be<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.360> rising

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
where the rice would be in the rising

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.570 
where the rice would be in the rising
water<00:03:15.989> sort<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.500> them<00:03:16.860> think<00:03:18.500> unfortunately

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
water sort of them think unfortunately

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.720 
water sort of them think unfortunately
world<00:03:20.580> painter<00:03:21.380> doesn't<00:03:22.380> detect<00:03:22.769> one<00:03:23.430> height

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
world painter doesn't detect one height

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.770 
world painter doesn't detect one height
height<00:03:24.030> increments<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:25.790> accurately<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
height increments that accurately the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.070 
height increments that accurately the
trick<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.769> case<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.760> use<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.660> height

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
trick is in this case to use a height

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.440 
trick is in this case to use a height
increment<00:03:31.560> which<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.890> higher<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.300> least

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
increment which is higher so at least

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.530 
increment which is higher so at least
two<00:03:33.810> blocks<00:03:34.110> or<00:03:34.380> more<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.880> way<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.360> slope

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
two blocks or more that way the slope

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.750 
two blocks or more that way the slope
filter<00:03:36.989> kennen<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.650> detect<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.400> edges

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
filter kennen can detect the edges

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.240 
filter kennen can detect the edges
perfectly<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.320> can<00:03:40.530> replace<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.010> edges

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
perfectly and you can replace the edges

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.190 
perfectly and you can replace the edges
for<00:03:41.400> another<00:03:41.700> material<00:03:41.910> replace<00:03:42.870> all<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
for another material replace all the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.840 
for another material replace all the
grass<00:03:43.410> or<00:03:43.590> whatever<00:03:43.860> material<00:03:44.370> for<00:03:44.550> farmland

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
grass or whatever material for farmland

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.420 
grass or whatever material for farmland
and<00:03:45.090> then<00:03:45.300> replace<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> edges<00:03:46.830> again<00:03:46.980> for

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
and then replace the edges again for

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.100 
and then replace the edges again for
another<00:03:47.580> material<00:03:47.850> using<00:03:48.420> all<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> filter

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
another material using all the filter

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.210 
another material using all the filter
settings

shouldn't<00:03:50.550> be<00:03:50.640> too<00:03:50.960> much<00:03:51.960> of<00:03:52.020> a<00:03:52.260> problem<00:03:53.540> so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
shouldn't be too much of a problem so

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.210 
shouldn't be too much of a problem so
yeah<00:03:54.660> you<00:03:54.780> need<00:03:54.990> at<00:03:55.170> least<00:03:55.200> a<00:03:55.470> 2<00:03:55.710> height<00:03:55.980> height

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
yeah you need at least a 2 height height

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.050 
yeah you need at least a 2 height height
increment<00:03:56.700> at<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> edge<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:59.130> use<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> very<00:03:59.760> hard

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
increment at the edge so use a very hard

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.790 
increment at the edge so use a very hard
brush<00:04:00.330> which<00:04:00.540> absolutely<00:04:01.170> no<00:04:01.440> failing

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
brush which absolutely no failing

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.880 
brush which absolutely no failing
towards<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.370> edge<00:04:02.600> paint<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.930> some<00:04:04.260> layers

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
towards the edge paint in some layers

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.770

some<00:04:05.280> rice<00:04:05.490> layers<00:04:05.790> where<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.150> want<00:04:06.360> to<00:04:06.540> feel

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
some rice layers where you want to feel

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.640 
some rice layers where you want to feel
stack<00:04:07.380> up<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:08.210> yeah<00:04:09.210> use<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.480> slope<00:04:10.170> filters

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
stack up and yeah use the slope filters

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.270 
stack up and yeah use the slope filters
to<00:04:10.830> detect<00:04:11.310> any<00:04:11.600> slopes<00:04:12.600> above<00:04:12.870> 60<00:04:13.530> degrees<00:04:13.890> it

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
to detect any slopes above 60 degrees it

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.569 
to detect any slopes above 60 degrees it
should<00:04:14.520> be<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.640> good<00:04:14.910> number<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:16.230> way<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:17.430> can

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
should be a good number that way you can

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180 
should be a good number that way you can
replace<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.090> for<00:04:18.209> another<00:04:18.390> material<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:19.190> that

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
replace it for another material and that

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.480 
replace it for another material and that
way<00:04:20.810> it<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.350> can<00:04:22.500> turn<00:04:22.890> it<00:04:23.070> back<00:04:23.220> again

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
way it will you can turn it back again

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.310 
way it will you can turn it back again
later<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.970> put<00:04:24.390> some<00:04:24.600> weight<00:04:24.780> on<00:04:24.810> top<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.230> it

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
later and put some weight on top of it

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.130 
later and put some weight on top of it
and<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:26.040> all<00:04:26.220> looks<00:04:26.430> great<00:04:26.700> and<00:04:26.940> rice<00:04:27.630> field<00:04:27.990> e

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
and it all looks great and rice field e

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.260 
and it all looks great and rice field e
so<00:04:29.040> yeah<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:29.490> sort<00:04:29.730> of<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.910> trick<00:04:30.240> for

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
so yeah that's sort of the trick for

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.030 
so yeah that's sort of the trick for
