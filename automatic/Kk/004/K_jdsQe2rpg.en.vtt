now<00:00:00.390> the<00:00:00.719> newest<00:00:01.079> juicer<00:00:01.439> on<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.620> market<00:00:01.709> is

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
now the newest juicer on the market is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.730 
now the newest juicer on the market is
the<00:00:02.370> vertical<00:00:02.760> masticating<00:00:03.510> style<00:00:03.840> by<00:00:04.380> Omega

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
the vertical masticating style by Omega

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.340 
the vertical masticating style by Omega
it<00:00:05.520> uses<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.029> same<00:00:06.270> stone<00:00:06.720> mill<00:00:07.140> light

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
it uses the same stone mill light

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.169 
it uses the same stone mill light
concept<00:00:07.890> as<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.130> other<00:00:08.280> masticating<00:00:08.910> model

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
concept as the other masticating model

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.049 
concept as the other masticating model
but<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> opening<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.290> twice<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.889> size<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:12.000> you

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
but the opening is twice the size so you

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.580 
but the opening is twice the size so you
have<00:00:12.269> less<00:00:12.480> Park<00:00:12.780> work<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.230> fruit<00:00:13.440> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
have less Park work for your fruit and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.530 
have less Park work for your fruit and
vegetables<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> it's<00:00:14.940> flipped<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.420> be

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
vegetables and it's flipped to be

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.480 
vegetables and it's flipped to be
vertical<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.590> takes<00:00:16.800> up<00:00:16.949> less<00:00:16.980> space<00:00:17.160> on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
vertical so it takes up less space on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.150 
vertical so it takes up less space on
your<00:00:17.550> counter<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.750> super<00:00:19.230> quiet<00:00:19.410> very

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
your counter it's super quiet very

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.189 
your counter it's super quiet very
efficient<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.270> juices<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.930> about
