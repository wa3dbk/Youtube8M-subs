00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.199
 then three 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:18.349
 an approximate sum on a well-known percent circuit one of these circuits 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.939
 very beautiful route 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.089
 so we attack the first corner 4th 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.349
 so here the problem happened without marking too far to 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.359
 outdoors 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.899
 it takes relatively fresh rates 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.180
 we're going to go into the second corner that will be negotiated in second gear 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.210
 so the similar in attack early enough the turn to precisely favor the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.580
 raise because we will enter the parabolica full load 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.580
 we then arrive in a wreck that will be negotiated in second gear 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.090
 you will see it will have to brake soon enough 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.270
 the spell that on the video we missed a little sheep puel you go 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.600
 realize that 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.900
 you do not have to brake too late so you have to brake 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.860
 here before you arrive in second 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.270
 and just not be too embarking as it is the case here 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.710
 by raising again for a straight 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.989
 leave to go absolutely unfounded you will see 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.989
 4th fifth speed 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.730
 do not hesitate to cut the turn 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.770
 in the meantime it's early enough 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.290
 and in recovery 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.770
 point left-right in third 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.550
 we had it a little before treated at sea either duly children 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.830
 before approaching turn 8 mobile then very dangerous this one 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.190
 that is to say we expect it would be the costs because it is important not 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.050
 make 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.660
 because if you go out left acetone reassure so we brake 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.100
 relatively early and we immediately agree to the agreement 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.560
 this 6 percent bandit left otherwise relatively early to revive the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 car 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.030
 and then that's all at the third acceleration as you'll see it 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.170
 we go up on the Hebrew state 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.020
 when we're at it 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 a france weather support office will happen here 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.970
 in relief and thank you before addressing the last 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.870
 in the pit straight
