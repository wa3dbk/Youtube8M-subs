pretty<00:04:34.190> powerful<00:04:34.490> monsters<00:04:34.970> because<00:04:35.240> there

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
pretty powerful monsters because there

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.080

was<00:04:35.660> never<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.990> Camaro<00:04:36.440> tuner<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.580> you<00:04:37.970> know

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
was never a Camaro tuner so you know

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.160 
was never a Camaro tuner so you know
it's<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.330> lot<00:04:38.480> harder<00:04:38.600> then<00:04:38.930> bring<00:04:39.080> out

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
it's a lot harder then bring out

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.260 
it's a lot harder then bring out
synchros<00:04:39.590> but<00:04:40.190> now<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.550> what<00:04:40.640> they<00:04:40.760> seized<00:04:41.030> I

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
synchros but now that what they seized I

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.030 
synchros but now that what they seized I
think<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.750> really<00:04:42.110> helps<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:42.710> give<00:04:42.800> them<00:04:42.980> a

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
think it really helps and give them a

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.570 
think it really helps and give them a
boost<00:04:43.390> number<00:04:44.390> 17<00:04:44.960> Leviathan<00:04:45.470> dragon<00:04:45.830> it<00:04:46.430> is

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
boost number 17 Leviathan dragon it is

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.130 
boost number 17 Leviathan dragon it is
possible<00:04:46.820> with<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.540> creature<00:04:47.720> swap<00:04:47.990> of

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
possible with the creature swap of

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.830 
possible with the creature swap of
course<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.250> war<00:04:49.460> wolves<00:04:49.670> so<00:04:50.540> yeah<00:04:50.720> this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
course and the war wolves so yeah this

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.390 
course and the war wolves so yeah this
reason<00:04:51.110> I<00:04:51.140> just<00:04:51.200> kind<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.530> put<00:04:51.890> one<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.220> there

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
reason I just kind of put one in there

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.240 
reason I just kind of put one in there
instead<00:04:52.760> of<00:04:52.820> using<00:04:53.030> a<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.740> think<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:55.130> know

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
instead of using a I think it you know

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.770 
instead of using a I think it you know
just<00:04:55.400> kind<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.640> cuz<00:04:55.820> i<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.090> room<00:04:56.240> to<00:04:56.480> for
