00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello and here we are going to be fine again 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:10.610
 fat away 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.610
 So you can see it lined up nicely here 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.740
 a bit wrong that's just the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.109
 buy we have here in black 3 meters 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 Jump by default 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.420
 normal with wide tires one meter 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.150
 wide and one chain-drive cool 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 thing else they are from the model ago 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.110
 show up here again 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 nice tempomat stages 12 30 clarify there 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.670
 everything is displayed in the camera and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:46.410
 continue to drum backlash too 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 ever through her the same again 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:58.030
 green or temperature speed 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.789
 we have an outdoor camera cool thing 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.469
 then take what we take there 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:09.009
 I want the name with chain drive 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.940
 I like it today and that time 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.250
 here are the different ones 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.259
 schneidwerk can be there ever good 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 I like that when 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.560
 you stop it 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.549
 you are at buying optimally so that the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.060
 just tip over 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.619
 but it's not that bad now 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 If you look at it, if that's all 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:34.420
 Nice works exactly 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:39.810
 and she loads wonderfully suddenly good 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.810
 driving people works too 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.630
 cutting unit 92 meters very good thanks 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.050
 unfold 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.569
 times we watch press ex then he works 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.450
 Beautifully animated on the pages here 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.799
 and can the contact meter 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.399
 camera view here you can see too 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:09.070
 I like our dickskull again 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:13.570
 also very good with olesja the pipe 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.600
 extend contact to midcom a chipper 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.209
 enable disable 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.709
 Of course you can also be pretty naive 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.250
 adjust and everything animates well 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:32.050
 parked 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.050
 then you can use the pad four and five 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.220
 what's called the hate pictures 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.140
 let that turn faster up there 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.310
 because I have no field goal now announced 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.910
 believe me or believe you are 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:51.920
 not scheduled near group 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.660
 is just as super day here was a 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.990
 You can drive faster in the opposite direction 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.820
 slow trainer dutt 45 is also 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.400
 still everything my description and no 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.709
 just look at it 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.989
 Here we have here again 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 grain corn harvesting by here again 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.660
 normal tailor something wider here 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.989
 another cutting work and new ones 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.940
 schneidwerk and here a hit 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.010
 combine harvester and animal 2 schneider 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.610
 So sick sees the bag consists of 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.959
 quite a few together 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.989
 here we can contact again 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.000
 open and look 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.950
 it also stays that way 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.890
 then we'll see a job 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.590
 Here we see the full 33 times the 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.459
 combine harvester looks nice again 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.519
 For example, water has many cm 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.870
 Tailor made for the chains 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.090
 then the cutting sue the two 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.970
 different well two different 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.700
 sizes are available that nine meters so 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.100
 yes, once the nine meters without the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.170
 Left handed with top with the exact nt 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.670
 but anyway 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.270
 then we have only nine meters here 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.760
 Most two-meter back two 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.470
 Stadtwerke and I do not believe it or 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.650
 three different cutting tools each 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:22.200
 two sizes expect meters and once 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.850
 just nine meters the prices also fit 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.010
 I think there is a download is that 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.960
 already worth looking at textures of mens 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.800
 also good from animated too nice 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.150
 a download is all the cases in there i 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.250
 Hope you liked the tugs 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.400
 I here again a lok that 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.280
 are unfortunately a few mistakes but the 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.740
 the uvs are now so bad auto friend 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.130
 they have no impact on 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.750
 players so that they are available 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.550
 but they only appear once 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.740
 and have not really gone out of it 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.220
 Of course , playing can still be a lot 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.770
 worse 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.130
 They let the uvs land them too 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:03.100
 so that I have a lot of work to fix 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.410
 guess you do not have the error 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.550
 is not so bad 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.229
 so have fun with it 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.320
 format i hope my video will please 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.000
 old load the leica an abo and like him 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.070
 say clearly by the motto there you have 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.810
 want or need information to courage 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.380
 easy and individual printing exactly 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.080
 down there 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.640
 everything is in there economically 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.240
 fun and see you in the next video 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.240
