doesn't<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.050> right<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
doesn't all right you're kind of right I

got 5 knife kills that nuke so I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290

probably will do another top-40 by mook

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.940 
probably will do another top-40 by mook
so<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.079> surprised<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> coming

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.560 
so don't be surprised to see that coming
don't<00:00:47.129> go<00:00:47.280> why'd<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.059> get<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.300> twice

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
don't go why'd you get that twice

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
don't go why'd you get that twice

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because I didn't but this gameplay kind

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.430 
because I didn't but this gameplay kind
of<00:00:54.120> random<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.539> wasn't<00:00:54.809> even<00:00:54.960> playing<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.320> any

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

randomly using an invention and well

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.209 
randomly using an invention and well
it's<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> an<00:01:01.440> interesting<00:01:01.469> new<00:01:01.949> kits

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219

it's kind of an interesting new kits
probably<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> most<00:01:02.820> interesting<00:01:03.300> on

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
probably one of the most interesting on

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.380 
probably one of the most interesting on
my<00:01:03.480> channel<00:01:03.809> because<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.880> don't<00:01:05.880> even<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.210> all

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.350 
18 or 19 kills three so I'm out of amla
why<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> chopper

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
why they have them out of the chopper

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.390 
why they have them out of the chopper
gunner<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> go<00:01:20.100> pick<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
gunner so I have I have to go pick up a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.200 
gunner so I have I have to go pick up a
weapon<00:01:21.229> which<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.610> video<00:01:23.939> it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
weapon which I do and this video it's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.870 
weapon which I do and this video it's
gonna<00:01:24.330> speed<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.170> lot<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.790> there's<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
gonna speed up a lot because there's a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
gonna speed up a lot because there's a
period<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.659> first<00:01:27.900> time<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
period the first time it's going to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.590 
period the first time it's going to
speed<00:01:28.590> up<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.549> ac-130<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
speed up because they have an ac-130 in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600 
speed up because they have an ac-130 in
the<00:01:30.689> air<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.740> basically<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.189> cancel<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the air and I basically just cancel the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.590 
the air and I basically just cancel the
building<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.000> don't<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> die<00:01:33.420> i'm

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
building so they don't want to die i'm

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.929 
building so they don't want to die i'm
already<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> killstreak<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
already on the killstreak so that's that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.160 
already on the killstreak so that's that
one<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> speed<00:01:37.079> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
one and then it's going to speed up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.450 
one and then it's going to speed up
