then some people make in a year you know
I<00:02:26.840> had<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.990> come<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> realization<00:02:28.800> that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
I had to come to the realization that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.590 
I had to come to the realization that
that<00:02:29.630> either<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.080> quit<00:02:31.410> or<00:02:32.240> or<00:02:33.240> make<00:02:33.480> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that either have to quit or or make it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.590 
that either have to quit or or make it
work<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.100> developed<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:36.060> simple<00:02:36.330> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
work and so I developed a simple and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.250 
work and so I developed a simple and
effective<00:02:37.490> date<00:02:38.490> training<00:02:39.740> strategy

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
utilizing the most important part of day

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.800
