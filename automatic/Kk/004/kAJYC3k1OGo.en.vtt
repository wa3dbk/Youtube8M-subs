00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
sure it took like a year to even recover

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.130 
sure it took like a year to even recover
from<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.670> damage<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.210> slow<00:02:42.630> down<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
from the damage to slow down the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
from the damage to slow down the
breakage<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.890> was<00:02:44.130> experience<00:02:44.850> because<00:02:45.270> not

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
breakage that was experience because not

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.449 
breakage that was experience because not
I<00:02:45.780> would<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.350> look<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:46.680> their<00:02:46.860> pictures<00:02:47.100> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
I would just look at their pictures and

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.850 
I would just look at their pictures and
just<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.730> like<00:02:47.760> why<00:02:48.120> isn't<00:02:48.420> my<00:02:48.660> hair<00:02:48.930> not

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
just be like why isn't my hair not

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.460 
just be like why isn't my hair not
necessarily<00:02:50.340> growing<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.360> fast<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:52.110> because

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
necessarily growing as fast but because

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.720 
necessarily growing as fast but because
I<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.620> everybody<00:02:53.130> here<00:02:53.250> goes<00:02:53.459> differently

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
I know everybody here goes differently

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.630 
I know everybody here goes differently
but<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.450> wasn't<00:02:54.690> seeing<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:56.100> results

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
but I just wasn't seeing the results

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
but I just wasn't seeing the results
that<00:02:56.700> other<00:02:57.000> people<00:02:57.390> were<00:02:57.510> seeing<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.200> at

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that other people were seeing like at

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.010 
that other people were seeing like at
all<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:59.040> I<00:02:59.130> think<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.700> first<00:03:00.570> two<00:03:00.990> years

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
all and I think in the first two years

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.730 
all and I think in the first two years
it<00:03:01.590> took<00:03:01.709> me<00:03:01.860> like<00:03:02.010> two<00:03:02.310> years<00:03:02.820> from<00:03:03.750> went<00:03:04.140> from

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
it took me like two years from went from

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.420 
it took me like two years from went from
basically<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.610> chinle<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:07.430> shoulder

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
basically like chinle to like shoulder

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.240 
basically like chinle to like shoulder
length<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.910> night<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.510> even<00:03:09.890> if<00:03:10.890> he<00:03:11.010> still

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
length and night not even if he still

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.040 
length and night not even if he still
wasn't<00:03:11.459> even<00:03:11.760> like<00:03:11.880> full<00:03:12.270> shoulder<00:03:12.690> think

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
wasn't even like full shoulder think

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.860 
wasn't even like full shoulder think
there<00:03:13.200> was<00:03:13.320> still<00:03:13.820> like<00:03:14.820> crazy<00:03:15.180> shoulder<00:03:15.660> like

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
there was still like crazy shoulder like

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.420 
there was still like crazy shoulder like
it<00:03:15.990> took<00:03:16.140> me<00:03:16.290> like<00:03:16.410> two<00:03:16.650> years<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.100> even<00:03:17.250> do

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it took me like two years to even do

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.160 
it took me like two years to even do
that<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:19.519> like<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.790> third<00:03:21.060> year<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:22.050> I

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
then when I started transitioning I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.759 
then when I started transitioning I
noticed<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.840> breakage<00:03:58.260> was<00:03:58.410> becoming

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
noticed that the breakage was becoming

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.479 
noticed that the breakage was becoming
less<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.430> less<00:03:59.570> and<00:04:00.570> less<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.530> less<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.190> then

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
less and less and less and less and then

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.699 
less and less and less and less and then
when<00:04:02.670> i<00:04:02.700> big<00:04:03.030> chopped<00:04:03.390> like<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:04.230> literally

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
when i big chopped like I literally

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.070 
when i big chopped like I literally
don't<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.430> breakage<00:04:06.030> like<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.450> have<00:04:06.660> shaded

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
don't have breakage like I have shaded

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.890 
don't have breakage like I have shaded
hairs<00:04:07.350> when<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.709> wash<00:04:08.430> my<00:04:08.640> hair<00:04:08.880> but<00:04:09.209> i<00:04:09.450> do<00:04:09.510> not

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
hairs when I wash my hair but i do not

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.289 
hairs when I wash my hair but i do not
have<00:04:10.140> breakage<00:04:10.620> at<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.820> i<00:04:11.880> think<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.269> of

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
have breakage at all and i think one of

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.420 
have breakage at all and i think one of
the<00:04:12.420> main<00:04:12.480> things<00:04:12.900> that<00:04:12.989> i<00:04:13.140> noticed<00:04:13.410> was<00:04:13.830> now

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
the main things that i noticed was now

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.729 
the main things that i noticed was now
that<00:04:14.670> i'm<00:04:14.760> absolutely<00:04:14.910> natural<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.470> crown

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
that i'm absolutely natural is the crown

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.340 
that i'm absolutely natural is the crown
of<00:04:16.950> my<00:04:17.100> hair<00:04:17.430> texture<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:18.479> much<00:04:18.870> looser

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
of my hair texture is so much looser

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.529 
of my hair texture is so much looser
than<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.650> rest<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:20.010> my<00:04:20.160> hair<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.790> only<00:04:21.209> thing

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
than the rest of my hair the only thing

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.379 
than the rest of my hair the only thing
that<00:04:21.870> could<00:04:22.080> make<00:04:22.109> sense<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.340> why<00:04:23.520> am<00:04:23.580> I

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
that could make sense so why am I

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.059 
that could make sense so why am I
was<00:04:24.569> breaking<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.199> much<00:04:25.439> is<00:04:25.620> because<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.979> was

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
was breaking so much is because it was

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:27.649 
was breaking so much is because it was
so<00:04:26.310> much<00:04:26.460> looser<00:04:26.849> than<00:04:26.879> the<00:04:27.090> rest<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.389> my<00:04:27.479> hair

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
that he didn't take that long to process

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.760 
that he didn't take that long to process
like<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.360> rest<00:04:30.569> of<00:04:30.719> my<00:04:30.810> hair<00:04:31.020> did<00:04:31.289> and<00:04:31.319> so<00:04:31.620> when
