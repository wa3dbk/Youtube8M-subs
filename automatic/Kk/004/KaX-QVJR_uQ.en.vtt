 amateurs pre experts and experts and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.650
 during their presentations they were evaluated 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.299

 creativity and the kids' routine 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.920
 for the newbies are those who come 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.170
 beginning the tricks fall a lot 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.920
 they are so risky but even if they have 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.810
 a good consistency and they also go 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.450
 learning only that they have around 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.329
 two years practicing the sport from 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.470
 than nissan to two years the pre experts 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:45.620
 already fall less already their tricks are 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.069
 more varied the falls are smaller and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.430
 as well 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.609
 and they are also not as much as the experts 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.400
 but yes they do have a very good variety 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.280
 of tricks the experts are simply 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.170
 those who most risk their lives the truth 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.790
 they have around 5 to 10 years 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.579
 practicing this sport the most 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.879
 they practice in this country the best are 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.780
 of tegucigalpa for being the place that 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:14.550
 they have this space to be able to practice 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.139
 and those from the other sides practice in 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.420
 earth ramps but they still have very 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.269
 good routines and very good tricks the 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.790
 difficulty is bigger the speed is 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.530
 the height is greater and the tricks 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.080
 they are much more difficult than the others 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.930
 two categories and if you can 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.540
 fix them they almost do not fail tricks and their 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.850
 tricks and they are very difficult at the end of 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.780
 the activity was delivered 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.690
 acknowledgments to the first places 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.850
 of each category but the emotion does not 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.520
 only invaded the creditors of the 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.950
 main positions since it could be 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.380
 observe great satisfaction in each 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.660
 one of the competitors where everyone is 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.240
 felt winners not for the achievement of a 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.820
 medal or a trophy but because they were 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.650
 the protagonists of the show that 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.090
 managed to gather many people 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.910
 who enjoyed their acrobatics 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.840
 Well I also feel happy 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.490
 I came to have fun a friend told me that 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.380
 this is not done by winning but by 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.000
 have fun and the truth has 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.310
 I am very funny 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.510
 very much the truth a lot has been one of my 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.150
 greater competences and 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.090
 the truth I have not done tricks that never 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.900
 you've almost never tried the two 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.900
 knocks of the rail 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.570
 I practiced it but one day it hits me and 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.530
 I fell head on then I do not know the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.530
 Adrenaline was rising 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.810
 If I feel very happy for that
