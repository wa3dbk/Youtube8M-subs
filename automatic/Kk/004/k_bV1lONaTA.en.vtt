and the only thing i'm saying okay well
i<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.399> they<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.670> range<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.480> so

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
i do see that they have range on that so

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.110 
i do see that they have range on that so
will<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.070> spirit<00:00:38.370> made<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.760> hit<00:00:38.910> here

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
will my spirit made you get hit here

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.280 
will my spirit made you get hit here
let's<00:00:39.390> find<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:41.300> not<00:00:42.300> enough<00:00:42.629> range<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.170> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
let's find out not enough range on it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.950 
let's find out not enough range on it
just<00:00:43.559> yet<00:00:43.680> but<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.940> okay<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.460> i'm

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
just yet but that's okay and i'm

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
just yet but that's okay and i'm

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
guessing probably gonna be enough range

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.250 
guessing probably gonna be enough range

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
town hall in my opinion should always be

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.789 
town hall in my opinion should always be
in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> center<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> base<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.930> very

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
in the center of the base for a very

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920 
in the center of the base for a very
important<00:01:35.340> reason<00:01:35.390> town<00:01:36.390> halls<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
important reason town halls in the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.149 
important reason town halls in the
center<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.290> base<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.530> because<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.070> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
center of my base is because when you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
center of my base is because when you
see<00:01:38.340> heroes<00:01:38.729> come<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.000> from<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:39.810> direction

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
see heroes come in from this direction

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.440 
see heroes come in from this direction
or<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> direction<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> times<00:01:42.270> they

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
or this direction a lot of times they

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.929 
or this direction a lot of times they
will<00:01:42.570> target<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.259> first<00:01:43.829> leaving<00:01:44.430> my<00:01:44.579> heroes

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
will target this first leaving my heroes

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.450 
will target this first leaving my heroes
out<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.750> pound<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
out there to just pound on them so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.359 
out there to just pound on them so
that's<00:01:47.850> why<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.500> suggest<00:01:49.500> putting<00:01:49.740> town<00:01:50.070> hall

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that's why I suggest putting town hall

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.590 
that's why I suggest putting town hall
in<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> center<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.189> base<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.939> basically

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
in the center of your base to basically

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.990 
in the center of your base to basically
it's<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> protect<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:56.820> not

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's there to protect you you're not

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
it's there to protect you you're not
protecting<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.689> it's<00:01:58.409> protecting<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.310> same

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
protecting it it's protecting you same

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.459 
protecting it it's protecting you same

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
thing with bolts they work in a very

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
thing with bolts they work in a very
similar<00:02:01.770> fashion<00:02:02.159> I've<00:02:02.670> got<00:02:02.880> one<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.479> do
