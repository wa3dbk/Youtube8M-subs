00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.190
 let's say that people 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.190
 well there we have 100 grams of dough 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.150
 and let's put the record are bean 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.380
 black is a stew is a typical 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.990
 dish of the old ancestors of the 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.450
 mexican food from before 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 this shine is practically stewed 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.430
 with butter and should carry garlic 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.650
 onion panela cheese in box and 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.710
 shredded half to half and should 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.470
 Take the step of science in the case of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 how it is here the onion comes and it is 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.690
 a saucer ventures this is not going to serve 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.430
 to make the filling of our plate 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.580
 I had already mentioned they are a turn 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.200
 of 100 grams of dough is clearly 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.770
 go 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:58.079
 and we go to our I recommend this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.960
 normally in the back of those times 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.490
 housewives there was this but I 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.210
 I'm going to do it here so that you 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:09.060
 and they are practically learning 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 let's have 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.530
 look at this practically before that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.159
 dinner yes but here we go here we are going to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.509
 do it on a little machine for those who 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.710
 really do not know how to do it and in the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.710
 make them a little more practical 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.149
 well let's start we are a little 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.149
 we are not a little bit like taquito 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.820
 let's crush it but not much because 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.590
 the plan just has to be totally 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.579
 filling 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.939
 well as giving it the form action does not have 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:48.520
 that being chubby and fat chubby is 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.140
 accompany alone or with some cut 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.620
 some meat already saw 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.970
 to be clearly if we are not seeing 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:04.260
 and on this side we're going to open it from 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.040
 this side and we're going to pass exactly 40 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.040
 grams of beans 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.360
 you have a 37 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.730
 a little more 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.740
 let's remove a little bit is happening 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.910
 in unusual but we're talking about that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.910
 They are 40 40 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.010
 subsequently this is emptied here in 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.010
 medium 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.209
 all right 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.880
 what rich and what are we going to put what is to 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.930
 throughout the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.930
 throughout the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.730
 this case is being garachico but what 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.600
 let's convert 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.390
 in a 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.400
 in a skinny and those on this side are going to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.400
 start doing this this 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.210
 to make it like a pancake 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.569
 same before 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.269
 they did it this way they did something more to 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.959
 pure hands but we are not so 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.959
 Experts 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.480
 then this is the way how it goes 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.150
 to stay this 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.329
 the co 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.860
 totally stuffed as well as a common the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.569
 lantern 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.110
 and it looks good gray 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.540
 we are going to flip it here 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.180
 on this side so that to give a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.180
 little way of life look at veas 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.680
 amuse moms did it with 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.020
 practically with pure hands with 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.250
 the pure hands this was a skinny twine 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.620

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.920

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.540
 complement of this skinny lito
