00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.240
I promised the world of Reddit that I'd test
which weapons could be thrown the furthest.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.600
This is without a doubt THE most important
video that you'll ever watch. How many times

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.879
have you been stuck in a corner with a load
of weapons, while your weaponless team-mate

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.130
is begging you to toss one across? Which stands
the best chance of crossing the distance between

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.280
yourself and them? This is a classic Tosser's
dilemma and is one that I'll be studying in

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.280
this video.
For this I had a friend help me. That's right,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.280
I have friends! I began by throwing weapons
into shallow water to record where the splash

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.670
was and then ranked them from best to worst.
I guess that this most accurately represents

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.529
how people throw weapons. Here were the results,
with the longest throws being awarded the

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.989
highest points. Rifles, SMGs and heavy weapons
fare worse than pistols which are clearly

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.920
the best things to toss.
There's clearly some kind of pattern going

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.590
on here! To test this further I then repeated
it, only throwing the weapons directly upwards.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.550
You know, in case your team-mate's stuck in
the rafters or something. The same sort of

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.129
pattern emerged, with the pistols outperforming
the others and the rifles faring poorly.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.510
The red blobs are the mid-points of the weapons,
since otherwise longer weapons would have

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.260
an advantage over shorter ones. 'But they
do!' you might cry. NO THEY DON'T! Here's

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.160
a test to show that the AWP can only be picked
up from a certain point, even though it looks

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.360
as though it should be picked up sooner if
pointed towards or away from you. If I was

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.360
to test the rafter throws again I'd probably
do it with low gravity to try and differentiate

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.980
between the results a bit more. But whatever.
It'll be something for me to look forward

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.360
to doing on a rainy afternoon sometime.
And finally, I designed a tall tower to simulate

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.540
longer drops. I don't think you're ever going
to throw a weapon from Vertigo to aid a team-mate

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.771
on the streets below, but YOU NEVER KNOW.
This is where things got interesting. Rifles

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:35.350
do the worst and the pistols do the best.
Interestingly, in all three of these tests,

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.360
the shotguns (with the exception of the nova)
consistently performed well.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.420
It's important to be aware of the limitations
of these tests. Every toss-spot is unique

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.810
so it's hard to compare weapon throws in any
sort of meaningful way. I also noticed a strange

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.670
phenomenon where some weapons would drop far
slower than others, much like how the rag-dolls

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.030
in Counter Strike Source used to. Sniper rifles
were particularly prone to this which is probably

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.230
why they did so poorly in the tower-test.
A fascinating subject in its own right, but

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.630
I think that I'll save that for another video.
We don't want too much excitement in one day,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.060
do we.
Remember that the gaps in distance are further

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.229
apart in some situations than in others and
isn't something that the numbers really show.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.280
For example, in the 'up' test, a lot of the
pistols were the exact same height and due

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.239
to the limitations of my testing some inevitably
got ranked more favourably than others. Because

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.409
of this, take my results with a pinch of salt.
I combined all 3 results into a mega-table

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.090
and came up with these ranks. You can criticise
these all you like but I have made my decision.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.480
Some weapons, such as the main automatic rifles,
are consistently poor for throwing, while

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.370
most pistols are good. Remember this the next
time a team-mate asks for your AWP at spawn.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.090
Inform him that your pistol is much more likely
to reach him since firstly the length of the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.049
weapon DOESN'T compensate for anything and
because, with the exception of the tec-9 which

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.609
only performed averagely in the tests, and
the elites which are bad for throwing to people

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.879
in the rafters, pistols can be thrown the
furthest. So with this in mind, 'Philip's

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.829
Favourite Toss' award goes to the P250, while
'Philip's Ultimate Flop' award goes to the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.189
M4A1-S. An honorable mention to all shotguns
but the nova, which all consistently performed

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.920
better than other heavy weapons.
Now of course the angle at which you throw

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.769
the weapons is also important. Standing from
a height of 64 units, I found that pointing

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.049
10 degrees upwards yielded the best results
for throwing the furthest. So far, throwing

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.219
a P250 at an angle of 10 degrees is the ultimate
throw! I tested a number of skins, but didn't

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.790
find any difference. I'm very disappointed
with my friend.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.109
Can't trust anybody these days.
I tried all sorts of things myself to try

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.950
and throw weapons further but to no avail-
until somebody suggested an ibp sticker. But

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.950
surely this wouldn't work! This wouldn't work,
right?

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.379
I find the heavily scratched and tarnished
IBP throws better.

00:03:39.379 --> 00:04:02.752
But is there a way of throwing it EVEN further?
I tried changing the skins and everything,

00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:03.752
but nothing worked. But then, somebody suggested
an IBP sticker. Surely not.

00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:04.810
...Right?
I didn't make this video all by myself. A

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.559
special thanks to Welshe for being the concerned
CT in these clips. He's always willing to

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.980
help me in my videos- check out his channel
