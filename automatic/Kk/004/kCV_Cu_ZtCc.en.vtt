00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
said i've been doing it all summer for

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.169 
said i've been doing it all summer for
like<00:01:59.679> three<00:01:59.890> or<00:01:59.979> four<00:02:00.009> months<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.700> figure<00:02:01.090> it

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
like three or four months so I figure it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.200 
like three or four months so I figure it
I<00:02:01.950> think<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.039> initial<00:02:03.429> progress<00:02:03.819> said<00:02:04.060> you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
I think the initial progress said you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.919 
I think the initial progress said you
dive<00:02:04.630> in<00:02:04.780> a<00:02:04.960> second<00:02:05.349> week<00:02:05.500> can<00:02:06.490> i<00:02:06.759> watch<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
dive in a second week can i watch the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.440 
dive in a second week can i watch the
light<00:02:08.140> by<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.069> way<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> guess<00:02:09.670> because<00:02:10.239> I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
light by the way I guess because I

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.690 
light by the way I guess because I
didn't<00:02:10.660> want<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.019> hop<00:02:11.260> out<00:02:11.410> there<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.459> I
