00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.300
 find us among males 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.040
 it was an idea g at first had to do 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:15.229
 the meeting of friends 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.650
 now these encounters 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 they went systematizing 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.380
 and that we could 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.839
 stop talking only 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.250
 of soccer 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.759
 politics 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.900
 and of issues quite outside of us 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:33.070
 we were realizing 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 the fact of being able 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.350
 have a scope 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.350
 where you have to share 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.800
 the privacy of each one of us 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.190
 municipality 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.740
 it did not represent the possibility of meeting each one of us 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.780
 with ourselves 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.140
 in a space of sincerity 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.760
 with us 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.480
 and at the same time 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.480
 a space where you will have other 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 Kenny will make fun of what we're talking about 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.710
 that firewood from the fallen tree did if we were actually talking about any 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.710
 our pains or our difficulties 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.350
 they could not get closer 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.810
 aspects 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.240
 of his daily life that had to do with what 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 This also happened to him in relation to the topics that each one of us and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.840
 he raises it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.090
 That's how it went 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940
 as in other spaces 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.490
 they went after mutating 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.490
 in the opportunity of whole me 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.560
 that allowed us 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.430
 to be able to talk about what we were feeling 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.090
 I will be able to know that we were the only ones that did not pass things of that nature 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.300
 and together 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.150
 I will find new ways 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.270
 power 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.060
 travel through life 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.600
 that will bring us closer to happiness and much less 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.030
 to pain and society 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.310
 these meeting spaces 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.480
 are the bars that 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.850
 we preserve 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.559
 serious solvent 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.029
 and that 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.789
 Before the possibility 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.499
 that there is no look 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.999
 The player 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.229
 I will not open completely 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.199
 down that road 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.559
 recognize 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.559
 each of the things that are happening to us 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.569
 be able to admit 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.629
 all the emotions 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.249
 that will generate different life experiences 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.390
 in the different 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.719
 Vital signs 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.939
 that's why we go rag well endowed 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:51.359
 that's why you stay day we can think that also that this activity d the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.420
 recycling with which we have been working in groups 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.870
 we can also be a cyclist militarily 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.379
 the groups of encounter between males that to throw 30 years that we come 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.379
 doing 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.319
 percent is a treat for me 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.600
 you can continue 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.560
 meeting with 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.040
 other men she is not necessarily from there her friend because he comes 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.659
 after 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.029
 it is generating 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:29.469
 a bond has deep intimacy friendship with all of them 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.289
 this proposal that was born 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:33.860
 a group of friends after 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.279
 If the fire professionalized 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.789
 and today I will not allow 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.789
 from the experience we have done in these 30 years 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.579
 have a fairly clear set of ideas for some problems 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.060
 specific that we men are going to trade from the different cycles 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.259
 vital 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:04:00.859
 very important we can take into account recognize fight 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.029
 importance and severity 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:04.850
 d 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.689
 at certain times in which 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.629
 being accompanied 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.549
 entertainment the feeling of being 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.599
 sheltered 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.440
 also having the right word that allows us after being cited 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 they independently raised some stumbling we have 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.940
 does not allow to continue building a life project 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.789
 g flatters us 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.110
 but the feeling of helplessness 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.479
 of fullness 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.930
 and that is that AIDS 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.510
 thank you
