 today's episode is an episode one 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 little reduced because after asking a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 you fans are having both me and nee 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.619

 make today's episode with news only 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.780

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.580
 a special episode will be released soon 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.850
 totally dedicated to the game trailer 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.020
 that hopefully come out soon even if you 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.610
 who is not respecting the dates 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 announced for the release of the trailer e 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 precisely that there will be an episode 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.040
 totally dedicated to the trailer is therefore 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.869
 to be considered a special episode with 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.759
 so much good analysis 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.759
 the premises are finished and initials 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.670
 we have news on set 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.260
 collins will have the tired iuris menia 31 la 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.450
 its whole from will be very accurate and 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.890
 will vary if it will be champion 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.510
 at the beginning of the game development set 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.930
 lonis must also have a name and gaz 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.280
 dedicated moment or the cag stomp la 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.090
 move to the now seth bandit 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.140
 rogen on concrete blocks 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.000
 unfortunately just because the federation 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.370
 he removed this western technique 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.880
 not even the omega moment will be included 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.010
 in the game 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.320
 the card stomp does not always appear 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.030
 not even in the list of moves 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.860
 assignable hyperx however you could 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.440
 be included in a hypothetical mode 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.990
 creates one ends up returning to saturated spears 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.480
 the jj security will be present in his 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.820
 entry and can be used as 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.410
 manager but only exclusively 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.239
 for set rolex set 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.730
 will also have a very second time 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.040
 probably a saying that is late 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.920
 soon and well to 30 that of the shield 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.510

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.330
 it should be the phoenix 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.680
 flash and face praise of we remember you 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.390
 that the face locke rights to be 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.360
 really used for a short span of 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.290
 time therefore most likely will come 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.010
 replaced with panning that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.190
 currently uses set collins in 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.530

 the cute graf possess at least 2 to 1 with 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.209
 the body paint and one without I care about 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.160
 milva of mind will probably be 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.380
 unlockable in the mode but the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.709
 knight his entry is one of the 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.410
 more accurate the game and the current style 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.870
 expected and the demon born and nt role 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.120
 the page could not be updated 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.280

 recordings for an introductory video 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.700

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.789
 blog 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.550
 we know most of the roster

 it is scanned including 90 percent 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.610

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.650
 universal mode 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.419
 in fact the suu kyi is implementing of

 cd on its official page 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.190
