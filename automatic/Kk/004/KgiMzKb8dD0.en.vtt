00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
subject is there are a lot of tech

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
subject is there are a lot of tech
enthusiasts<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.860> most<00:00:38.040> computer

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
enthusiasts out there but most computer

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
enthusiasts out there but most computer
users<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.180> regular<00:00:39.750> consumers<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
users are just regular consumers and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
users are just regular consumers and
that's<00:00:41.219> great<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> will<00:00:42.420> admit<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that's great but I will admit that the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.540 
that's great but I will admit that the
difference<00:00:43.440> between<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.160> types<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
difference between these two types of

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
difference between these two types of
systems<00:00:44.760> has<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.600> been<00:00:45.780> explained<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.350> well

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
systems has not been explained that well

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.860 
systems has not been explained that well
to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> consumer<00:00:47.190> market<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.210> what<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> all

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
to the consumer market so what is all

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.360 
to the consumer market so what is all
the<00:00:49.050> fuss<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.260> between<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.160> types

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the fuss about between these two types

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.680 
the fuss about between these two types
of<00:00:50.520> systems<00:00:50.730> well<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> look<00:00:52.289> in

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
of systems well let's take a look in

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
of systems well let's take a look in
terms<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.930> numbers<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.829> maximum<00:00:56.430> value<00:00:57.000> a

translated into bytes and then into

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.860 
translated into bytes and then into
exabytes<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:52.800> can<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.010> about<00:01:53.190> 16<00:01:54.000> exabytes<00:01:54.510> of

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.910 
exabytes we can get about 16 exabytes of
ram<00:01:55.080> that's<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:55.860> 16<00:01:56.460> billion<00:01:57.120> gigabytes<00:01:57.920> so

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
ram that's about 16 billion gigabytes so

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880 
ram that's about 16 billion gigabytes so
this<00:01:59.130> large<00:01:59.520> number<00:02:00.050> basically<00:02:01.050> removes<00:02:01.530> any

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
this large number basically removes any

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.990 
this large number basically removes any
kind<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.250> Ram<00:02:02.520> cap<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:03.060> technology<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.810> today

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
kind of Ram cap for technology of today

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.370 
kind of Ram cap for technology of today
now<00:02:06.000> let's<00:02:06.030> talk<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.450> why<00:02:06.780> Ram<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.260> so

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
now let's talk about why Ram is so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.560 
now let's talk about why Ram is so
special<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.399> about<00:02:08.520> your<00:02:08.670> hard<00:02:08.910> drive<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
special think about your hard drive you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.060 
special think about your hard drive you
store<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:09.990> of<00:02:10.020> your<00:02:10.170> personal<00:02:10.350> files<00:02:10.830> on

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
store all of your personal files on

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.680 
store all of your personal files on
there<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.850> have<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> lot<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.240> space<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
there and you have a lot of space to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.110 
there and you have a lot of space to
store<00:02:12.930> all<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.320> your<00:02:13.470> data<00:02:13.760> RAM<00:02:14.760> works<00:02:15.030> a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
store all of your data RAM works a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.820 
store all of your data RAM works a
little<00:02:15.209> bit<00:02:15.390> differently<00:02:15.720> though<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.470> stores

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
little bit differently though it stores

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.340 
little bit differently though it stores
data<00:02:17.100> temporarily<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.390> help<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.720> computer<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
data temporarily to help the computer it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.620 
data temporarily to help the computer it
does<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.100> store<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.550> much<00:02:20.730> data<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.330> hard

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
does not store as much data as a hard

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.600 
does not store as much data as a hard
drive<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> advantage<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.040> Ram<00:02:23.400> can

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
drive but the advantage is that Ram can

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.150 
drive but the advantage is that Ram can
transfer<00:02:24.090> data<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:25.020> faster<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.890> hard

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
transfer data way faster than a hard

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 
transfer data way faster than a hard
drive<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.640> even<00:02:27.300> faster<00:02:27.720> than<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.959> solid-state

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
drive can even faster than a solid-state

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.340 
drive can even faster than a solid-state
drive<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.700> if<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> RAM<00:02:30.330> acts<00:02:30.690> faster<00:02:31.200> than<00:02:31.320> a

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
drive so if the RAM acts faster than a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.530 
drive so if the RAM acts faster than a
hard<00:02:31.620> drive<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:32.160> user<00:02:32.700> would<00:02:32.880> typically<00:02:33.270> want

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
hard drive a user would typically want

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.390 
hard drive a user would typically want
more<00:02:33.810> data<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.410> temporarily<00:02:34.950> stored<00:02:35.310> on

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
more data to be temporarily stored on

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420 
more data to be temporarily stored on
the<00:02:35.489> RAM<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> more<00:02:37.200> free<00:02:37.440> Ram<00:02:37.739> that<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the RAM so the more free Ram that the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
the RAM so the more free Ram that the
computer<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:38.940> available<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.600> itself<00:02:39.959> the

computer has available to itself the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.680 
computer has available to itself the
faster<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> system<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.489> respond<00:02:41.970> under<00:02:42.330> a

heavier load sometimes when you're using

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.990 
heavier load sometimes when you're using
a<00:02:44.970> computer<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.410> not<00:02:46.799> responding<00:02:47.519> sign

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
a computer you see a not responding sign

a computer you see a not responding sign
on<00:02:48.269> your<00:02:48.390> window<00:02:48.750> or<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.290> you're<00:02:49.380> running<00:02:49.500> a

it<00:03:07.500> simple<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.400> do<00:03:08.489> more<00:03:08.730> things<00:03:08.790> at<00:03:09.209> once

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
it simple you can do more things at once

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.949 
it simple you can do more things at once
faster<00:03:10.200> than<00:03:10.380> normal<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.510> now<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.720> know<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
faster than normal so now you know a

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.680 
faster than normal so now you know a
little<00:03:13.200> bit<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:13.799> bits<00:03:14.070> are<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.730> why<00:03:15.420> Ram

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
little bit of what bits are and why Ram

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.380 
little bit of what bits are and why Ram
is<00:03:15.870> important<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.860> what<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> good

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
is important so what now well the good

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.180 
is important so what now well the good
news<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:19.049> lot<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.440> modern<00:03:19.620> computers
