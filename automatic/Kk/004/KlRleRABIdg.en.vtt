expensive and finding one without side
effects<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> difficult<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.200> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> VA<00:01:13.530> we

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
effects is difficult and in the VA we

that<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.710> metformin<00:01:20.300> what<00:01:21.300> we<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.540> found<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
that is metformin what we have found is

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.390 
that is metformin what we have found is
patients<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.620> take<00:01:22.830> metformin<00:01:23.070> for

forms of cancer modeling like those

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.930 
forms of cancer modeling like those
cancers<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> difficult<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.610> ground

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
cancers is difficult on the ground

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.160 
cancers is difficult on the ground
because<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.360> middle<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.660> cancer<00:01:31.080> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because in the middle of the cancer you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.770 
because in the middle of the cancer you
have<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.680> gas<00:01:31.770> exchange<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.780> it's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
have very little gas exchange and it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
have very little gas exchange and it's
exactly<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> same<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.680> space<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.580> have<00:01:35.610> very

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
exactly the same in space you have very

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
exactly the same in space you have very
little<00:01:36.180> convection<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> gases<00:01:37.290> don't<00:01:37.440> move

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
little convection the gases don't move

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.680 
little convection the gases don't move
like<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.160> on<00:01:38.190> the<00:01:38.340> ground<00:01:38.580> so<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.420> think

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
like they do on the ground so we think

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.500 
like they do on the ground so we think
space<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> very<00:01:40.830> good<00:01:40.920> way<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.580> model<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
space is a very good way to model the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.450 
space is a very good way to model the
inside<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.870> a<00:01:43.020> tumor<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:44.070> look<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.430> new

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

knock<00:02:12.060> genes<00:02:12.510> out<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.230> we

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
knock genes out so we

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.650 
knock genes out so we
to<00:02:13.709> have<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.280> series<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.300> jeans<00:02:15.720> pool<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.770> jeans

what<00:02:56.310> we've<00:02:56.430> done<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.970> we<00:02:57.180> put<00:02:57.450> if<00:02:57.780> you've<00:02:58.019> ever

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
what we've done is we put if you've ever

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.780 
what we've done is we put if you've ever
seen<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.380> fluorescent<00:02:58.890> jellyfish<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.340> goes

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
seen the fluorescent jellyfish that goes

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.850 
seen the fluorescent jellyfish that goes
green<00:03:00.090> right<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.930> protein<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.530> makes<00:03:01.739> it

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
green right the protein that makes it

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.640 
green right the protein that makes it
grow<00:03:02.099> good<00:03:02.400> green<00:03:02.970> has<00:03:03.390> been<00:03:03.690> isolated<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.500> we

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
grow good green has been isolated and we

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.160 
grow good green has been isolated and we
have<00:03:04.860> its<00:03:05.040> DNA<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:06.269> we've<00:03:06.420> put<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> front

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
have its DNA and we've put that in front

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.680 
have its DNA and we've put that in front
of<00:03:07.290> every<00:03:07.650> gene<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.010> genome<00:03:08.220> as<00:03:08.580> well<00:03:08.819> so

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
of every gene in the genome as well so

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.800 
of every gene in the genome as well so
it<00:03:10.049> spotted<00:03:10.560> each<00:03:11.130> strain<00:03:11.670> reports<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.569> the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
it spotted each strain reports on the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.949 
it spotted each strain reports on the
when<00:03:13.260> what<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.590> gene<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:14.280> transcribed<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.690> also

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
when what a gene is transcribed it also

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.960 
when what a gene is transcribed it also
transcribes<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.980> protein<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.609> makes<00:03:17.850> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
transcribes that protein that makes a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.750 
transcribes that protein that makes a
green<00:03:18.209> fluorescence<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.070> have<00:03:20.280> plates

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
green fluorescence so we have plates

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.490 
green fluorescence so we have plates
that<00:03:21.060> have<00:03:21.120> three<00:03:21.540> hundred<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.959> eighty<00:03:22.109> four

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
that have three hundred and eighty four

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.410 
that have three hundred and eighty four
different<00:03:23.100> strains<00:03:23.280> each<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.970> reporting<00:03:24.359> a

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
different strains each one reporting a

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.620 
different strains each one reporting a
different<00:03:24.780> gene<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.880> over<00:03:26.880> ten<00:03:27.120> plates<00:03:27.390> we

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
different gene and over ten plates we

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.210 
different gene and over ten plates we
can<00:03:27.750> get<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:27.989> whole<00:03:28.170> genome<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:29.069> this

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
can get the whole genome and this

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.210 
can get the whole genome and this
actually<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> fluorescent<00:03:30.269> plate<00:03:30.540> reader<00:03:30.810> on

actually a fluorescent plate reader on

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.400 
actually a fluorescent plate reader on
station<00:03:32.220> we<00:03:32.850> put<00:03:33.060> one<00:03:33.239> plate<00:03:33.450> at<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.720> time<00:03:33.989> we

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
station we put one plate at a time we

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.770 
station we put one plate at a time we
measure<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.829> gene<00:03:35.579> expression<00:03:36.090> every<00:03:36.569> ten

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
measure the gene expression every ten

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.599 
measure the gene expression every ten
minutes<00:03:36.930> for<00:03:37.200> 18<00:03:37.470> hours<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:38.190> we<00:03:38.370> get<00:03:38.519> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
minutes for 18 hours and we get the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.449 
minutes for 18 hours and we get the
entire<00:03:38.910> ballet<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.750> how<00:03:40.410> East<00:03:40.890> responded

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
entire ballet of how East responded

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.129 
entire ballet of how East responded
space<00:03:42.859> that's<00:03:43.859> just<00:03:44.100> it's<00:03:44.639> amazing<00:03:45.239> how<00:03:45.480> how

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
space that's just it's amazing how how

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
that is planned to operate how are you

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.250 
that is planned to operate how are you
going<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.959> able<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.829> tell<00:03:51.139> basically<00:03:52.139> how

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
going to be able to tell basically how

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.280 
going to be able to tell basically how
the<00:03:52.319> cells<00:03:52.680> respond<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.639> stresses<00:03:54.230> on<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the cells respond to the stresses on the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.309 
the cells respond to the stresses on the

from the orbital environment well

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.780 
from the orbital environment well
because<00:03:58.590> we<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.859> ground<00:03:59.069> controls<00:03:59.549> for

just<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.630> they<00:04:06.750> made<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.019> canadian<00:04:07.440> armed

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
just like they made the canadian armed

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.440 
just like they made the canadian armed
for<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.220> industrial<00:04:08.670> space<00:04:08.880> station<00:04:09.239> they

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
for the industrial space station they

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.030 
for the industrial space station they
have<00:04:09.569> some<00:04:09.720> very<00:04:09.959> very<00:04:10.079> good<00:04:10.260> robotics<00:04:10.799> and

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
have some very very good robotics and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.910 
have some very very good robotics and
they<00:04:12.000> just<00:04:12.269> published<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.139> paper<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.620> science

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
they just published a paper in science

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.000 
they just published a paper in science
last<00:04:14.340> week<00:04:14.609> which<00:04:15.299> they<00:04:15.510> look<00:04:15.660> at<00:04:16.010> 3,700

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
last week which they look at 3,700

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.400 
last week which they look at 3,700
different<00:04:17.820> responses<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.840> stresses<00:04:19.289> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
different responses to stresses and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.529 
different responses to stresses and
drugs<00:04:19.620> on<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.889> ground<00:04:20.220> so<00:04:20.910> that<00:04:20.940> gives<00:04:21.239> us<00:04:21.359> a

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
drugs on the ground so that gives us a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.020 
drugs on the ground so that gives us a
fantastic<00:04:21.750> reference<00:04:22.680> library<00:04:23.159> so<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.760> really

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
fantastic reference library so we really

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.120 
fantastic reference library so we really
understand<00:04:24.510> what's<00:04:24.750> unique<00:04:25.169> about<00:04:25.289> space<00:04:25.800> and

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
understand what's unique about space and

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.770 
understand what's unique about space and
what<00:04:27.060> we<00:04:27.330> can

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
what we can

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.360 
what we can
white<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:28.020> space<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.560> we<00:04:28.680> can't<00:04:28.950> go<00:04:29.160> on<00:04:29.190> the

white in space that we can't go on the
ground<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.620> course<00:04:31.650> what<00:04:32.160> we'll<00:04:32.610> talk

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
ground and of course what we'll talk

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.240 
ground and of course what we'll talk
about<00:04:33.180> your<00:04:33.420> goals<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.410> figure<00:04:34.680> out<00:04:34.860> are<00:04:35.100> they

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
about your goals to figure out are they

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.580 
about your goals to figure out are they
to<00:04:35.310> figure<00:04:35.820> out<00:04:36.000> which<00:04:36.210> plants<00:04:36.810> grow<00:04:37.050> best<00:04:37.380> in

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590

what<00:05:01.410> we<00:05:01.620> want<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.890> do<00:05:02.010> is<00:05:02.250> repurpose<00:05:02.850> drugs

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
what we want to do is repurpose drugs

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.790 
what we want to do is repurpose drugs
and<00:05:03.419> we're<00:05:03.570> interested<00:05:03.960> in<00:05:04.230> whether<00:05:04.380> the<00:05:04.620> lack

and we're interested in whether the lack

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.010 
and we're interested in whether the lack
of<00:05:04.830> convention<00:05:05.490> in<00:05:05.640> space<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.480> lack<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.720> gas

of convention in space the lack of gas

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.230 
of convention in space the lack of gas
movement<00:05:07.530> gives<00:05:08.010> us<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.190> good<00:05:08.550> model<00:05:09.090> for

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
movement gives us a good model for

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.080 
movement gives us a good model for
tumour<00:05:09.750> agents<00:05:10.230> for<00:05:10.980> anti-cancer<00:05:11.460> drugs<00:05:11.910> that

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
tumour agents for anti-cancer drugs that

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.330 
tumour agents for anti-cancer drugs that
are<00:05:12.210> better<00:05:12.540> than<00:05:12.840> on<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.050> ground<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:14.070> what<00:05:14.220> we

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
are better than on the ground so what we

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.860 
are better than on the ground so what we
will<00:05:14.460> bring<00:05:14.580> back<00:05:14.790> is<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.060> knowledge<00:05:15.390> which

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
will bring back is the knowledge which

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.860 
will bring back is the knowledge which
pathways<00:05:16.580> attack<00:05:17.580> tumors<00:05:18.030> so<00:05:18.419> that<00:05:18.570> we<00:05:18.690> can

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
pathways attack tumors so that we can

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.900 
pathways attack tumors so that we can
use<00:05:19.290> those<00:05:19.500> drugs<00:05:19.800> that<00:05:19.890> even<00:05:20.220> design<00:05:20.520> better

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
use those drugs that even design better

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.460 
use those drugs that even design better
drugs<00:05:21.270> on<00:05:21.479> the<00:05:21.570> ground<00:05:21.810> watch<00:05:22.080> me<00:05:22.260> know<00:05:22.350> the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
drugs on the ground watch me know the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.400 
drugs on the ground watch me know the
pathways<00:05:22.890> involved<00:05:23.450> well<00:05:24.450> and<00:05:24.870> you<00:05:24.960> just<00:05:25.200> I

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
pathways involved well and you just I

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.990 
pathways involved well and you just I
think<00:05:25.680> it<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:25.919> answered<00:05:26.340> my<00:05:26.400> last<00:05:26.700> question

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
think it just answered my last question

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.830 
think it just answered my last question
but<00:05:27.419> if<00:05:28.260> the<00:05:28.680> unique<00:05:29.010> I<00:05:29.220> guess<00:05:29.630> environment<00:05:30.630> of

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
but if the unique I guess environment of

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.430 
but if the unique I guess environment of
space<00:05:31.460> offers<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.940> actually<00:05:33.390> that<00:05:33.630> I<00:05:33.810> assume

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
space offers you actually that I assume

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.620 
space offers you actually that I assume
you<00:05:34.620> can<00:05:34.800> have<00:05:35.040> direct<00:05:35.400> interaction<00:05:36.300> with<00:05:36.479> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
you can have direct interaction with the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.610 
you can have direct interaction with the
crew<00:05:36.960> as<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:37.860> principal<00:05:38.370> investigator<00:05:39.000> right

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
crew as a principal investigator right

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.930 
crew as a principal investigator right
we<00:05:40.620> do<00:05:40.860> we've<00:05:41.070> course<00:05:41.340> have<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.640> go<00:05:41.729> through

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
we do we've course have to go through

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.400 
we do we've course have to go through
the<00:05:42.000> cap<00:05:42.180> cana<00:05:42.390> like<00:05:42.600> everybody<00:05:42.990> else<00:05:43.169> like

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
the cap cana like everybody else like

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.450 
the cap cana like everybody else like
you<00:05:43.440> see<00:05:43.680> on<00:05:43.710> TV<00:05:44.690> but<00:05:45.690> yes<00:05:46.080> we<00:05:46.229> can<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.680> we<00:05:47.250> try

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
you see on TV but yes we can and we try

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.870 
you see on TV but yes we can and we try
to<00:05:47.520> design<00:05:47.880> the<00:05:48.030> experiment<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:49.610> is<00:05:50.610> fairly

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
to design the experiment that is fairly

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.020 
to design the experiment that is fairly
automated<00:05:51.510> so<00:05:52.080> we<00:05:52.320> don't<00:05:52.530> take<00:05:52.770> or<00:05:52.979> so<00:05:53.190> we<00:05:53.850> have

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
automated so we don't take or so we have

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.760 
automated so we don't take or so we have
abundant<00:05:54.780> crew<00:05:54.930> time<00:05:55.110> where<00:05:55.260> we<00:05:55.350> need<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.560> but

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
abundant crew time where we need it but

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.610 
abundant crew time where we need it but
we<00:05:55.890> try<00:05:56.100> not<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.370> overuse<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.729> privilege

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
we try not to overuse that privilege
