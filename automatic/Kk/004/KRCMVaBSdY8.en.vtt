that make sense I don't know the same

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.390 
that make sense I don't know the same
reason<00:00:35.870> why<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:35.989> don't<00:00:36.230> get<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:37.010> the

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
reason why I don't get the the

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.250 
reason why I don't get the the
colour-pop<00:00:37.699> cosmetics<00:00:38.150> cuz<00:00:38.660> everybody<00:00:39.050> says

colour-pop cosmetics cuz everybody says

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.570 
colour-pop cosmetics cuz everybody says
that<00:00:39.290> they're<00:00:39.530> awesome<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.160> there's<00:00:40.430> no

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
that they're awesome so there's no

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.459 
that they're awesome so there's no
controversy<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:41.840> what<00:00:42.110> do<00:00:42.170> I<00:00:42.260> need<00:00:42.320> to

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
controversy is it so what do I need to

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.190 
controversy is it so what do I need to
review<00:00:42.770> before<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:44.059> that's<00:00:44.510> why<00:00:44.780> one<00:00:45.079> of<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
review before so that's why one of the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.540 
review before so that's why one of the
reasons<00:00:45.260> why<00:00:45.590> I've<00:00:45.710> never<00:00:45.890> really<00:00:46.160> per<00:00:46.340> slot

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
reasons why I've never really per slot

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.040 
reasons why I've never really per slot
in<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.730> cosmetics<00:00:47.270> but<00:00:47.360> they<00:00:47.510> got<00:00:47.719> me<00:00:47.930> with

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
in that cosmetics but they got me with

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.389 
in that cosmetics but they got me with
the<00:00:48.170> whole<00:00:48.289> Cinderella<00:00:48.800> thing<00:00:49.039> because<00:00:49.309> I

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
the whole Cinderella thing because I

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.260 
the whole Cinderella thing because I
think<00:00:49.460> every<00:00:50.030> girl<00:00:50.750> woman<00:00:51.399> you<00:00:52.399> know<00:00:52.520> has<00:00:52.940> this

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
think every girl woman you know has this

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.450 
think every girl woman you know has this
thing<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:53.840> maybe<00:00:54.320> not<00:00:54.500> every<00:00:54.949> but<00:00:55.129> I<00:00:55.190> think

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
thing and maybe not every but I think

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.700 
thing and maybe not every but I think
most<00:00:55.730> women<00:00:56.120> kind<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.930> have<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.289> connection

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
most women kind of have this connection

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.040 
most women kind of have this connection
with<00:00:58.280> disney<00:00:58.820> princesses<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.870> just

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
with disney princesses and just

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.900 
with disney princesses and just
princesses<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:00.680> general<00:01:01.100> and<00:01:01.309> that<00:01:01.430> idea<00:01:01.609> of

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
princesses in general and that idea of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.400 
princesses in general and that idea of
being<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.300> princess<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:02.899> all<00:01:02.989> those<00:01:03.140> things<00:01:03.350> I

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
being a princess and all those things I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.170 
being a princess and all those things I
think<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.590> lot<00:01:03.800> of<00:01:03.829> women<00:01:04.100> really<00:01:04.369> buy<00:01:04.970> into

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
think a lot of women really buy into

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.700 
think a lot of women really buy into
that<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.570> I<00:01:05.660> think<00:01:05.690> going<00:01:06.050> with<00:01:06.170> a<00:01:06.200> Cinderella

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
that and I think going with a Cinderella

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.070 
that and I think going with a Cinderella
collection<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:07.160> really<00:01:07.520> smart<00:01:07.789> of<00:01:08.000> Mac<00:01:08.210> but

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
collection was really smart of Mac but

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.330 
collection was really smart of Mac but
let<00:01:09.200> me<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:09.320> tell<00:01:09.500> you<00:01:09.649> what<00:01:09.890> I<00:01:09.920> think<00:01:09.979> of<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
let me just tell you what I think of the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.620 
let me just tell you what I think of the
two<00:01:10.490> different<00:01:10.670> things<00:01:10.850> we'll<00:01:11.270> start<00:01:11.479> with

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
two different things we'll start with

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.080 
two different things we'll start with
the<00:01:11.660> fluid<00:01:12.170> line<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.500> got<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.009> fluid<00:01:13.640> line<00:01:13.849> and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
the fluid line I got the fluid line and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.820 
the fluid line I got the fluid line and
macro<00:01:14.420> violet<00:01:14.720> which<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:14.959> basically<00:01:15.349> a<00:01:15.440> gel

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
macro violet which is basically a gel

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.150 
macro violet which is basically a gel
eyeliner<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:17.349> let<00:01:18.349> me<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.500> say<00:01:18.679> I'm<00:01:18.920> not

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
eyeliner and let me just say I'm not

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.460 
eyeliner and let me just say I'm not
super<00:01:19.610> impressed<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.929> one<00:01:21.170> supposedly<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
super impressed this one supposedly is a

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.380 
super impressed this one supposedly is a
reproach<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.679> think<00:01:25.369> I<00:01:25.520> don't<00:01:25.819> think<00:01:26.149> that<00:01:26.270> this

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
reproach I think I don't think that this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.139 
reproach I think I don't think that this
is<00:01:26.450> brand<00:01:26.869> new<00:01:27.009> i'm<00:01:28.009> pretty<00:01:28.429> sure<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.789> it's

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
is brand new i'm pretty sure that it's

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
you a nice purple color but then I feel

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.760 
you a nice purple color but then I feel
like<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.209> more<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.569> mess<00:02:02.780> with<00:02:02.989> it<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.500> more

like the more you mess with it the more

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.279 
like the more you mess with it the more
it<00:02:03.950> doesn't<00:02:04.369> keep<00:02:04.670> its<00:02:04.940> opacity<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.869> if<00:02:05.989> you<00:02:06.110> go

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
it doesn't keep its opacity so if you go

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.199 
it doesn't keep its opacity so if you go
over<00:02:06.319> it<00:02:06.890> you<00:02:07.280> know<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.489> swatch<00:02:07.849> turned<00:02:08.119> out

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.999 
over it you know that swatch turned out
great<00:02:08.330> because<00:02:08.509> I<00:02:08.660> only<00:02:08.840> hit<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.229> one<00:02:09.379> time<00:02:09.410> but

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
great because I only hit it one time but

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.680 
great because I only hit it one time but
if<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.220> feel<00:02:10.429> like<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.700> need<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:10.940> keep<00:02:11.239> going

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
happy with the way it initially comes

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.320 
happy with the way it initially comes
out<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.380> feel<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.430> starts<00:02:19.790> losing<00:02:20.000> its

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
out I feel like it starts losing its

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.940 
out I feel like it starts losing its
pigmentation<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.320> don't<00:02:21.500> really<00:02:21.590> like

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
pigmentation and I don't really like

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:22.780 
pigmentation and I don't really like
that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790
