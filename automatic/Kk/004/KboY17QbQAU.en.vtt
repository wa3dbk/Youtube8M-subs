00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.130 
putting it back here rotate the head up
and<00:02:15.209> rotate<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.959> chest<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.470> 90<00:02:17.069> degrees<00:02:18.140> you

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and rotate the chest up 90 degrees you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.110 
and rotate the chest up 90 degrees you
can<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:20.040> at<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> 90<00:02:20.819> degree<00:02:20.879> angle

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
can see that it's at a 90 degree angle

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.320 
can see that it's at a 90 degree angle
their<00:02:22.610> next<00:02:23.610> move<00:02:24.420> v2<00:02:24.840> arms<00:02:25.170> forward<00:02:26.330> once

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
their next move v2 arms forward once

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.650 
their next move v2 arms forward once
again<00:02:27.420> about<00:02:27.810> 90<00:02:28.170> degrees<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.560> then<00:02:29.660> we're

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
again about 90 degrees and then we're

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.289 
again about 90 degrees and then we're
going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.810> move<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.379> legs<00:02:32.180> forward<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.360> down

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
going to move the legs forward and down

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.390 
going to move the legs forward and down
so<00:02:36.299> let's<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.720> again

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
so let's see that again

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.780 
so let's see that again
forward<00:02:38.400> 90<00:02:38.910> degrees<00:02:39.269> and<00:02:39.870> down<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.610> just

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
forward 90 degrees and down you can just

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.069 
forward 90 degrees and down you can just
close<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> feet<00:02:42.299> I<00:02:42.480> think<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.720> looks<00:02:42.900> better

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
close the feet I think it looks better

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.940 
close the feet I think it looks better
that<00:02:43.200> way

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.039 

losing<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> feet<00:02:48.860> alright<00:02:50.000> next<00:02:51.000> we<00:02:51.629> fold<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
losing the feet alright next we fold the

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.260 
losing the feet alright next we fold the
wings<00:02:52.260> back

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
optimises arms are going to go in this

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.520 
optimises arms are going to go in this
gap<00:03:17.830> between<00:03:18.310> jetfire's<00:03:19.120> legs<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.930> jetfire's

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
gap between jetfire's legs and jetfire's

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.060 
gap between jetfire's legs and jetfire's
arms<00:03:20.980> right<00:03:21.460> here<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.900> let's<00:03:23.080> back<00:03:23.530> up<00:03:23.560> and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
arms right here so let's back up and

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.450 
arms right here so let's back up and
here<00:03:24.310> they<00:03:24.490> come<00:03:24.700> right<00:03:27.450> on<00:03:28.450> there

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
here they come right on there

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.820 
here they come right on there
BAM<00:03:30.810> look<00:03:31.810> how<00:03:31.930> epic<00:03:32.110> this<00:03:32.440> already<00:03:32.710> looks

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
BAM look how epic this already looks

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
BAM look how epic this already looks
we're<00:03:33.640> not<00:03:33.760> even<00:03:33.940> done<00:03:34.920> alright<00:03:35.920> our<00:03:36.460> next

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
we're not even done alright our next

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.210 
we're not even done alright our next
step<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.300> you're<00:03:37.540> going<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.840> rotate<00:03:38.220> optimises

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
step is you're going to rotate optimises

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.390 
step is you're going to rotate optimises
arms<00:03:39.580> 90<00:03:40.090> degrees<00:03:40.650> once<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.770> do<00:03:41.890> that<00:03:41.920> you

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
arms 90 degrees once you do that you

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.550 
arms 90 degrees once you do that you
rotate<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:44.190> tab<00:03:45.190> panel<00:03:45.670> down<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:46.440> form<00:03:47.440> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
rotate the tab panel down to form a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.510 
rotate the tab panel down to form a
shoulder<00:03:48.360> rotate<00:03:49.360> the<00:03:49.510> arm<00:03:49.720> 90<00:03:50.380> degrees<00:03:50.770> then

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
shoulder rotate the arm 90 degrees then

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.580 
shoulder rotate the arm 90 degrees then
rotate<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.030> cab<00:03:52.420> panel<00:03:52.870> down<00:03:53.050> to<00:03:53.110> form<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
rotate the cab panel down to form the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.640 
rotate the cab panel down to form the
shoulder<00:03:55.020> there<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.170> go

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
shoulder there you go

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.950 
shoulder there you go
now<00:03:57.400> everything<00:03:57.940> that's<00:03:57.970> left<00:03:58.390> is<00:03:58.690> just

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960 
now everything that's left is just

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.310 
now everything that's left is just
placing<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.470> guns<00:04:00.210> so<00:04:01.210> first<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.840> like<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.080> take

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
placing the guns so first I like to take

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.200 
placing the guns so first I like to take
jetfire's<00:04:02.830> gun<00:04:03.190> split<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:03.940> in<00:04:04.060> two<00:04:04.770> put<00:04:05.770> one

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
jetfire's gun split it in two put one

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.990 
jetfire's gun split it in two put one
and<00:04:07.470> optimises<00:04:08.470> one<00:04:08.800> hand<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.340> put<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.850> other

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
and optimises one hand and put the other

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.540 
and optimises one hand and put the other
up<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.720> mrs.<00:04:11.020> other<00:04:11.290> hand<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:12.250> one<00:04:12.400> reason

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
up to mrs. other hand it's one reason

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.640 
up to mrs. other hand it's one reason
it's<00:04:12.940> important<00:04:13.420> to<00:04:13.630> fold<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.080> hands<00:04:14.350> down

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it's important to fold the hands down
