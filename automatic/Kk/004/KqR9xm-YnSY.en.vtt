00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.080
 he wanted to have a pig 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.059
 date in my list are only at 14 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.740
 title so I'm 200 sony 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.030
 We 've got that 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.170
 Date got there were not yet 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.789
 known what that game is and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.660
 So that's guardian had pig 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.029
 then a bit like that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.830
 Disillusionment the pk 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.650
 presentation again shown expected 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.179
 about that much you have before 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.700
 a bit seen this day 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.020
 injured big color being traikov in 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.210
 the corner and our little boy has 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.739
 just there again a couple of players from 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 the physical pulled so as to the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.329
 lions' thumb pulls on the floor and 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.110
 so a bit the relationship between 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.970
 the two a little bit more 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.350
 that was lit in the theme 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.060
 Of course, very dearest again 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.310
 say the animations are just 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.840
 a dream 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.670
 fantastic how much effort and detail 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.460
 Workers in this in this 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.100
 one has flown fantastic beings 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.960
 sees that 20 seconds you want from and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.900
 take home with a bottle big 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.670
 Of course, pulling is great too 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.930
 The theme has run through all the games 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.850
 from the same developer of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.260
 made the fire place homeless 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.420
 also two games where it comes to that 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.700
 the nbc that emotional attachment to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.140
 play active that's what you do with great 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.170
 the horse in shadow of the colossus 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.450
 just like the little girl I am 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 not so much more is it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.930
 otherwise not the developer at least 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.250
 It had the landlord wants eder 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.380
 presenting the game itself has one 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.640
 a bit commented on one has 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 Of course, the first thing that will be asked here 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.460
 took a long time to be printed 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.630
 said so yes so it was behind one 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.490
 Business decision of the players 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.930
 to move to the ps4 and thereby have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.880
 at least it did not go faster 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.450
 that was the only thing he said 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.550
 wanted 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.710
 so he is relatively clear you can see 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.570
 just play here as well 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 Sectors and that's all 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.020
 a little bit r ps3 fans not quite 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.940
 other physics and so on the creature 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 is also fantastic again this is then 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.510
 afterwards such a mixture of a kind 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.930
 jump'n'run so do a little men 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.850
 moderate discussions and then posing has 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.350
 reveal that the creature so 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.700
 trike and in fact very cartier 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 should be controlled 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.380
 act very strongly in the context of the world 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.330
 it does not seem like it has it 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.640
 at least a fixed sentence 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.980
 at kommandos so come here and 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.380
 jump and that though I'll be honest 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.560
 must have looked at the demo so he waits 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.910
 on demand then argued and 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.910
 otherwise man jumps over it then 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.890
 dreamcatcher also to this 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.110
 Wind chimes because they seem then 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.310
 strikes to fix are the shine 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.440
 eyes at once, it's no longer possible 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.140
 then you have to dispose of it 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.370
 our big friend can continue and then 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.780
 helps you to stop almost always 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.810
 each other in this way 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.910
 Seen through the levels I am more total 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.280
 confessing fan of shadow of the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 colossus in particular and I'm down and 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.720
 It's awesome. It looks awesome 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.340
 from elaborate textures and the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.100
 technician not quite up-to-date will be very 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.600
 strained but a laptop sits 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.760
 again a bit good 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.290
 we played only said 2016 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.480
 They did not even want to leave spring 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.830
 or so set proof so if we 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.810
 now to see more of him again 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.310
 also get very controlled 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.930
 as they say there were only quite 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.630
 few questions admitted and then was 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.250
 immediately the roller'm back down very 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.060
 very curious when it goes on with it 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.060
 have seen what great
