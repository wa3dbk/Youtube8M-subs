00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
great defensively which we are used to

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.190

didn't<00:00:49.500> play<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.770> much<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> she<00:00:50.760> didn't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
didn't play so much in that she didn't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
play in the st. John's game and I think

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
play in the st. John's game and I think
they<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.610> learned<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.120> she<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> such<00:00:54.840> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
they all learned that she is such a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
they all learned that she is such a
vital<00:00:55.350> part<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.070> their<00:00:56.250> offense<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
vital part of their offense and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
vital part of their offense and
certainly<00:00:57.150> their<00:00:57.390> defense<00:00:57.810> but<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.050> emotion

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
certainly their defense but the emotion

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.440 
certainly their defense but the emotion
that<00:00:58.560> she<00:00:58.800> brings<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.310> floor<00:00:59.550> makes<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
that she brings to the floor makes a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.270 
that she brings to the floor makes a
huge<00:01:00.630> difference<00:01:00.900> for<00:01:01.110> them<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.920> was<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
huge difference for them so that was a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
huge difference for them so that was a
great<00:01:02.460> wake-up<00:01:02.820> call<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.530> season
