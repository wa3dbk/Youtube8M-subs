00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.370
 what to show you how easy it is 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.160
 connected to the mouse to a device 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.980
 android that has the possibility to do 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.480
 this you have the function tg will need 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.619
 of this cable here that turns micro usb 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 for normal usb this cable became cheap 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.790
 a cable liabilities has nothing in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.620
 yes and here I have a set of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 keyboard mouse and connects via usb case 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.739
 Do you have one that is this product? 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.860
 it is not protest here is an owner 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:56.340
 then asked if in case you have a 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.170
 bunch you do not need you can 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 simply connect to it voted because 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 As you can see, I have a 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:14.100
 mouse the senate is just like windows 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.700
 you do not need to have any if you can use 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 just a bad bit I connected like it was 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:34.530
 the first time you were connected 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 you never get her just for having nothing if not 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:45.780
 I mistake science before being the side 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 right mouse serves as back the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.790
 bak button and the when you press on the ball 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.420
 of mouse 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.189
 it should work as a menu button 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.170
 but now they all work with 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 button only then you can drag the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 things 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.549
 the keyboard also works perfectly 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.549
 have in the browser here 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:19.580
 the proposal will need to enter as soon as the 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:41.760
 reality works you do not need 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.550
 to configure in anything I that interesting 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.550
 it is also clear here how many have 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.600
 He's going to have painted with a smaller one. 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.910
 volume 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:23.430
 the volume does not work on the play button 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:31.470
 He started playing here, I can. 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:34.610
 control the music the music I made 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.610
 a call 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:58.350
 Can I go to an email that will ask the 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:59.820
 application I want and half have no 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.540
 problem 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:08.490
 after clicking the collect button 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:14.100
 I have to think that it is 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.329
 to put bernard 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.860
 he takes and does not own 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:26.710
 the unlocking is so the possession because here 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.629
 and hold on 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:34.060
 I have the normal menu and how are you 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.330
 you can see it 's like you're using the 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.330
 computer 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.710
 I have access to all the functions of the 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.639
 tablet 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.819
 I can handle the not working side 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.900
 Right-not but it is safe and I 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.560
 I can access all things from 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.560
 tablet 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:10.150
 You can see, it's taking the final touch. 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.729
 do not touch the a1 application 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.300
 another very really will find a 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:22.990
 application that does not expand to click 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:27.870
 mouse in development 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:35.080
 I have this option here that shows where the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:39.430
 on the screen and applying holding but he 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.550
 shows nothing then but who is here 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.270
 also show the coordinates 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.940
 but in this case it also shows the mouse 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.259
 then one application or another that does not 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.990
 will respond with mouse but almost all 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:01.919
 they will respond you can in the browser and 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.919
 use like a computer 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:30.430
 sui song and logically if you had the 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:36.840
 option I could could connect with the 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:39.810
 portable phone on monitor on tv 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:43.480
 but I can not do this with 117 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.520
 So, but this is something else is 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:49.000
 interesting you can buy the 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:54.850
 that comes with the small keyboard 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:57.100
 you bend over and that's it and you 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:04.170
 how this car here you can 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.170
 connect an external USB or flash drive 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.960
 if you had only connected a mouse without 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.860
 keyboard when typing something 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:20.170
 he appeared christmas keyboard can lead 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.970
 I did not accept that pendrive on it 17 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.660
 natively you need an application 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:27.270
 but this is not a problem 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.730
 You do not need this way here. 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:35.530
 anything sb you can use 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:37.900
 controls video game controls and I 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:44.700
 I'll make a video about it, the link will 

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:44.700
 have in the description and for everything and went
