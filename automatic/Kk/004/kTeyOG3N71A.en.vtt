5<00:00:18.680> spot<00:00:19.220> permanent<00:00:20.000> ball<00:00:20.300> system<00:00:21.610> has<00:00:22.610> a<00:00:22.970> one

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
5 spot permanent ball system has a one

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.210 
5 spot permanent ball system has a one
and<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.510> half<00:00:23.750> inch<00:00:23.930> ball<00:00:24.230> for<00:00:24.680> this<00:00:24.800> example

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
and a half inch ball for this example

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.330 
and a half inch ball for this example
there<00:00:26.030> is<00:00:26.210> also<00:00:26.390> a<00:00:26.660> version<00:00:27.110> of<00:00:27.440> this<00:00:27.770> with<00:00:28.160> a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
there is also a version of this with a

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.460 
there is also a version of this with a
one<00:00:28.850> inch<00:00:29.030> ball<00:00:29.330> which<00:00:29.600> is<00:00:29.810> for<00:00:30.080> mounting

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
one inch ball which is for mounting

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.180 
one inch ball which is for mounting
smaller<00:00:31.220> devices<00:00:31.580> like<00:00:31.820> gps's<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.689> things<00:00:33.190> so

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
smaller devices like gps's and things so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.120 
smaller devices like gps's and things so
the<00:00:35.030> part<00:00:35.329> with<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.630> one-inch<00:00:36.110> ball<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.770> part

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
the part with the one-inch ball is part

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.580 
the part with the one-inch ball is part
number<00:00:37.220> wrap<00:00:37.820> -<00:00:38.270> B<00:00:38.900> -<00:00:39.500> 1<00:00:39.920> 1<00:00:40.100> 4<00:00:40.430> -<00:00:40.670> 5<00:00:40.910> B<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:42.320> as

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
number wrap - B - 1 1 4 - 5 B so this as

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.250 
number wrap - B - 1 1 4 - 5 B so this as
again<00:00:43.010> as<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.730> said<00:00:43.790> again<00:00:44.090> is<00:00:44.360> a<00:00:44.390> 1/2<00:00:44.840> inch<00:00:44.960> ball

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
again as I said again is a 1/2 inch ball

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.930 
again as I said again is a 1/2 inch ball
but<00:00:45.470> I'm<00:00:45.560> going<00:00:45.680> to<00:00:45.710> use<00:00:45.770> this<00:00:46.010> as<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.280> example

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
but I'm going to use this as the example

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.020 
but I'm going to use this as the example
to<00:00:47.270> show<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:47.540> how<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:47.750> install<00:00:48.110> these<00:00:48.290> systems

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
to show you how to install these systems

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.080 
to show you how to install these systems
now<00:00:50.030> first<00:00:50.840> step<00:00:51.079> is<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.530> drop<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.160> nut<00:00:52.550> into

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
now first step is to drop this nut into

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.750 
now first step is to drop this nut into
the<00:00:53.239> head<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:54.140> ball<00:00:54.380> now<00:00:55.010> inside<00:00:55.399> this

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
the head of this ball now inside this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.380 
the head of this ball now inside this
hole<00:00:56.059> here<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:57.110> hex<00:00:57.620> hole<00:00:58.340> which<00:00:59.030> will<00:00:59.239> hold

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
hole here is a hex hole which will hold

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.420 
hole here is a hex hole which will hold
the<00:00:59.510> nut<00:00:59.750> perfectly<00:01:00.290> so<00:01:00.860> they<00:01:00.890> drop<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.309> in

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
the nut perfectly so they drop it in

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.299 
the nut perfectly so they drop it in
right<00:01:01.700> as<00:01:02.350> always<00:01:03.350> I'll<00:01:03.710> get<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> screwdriver

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
right as always I'll get a screwdriver

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.789 
right as always I'll get a screwdriver
and<00:01:04.729> just<00:01:05.360> flick<00:01:05.569> that<00:01:05.689> around<00:01:06.020> so<00:01:06.289> it<00:01:06.350> sits<00:01:06.619> in

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
and just flick that around so it sits in

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.340 
and just flick that around so it sits in
the<00:01:06.950> hole<00:01:07.189> properly<00:01:07.670> there<00:01:07.909> we<00:01:07.999> go<00:01:08.209> so<00:01:09.139> you<00:01:09.200> can

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
the hole properly there we go so you can

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.779 
the hole properly there we go so you can
see<00:01:09.560> now<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.799> nut<00:01:10.219> sitting<00:01:10.579> in<00:01:10.639> there

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
see now that nut sitting in there

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.449 
see now that nut sitting in there
perfectly<00:01:11.560> second<00:01:12.560> thing<00:01:12.679> I<00:01:12.740> need<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.009> do<00:01:13.189> is

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
perfectly second thing I need to do is

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.319 
perfectly second thing I need to do is
put<00:01:13.969> this<00:01:14.709> screw<00:01:15.709> through<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.429> washer<00:01:17.149> that

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
put this screw through the washer that

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.399 
put this screw through the washer that
comes<00:01:17.389> with<00:01:17.779> the<00:01:17.869> system

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
comes with the system

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.539 
comes with the system
now<00:01:19.219> we're<00:01:19.369> going<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:19.549> drag<00:01:19.789> over<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.779> spot<00:01:21.079> 5

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
now we're going to drag over the spot 5

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
base and you can see there the washer

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.550 
base and you can see there the washer
just<00:01:24.770> goes<00:01:25.729> over<00:01:26.179> that<00:01:26.209> hole<00:01:26.630> sits<00:01:27.350> right

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
just goes over that hole sits right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.489 
just goes over that hole sits right
there<00:01:27.619> on<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.520> one<00:01:28.759> here<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.899> we<00:01:30.289> now

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
have to tighten this up and line it all

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.029 
have to tighten this up and line it all
up<00:01:56.509> perfectly<00:01:57.109> so<00:01:57.200> right<00:01:57.619> now<00:01:57.770> I'm<00:01:57.889> just

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
tightening that screw on the bottom and

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.109 
tightening that screw on the bottom and
now<00:02:03.679> just<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.130> aware<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.429> when<00:02:04.609> you<00:02:04.880> tighten

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
now just be aware that when you tighten

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.419 
now just be aware that when you tighten
this<00:02:05.270> up<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:06.049> just<00:02:06.259> want<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.439> make<00:02:06.619> sure<00:02:06.649> that

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
you line up the flange on the ball line

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.750

then tighten up the last bit and there
we<00:02:24.049> go<00:02:24.349> there's<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.739> thread<00:02:25.250> threaded<00:02:26.030> bolt

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
we go there's the thread threaded bolt

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.449 
we go there's the thread threaded bolt
coming<00:02:26.450> through<00:02:26.840> but<00:02:27.709> now<00:02:27.860> we've<00:02:28.069> installed

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
coming through but now we've installed
