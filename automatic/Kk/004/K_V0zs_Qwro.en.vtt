00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 And then, my personal beauty is cream. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 this step involved a program of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.660
 cooking for those who like to put their hands 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.260
 in the mass and in the episode of today sauce 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.260
 curry 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.099
 Today I'm going to make the sugo sauce, which is one of the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.470
 greatest classics of italian cuisine 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.739
 for the sugo sauce we'll use two 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.010
 pounds of ripe tomatoes 200 grams of 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.180
 onion 100 grams of salt are and 100 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.489
 carrot grams 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.220
 this mixture of shrimp onion and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.010
 carrot is the so-called meire popular 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.780
 so let there will be no good not 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.899
 need to cut very small and good 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.910
 because we're going to hit the big eye at 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.239
 carrot the celery let's reserve this and 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.789
 Let's take the skin off the tomato. 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.039
 we do this the following way we go 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.050
 make a cross from the bottom of the tomato 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.050
 Let's take the eye out of the koopa tomato. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.759
 now I 've taken the tomato eye 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.850
 I made a cross beneath all I will 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.640
 throw them in boiling water leave the 30 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 seconds and in the sequence play the water 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.689
 for it to release into the skin and 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.689
 people got to take 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.189
 let's get that tomato in 4 also not 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.780
 needs to be small because we're going to 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.000
 hitting the eye is simply for 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.000
 make it easier to melt the 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.790
 sauce get ready faster and beauty 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.390

 in sequence add onion to carrot 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.239

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.989
 deserved to be able to play 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.610

 I do it in the same pot but you can 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.030
