00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that would mount on the wall and the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
that would mount on the wall and the
other<00:00:58.980> parent<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> bracket<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.120> mount

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
other parent is a bracket will mount

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
other parent is a bracket will mount
directly<00:01:00.570> onto<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> television<00:01:01.800> itself<00:01:02.070> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
directly onto the television itself so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.619 
directly onto the television itself so
let's<00:01:02.699> say<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> bracket<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
let's say the bracket is going to be

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
let's say the bracket is going to be
mounted<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.019> world<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.920> column<00:01:05.369> here

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
mounted in the world the column here

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.340 
mounted in the world the column here
we'll<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.030> those<00:01:06.210> arrows<00:01:06.570> pointing<00:01:06.990> upwards

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we'll see those arrows pointing upwards

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.870 
we'll see those arrows pointing upwards
so<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.740> city<00:01:08.010> mounted<00:01:08.400> with<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.729> way

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
so will our city mounted with this way

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
so will our city mounted with this way
up<00:01:09.030> however<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> square<00:01:10.590> it

up however you want to go to square it

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.710 
up however you want to go to square it

are two screws here as well I will use
that<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.509> mounting<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.930> bracket<00:01:25.380> onto<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
that for mounting this bracket onto the

that for mounting this bracket onto the
wall<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.490> fact<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.880> slop<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.479> gives<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
wall the fact that slop it gives it a

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350 
wall the fact that slop it gives it a
little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.290> ly<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.979> okay<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:30.240> that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
little bit ly way here okay so put that

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
screws with use for mounting this onto

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770 
screws with use for mounting this onto
the<00:01:37.890> wall<00:01:38.130> recent<00:01:38.850> space<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.750> well

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the wall recent space is here as well

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
the wall recent space is here as well
and<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.890> keeping<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> base<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and use that for keeping the base of the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
and use that for keeping the base of the
television<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.720> from<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> wall<00:01:43.259> okay<00:01:43.770> in

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
television out from the wall okay in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
television out from the wall okay in
terms<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> market

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
terms of market

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.910 
terms of market
straight<00:01:46.420> argument<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.500> back<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.830> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
straight argument and the back of the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.950 
straight argument and the back of the
wall<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.729> next<00:01:49.090> thing<00:01:49.240> there's<00:01:49.450> been<00:01:49.690> four

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
wall and next thing there's been four

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.070 
wall and next thing there's been four
screws<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.680> four<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.600> four<00:01:52.600> different<00:01:52.930> types

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
screws and four and four different types

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.430 
screws and four and four different types
of<00:01:53.670> bulls<00:01:54.670> here<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.299> basically<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.020> idea<00:01:56.049> in

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
of bulls here and basically the idea in

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.080 
of bulls here and basically the idea in
this<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.159> depending<00:01:57.729> of<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.880> visa

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
this is that depending of the visa

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.820 
this is that depending of the visa
standard<00:01:58.600> might<00:01:58.780> be<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.080> larger<00:01:59.470> ones<00:01:59.680> are

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
standard might be the larger ones are

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.889 
standard might be the larger ones are
smaller<00:02:00.250> ones<00:02:00.520> there's<00:02:01.000> washing<00:02:01.420> stuff<00:02:01.600> using

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
smaller ones there's washing stuff using

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.520 
smaller ones there's washing stuff using
the<00:02:02.110> judgment<00:02:02.590> romantic<00:02:03.159> okay<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.259> coma

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the judgment romantic okay so a coma

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.020 
the judgment romantic okay so a coma
anywhere<00:02:06.070> but<00:02:06.220> look<00:02:06.310> at<00:02:06.399> the<00:02:06.460> bracket<00:02:06.850> here

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
anywhere but look at the bracket here

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.370 
anywhere but look at the bracket here
that<00:02:07.270> will<00:02:07.450> use<00:02:07.600> for<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.930> bolting<00:02:08.319> on

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
that will use for a bolting on

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
thing here is we'll see here if we cover

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.229 
thing here is we'll see here if we cover
on<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.130> will<00:02:45.310> see<00:02:45.580> that<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:45.850> have<00:02:45.880> a<00:02:46.000> start

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
on I will see that we have a start

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.940 
on I will see that we have a start
locking<00:02:46.480> mechanism<00:02:47.200> here<00:02:47.380> went<00:02:47.590> straight

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
locking mechanism here went straight

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.979 
locking mechanism here went straight
from<00:02:48.190> them<00:02:48.459> if<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.030> come<00:02:49.209> around<00:02:49.329> we<00:02:49.690> pull<00:02:49.959> a

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
from them if we come around we pull a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.680 
from them if we come around we pull a
heavily<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.920> string<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:52.239> can<00:02:52.390> pull<00:02:52.630> it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
heavily on this string we can pull it

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.750 
heavily on this string we can pull it
down<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.140> it's<00:02:53.260> not<00:02:53.380> laughing<00:02:53.829> anymore<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.579> if

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
down so it's not laughing anymore and if

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.729 
down so it's not laughing anymore and if
a<00:02:54.850> release<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.239> back<00:02:55.360> up<00:02:55.600> we<00:02:56.260> can<00:02:56.410> see<00:02:56.530> there's

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
a release it back up we can see there's

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.530 
a release it back up we can see there's
a<00:02:56.799> catch<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.430> I'll<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:58.030> able<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> catch<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
a catch here I'll be able to catch it

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.750 
a catch here I'll be able to catch it
quite<00:02:58.750> well<00:02:58.959> so<00:02:59.709> what<00:02:59.920> would<00:03:00.010> happen<00:03:00.070> here<00:03:00.610> is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
quite well so what would happen here is

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.310 
quite well so what would happen here is
we<00:03:00.940> could<00:03:01.060> call<00:03:01.299> out<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:03.600> we<00:03:04.600> would<00:03:04.750> grab<00:03:04.989> this

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
mechanism here as well where it's

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.420
