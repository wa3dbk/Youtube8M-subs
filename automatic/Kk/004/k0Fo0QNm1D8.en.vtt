nice it's really easy to use and it was
also<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.150> bargain<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.230> rehydrate<00:03:43.739> my<00:03:44.070> skin<00:03:44.430> i

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
also a bargain to rehydrate my skin i

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.789 
also a bargain to rehydrate my skin i
use<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.209> hydro<00:03:45.660> neuron<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.500> has<00:03:46.620> got

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
use the hydro neuron this has got

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.340 
use the hydro neuron this has got
hyaluronic<00:03:47.280> acid<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> which<00:03:48.360> helps<00:03:48.840> your

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
hyaluronic acid in it which helps your

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.289 
hyaluronic acid in it which helps your
skin<00:03:49.380> retain<00:03:50.010> water<00:03:50.519> I<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:50.850> it's<00:03:51.120> about<00:03:51.180> a

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
skin retain water I think it's about a

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.600 
skin retain water I think it's about a
thousand<00:03:51.840> times<00:03:51.989> much<00:03:52.350> more<00:03:52.590> water<00:03:52.799> so

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
thousand times much more water so

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
thousand times much more water so
basically<00:03:54.000> when<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.239> drink<00:03:54.480> water

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
basically when you drink water

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.910 
basically when you drink water
throughout<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.959> day<00:03:55.080> when<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.650> apply

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
throughout the day when you apply

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.979 
throughout the day when you apply
moisturizer<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.700> skin<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.720> work

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
moisturizer to skin it's going to work

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.110 
moisturizer to skin it's going to work
so<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.010> much<00:03:59.040> betters<00:03:59.580> it's<00:03:59.820> going<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.000> keep

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
so so much betters it's going to keep

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.570 
so so much betters it's going to keep
