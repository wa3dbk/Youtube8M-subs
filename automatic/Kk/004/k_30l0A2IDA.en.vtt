and all of the ceramic tiles these were
very<00:00:29.660> carefully<00:00:30.200> made<00:00:30.439> in<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.800> past<00:00:31.040> and

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
very carefully made in the past and

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.710 
very carefully made in the past and
applied<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:31.970> roof<00:00:32.150> they're<00:00:32.360> very<00:00:32.540> heavy

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
applied to the roof they're very heavy

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.270 
applied to the roof they're very heavy
and<00:00:33.020> very<00:00:33.050> durable<00:00:33.410> they<00:00:33.680> last<00:00:33.950> a<00:00:34.070> long<00:00:34.250> time

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
and very durable they last a long time

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.729 
and very durable they last a long time
and<00:00:35.270> in<00:00:35.720> fact<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.989> lasts<00:00:36.170> longer<00:00:36.470> than<00:00:36.500> most

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
and in fact the lasts longer than most

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.800 
and in fact the lasts longer than most
houses<00:00:37.060> and<00:00:38.060> you<00:00:38.180> can<00:00:38.300> see<00:00:38.420> that<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.660> house

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
houses and you can see that the house

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.420 
houses and you can see that the house
itself<00:00:39.140> is<00:00:39.260> beginning<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.710> fall<00:00:39.890> apart<00:00:39.920> the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
itself is beginning to fall apart the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.369 
itself is beginning to fall apart the
wood<00:00:40.609> is<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:40.789> buckling<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:41.539> places<00:00:41.930> up<00:00:42.109> here

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
wood is that buckling in places up here

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.170 
wood is that buckling in places up here
and<00:00:42.769> it<00:00:43.129> won't<00:00:43.219> be<00:00:43.370> up<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.579> much<00:00:43.699> longer<00:00:44.059> before

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
and it won't be up to much longer before

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.119 
and it won't be up to much longer before
this<00:00:44.390> house<00:00:44.570> will<00:00:44.840> eventually<00:00:45.739> be<00:00:45.800> torn<00:00:46.070> down

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
this house will eventually be torn down

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.849 
this house will eventually be torn down
but<00:00:46.910> the<00:00:47.149> roof<00:00:47.510> tiles<00:00:47.780> will<00:00:47.989> likely<00:00:48.199> outlast

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
but the roof tiles will likely outlast

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.040 
but the roof tiles will likely outlast
the<00:00:49.070> house<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.030> what<00:00:50.179> do<00:00:50.269> people<00:00:50.449> do<00:00:50.690> with<00:00:50.870> the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
the house so what do people do with the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.279 
the house so what do people do with the
old<00:00:51.440> roof<00:00:51.679> tiles<00:00:51.949> after<00:00:52.429> they've<00:00:53.289> discarded

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
old roof tiles after they've discarded

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:56.529 
old roof tiles after they've discarded
them<00:00:54.530> with<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.710> house<00:00:54.890> but<00:00:55.789> typically<00:00:56.239> they

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
them with the house but typically they

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.389 
them with the house but typically they
can<00:00:56.750> find<00:00:57.019> some<00:00:57.230> other<00:00:57.379> use<00:00:57.589> for<00:00:57.620> them<00:00:57.949> such<00:00:58.190> as

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
can find some other use for them such as

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.500 
can find some other use for them such as
using<00:00:58.609> them<00:00:59.620> in<00:01:00.620> landscaping<00:01:01.519> and<00:01:02.239> what<00:01:02.390> we

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
using them in landscaping and what we

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.320 
using them in landscaping and what we
have<00:01:02.719> right<00:01:02.749> here<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:04.030> basically<00:01:05.030> a<00:01:05.120> little

have right here is a basically a little

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.320 
have right here is a basically a little
bit<00:01:05.540> gutter<00:01:05.780> this<00:01:06.620> is<00:01:06.800> a<00:01:06.830> little<00:01:07.820> trough<00:01:08.060> for

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
bit gutter this is a little trough for

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.090 
bit gutter this is a little trough for
water<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.720> flow<00:01:08.930> through<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.770> can<00:01:09.920> see

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
water to flow through and you can see

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.210 
water to flow through and you can see
that<00:01:10.250> along<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.700> edge<00:01:10.820> here<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.220> funny

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
a look and see how they extend up all

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.030 
a look and see how they extend up all
the<00:01:40.400> way<00:01:40.490> along<00:01:40.730> through<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.680> keep
