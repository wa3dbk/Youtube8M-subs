00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.690
 I welcome the viewers of the channel to repair 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.980
 iphone 5s indiscretion does not work 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.119
 touchscreen 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.630
 telephone after such a service center 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:21.029
 where as a repair they tried to warm up 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.330
 two chips responsible for the work 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.199
 touchscreen in 12 of which 14 resulting in 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:35.900
 pick it up and show now 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:38.370
 creative does not work got out the balls and 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.320
 even if mom got out of the ball 100 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
 processor threat like at work yet 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 it did not affect at all you need 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.000
 try to replace these chips 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.879
 because now I'll show the microcircuit 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.949
 skated clean the compound probably here 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.120
 still do something in general and they have 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.399
 chipped best not to 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.609
 experiment with reinstalling 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.420
 back and forth 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.090
 chips because the processor is real 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:16.099
 quite dangerously changing video for 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.050
 microcircuit 12 and 14 2 pairs I'm already rolling 

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:24.160
 microcircuits 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.160
 Well, I'll be worth the lead 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.790
 because she has no heart is enough 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.510
 scary to block the process 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.510
 general look further 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:14.660
 two days after the first part 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:18.950
 this repair will comprehend the problem 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.930
 IC chip 12 driver touchscreen 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:26.550
 all the party I bought in china 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.130
 It turned out to be non-working 5 pieces of microcircuits 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.830
 I've had all worked with whatever 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.750
 defects did not work 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.890
 vertical stripes there then there after all 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.130
 tried to reinstall everything for a long time 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:46.940
 I could not figure out what the reasons for 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.840
 eventually removed the kit from the raft donor 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.160
 put 12 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.329
 obviously working on the shop and all 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.579
 earned now show too soon as 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.970
 report that light 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.970
 the repair was successful 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.210
 so stop the phone 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.380
 while the phone turns on 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.819
 the most problem with this repair is that 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.020
 the processes is in extremely close to 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:33.240
 IC chip and very difficult 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:38.599
 By the way, I had to replace it. 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.330
 microcircuit 5 without losing which costs 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.910
 a roundabout at the su-14 exit because 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.289
 the guys who repaired the phone you me 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.599
 somehow managed 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:54.320
 stewed on them by the same to themselves 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:59.009
 microcircuits and coil actively pulled 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:06.289
 all phone and works differently 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:11.930
 brightness is not a classic check 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.930
 poelozit icon desktop 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.389
 everything is working 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:23.180
 I hope it was interesting informative 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.900
 repair in advance advice if you 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.919
 going to change and chips 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:34.099
 stock up a bundle of knowingly working for 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.080
 checking your horn that here I didn't have 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.979
 obviously working because i always 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:42.110
 relied on your supplier because 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.970
 that chips have always come very 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.699
 good quality and try without 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:51.650
 problems well applied 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:55.360
 anything was interesting here
