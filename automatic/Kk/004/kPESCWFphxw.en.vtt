00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.839
 with me I have you last time the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.059
 invisible pens presented a pen 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.469
 can with the letter and 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 then with a small lamp 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.059
 can shine on it and without this lamp 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.699
 you really do not see anything that is 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.720
 a pen for secret messages and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.859
 I want to play a little bit today 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.250
 to do with you 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.960
 I write something down and then have to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.510
 Guess what I wrote down and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 to write that in the comments 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.309
 and if you have it right then you have 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 the chance to win two investments 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.120
 So then you can with your friends 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.489
 to try that at home 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 First of all , I'll write something down here 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.129
 Second, you have to write down what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.930
 I wrote down in the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.440
 comments but not imprints at the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.050
 but look at it yourself and who it is 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.030
 right then has the chance two 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 to win invisible pence 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can also go to the 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.000
 Write comments like you generally do 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 the invisible pence finds and which 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 you would like to have color you have last 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.439
 Let's see there are pink blue and yellow 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.760
 green yes write that up with and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.760
 now it starts right 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.219
 Did you pay attention to what I wrote 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 I wrote very quickly 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:30.450
 so that is a bit difficult 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.119
 and you really do not see anything here 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.880
 the sheet thanks to my invisible 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.649
 pen but who has recognized anyway 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.479
 what I have written down writes 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.490
 that just below in the comments 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.100
 and I'm really curious if you like it 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.990
 could recognize could recognize like me 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 have written 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 if yes, just write it down 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.659
 purely in the video is a thumb after 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.530
 above 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.079
 share the video with your friends 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.720
 Maybe they also want to guess and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.439
 has only really then has the opportunity 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.209
 I gain two invisible pence 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.280
 I'll be in one of my next 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.190
 videos that dissolve here 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.289
 You can attend until the next one 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.260
 Thursday 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.150

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.010
 resolution comes and then I give you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.140

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.760
 play in this little win game 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.970
 this little guessing game 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.980
 and if you like this goal 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.690

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.630

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.280
 video a thumbs up 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.299
 look at our other videos and us 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.549
 See you again next time 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.530
 Bye oh yes I still have one 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.019
 little tip for you on the self 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.239
 inspiration and of the self inspiration 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.730
 I'll also be kids club two 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.470
 invisible penz indiscriminate so who his 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.450
 wants to increase chance then have 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.910
 Of course, still participate 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.099
 just pass my other channels over there 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.639
 Of course, I will become more different 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.739
 So think it out is not that easy 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.450
 As you think you can not just do it 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.010
 below write in the comments 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.019
 but you have to look again 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.739
 which I understood written there 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.660
 have 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.430
 or what sentence I wrote down 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.049
 and then you can do that again 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.660
 participate and maybe you will have 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.579
 the luck on one of my channels this 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.329

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.329
 bye
