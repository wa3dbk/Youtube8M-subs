00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 to see but anything she 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.500
 need or emit light directly as the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 sun an incandescent lamp the firefly 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 or have photons of light hitting it 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.070
 and reflecting towards our eyes 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 but as we see the light itself 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 you can not fill light in the light like that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 as you can not remove two waves of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 a spring or in the water they pass straight through 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.650
 one by the other and also see a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 light focus in normal day to day mode 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 means that your eye or camera or 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.360
 photodetector will absorb it and so it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.250
 is going to be destroyed annihilated 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.809
 it's like you want to test how much 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.559
 weight a bridge holds before 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.510
 collapse 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.250
 once you have measured you win 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.730
 information they wanted only that does not 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.230
 plus the bridge so as to see the light 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 we need a non-destructive test 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.100
 One way to do this is to build 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.989
 a super-dark super-cool box and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 cover your interior with a very 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.399
 very bright so perfectly 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 reflective light and kochi photons 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 back to front 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 more than a billion times before 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.629
 be absorbed in this interval they 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.760
 have traveled an equivalent distance 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.250
 one around the earth 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 this box is also so cold and dark that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 only once in a while will there be a photon 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.810
 inside it and if there really is one like 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
 we can state without destroying it well but 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 we sent an act through the box an act 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.350
 in a two state superposition 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.159
 different from the cat's 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.990
 restinga 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.090
 if there is no photo inside the box 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.490
 mirrored when the act does not leave the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.079
 other side will most likely start 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 being in one of the states 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.380
 let's call him dead but if at one 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.450
 photon inside and we send it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.490
 carefully the atom so that it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.700
 it does not destroy or photon the interactions 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 atom photon change the chances so now 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.170
 an almost certain chance of seeing the atom 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.240
 I live after crossing some 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 atoms if the vast majority are in the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 been alive then we will know that the 1 photo 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 the box and if you are dead or a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 photon is similar to command a weathervane 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.710
 by a darkroom if it exits the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.869
 other side spinning 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.280
 You know the wind is blowing. 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.469
 without wind to dengue 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.450
 in fact we knew that there is a photon 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.489
 inside we can use this technique of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.630
 measure and manipulate other 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.190
 properties of the photon we can see how much 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.650
 it's time to acknowledge having back to 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.020
 before being absorbed verify 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.910
 whether it is in overlap or even force 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.320
 you to enter into your position as the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.900
 Nobody's own cat 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.970
 so we can not only see the light as 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.310
 we can now use the 4 watering to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.850
 measuring the cat turns off the cats action 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.850
 quantum 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.690
 Hmm
