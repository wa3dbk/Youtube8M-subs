so the performance has been a okay thus
far<00:02:00.950> now<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.520> throw<00:02:03.469> the<00:02:04.469> throw<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:05.329> medium

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
far now the throw the throw is medium

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.479 
far now the throw the throw is medium
strong<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> lot<00:02:07.320> stronger<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
strong it was a lot stronger on the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.040 
strong it was a lot stronger on the
first<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> second<00:02:09.179> day<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.959> you

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
first and second day but then as it you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.180 
first and second day but then as it you
know<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> burned<00:02:10.649> down<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:12.239> know

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
know kind of burned down and you know

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.610 
know kind of burned down and you know
just<00:02:13.370> kind<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.880> didn't<00:02:14.570> really<00:02:14.780> dissipate<00:02:15.320> but

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
just kind of didn't really dissipate but

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.280 
just kind of didn't really dissipate but
it's<00:02:16.550> definitely<00:02:16.910> not<00:02:17.210> strong<00:02:17.510> as<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.780> was<00:02:17.810> I

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
