00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:21.329
 material needed monomer varnish to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.509
 plaster spatulas at 6.1 strawberry cutter ready 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.630
 would ultimately show a bottom of the paper 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.630
 of glass 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 hydrate your a model in water 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:44.730
 for two minutes isolate your model 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.760
 using flat blown varnish 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.100
 the excess of polish trace the boundaries 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.700
 door borrows with a pencil 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700
 gorce 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.450
 take a resin plate 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.420
 apply the plate on the model 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.130
 cut off the excess resin using 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.130
 of the spatula put to the limits 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.100
 high school the resin using the monomer 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.290
 formed a bead of resin and place the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.290
 on the ridge 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.300
 place the model in the device 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.440
 close the lid turn on 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.440
 for six minutes 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.880
 six minutes later turn off 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.880
 the device then take out the model 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.330
 raised the door imprints of the model 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.970
 return the door prints and photos 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.090
 polymerized again for two 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.090
 minutes 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:07.829
 two minutes later turn off 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:20.129
 the device go out the snow model I 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:23.810
 will not make resin beards and graffiti 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.810
 and the dead and m limits 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.019
 effects on the resin bead 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:44.760
 decrease the height of the body gives to 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.950
 using a fine resin bur to make 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.950
 retentions in the form of tube down 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.120
 sandpaper paper using the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.120
 expected world
