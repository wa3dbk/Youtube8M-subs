there's<00:03:43.750> two<00:03:43.870> ways<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.170> looking<00:03:44.230> at<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.709> when

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
there's two ways of looking at it when

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.860 
there's two ways of looking at it when
you're<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:44.980> home<00:03:45.250> base<00:03:45.489> in<00:03:45.849> an<00:03:46.359> arena<00:03:46.750> like

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
you're on home base in an arena like

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.420 
you're on home base in an arena like
this<00:03:47.230> one<00:03:47.439> is<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.769> it's<00:03:47.889> going<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.129> be<00:03:48.219> big

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
this one is that it's going to be big

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.610 
this one is that it's going to be big
pressure<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:49.209> going<00:03:49.420> to<00:03:49.510> pull<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.409> down

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
pressure and it's going to pull you down

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.250 
pressure and it's going to pull you down
but<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.519> case<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.659> as<00:03:52.810> though<00:03:52.959> it<00:03:53.200> was

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
but in this case this as though it was

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.020 
but in this case this as though it was
just<00:03:53.439> a<00:03:53.500> practice<00:03:53.889> session<00:03:54.099> but<00:03:54.459> really

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
just a practice session but really

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.750 
just a practice session but really

execution<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.519> transitions<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.539> particular

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
execution that transitions in particular

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.050 
execution that transitions in particular
Simon<00:04:20.349> from<00:04:20.799> one<00:04:21.009> thing<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.459> other<00:04:21.579> that

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
Simon from one thing to the other that

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.779 
Simon from one thing to the other that
the<00:04:22.449> jumps<00:04:22.840> did<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:23.260> occur<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:23.979> stop<00:04:24.460> point

so flowing through them is what the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.560 
so flowing through them is what the
judges<00:04:27.310> are<00:04:27.550> wanting<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:27.970> see<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.479> the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
judges are wanting to see that the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.750 
judges are wanting to see that the
elements<00:04:28.990> are<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.320> but<00:04:30.039> done<00:04:30.370> as<00:04:30.610> though

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
elements are there but done as though

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.879 
elements are there but done as though
they're<00:04:31.000> effortless<00:04:31.659> and<00:04:31.900> they<00:04:32.110> flow<00:04:32.500> through

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
they're effortless and they flow through

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.339 
they're effortless and they flow through
and<00:04:33.159> there's<00:04:33.430> ease<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:34.060> them<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:34.810> was<00:04:35.050> so

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
and there's ease to them and that was so

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.140 
and there's ease to them and that was so
well<00:04:35.590> demonstrated<00:04:36.190> through<00:04:36.520> every<00:04:37.120> element

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
well demonstrated through every element

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:48.610 
well demonstrated through every element
here<00:04:38.159> here's<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.690> thing<00:04:40.690> combination

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.370 

slightly<00:04:49.460> under<00:04:50.090> rotated<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.630> second<00:04:51.139> part<00:04:51.290> of

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
slightly under rotated on second part of

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.870 
slightly under rotated on second part of
the<00:04:51.470> jump<00:04:51.680> so<00:04:51.800> the<00:04:51.830> grade<00:04:52.100> of<00:04:52.220> execution<00:04:52.310> would

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
the jump so the grade of execution would

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.610 
the jump so the grade of execution would
go<00:04:53.030> down<00:04:53.240> there<00:04:53.449> maybe<00:04:53.630> point<00:04:53.870> one<00:04:54.139> maybe<00:04:54.380> for

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
go down there maybe point one maybe for

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.710 
go down there maybe point one maybe for
two<00:04:54.830> here's<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.610> loop<00:04:56.500> no<00:04:57.500> problems<00:04:58.010> there

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
two here's the loop no problems there

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.300
