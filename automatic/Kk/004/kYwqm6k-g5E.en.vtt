00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.099
 Hey, my name is daniel bernal. 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'm the owner of aurus studio here today. 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'll talk to you a little bit about 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.619
 impulse responses these impulses are 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 small transients that carry 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.010
 frequency response information 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.740
 and the decay of these frequencies 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.579
 through software with volution is 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.739
 can import these impulses and has 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.570
 information on the response of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 frequency of a new guitar line 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.300
 for example or any equipment 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 amplifiers and it is also possible to 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.230
 recreating the acoustic characteristics of 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 a room or any environment 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.640
 in these places are past some uip that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.699
 goes from 20 to 20 km2 through software 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.010
 and consolation is that information is 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.229
 transformed into a small boost 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.650
 when you care that momentum inside 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.119
 of a convolution software 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 can recreate all the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.189
 acoustic characteristics of the room in which 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 was recorded the advantage of this is that 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.049
 can you have, for example, the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 reverberation of the taj mahal or the great 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.689
 that no software tries without 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.600
 access that location 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.549
 and you can also get answers from 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.880
 expensive guitar cabinets from a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.369
 over size of the table bug for example and that's it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.070
 put your own player before and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.840
 digitally recreate this case 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 to get that sound that was 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.360
 searching 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.820
 Now I'll show you a guitar. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 heavy metal that I recorded with the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.189
 impulse that I made myself based on the sound 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.750
 of one of these bands of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.390
 modern metal 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.880
 so let's take a little nudge with nothing 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.880
 just for you to hear the guitar sound 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.560
 now I'll get a plugin here to show 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.290
 for you will take your foot if what I 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600
 I did import my impulse here. 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.370
 within this convolution module are that 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.810
 have in pv revolver 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.570
 so what he's going to do is recreate 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.270
 frequency response that I recorded 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.360
 my box and then I went back to 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.739
 to be similar to one of these 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:44.000
 modern metal 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:47.850
 I put it here to increase the gain 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 of this buggy simulation and soon in 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.130
 then I put it up with a solution now 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.790
 Let's have a listen in the result of 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.790
 all this 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.610
 The cool thing is that often the sound that the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.370
 people through these impulses is 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.209
 more real than many simulations that 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.049
 have software of this type piv or some 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.870
 wise amplitube they use is 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.120
 equalization and not with 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.760
 arrive at the final result 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.819
 so you can even put a 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.900
 Amplitube amplifier nail and then 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.879
 the revolver 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.060
 only using this module of 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.329
 consolation are to see the result 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.950
 I recorded the guitar twice using the 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.349
 same momentum 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.329
 Only I changed to set the mood 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.940
 just a little bit different 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.620
 You can see that both of us are 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.620
 practically everything at zero here 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.280
 why the equalization comes from the impulse that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 I'm putting so many times only 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.340
 that will not make so much difference in 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.590
 final result 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.690
 plug and play type is ready 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.500
 placed touched and did not need even 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.580
 right 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.340
 then you will only have to give 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.709
 tidy because of the others 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.790
 instruments but the sound alone is already 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.310
 ready 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.310
 Let's see now on the stereo. 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:46.110
 now I'm going to put the other instruments 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.110
 mixing for us to see how it looks 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.270
 Good, people, class was short today but I 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.800
 I'll make this 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.960
 impulse that I did 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.260
 just enter your site 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.240
 send a short e-mail too the page 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.410
 from facebook sign up for the 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.770
 youtube 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.660
 I respond to you with the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.030
 attached in the mail 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.030
 that's it, do not forget that you 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.510
 You'll need a plugin to get 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.790
 this impulse some free to the 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.620
 internet is very easy to find 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.620
 thanks a hug
