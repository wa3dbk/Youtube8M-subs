00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.080
 hello how about youtube friends good them 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.660
 we speak well in this new tutorial 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.990
 we will learn how to eliminate all kinds 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.330
 of virus in a general way 100% safe 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.420
 for our computer for this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 we will use an antivirus that brings a 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 function that is a scan before the 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.040
 boot I do not know if all 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 antivirus bring this function but the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 that does bring it and I manage it and it's very 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.199
 complete is the abbas stream comes in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.580
 free way and in way of pay this 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.460
 is the free version that I 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.549
 handling this is the antivirus that brings 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.559
 this function of doing a scan before 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:51.960
 of the boot well once you already 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.170
 have installed on their computers 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 let's start with this tutorial well 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.580
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 open our antivirus our avast 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.339
 streep and we are going to address the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 tab that says analysis in this 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.450
 box we are going to choose the option 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:16.259
 which says analysis during startup 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.750
 to give it start we will appear a 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.689
 I insert a notice where it tells us that if 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 we want to restart the computer now I 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 I'm doing nothing because we're going to give it 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.539
 that if we give it and if it is going to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 restarting our computer will start at 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.610
 Normally load our computer and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.100
 well here until doing the scan in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.860
 our computer before it starts 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.020
 our windows before the start of the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.539
 operating system here is already doing 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.439
 scanning in all local units 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:52.229
 and well let's wait for the analysis can 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:56.340
 last up to an hour or if not more 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.250
 since they are here analyzing our 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.759
 computer completely here we 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.599
 gives the report of how much is 1% 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.349
 then let's wait and well here already 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:13.290
 has scanned and found that we already have 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.630
 the first virus that has come out here we 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.680
 gives a series of things that we can 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.010
 do is eliminate it 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.159
 and correct it or ignore it here what I 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.430
 I recommend that you select the 6 that 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.590
 is to eliminate everything so they do not have this 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.579
 problem of this virus simply 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.150
 press key 6 and it automatically goes 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:40.810
 to eliminate that annoying virus will continue with 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.659
 the scan normally and simply 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.090
 we have to wait and good once 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.489
 I have finished scanning in 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 our computer automatically 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.829
 is going to restart our computer and 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.500
 now if you are going to start our windows the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.359
 that we have and in this way they are going to 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.090
 feel a little faster in our 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.639
 computer because it does not have any 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.400
 virus is no longer already completely 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.849
 clean of any virus and this is the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.489
 best way to eliminate a virus from 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.400
 our computer I hope this little one 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.780
