I<00:01:09.439> think<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.649> of<00:01:10.679> the<00:01:10.799> greatest<00:01:11.070> things<00:01:11.399> about

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
I think one of the greatest things about

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.669 
I think one of the greatest things about
super<00:01:12.149> handles<00:01:12.509> is<00:01:12.979> he's<00:01:13.979> not<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> player

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
super handles is he's not in me a player

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.520 
super handles is he's not in me a player
but<00:01:16.679> he's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> fraud<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.700> true<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
but he's a fraud that's true so I think

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.730 
but he's a fraud that's true so I think
kids<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.340> identify<00:01:20.429> with<00:01:21.240> him<00:01:21.420> more<00:01:21.740> because

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
kids can identify with him more because

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.959 
kids can identify with him more because
you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:23.759> closer<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.149> their<00:01:24.450> level<00:01:28.969> they
