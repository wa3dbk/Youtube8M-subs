in<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.000> past<00:04:20.090> in<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.750> lot<00:04:20.930> of<00:04:20.959> my<00:04:21.229> products<00:04:21.769> and

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:22.009 
in the past in a lot of my products and

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.939 
in the past in a lot of my products and
one<00:04:22.910> thing<00:04:23.150> is<00:04:23.330> fatty<00:04:23.660> acid<00:04:24.139> fatty<00:04:24.440> acid

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
one thing is fatty acid fatty acid

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.060 
one thing is fatty acid fatty acid
oxidation<00:04:26.259> chlorogenic<00:04:27.259> acid<00:04:27.740> is<00:04:27.830> sudden<00:04:28.039> I

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
oxidation chlorogenic acid is sudden I

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.770 
oxidation chlorogenic acid is sudden I
believe<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.430> green<00:04:28.610> coffee<00:04:28.880> bean<00:04:29.210> I<00:04:29.449> used<00:04:29.660> in

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
believe in green coffee bean I used in

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960 
believe in green coffee bean I used in
the<00:04:29.870> past<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.320> some<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.500> my<00:04:30.560> products<00:04:31.009> choline

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
the past and some of my products choline

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.210 
the past and some of my products choline
here's<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.930> reason<00:04:33.229> it's<00:04:33.440> an<00:04:33.620> alpha<00:04:34.039> mean

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
here's the reason it's an alpha mean

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.050 
here's the reason it's an alpha mean
it's<00:04:35.000> because<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:36.169> formula<00:04:36.770> lasts<00:04:37.550> longer

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
it's because the formula lasts longer

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.600 
it's because the formula lasts longer
and<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.419> much<00:04:38.720> smoother<00:04:39.500> with<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.979> and<00:04:40.160> then

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
and is much smoother with it and then

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.400 
and is much smoother with it and then
for<00:04:40.789> lean<00:04:41.030> mass<00:04:41.240> preservation<00:04:41.930> again<00:04:42.169> in<00:04:42.320> a
