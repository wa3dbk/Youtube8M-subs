speed<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> don't<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.319> but<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
speed I don't know but you know the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
speed I don't know but you know the
balls<00:02:02.909> were<00:02:03.030> definitely<00:02:03.329> flying<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.840> there

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
balls were definitely flying out there

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.609 
balls were definitely flying out there
they<00:02:05.009> weren't<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.429> most<00:02:05.549> heavy-duty<00:02:06.619> thing

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
they weren't the most heavy-duty thing

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.339 
they weren't the most heavy-duty thing
so<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.030> problem<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.140> want

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
so then the problem is this you you want

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.259 
so then the problem is this you you want
to<00:02:10.470> do<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.890> well<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> want<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> be<00:02:12.030> right

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
to do so well and you want to be right

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.120 
to do so well and you want to be right
and<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.049> you<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.290> tentative<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:13.950> try

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and so you get tentative because you try

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.009 
and so you get tentative because you try
to<00:02:14.160> keep<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.579> ball<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.000> court<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.450> work

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
to keep the ball on the court and work

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080 
to keep the ball on the court and work
into<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.290> rhythm<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.130> more<00:02:17.700> attend<00:02:17.940> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
into a rhythm with the more attend the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.089 
into a rhythm with the more attend the
tentative<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.290> harder<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.040> to

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
tentative you get the harder it is to

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.800 
tentative you get the harder it is to
sort<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.519> control<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.030> almost<00:02:21.239> have<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.480> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
sort of control you almost have to just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.589 
sort of control you almost have to just
forget<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.099> let<00:02:23.519> loose<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.120> let<00:02:24.510> it

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
forget it and let loose and just let it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.110 
forget it and let loose and just let it
go<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.260> never<00:02:25.769> quite<00:02:26.040> found<00:02:26.849> that

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
go and I never quite found that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
go and I never quite found that
particularly<00:02:27.540> stride<00:02:27.989> but<00:02:28.290> uh<00:02:28.349> but<00:02:28.799> had<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.129> few

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
particularly stride but uh but had a few

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.670 
particularly stride but uh but had a few
moments<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.650> was

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
moments of it so it was a that was

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.479 
moments of it so it was a that was
enough<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> feel<00:02:32.340> good<00:02:33.799> we<00:02:34.799> relived<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.280> lot<00:02:35.400> of

enough to feel good we relived a lot of

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:36.949

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.920 

some<00:02:46.000> people<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.450> same<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:49.480> had<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> lot<00:02:49.900> of

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
career and there was a lot of times we

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.420 
career and there was a lot of times we
played<00:02:58.540> where<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.050> us<00:02:59.260> was<00:02:59.590> just<00:02:59.620> on<00:03:00.160> their

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
played where one of us was just on their

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.040 
played where one of us was just on their
game<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.970> other<00:03:01.000> one<00:03:01.300> was<00:03:01.480> slightly<00:03:01.780> off

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
game and the other one was slightly off

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.820 
game and the other one was slightly off
and<00:03:02.260> as<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.410> result<00:03:02.770> it<00:03:03.550> was<00:03:03.790> almost<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.830> protocol

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
and as a result it was almost a protocol

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.140 
and as a result it was almost a protocol
to<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.130> through<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> motions<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.910> just

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to go through the motions of just

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.580 
to go through the motions of just
beating<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.570> other<00:03:07.630> one<00:03:07.960> who<00:03:08.110> there's<00:03:08.290> these

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
beating the other one who there's these

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.080 
beating the other one who there's these
moments<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.160> then<00:03:09.250> very<00:03:09.490> rarely<00:03:09.820> do<00:03:10.060> we

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
moments and then very rarely do we

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.240 
moments and then very rarely do we
really<00:03:10.420> both<00:03:10.690> play<00:03:11.440> our<00:03:11.590> best<00:03:11.860> tennis<00:03:12.930> against

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
really both play our best tennis against

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.960 
really both play our best tennis against

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
spectacular and I thought that happened

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.250 
spectacular and I thought that happened
in<00:03:18.040> New<00:03:18.160> York<00:03:18.370> with<00:03:19.210> those<00:03:19.360> four<00:03:19.540> breakers<00:03:20.020> and

in New York with those four breakers and

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.650 
in New York with those four breakers and
that<00:03:20.740> such<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> special<00:03:21.520> special<00:03:21.820> moment<00:03:22.540> we

that such a special special moment we

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.500 
that such a special special moment we
had<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.650> saw<00:03:24.490> lights<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:24.970> tennis<00:03:25.330> and<00:03:25.450> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
what you still can do because there's

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.360
