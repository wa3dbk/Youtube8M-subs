see<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:38.930> same<00:00:39.170> fate<00:00:41.440> up<00:00:42.440> on<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.769> mountain<00:00:43.129> a

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
see the same fate up on the mountain a

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:53.320 
see the same fate up on the mountain a
quick<00:00:43.820> Thompson<00:00:47.650> has<00:00:48.650> like<00:00:48.830> a<00:00:48.860> wall<00:00:52.330> little

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
quick Thompson has like a wall little

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:02.109 
quick Thompson has like a wall little
cave<00:00:59.110> looks<00:01:00.110> like<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.470> cone<00:01:01.159> of<00:01:01.190> a<00:01:01.549> small

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119

volcano<00:01:03.040> like<00:01:04.040> Franklin<00:01:06.700> I'm<00:01:07.700> gonna<00:01:07.909> hide

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
volcano like Franklin I'm gonna hide

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.209 
volcano like Franklin I'm gonna hide
under<00:01:08.509> there<00:01:08.719> not<00:01:09.409> much<00:01:09.590> shelter<00:01:10.009> I<00:01:10.039> guess<00:01:12.219> so

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
under there not much shelter I guess so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.550 
under there not much shelter I guess so
we're<00:01:13.340> already<00:01:13.490> halfway<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:15.320> what<00:01:15.439> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
we're already halfway so what the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.760 
we're already halfway so what the
markers<00:01:15.920> look<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:16.640> look<00:01:16.820> for

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
markers look like that we look for

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.760 
markers look like that we look for
sometimes<00:01:18.770> I<00:01:18.920> can't<00:01:19.159> see<00:01:19.340> you<00:01:19.460> is<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.909> fog

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
sometimes I can't see you is the fog

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
sometimes I can't see you is the fog
we're<00:01:21.770> not<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.009> only<00:01:22.039> ones<00:01:22.219> up<00:01:22.549> here

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:41.010 

it<00:01:26.320> ain't<00:01:26.590> easy<00:01:35.340> stuff<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.520> steep<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:40.020> think

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
it ain't easy stuff the steep I think

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.230 
it ain't easy stuff the steep I think
straight<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.560> top<00:01:41.770> right<00:01:42.220> there<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:46.030> are

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
straight to the top right there we are

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.010 
straight to the top right there we are
we<00:01:46.750> just<00:01:46.930> passed<00:01:47.140> a<00:01:47.290> marker<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:47.680> said

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
we just passed a marker that said

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.800 
we just passed a marker that said
eighteen<00:01:50.020> hundred<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.560> eighty<00:01:50.740> kilometers

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
eighteen hundred and eighty kilometers

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.520 
eighteen hundred and eighty kilometers
meters<00:01:52.810> kilometers<00:01:53.440> look<00:01:53.740> quite<00:01:54.010> a<00:01:54.070> bit<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.740> i

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
meters kilometers look quite a bit so i

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.020 
meters kilometers look quite a bit so i
think<00:01:59.530> the<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:01.150> peak<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.600> just<00:02:01.900> under<00:02:02.610> 2300<00:02:04.770> so

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
think the the peak is just under 2300 so

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.460 
think the the peak is just under 2300 so
we're<00:02:07.030> gonna<00:02:07.180> do<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.590> sun's<00:02:08.590> out<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:10.030> awesome

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470

we're almost there it's right there I
can<00:02:27.940> lick<00:02:28.210> it<00:02:28.240> almost<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:31.030> didn't<00:02:31.209> even<00:02:31.270> know

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
can lick it almost we didn't even know

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.850 
can lick it almost we didn't even know
we<00:02:31.480> were<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.020> then<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> clouds<00:02:32.410> just

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860

we were and then the clouds just
disappeared<00:02:33.720> we've<00:02:34.720> been<00:02:34.840> walking<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.260> long

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
disappeared we've been walking a long

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.540 
disappeared we've been walking a long
way<00:02:35.800> yeah<00:02:38.070> here's<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.370> here's<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:41.340> yeah<00:02:42.340> it's

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
way yeah here's that here's a yeah it's

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.199 
way yeah here's that here's a yeah it's
hard<00:02:42.730> to<00:02:42.850> tell<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:44.410> clouds<00:02:44.830> but<00:02:45.250> there's<00:02:46.030> like

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
hard to tell the clouds but there's like

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.380 
hard to tell the clouds but there's like
a<00:02:46.239> crave<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:46.870> is<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.080> crater<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.270> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
a crave this is a crater this is the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.000 
a crave this is a crater this is the
edge<00:02:49.540> then<00:02:50.310> there's<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.459> Creator<00:02:52.530> see<00:02:53.530> we<00:02:53.860> can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
edge then there's the Creator see we can

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.610 
edge then there's the Creator see we can
see<00:02:54.280> when<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:54.580> first<00:02:54.850> got<00:02:55.030> up<00:02:55.090> here<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.590> just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
see when we first got up here you just

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.050 
see when we first got up here you just
gotta<00:02:56.950> walk<00:02:57.370> around<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:58.120> guess<00:02:59.520> the<00:03:00.520> Creator<00:03:03.060> we

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
gotta walk around I guess the Creator we

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.229 
gotta walk around I guess the Creator we
are<00:03:04.180> now<00:03:04.360> in<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.630> crater<00:03:05.850> before<00:03:06.850> we<00:03:06.970> go<00:03:07.180> to

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
are now in the crater before we go to

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.280 
are now in the crater before we go to
the<00:03:07.570> top<00:03:08.010> probably<00:03:09.010> off<00:03:09.690> fri<00:03:10.690> off<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.020> trail

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
the top probably off fri off the trail

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.160 
the top probably off fri off the trail
frank<00:03:12.070> says<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.780> think<00:03:13.780> we're<00:03:13.870> doing<00:03:14.020> good

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.520 
we're going straight at it just found
ourselves<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:18.220> little<00:03:18.340> shelter<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:20.320> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
ourselves a little shelter here on the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.350 
ourselves a little shelter here on the
way<00:03:20.680> up<00:03:21.989> so<00:03:22.989> how<00:03:23.140> big<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.410> is<00:03:23.470> ranked<00:03:24.360> first

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
way up so how big that is ranked first

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.620 
way up so how big that is ranked first

huh
I<00:03:26.690> guess<00:03:27.470> when<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:27.740> snows<00:03:28.010> up<00:03:28.190> here<00:03:29.200> very<00:03:30.200> good

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
I guess when it snows up here very good
