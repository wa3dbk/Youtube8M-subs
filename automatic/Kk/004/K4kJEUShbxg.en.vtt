of fairly close to that that point there

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.330 
of fairly close to that that point there
just<00:01:04.090> to<00:01:04.180> act<00:01:04.360> as<00:01:04.480> a<00:01:04.510> bit<00:01:04.630> of<00:01:04.660> a<00:01:04.780> bunker<00:01:04.900> and

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
just to act as a bit of a bunker and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.010 
just to act as a bit of a bunker and
looks<00:01:06.340> like<00:01:06.610> a<00:01:06.760> heavy<00:01:07.060> bolter<00:01:07.480> turret<00:01:07.750> going

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
looks like a heavy bolter turret going

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.870 
looks like a heavy bolter turret going
down<00:01:08.200> over<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> west<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.100> pass<00:01:09.280> here<00:01:09.700> from

darkie<00:01:10.810> who's<00:01:10.990> going<00:01:11.230> to<00:01:11.350> actually<00:01:11.620> put<00:01:11.740> that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
darkie who's going to actually put that

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.290 
darkie who's going to actually put that
a<00:01:11.890> range<00:01:12.160> of<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.400> strategic<00:01:12.790> point<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.180> the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
a range of that strategic point and the

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.630 
a range of that strategic point and the
elder<00:01:13.900> guardians<00:01:14.380> are<00:01:14.530> going<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.830> be<00:01:14.980> getting

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
elder guardians are going to be getting

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.250 
elder guardians are going to be getting
in<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.910> range<00:01:16.120> of<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.420> they're<00:01:16.900> probably<00:01:17.020> gonna

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
in a range of it they're probably gonna

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.840 
in a range of it they're probably gonna
see<00:01:17.440> this<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.740> hopefully<00:01:18.070> for<00:01:18.460> them<00:01:18.580> if<00:01:18.730> they

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
see this and hopefully for them if they

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.430 
see this and hopefully for them if they
can<00:01:19.030> take<00:01:19.210> out<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.570> tech<00:01:19.810> quest<00:01:20.050> and<00:01:20.200> time

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
can take out that tech quest and time

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.690 
can take out that tech quest and time
maybe<00:01:20.710> they<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:20.980> prevent<00:01:21.160> it<00:01:21.280> from<00:01:21.340> going<00:01:21.520> up

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
maybe they can prevent it from going up

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700 
maybe they can prevent it from going up
we've<00:01:21.910> got<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.180> got<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.140> Imperial<00:01:23.530> Guard
