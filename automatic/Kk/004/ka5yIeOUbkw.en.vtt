00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
it's his last year and you know how's he

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.740 
it's his last year and you know how's he
doing<00:04:03.420> it<00:04:03.569> uh<00:04:03.870> he's<00:04:04.260> doing<00:04:04.470> good<00:04:04.620> um<00:04:05.750> again

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
doing it uh he's doing good um again

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.360 
doing it uh he's doing good um again
good<00:04:06.930> good<00:04:07.319> approach<00:04:07.590> by<00:04:07.799> him<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.130> think<00:04:08.190> he

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
good good approach by him I think he

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.670 
good good approach by him I think he
finished<00:04:08.549> first<00:04:08.880> in<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.209> offseason<00:04:10.140> program

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
finished first in the offseason program

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.370 
finished first in the offseason program
and<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.519> think<00:04:11.970> he<00:04:12.030> went<00:04:12.150> wire-to-wire<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:13.260> it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
and I think he went wire-to-wire with it

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.199 
and I think he went wire-to-wire with it
so<00:04:13.650> he<00:04:14.069> had<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> good<00:04:14.310> attitude<00:04:14.489> minute<00:04:14.940> maybe

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
so he had a good attitude minute maybe

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.330 
so he had a good attitude minute maybe
lost<00:04:15.450> one<00:04:15.690> week<00:04:15.900> or<00:04:16.079> something<00:04:16.410> but<00:04:16.530> good<00:04:17.310> job

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
lost one week or something but good job

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.270 
lost one week or something but good job
for<00:04:17.639> him

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
for him

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.460 
for him
maybe<00:04:20.120> other<00:04:20.299> receivers<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:21.049> you've<00:04:21.200> seen

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
maybe other receivers that you've seen

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.240 
maybe other receivers that you've seen
really<00:04:21.799> stepped<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.190> early

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
really stepped up early
