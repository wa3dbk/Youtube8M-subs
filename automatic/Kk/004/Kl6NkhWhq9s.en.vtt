it's<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.580> product<00:01:03.880> I<00:01:04.000> think<00:01:04.030> which<00:01:04.300> people<00:01:05.130> once

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
it's a product I think which people once

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.560 
it's a product I think which people once
they<00:01:06.310> get<00:01:06.490> used<00:01:06.910> to<00:01:07.120> you<00:01:07.210> once<00:01:07.420> they

they get used to you once they

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
understand it they get into it in a big

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.130 
understand it they get into it in a big
way

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
way

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.260 
way
and<00:01:11.260> I<00:01:11.680> think<00:01:11.740> it's<00:01:12.100> it's<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.820> natural

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
and I think it's it's a natural

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.960 
and I think it's it's a natural
progression<00:01:13.510> from<00:01:14.320> other<00:01:14.650> spirits<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.850> know

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
progression from other spirits you know

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.180 
progression from other spirits you know
people<00:01:16.270> will<00:01:16.360> drink<00:01:16.690> Jin's<00:01:17.110> vodkas<00:01:17.740> corny

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
people will drink Jin's vodkas corny

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.270 
people will drink Jin's vodkas corny
acts<00:01:18.340> but<00:01:19.050> what<00:01:20.050> we<00:01:20.170> find<00:01:20.410> is<00:01:20.680> everyone

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
acts but what we find is everyone

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760 
acts but what we find is everyone
develops<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:22.450> passion<00:01:23.110> for<00:01:23.440> whiskey

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
develops a passion for whiskey

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.070 
develops a passion for whiskey
eventually<00:01:24.430> yeah<00:01:25.060> it's<00:01:25.540> it's<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> most

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
eventually yeah it's it's the most

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.650 
eventually yeah it's it's the most
interesting<00:01:26.590> spirit<00:01:27.400> category<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.420> most

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
interesting spirit category it's most

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.010 
interesting spirit category it's most
challenging<00:01:29.380> spirit<00:01:29.740> category<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:31.690> I<00:01:31.780> think

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
challenging spirit category and I think

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.880 
challenging spirit category and I think
that's<00:01:32.170> one<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.770> reasons<00:01:33.130> why<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.770> still

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
that's one of the reasons why it's still

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.359 
that's one of the reasons why it's still
buoyant

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.580 

I<00:01:42.720> mean<00:01:43.720> there's<00:01:43.930> there's<00:01:44.170> different

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
I mean there's there's different

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.469 
I mean there's there's different
elements<00:01:44.650> of<00:01:44.979> collecting<00:01:45.460> some<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.820> them<00:01:46.119> are

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
elements of collecting some of them are

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.390 
elements of collecting some of them are
doing<00:01:46.780> fantastically<00:01:47.590> well<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:49.119> feel<00:01:49.570> that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
doing fantastically well I feel that

years<00:02:34.170> we're<00:02:35.170> not<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.470> find<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:35.800> stuff

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
years we're not going to find this stuff

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.570 
years we're not going to find this stuff
anymore

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
anymore

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.440

we<00:02:36.940> really<00:02:37.239> aren't<00:02:38.069> jump<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.220> now<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.640> think

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
we really aren't jump it now I think

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.850 
we really aren't jump it now I think
it's<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> good<00:02:40.690> time<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.019> start<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.709> know<00:02:41.830> I

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
it's a good time to start you know I

these beautiful beautiful whiskeys I
mean<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.440> quite<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.549> quite<00:02:57.790> interesting

to<00:02:58.450> see<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.780> know<00:02:58.900> why<00:02:59.140> did<00:02:59.470> they<00:02:59.590> even<00:02:59.769> close

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
to see you know why did they even close

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.039 
to see you know why did they even close
you<00:03:00.850> know<00:03:00.880> why<00:03:01.180> did<00:03:01.360> these<00:03:01.450> distilleries

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
you know why did these distilleries

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.020 
you know why did these distilleries
close<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.769> hindsight<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.549> people<00:03:03.820> look<00:03:03.940> at

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
close in hindsight when people look at

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.850 
close in hindsight when people look at
it<00:03:04.090> today<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.540> go<00:03:04.720> should<00:03:05.230> never<00:03:05.440> have<00:03:05.590> closed

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
it today we go should never have closed

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.250 
it today we go should never have closed
should<00:03:06.549> never<00:03:06.760> ever<00:03:07.000> have<00:03:07.150> closed<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.230> know

should never ever have closed you know
there's<00:03:08.590> probably<00:03:08.709> other<00:03:09.010> distilleries<00:03:09.610> out

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
there's probably other distilleries out

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.150 
there's probably other distilleries out
there<00:03:10.030> today<00:03:10.329> which<00:03:10.989> possibly<00:03:11.260> should<00:03:11.680> closed

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
there today which possibly should closed

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.699 
there today which possibly should closed
and<00:03:12.430> some<00:03:13.299> of<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.510> losses<00:03:13.690> are<00:03:13.870> still<00:03:14.079> some<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
and some of the losses are still some of

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.280 
and some of the losses are still some of
the<00:03:14.769> lost<00:03:14.950> distilleries<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.810> yeah<00:03:16.989> it's<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
the lost distilleries so yeah it's a

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.010 
the lost distilleries so yeah it's a
good<00:03:17.410> time<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.680> start
