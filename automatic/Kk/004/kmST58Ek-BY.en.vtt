just the input level well here's just

just the input level well here's just

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.640 

so<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.030> a<00:04:19.120> pretty<00:04:19.299> musical<00:04:19.900> standard<00:04:20.410> set

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
so that's a pretty musical standard set

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:32.770 
so that's a pretty musical standard set
in<00:04:20.769> there<00:04:21.010> this<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.459> ten<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.790> one

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.840 

so<00:04:33.530> with<00:04:33.680> release<00:04:34.040> all<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.370> way<00:04:34.490> over<00:04:34.700> there

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
so with release all the way over there

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.040 
so with release all the way over there
it<00:04:35.000> takes<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.360> little<00:04:35.510> longer<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.900> get<00:04:35.990> back

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
it takes a little longer to get back

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.129 
it takes a little longer to get back
this<00:04:36.530> will<00:04:36.710> be<00:04:36.830> almost<00:04:37.100> instant

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
this will be almost instant

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.070 
this will be almost instant
you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
you

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.260 
you
and<00:04:42.100> with<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.250> attack<00:04:43.580> all<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:44.000> way<00:04:44.090> here

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
and with the attack all the way here

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.100 
and with the attack all the way here
counterclockwise<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:46.370> reacts<00:04:46.790> almost

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
counterclockwise it reacts almost

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.060 
counterclockwise it reacts almost
instantaneously<00:04:48.110> this<00:04:48.410> will<00:04:48.590> take<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> little

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
instantaneously this will take a little

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:59.100 
instantaneously this will take a little
bit<00:04:52.540> definitely<00:04:53.540> making<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.260> less<00:04:54.440> noticeable

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.900 

and<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.290> far<00:05:00.530> I've<00:05:00.620> had<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.920> blend<00:05:01.250> completely

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
and so far I've had the blend completely

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.550 
and so far I've had the blend completely
wet<00:05:02.120> here<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.690> completely<00:05:03.290> dry

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:34.070 

you

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.900 

this<00:05:35.080> pedal<00:05:35.380> also<00:05:35.680> features<00:05:36.040> a<00:05:36.250> quarter<00:05:36.700> inch
