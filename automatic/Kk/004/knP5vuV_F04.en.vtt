00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 good morning evenings or nights I'm skiing 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.350
 dragon 96 I wanted to continue with the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.059
 analysis to albert wesker and his mysterious 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.759
 trajectory since the events of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 resident evil 5 to get to the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.599
 final conclusion I should do this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.310
 further investigation including the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.920
 most recent of the video games that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 would be the resident evil 6 being this one the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.730
 most recent with information that we 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.609
 would give more response and arguments for 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
 say that Alberto esquer is still alive 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.960
 to the most powerful test possible 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.030
 we have this specimen individual 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.890
 weird called karl to radames and for 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 of course I have to give a notice of what 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.960
 that is coming along the video is a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.989
 spoiler spoiler related to all 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.510
 the events of resident evil 6 well 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.300
 Carla Radames character created to the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.789
 perfection for use this individual is 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.410
 a web created by name and to which it is 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 behind all this 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.610
 this cloning project so to speak 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.770
 was implemented especially for ada 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 wong and his organization for purposes of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 Carla did what she would not do 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.500
 blaming her for all the crimes yet 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.840
 knowing what fairy is so far the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.329
 unique in his family also without a sister 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.250
 twins because he had said before that 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.170
 the earth had to survive with so 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.539
 only 1 requirement the human race 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.359
 had to be modified to be beings 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.979
 superiors however someone copied his 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.200
 idea and created a cargo radames a 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 scientific affiliate ame man already for 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.490
 look like a fairy is not a super being 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.310
 but nevertheless it was created 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.159
 an identical clone anything I want 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.799
 get to this wesker wise of the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.719
 existence of this virus 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.209
 this is an unknown although wesker 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.220
 always he had an ace up his sleeve 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.380
 he could easily kidnap someone to 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.090
 said cloning had the ease with 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.209
 jill valentine that he fulfilled his 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.159
 western orders we know a lot and 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.289
 we can also determine that he in his 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.629
 trajectory of scientist and creator of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.509
 varied viruses we can determine this 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:59.459
 the virus or chrysalis is a virus 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.819
 researched and created for purposes of 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:04.860
 organic bio war since 1998 fair 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.530
 when the events of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.209
 'resident evil' easily wesker had 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.799
 the power and influence that moves 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.020
 mountains so that this one could 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.000
 investigate what the government does 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.760
 with the power of umbrella in their hands 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.370
 at first wesker could know what 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.040
 that is all involved with the word 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.580
 virus let's start with an essential part 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.110
 of excess and mons this guy has 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.510
 what to do with the creation of the virus 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.700
 after raccoon sterilization 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 city ​​with the missile of destruction marisa 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 released in the city this character in 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.410
 a beginning was and until now 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.810
 It was the defense minister usa 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.180
 to the east know the impossible I mean 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.190
 the creation of zombies this had the idea 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.980
 to innovate and create a virus for war 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.960
 modern had the idea first but it was not 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.480
 the first one knew of the existence 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.820
 by Albert Wesker and I imagine that 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.410
 vice versa wesker when driving a man 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.690
 already and have some contact with the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.760
 organization called the family 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.370
 symonds should also have known 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 wesker in this organization I man and 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.660
 there is a man they already commonly brought something 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.210
 between hands and well you have to know that 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.100
 Simon never appeared in the saga only in 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.010
 resident evil 6 where is brutally 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.209
 killed by becoming a voice but 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.590
 what we get is that the virus 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.870
 chrysalis is a virus 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.550
 realization of decades and look at all 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.590
 his attempts to achieve the virus 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.110
 perfect or more referring the one of the life 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.629
 eternal did not achieve its purpose but 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.700
 knowing of the existence of the virus as 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.970
 there would be a smoke screen with his clone 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.739
 which is the strongest theory wesker 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 I knew he was close to achieving his 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.640
 committed with the virus and that would do everything 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 whatever was within your reach 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.099
 protect that project this creates the virus 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.379
 ur borox which is the most incomplete virus 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.840
 and unstable that he has created he uses it in his 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.280
 clone and this how it manages to have a resemblance 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.799
 in his chain of 'hard he accepts it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.459
 totally and from there we went to the 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.590
 events of resident evil 5 albert a lo 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.480
 long the films of 'resident evil' are 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.340
 has been adding to the realization that 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.560
 the saga from the resident evil 3 the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.780
 movie to see that his kinship with the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.940
 game are nothing the same to look like 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
 more of a post apocalyptic scenario 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.079
 that a survival horror alberti 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
 played by shawn roberts for now 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.949
 has given to be a calculating character 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.770
 but not cold enough as it is 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.229
 albert wesker still the changes in the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.610
 films in albert are distant nothing 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.650
 similar and in grief 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.199
 delivery appeared as if it were a 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.729
 monster more but now we take in 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.159
 note that some scenes of the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.650
 movie relate to the game but 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:39.569
 it's not enough to say that Albert is now 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.289
 prostrate in the chair of the president in 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.879
 the white house but because he is still alive 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.520
 perhaps the universes between the movie and 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.830
 the game have no relationship something like that 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.469
 like grand theft auto 5 and its universe 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.120
 parallel to the previous one is therefore although the 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.310
 same director of 'resident evil' 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.800
 mishima kagawa said that what remains 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.169
 of western are memories is not the 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.050
 reality besides that I have realized 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.460
 and my perception has saved me today 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.710
 letting me know that in the report of 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.310
 host and Alice appear certain texts 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.009
 related the first was the report 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.110
 of alice is the same as albert's 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.849
 the wesker report mentions how was his 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.680
 principle within the career of the 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.789
 life or death in the 'resident evil' 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.099
 cited my name is albert wesker was boss 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.469
 of laboratory in a gray accord company 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.259
 that led the development of the knew 

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:32.849
 birkin but we took separate paths the 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.360
 virus that dispersed and the good 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.180
 city 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.599
 the report of alice became zombies 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.310
 cited my name is alice was boss of 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.500
 security in a beautiful corporation 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.009
 company that led the development of 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.080
 boy 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.539
 hammer we escaped but we were separated 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.300
 the tea spread and everyone died but 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.849
 they revived something that I noticed 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.800
 alice although you feel resentment for a man 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.050
 already wears a ring that says property of 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.430
 a man already cut something that tells me that 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.889
 albert in resident evil umbrella 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.479
 chronicles immediately after that 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:06.000
 albert fell to the ground comes the 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.009
 stage revive rebirth that we 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.870
 leads to that albert in resident evil 1 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.360
 he survives but this one of his frustration 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.009
 He throws his glasses on the floor that says 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.610
 owned by a man already but still 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:20.219
 keep maintaining that style of glasses 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.740
 always alice is in the program says 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.379
 a cloning program as well as you see 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.090
 that is in the wesker program only that 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.150
 Albert was a selection of children 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.849
 kidnapped and that he stood out from all of them 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.039
 in conclusion in the film it puts us 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:36.689
 even seeing that it is indeed distant 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.630
 to the other of another sex 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:43.600
 another name notice the initials alice 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.970
 both were projects and we do not know 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.450
 forget both were projects of 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.450
 cloning
