00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey!

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.840
Now what did you get on question number one?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.520
Oh, I don"t know

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.040
What?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.560
There's Mike Van Michelson!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.340

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.300
When you accidentally fall

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.520
Go into the wrong stall
