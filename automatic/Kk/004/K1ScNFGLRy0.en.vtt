okay so here's my raised beds and you
see<00:00:03.600> there's<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.870> little<00:00:04.049> bit<00:00:04.200> of<00:00:04.290> a<00:00:04.440> difference

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
see there's a little bit of a difference

because I'm running out a little bit of
time<00:00:12.179> I've<00:00:12.509> changed<00:00:13.170> jobs<00:00:14.160> changed<00:00:15.000> ours

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
time I've changed jobs changed ours

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.029 
time I've changed jobs changed ours
month<00:00:16.830> had<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> other<00:00:17.820> piece<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.270> property<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
month had a other piece of property and

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.700 
month had a other piece of property and
so<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.939> busy<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> wanted<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
so we're really busy and so I wanted to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.410 
so we're really busy and so I wanted to
keep<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.220> simple<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.880> year<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> mostly

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.670 
keep it simple so this year I mostly
just<00:00:24.539> growing<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:24.990> tomatoes<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.560> peppers

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
just growing with tomatoes and peppers

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.400 
just growing with tomatoes and peppers
even<00:00:26.670> though<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> far<00:00:27.330> end<00:00:27.630> I've<00:00:27.960> got<00:00:28.199> some

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
even though on the far end I've got some

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.500 
even though on the far end I've got some
rice<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.640> over<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:31.019> growing<00:00:31.500> some

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
rice and over here I'm growing some

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.010 
rice and over here I'm growing some
perennial<00:00:33.510> some<00:00:34.290> scarlet<00:00:34.890> runners<00:00:35.540> had<00:00:36.540> some

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
perennial some scarlet runners had some

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.420 
perennial some scarlet runners had some
other<00:00:37.410> beans<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.530> big<00:00:40.739> difference<00:00:40.920> that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
other beans but the big difference that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.110 
other beans but the big difference that
we're<00:00:41.610> doing<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.360> we've<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.730> wood<00:00:44.730> mulch

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
we're doing is we've got a wood mulch

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.040 
we're doing is we've got a wood mulch
and<00:00:45.690> he<00:00:46.170> got<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:47.149> cat's<00:00:48.149> cradle<00:00:48.390> from

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and he got that from cat's cradle from

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.889 
and he got that from cat's cradle from
the<00:00:49.350> homestead<00:00:49.559> honey<00:00:50.010> our<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.660> great

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
ladies on that show I was talking to her

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.040 
ladies on that show I was talking to her
the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.840> day<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.320> she<00:00:55.500> turned<00:00:55.739> me<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
the other day and she turned me on to a

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.380 
the other day and she turned me on to a
movie<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> free<00:00:58.379> movie<00:00:58.710> called<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> Eden

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
movie a free movie called back to Eden

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.290 
movie a free movie called back to Eden
and<00:01:00.960> basically<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> man<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.670> saying<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and basically the man was saying that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.039 
and basically the man was saying that
because<00:01:03.570> we've<00:01:03.899> got<00:01:04.110> away<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.470> nature<00:01:06.049> it's

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because we've got away from nature it's

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
because we've got away from nature it's
it's<00:01:07.350> made<00:01:07.560> stuff<00:01:08.010> harder<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.400> harder<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's made stuff harder and harder to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.130 
it's made stuff harder and harder to
grow<00:01:08.909> nature<00:01:09.330> doesn't<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> worry<00:01:10.020> about

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
grow nature doesn't have to worry about

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.770 
grow nature doesn't have to worry about
plants<00:01:10.560> died<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:11.010> right<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.420> he

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
plants died now right and and so he

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.600 
plants died now right and and so he
takes<00:01:13.350> some<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> principles<00:01:14.130> from<00:01:14.310> nature

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610

mulch you know woodchips in his garden
and<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.159> can<00:01:26.340> get<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.490> into<00:01:26.790> that

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
and you know you can get all into that

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
and you know you can get all into that
people<00:01:27.420> talk<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:27.600> nitrogen<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.009> know

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
people talk about nitrogen you know

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.310 
people talk about nitrogen you know
coming<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> soil<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
coming out of the soil because of the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.319 
coming out of the soil because of the
rotten<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> wood<00:01:32.579> pulling<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
rotten of the wood pulling in the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
rotten of the wood pulling in the
nitrogen<00:01:33.509> but<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:34.500> once<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.890> rots<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.430> get

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
nitrogen but then once it rots you get

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399 
nitrogen but then once it rots you get
you<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.240> nitrogen<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> soil

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you get more nitrogen back in the soil

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.560 
you get more nitrogen back in the soil
and<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:38.250> soil<00:01:38.280> test<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.970> I've<00:01:39.119> looked<00:01:39.329> at

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and the soil test that I've looked at

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050 
and the soil test that I've looked at
researching<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.500> says<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> most<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.909> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
researching this says that most of that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
researching this says that most of that
nitrogen<00:01:43.020> being<00:01:43.170> pulled<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> soul<00:01:44.009> is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
nitrogen being pulled out of the soul is

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.910 
nitrogen being pulled out of the soul is
right<00:01:44.399> where<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:45.170> right<00:01:46.170> where<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> meets<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
right where the right where it meets and

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.740 
right where the right where it meets and
it<00:01:47.009> doesn't<00:01:47.340> really<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.670> down<00:01:47.820> beat<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.630> right

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
it doesn't really go down beat all right

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.219 
it doesn't really go down beat all right
and<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> benefits<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> mulch<00:01:50.729> way

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
and the benefits of the mulch way

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.830 
and the benefits of the mulch way
outweighs<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:53.310> negatives<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.390> anyway

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
outweighs the the negatives so anyway

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.219 
outweighs the the negatives so anyway
you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.649> besides<00:01:56.570> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.719> being<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.049> weed

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you know besides you know being a weed

out<00:02:30.859> very<00:02:31.250> very<00:02:31.310> easily<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.480> hole<00:02:32.629> root

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
out very very easily just a hole root

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.399 
out very very easily just a hole root
and<00:02:32.989> all<00:02:33.079> just<00:02:33.349> straight<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:35.409> mulch

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
and all just straight out of the mulch

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.199 
and all just straight out of the mulch
and<00:02:36.530> I<00:02:36.650> would<00:02:36.829> show<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.189> to<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.549> but<00:02:38.090> that's

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and I would show that to you but that's

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.089 
and I would show that to you but that's
the<00:02:38.480> easy<00:02:38.689> thing<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.500> I've<00:02:39.620> already<00:02:39.799> done

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
the easy thing and so I've already done

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.369 
the easy thing and so I've already done
all<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.549> right<00:02:41.180> all<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:41.870> weeds<00:02:42.049> that<00:02:42.170> got

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
all that right all the weeds that got

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.390 
all that right all the weeds that got
left<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.829> hardwoods

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
left to the hardwoods

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.940 
left to the hardwoods
but<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.299> can<00:02:44.510> tell<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> big<00:02:44.950> difference

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
but you can tell a big difference

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:54.699 
but you can tell a big difference
between<00:02:46.159> that<00:02:47.109> garden<00:02:48.109> to<00:02:48.650> fight<00:02:48.980> those<00:02:53.709> this

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
between that garden to fight those this

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.569 
between that garden to fight those this
one<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.209> where<00:02:56.629> it<00:02:56.870> is

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
one here and where it is

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:05.510 
one here and where it is
you<00:02:58.579> know<00:02:58.700> straw

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.910 

and<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.240> end<00:03:06.450> where<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.350> what<00:03:07.710> was<00:03:07.890> left

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
and that end where it is what was left

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.240 
and that end where it is what was left
of<00:03:08.280> my<00:03:08.340> one<00:03:08.760> scoop<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.380> it<00:03:10.770> makes<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
of my one scoop so you know it makes a

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
of my one scoop so you know it makes a
big<00:03:11.550> difference<00:03:12.210> as<00:03:12.360> far<00:03:12.390> as<00:03:12.630> weeding<00:03:13.140> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
big difference as far as weeding and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.500 
big difference as far as weeding and
mulching<00:03:13.620> goes<00:03:13.830> so<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:15.000> know<00:03:15.150> I'm<00:03:15.300> quite

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
mulching goes so you know I'm quite

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.920 
mulching goes so you know I'm quite
pleased<00:03:15.930> with<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> results<00:03:16.740> so<00:03:16.800> far
