it's<00:02:50.140> as<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.950> game<00:02:51.220> designer<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.730> would<00:02:51.760> say

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
it's as a game designer we would say

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.729 
it's as a game designer we would say
what<00:02:52.209> its<00:02:52.330> importance<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.050> on<00:02:53.230> what<00:02:53.590> are<00:02:53.680> the

actions<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.800> idea<00:03:56.890> i'm<00:03:57.250> going<00:03:57.460> to

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
actions and so the idea i'm going to

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.460 
actions and so the idea i'm going to
turn<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.700> china<00:03:58.030> shop<00:03:58.120> for<00:03:58.510> me<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:58.930> yeah<00:03:59.440> this

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
turn a china shop for me is yeah this

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.520 
turn a china shop for me is yeah this
big<00:03:59.920> a<00:04:00.340> room<00:04:01.060> full<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.510> very<00:04:01.810> fragile<00:04:02.140> things

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
big a room full of very fragile things

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.260 
big a room full of very fragile things
that<00:04:02.710> are<00:04:02.800> very<00:04:02.890> carefully<00:04:03.490> organized<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.180> you

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
that are very carefully organized so you

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.700 
that are very carefully organized so you
can<00:04:04.390> walk<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.930> see<00:04:05.080> how<00:04:05.200> all<00:04:05.350> those<00:04:05.470> things

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
can walk in to see how all those things

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.560 
can walk in to see how all those things
are<00:04:05.860> put<00:04:05.980> together<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:06.880> if<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.270> were<00:04:07.330> to<00:04:07.390> walk

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
are put together but if you were to walk

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.120 
are put together but if you were to walk
in<00:04:07.780> there<00:04:07.900> as<00:04:08.020> minotaurs<00:04:08.560> are<00:04:08.740> knocking

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
in there as minotaurs are knocking

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.920 
in there as minotaurs are knocking
things<00:04:09.340> over<00:04:09.490> in<00:04:09.760> tables<00:04:10.120> falling<00:04:10.450> two<00:04:10.570> tables

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
things over in tables falling two tables

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.140 
things over in tables falling two tables
it's<00:04:11.350> really<00:04:11.500> hard<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.800> predict<00:04:12.130> exactly<00:04:12.580> what

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
it's really hard to predict exactly what

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.349 
it's really hard to predict exactly what
the<00:04:13.270> ruined<00:04:13.630> shop<00:04:13.930> is<00:04:14.170> going<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.560> look<00:04:14.709> like<00:04:15.359> so

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
the ruined shop is going to look like so

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.090 
the ruined shop is going to look like so
it's<00:04:16.480> not<00:04:16.570> exactly<00:04:17.080> random<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.680> kind<00:04:17.980> of

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
it's not exactly random it's kind of

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.650 
it's not exactly random it's kind of
deterministic<00:04:18.670> but<00:04:18.970> it's<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.299> hard<00:04:19.600> to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
deterministic but it's so hard to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.300 
deterministic but it's so hard to
predict<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.260> might<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.560> well<00:04:20.590> be<00:04:20.950> random<00:04:21.280> but

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
predict it might as well be random but

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.030 
predict it might as well be random but
it<00:04:21.519> has<00:04:21.670> this<00:04:21.880> extra<00:04:22.450> flavor<00:04:23.290> of<00:04:23.740> everything

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
it has this extra flavor of everything

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.400 
it has this extra flavor of everything
being<00:04:24.490> your<00:04:24.760> fault<00:04:25.120> and<00:04:25.960> that's<00:04:26.050> kind<00:04:26.380> of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
being your fault and that's kind of

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.150 
being your fault and that's kind of
interesting<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.950> think<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:29.710> you<00:04:29.830> still<00:04:29.890> need

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
interesting I think but you still need

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.130 
interesting I think but you still need
some<00:04:30.430> random<00:04:30.790> elements<00:04:31.210> not<00:04:31.330> everything<00:04:31.930> to

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
some random elements not everything to

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.840 
some random elements not everything to
be<00:04:32.200> deterministic<00:04:32.770> like<00:04:33.130> this<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.669> when

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
be deterministic like this and so when

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.690 
be deterministic like this and so when
you<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:34.600> have<00:04:34.930> random<00:04:35.350> elements<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:35.980> seems<00:04:36.580> to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
you do have random elements it seems to

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.750 
you do have random elements it seems to
help<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:37.060> lot<00:04:37.410> help<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.650> perception<00:04:39.550> of

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
help a lot help this perception of

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.390 
help a lot help this perception of
unfairness<00:04:40.180> if<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.720> are<00:04:40.870> given<00:04:41.260> a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
unfairness if you are given a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.220 
unfairness if you are given a
proportional<00:04:42.400> warning<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.600> if<00:04:43.870> something

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
proportional warning and so if something

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.020 
proportional warning and so if something
really<00:04:44.470> bad<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:44.890> going<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.250> happen<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:45.790> you

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
really bad is going to happen to you you

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.730 
really bad is going to happen to you you
get<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.180> warning<00:04:46.450> from<00:04:46.690> really<00:04:47.020> far<00:04:47.050> away<00:04:47.410> like

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
get a warning from really far away like

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.190 
get a warning from really far away like
hagas<00:04:48.160> terrible<00:04:48.700> things<00:04:48.940> coming<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:49.990> if

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
hagas terrible things coming and if

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.900 
hagas terrible things coming and if
something<00:04:50.410> smaller<00:04:50.830> less<00:04:51.160> important<00:04:51.730> maybe

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
something smaller less important maybe

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.880 
something smaller less important maybe
you<00:04:52.270> don't<00:04:52.419> get<00:04:52.630> as<00:04:52.720> much<00:04:52.870> morning<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:56.229> what

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
you don't get as much morning so what

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.830 
you don't get as much morning so what
that's<00:04:57.100> like<00:04:57.220> come<00:04:57.460> from<00:04:57.669> they<00:04:58.000> burst<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.479> yes

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
that's like come from they burst and yes

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.750 
that's like come from they burst and yes
that's<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.560> creepy<00:04:59.919> barn<00:05:00.160> oh<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:03.280> guess<00:05:03.550> that's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
that's a creepy barn oh I guess that's

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.210 
that's a creepy barn oh I guess that's
about<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:04.350> that's<00:05:05.350> all<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.560> I<00:05:05.800> think<00:05:05.950> that's<00:05:06.070> all

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
about it that's all I I think that's all

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.990 
about it that's all I I think that's all
yeah

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
yeah
