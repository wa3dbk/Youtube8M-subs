00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.751
I am further amazed by someone who speaks or researches on women’s issues with human rights organizations

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.931
while these same organizations do not even know rights that are mutually shared among various types of people!

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:28.251
This is why I said to one of the members of a human rights organization when he said to me:

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.480
“The West puts pressure on women, and so on.”

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.520
I said: “They themselves cannot differentiate...

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.640
Which of them is the woman? Who is the woman?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.280
First, differentiate between the sexes so that we can plainly and precisely lay out the rights!”

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.640
Because for them, a woman can marry a woman! Isn’t that so?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.020
And a man can marry a man!

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.320
The female sex is lost! It does not exist!

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.000
Sort that out first. Then we can reach a common understanding with regards to treaties between us so that we can understand the rights in that regard.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.240
If they were to say, “Save the woman and bring her out.”

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.280
We would say, “Where is the woman? There is no woman here!”

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.180
“These are men according to the definition of men, or the whole country are women!”

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.380
This is why they have reached the extent of bestiality! They have reached the extent of animals!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:19.580
So how can we negotiate with people who are so inclined against divine issues that Allah has ruled in and defined clearly?

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.560
However, the weakness of the Ummah and its degradation, even in issues pertaining to the fiṭrah (natural disposition)...

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.480
has made it to be shy from rights organizations and to flee from the judgment of Allah, resorting to giving them lip service.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.460
Until today, there is no Muslim ruler - unfortunately - from among the many Muslim rulers throughout the Muslim countries in the East and West...

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.580
who has called the West to return to the fiṭrah.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.000
We do not want them to only return to religion...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.460
Return to humanity... Return to the fiṭrah...

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.940
Return to the natural state upon which Allah created you.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.200
The fiṭrahs have not been opposed throughout history except on two occasions:

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520
During the time of Prophet Lūṭ and in this era we live in now.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.800
Had another prophet been sent after our Prophet Muḥammad, peace and blessings be on him...

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.500
Allah would have sent him in this age we live in now.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.540
There is dis-figuration that humanity has never witnessed before!

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:20.780
That is why Allah sent down a punishment to the people of Lūṭ, and yet their actions exist now in laws and constitutions of the West that they have finished from, and which they want to export to the East.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.480
Many countries that are attributed to Islam have signed constitutions like these, such as the committee known as CEDAW, as well as others...

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.320
which have developed and signed charters that will not allow differentiation between the sexes.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.660
Differentiation between the sexes is something natural and innate...

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.700
Just like there is differentiation between the elderly and the young, the latter respecting the former...

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.920
The scholar and the ignorant... they are different from one another.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.120
The same with the man and the woman, one is better than the another in their respective ways, and so forth.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.680
The issue of equality is an illusion!

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.820
They look into issues of equality until they have drowned in them.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.640
That is because they were brought up with intellectual theories that are based solely on the intellect, and do not know where they will come to a halt.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.180
When Liberalism first originated in the West, it did not originate in this manner.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.040
But when they opened the door of the intellect and cancelled religious legislation, they reached the extent of animals.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.460
This is why we say that when it comes to ideologies, they do not affect you alone, but they affect an entire generation.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.060
If a person is unable to change their clothing styles...

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.600
The clothing that you wear, when you became mature enough, were you given the choice between wearing them and having them sowed...

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.520
or did you find your father and those around you wearing certain clothes, then you wore similar clothes?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.260
You found those around you wearing them...

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.780
This is pertaining to clothing, of which you are unable to go against the norm of the people.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.200
So how about an entire legislative and intellectual system that they set for entire generations, then want the people to abide by that?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.340
They set legislations to wipe out an entire generation!

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.960
You may be living in a blessing and see that perhaps this is good...

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.000
When liberal thought first emerged in the West in France, they had intended to rectify their situation through it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.860
At first, it was a remedy for their corruption.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.500
But was it with the Light of God or was it with the light of vain desire?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.620
It was with the light of vain desire!

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.400
So they opened a door, and it has ended up where it has ended up.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.040
Until it has reached the point where a man takes a passport which reads “So &amp; so the son of so &amp; so.”

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.600
and his spouse, “So &amp; so the son of so &amp; so!”

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.440
Then he travels with him together on the plane to all the countries of the world!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.180
This has never occurred in the history of mankind! Even during the time of Prophet Lūṭ, it did not exist in this manner!

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.160
This is why we say that this is one of the grave matters that a person must refer to the Law of Allah in.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.160
The Ummah is in need of a reforming ruler that calls people to return to the fiṭrah.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.740
Our struggle with the West right now is not only a struggle of Islam...

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.020
It is a struggle of humanity... A struggle of the fiṭrah!

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.680
They are in need of being brought back from the state of animals to the state of humans beings...

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.700
Then after that comes addressing them with Islam.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.900
Who is calling to this?

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.200
Unfortunately, even though we are the people of the fiṭrah and the people of the true religion, we are shy of that... Why?

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.400
Because they have airplanes that fly...

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.120
because they have computers and because they have mobile phones.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.060
That’s the end of it! After that, everything they do becomes correct!

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:21.080
This is why we have become dazzled by materialism and have forgotten about the fiṭrah upon which Allah has created us!
