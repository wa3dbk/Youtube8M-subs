00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:02.667
"Title in the Middle",
everybody plays.

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.213
What's the deal with
"Title in the Middle"?

00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:08.475
Our improv musician Daniel
Tauszig will play a theme song,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.408
and this theme will inspire
our players to do a scene.

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:14.089
I ring the bell and
the scene freezes.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:17.940
I'll get one of the sentences
you wrote outside and it will

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.752
be the scene title, and they'll
have to make this title match

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:24.010
with the scene they
have already started.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.957
We'll do a number of
scenes and they all start

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:30.233
with a theme song from
Daniel Tauszig, please.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.459
Who's there?

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:48.942
Oh, it's a dog.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:51.340
I don't have a dog!

00:00:52.827 --> 00:00:55.651
Okay, after the bell,
no one else can join the scene.

00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:58.016
The title for this scene is...

00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:03.929
'You will want me,
whether you want it or not'

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:12.236
I can't believe this...
Who's there? Who's there?

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:14.304
I don't have a dog!

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:19.796
Hi! It's me, Roberto!

00:01:19.796 --> 00:01:24.387
- What are you doing here?
- We met each other 45 years ago.

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:30.772
And you left me waiting. I still have
the flower I was going to give you!

00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:33.743
Look, son,
I got married, I had kids...

00:01:34.443 --> 00:01:39.597
And you will want me,
whether you want it or not!

00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:41.581
How cute...

00:01:44.668 --> 00:01:46.652
How cute!

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:52.248
Daniel Tauszig, next theme!

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:11.203
After the bell,
no one else can join...

00:02:11.553 --> 00:02:13.699
And the title for the scene is...

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.150
'I plant to eat'

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:27.133
They don't make public
libraries like they used to!

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:33.651
Motherfuckers!

00:02:38.365 --> 00:02:41.905
You're not supposed
to be talking in english!

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:52.955
Oh, my book? 'I Plant to Eat'.
It's a great book...

00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:04.758
Daniel Tauszig,
next theme, please.

00:03:10.705 --> 00:03:13.151
If you're not coming,
I'll go alone, baby!

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.262
- Oh, I don't know...
- Come with me, baby!

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:20.483
His car has electric windows...

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:24.196
But my car has my heart in it!

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:46.057
And the title for the scene is:
'Dirty floor, dirty floor, dirty floor'.

00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:48.756
Hey, baby!

00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:52.530
I have money!

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:55.195
Come!

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:02.279
All I can offer you is my heart!

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.164
Oh, how cute!

00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.411
- Do you have another helmet?
- I do!

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:16.527
Wait. I'll just grab a book.

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:20.128
'Dirty Floor, Dirty Floor,
Dirty Floor'

00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:33.305
The game is a lot easier
if we can justify it like this!

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:37.444
- So, the game works like this...
- One: He wasn't even in a library.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:41.560
Two: He can't speak right,
he said 'dirry floor, dirry floor'!

00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:45.561

00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:52.562
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.

00:04:55.785 --> 00:04:58.019
Electric fan, so good.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.652
- Change!
- This death should just die!
