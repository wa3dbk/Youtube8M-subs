00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.247
 Chapter IX Chanel in Carl's opinion 

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:06.550
 Follow 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.796
 : But slow down, you know my hair 

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:10.909
 "I have nothing to say but I will answer any question" 

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:12.852
 Of course, this is what I aspire to, this is my goal 

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.352
 To create a style that has not been created before 

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.975
 If I had Chanel's definition I would say she was the first fashion designer 

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.491
 The members of the women have a modern dress that did not exist before 

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:26.983
 She was not just a shopkeeper 

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:28.423
 She had her own look and style 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.238
 They were probably more entertaining than others 

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.279
 Coco was someone who knew nothing and understood everything 

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:36.988
 She understood herself 

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:39.893
 She felt she was full 

00:00:40.013 --> 00:00:41.990
 In tune with her age 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.440
 Chanel has given us ... herself 

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:46.624
 That was a significant thing 

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.725
 Chanel left us her style 

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.165
 Which is difficult to identify at first sight 

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.207
 It is a but it is in fashion 

00:00:54.327 --> 00:00:56.878
 Her style belonged to another era 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.010
 But he managed to stay and adapt 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.999
 With the modern world and the following decades 

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.145
 Fashion ... is progressing 

00:01:05.186 --> 00:01:07.477
 You can not go back ... there is no line of return 

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:09.565
 The elegance of Chanel 

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.311
 Attitude, spirit and kind of asceticism 

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:15.987
 For femininity without cost 

00:01:16.107 --> 00:01:17.954
 I am the first to admit 

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.659
 They invented something amazing, Chanel costume 

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.337
 The feminine version of the jacket with two buttons 

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:26.803
 That was called 

00:01:27.272 --> 00:01:30.041
 "An avalanche in the fashion mountains, there is no other term to describe it" 

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:32.411
 Everyone copied it and still people 

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.253
 They copy it in innovative ways 

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:36.839
 The distinctive features of Chenille are enjoyable 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:37.972
 It is in fact 

00:01:38.016 --> 00:01:41.740
 If you see the fifties formations in the late 1950s 

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:43.649
 There are few strings 

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:44.876
 There is no CC 

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:46.507
 And no camellia flowers 

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.323
 But in the 1980s we had to get into these symbols 

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:50.802
 Because otherwise 

00:01:50.922 --> 00:01:55.059
 It would have been a neat and modest tweed with a small bow 

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:57.490
 These were the things you added 

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:58.434
 exaggerated 

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:00.629
 And made people think it 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.977
 It has always existed and this is my work 

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:05.459
 "I do not stand idly by and say, I'll create Chanel" 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.000
 Frankly, I do it automatically 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.743
 I can not tell you the secret behind it because there is no secret at all 

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.259
 When you buy Chanel then you buy an idea 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.876
 Somewhat unintended 

00:02:15.996 --> 00:02:18.698
 As you are aware of this story 

00:02:18.742 --> 00:02:20.084
 The Chanel style is an idea 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.456
 But this idea is now in a kind of collective memory 

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.549
 This is very rare 

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:28.181
 It is a myth to be seen 

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.835
 It is a global phenomenon 

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:34.076
 It is a globalization before the advent of globalization 

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.850
 Here lies the genius
