00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello, sleepy Kaiser toy 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.220
 robocraft on your screens ordered 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.230
 will receive 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.509
 means and immediately explain to those who do not 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.820
 understands why I do not play it guys 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'm just sick of you you understand 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.189
 or not but bored me it became here in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.189
 second but it is first and secondly what 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 I'm 5 shooting and yes, and I have guns there 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.829
 I do not remember what 3 in my wheels 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.329
 1 and who cares added wings 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.280
 they can be at ping ease here and so 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 get to put trust Ira and your 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.090
 the machine will fly on will make 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.559
 imagine a plane and very cool 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.260
 by the way will not be here and your technique will be 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.149
 fly that very well that's it by the way 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.640
 very good idea was to put the wings 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.559
 add now you can now trust 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:08.250
 you can use a normal plane 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.510
 do and normally fight so do 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.159
 we have a way 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:19.159
 what we have new 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:24.350
 so here I remember that 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.350
 popobol going on in this 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.090
 this is some kind of horror make such a grid 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090
 so what is there 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:45.230
 cosmetics 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.230
 all the same nothing new hurry 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.210
 gifts of jamming 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:03.150
 and by the way who did not have time on rails 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:09.149
 that young man I had time to great 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.250
 Fortunately, I bought myself a nick 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.200
 bought a promotional code there was a promo code and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.270
 one could get five rails also to 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 actually which wings are the same you 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.970
 got 5 wings get promo code 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.010
 so i look at us first win up 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.870
 free x 2 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 let's look right into them for battle 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:44.610
 will it give us whether we win the first 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:50.760
 victory 5 6 and must enter a new card 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:55.020
 winter I wildly apologize 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:00.930
 feed all that happens yes come on 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.410
 hold oh you tyzh here it is bubble and this 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.350
 how his donut donut this donut 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.820
 before the laser removed the restrictions it's me too 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.840
 I know by the way the range of the shot 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:31.800
 Now you can fire everything and 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:31.800
 wherever you want items even 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
 infection 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.300
 side will fight until the Neva that 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.300
 shocked 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:26.620
 they are on the fifth level will give such 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.690
 but actually what can I say at the expense of 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.730
 of the fact that they strengthened the blocks, but of course 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.720
 It seems to be more interesting, but before me 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:50.490
 liked more like it collapsed here 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.080
 Now it has become so hard to know. 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.080

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:18.100
