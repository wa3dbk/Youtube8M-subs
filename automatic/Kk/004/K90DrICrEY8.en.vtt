a little vent just a little air vent and
that<00:01:06.420> basically<00:01:06.930> releases<00:01:07.500> any<00:01:07.649> water<00:01:07.890> vapor

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that basically releases any water vapor

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
that basically releases any water vapor
that<00:01:08.759> might<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.090> caught<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> between<00:01:09.719> those

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that might get caught in between those

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.539 
that might get caught in between those
two<00:01:10.289> layers<00:01:11.960> inside<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.259> is<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.219> thermal

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
two layers inside that is the thermal

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.660 
two layers inside that is the thermal
light<00:01:14.729> insulating<00:01:15.630> layer<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.890> finally

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
light insulating layer and then finally

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.679 
light insulating layer and then finally
it's<00:01:17.789> finished<00:01:17.850> off<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.539> really

actually is it's just just meant to
velcro<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.109> thigh<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.649> that's<00:01:35.250> where

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
velcro on your thigh and that's where

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.050 
velcro on your thigh and that's where
you<00:01:35.520> clip<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.390> controller<00:01:37.429> so<00:01:38.429> this

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you clip the controller so this

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.429 
you clip the controller so this
controller<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> actually<00:01:39.929> a<00:01:40.170> really

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
controller is actually a really

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.700 
controller is actually a really
sophisticated<00:01:41.000> piece<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> electronics<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
sophisticated piece of electronics it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
sophisticated piece of electronics it's
not<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> rheostat<00:01:44.509> it's<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.929> a<00:01:45.960> pulse

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
not a rheostat it's actually a pulse

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.580 
not a rheostat it's actually a pulse
width<00:01:46.560> modulator<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:48.420> has<00:01:48.570> six<00:01:48.960> different

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
width modulator and it has six different

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.279 
width modulator and it has six different
settings<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.609> all<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.969> way<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.179> to<00:01:51.329> 163

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
settings that go all the way up to 163

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.010 
settings that go all the way up to 163
degrees<00:01:52.409> Fahrenheit<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.969> most<00:01:54.450> people<00:01:54.570> we've

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
degrees Fahrenheit now most people we've

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.389 
degrees Fahrenheit now most people we've
found<00:01:55.320> are<00:01:55.679> happy<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.460> about<00:01:56.579> 135<00:01:57.479> degrees

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
found are happy with about 135 degrees

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
found are happy with about 135 degrees
that<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.460> level<00:01:59.880> 3<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.539> this<00:02:01.020> particular

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that is level 3 on this particular

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.559 
that is level 3 on this particular
controller<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.819> almost<00:02:02.939> guarantee<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
controller so can almost guarantee it's

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.539 
controller so can almost guarantee it's
going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.780> keep<00:02:03.899> your<00:02:04.079> hands<00:02:04.289> warm<00:02:04.490> now<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
going to keep your hands warm now the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
going to keep your hands warm now the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
really cool thing about it is once you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.690 
really cool thing about it is once you
set<00:02:07.679> it<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> temperature<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.670> want

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
set it to the temperature that you want

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
set it to the temperature that you want
you<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.570> just<00:02:09.750> leave<00:02:09.960> it<00:02:10.140> because<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.070> like

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you can just leave it because just like

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.010 
you can just leave it because just like
the<00:02:11.370> climate<00:02:11.700> control<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.210> car<00:02:12.420> it's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
the climate control in your car it's

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.480 
the climate control in your car it's
actually<00:02:13.170> going<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.470> modulate<00:02:13.980> its<00:02:14.160> own

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
actually going to modulate its own

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.040 
actually going to modulate its own
temperature<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.180> maintain<00:02:15.870> that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
temperature and maintain that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.570 
temperature and maintain that
temperature<00:02:16.230> so<00:02:16.740> you're<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:16.980> constantly

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
temperature so you're not constantly

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.540 
temperature so you're not constantly
reaching<00:02:17.820> down<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.150> fiddling<00:02:18.810> with<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.550> now

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
reaching down and fiddling with it now

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.760 
reaching down and fiddling with it now
