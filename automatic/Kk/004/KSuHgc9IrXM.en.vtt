you're going to gauge that glute this is
going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> help<00:00:48.329> neutralize<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.440> lumbar

going to help neutralize this lumbar

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.529 
going to help neutralize this lumbar
spine<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> stretch<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.420> hamstring<00:00:53.539> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
spine as you stretch this hamstring so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.479 
spine as you stretch this hamstring so
in<00:00:54.629> order<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> stretch<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.079> hamstring<00:00:55.710> we're

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
in order to stretch the hamstring we're

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
in order to stretch the hamstring we're
going<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.670> drop<00:00:56.910> our<00:00:57.120> chest<00:00:57.390> forward<00:00:57.899> closer

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
going to drop our chest forward closer

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580 
going to drop our chest forward closer
to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> knee<00:00:59.719> now<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.899> I'm<00:01:01.019> looking<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to the knee now what I'm looking for

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
to the knee now what I'm looking for
with<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:02.010> effective<00:01:02.399> hamstring<00:01:02.850> stretch<00:01:03.149> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
with an effective hamstring stretch is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.800 
with an effective hamstring stretch is
that<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.960> pelvis<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.830> rotating<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:06.509> if

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
that the pelvis is not rotating so if

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.900 
that the pelvis is not rotating so if
this<00:01:06.990> hip<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> way<00:01:08.340> inch<00:01:08.640> back

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
this hip is not all the way inch back

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.760 
this hip is not all the way inch back
then<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.660> very<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.200> stretch<00:01:10.530> going

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
then there's very little stretch going

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.830 
then there's very little stretch going
on<00:01:10.950> within<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> hamstring<00:01:11.670> muscle<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.630> be

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
on within the hamstring muscle so be

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
on within the hamstring muscle so be
sure<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> keep<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.350> pelvis<00:01:13.710> square<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> your

hamstrings to get the upper portion of

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
hamstrings to get the upper portion of
the<00:01:20.490> hamstring<00:01:20.909> closer<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> insertion

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the hamstring closer to the insertion

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
the hamstring closer to the insertion
you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.650> flex<00:01:22.979> your<00:01:23.159> knee<00:01:23.400> slightly<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.119> drop

rounding your shoulders forward a lot of
times<00:01:41.340> people<00:01:41.820> will<00:01:41.909> try<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.149> reach<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.630> touch

their toes while they round their
shoulders<00:01:44.399> forward<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> not<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
shoulders forward this is not going to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
shoulders forward this is not going to
stretch<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.259> hamstring<00:01:46.649> effectively<00:01:47.189> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
stretch the hamstring effectively so

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.270 
stretch the hamstring effectively so
keep<00:01:48.000> those<00:01:48.149> shoulders<00:01:48.509> retracted<00:01:49.020> back<00:01:49.280> and

keep those shoulders retracted back and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.830 
keep those shoulders retracted back and
it<00:01:50.430> doesn't<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:50.850> much<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> forward<00:01:51.689> lean

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it doesn't take much in a forward lean

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.510 
it doesn't take much in a forward lean
