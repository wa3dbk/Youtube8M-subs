00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
going over the plans here cucumbers are

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.880 
going over the plans here cucumbers are
doing<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.590> well<00:00:37.890> i<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:39.890> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
doing really really well i think the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
doing really really well i think the
leaks<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.059> darn<00:00:42.300> hard<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.870> here

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
leaks are just so darn hard to see here

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.000 
leaks are just so darn hard to see here
there's<00:00:43.260> almost<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.680> Eric<00:00:44.219> thin<00:00:46.010> enough

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
there's almost like Eric thin enough

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.180 
there's almost like Eric thin enough
they'll<00:00:47.219> pick<00:00:47.430> up<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.850> same

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.740 

it's<00:00:52.609> hard<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:52.879> tell<00:00:53.090> my<00:00:53.300> little<00:00:53.480> viewfinder

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's hard to tell my little viewfinder

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.299 
it's hard to tell my little viewfinder
here<00:00:54.260> what's<00:00:54.649> uh<00:00:54.859> what's<00:00:56.289> going<00:00:57.289> on<00:00:57.500> leaks<00:00:58.100> but

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
here what's uh what's going on leaks but

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.130 
here what's uh what's going on leaks but
you<00:00:59.030> take<00:00:59.180> my<00:00:59.329> word<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.809> that<00:00:59.839> they're

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
you take my word for that they're

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.930 
you take my word for that they're
anywhere<00:01:00.890> from<00:01:01.129> three<00:01:01.399> quarters<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:01.760> an<00:01:01.879> inch

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940

anywhere from three quarters of an inch
to<00:01:02.269> about<00:01:02.510> two<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.230> half<00:01:03.260> inches<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.009> they

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
to about two and a half inches so they

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.480 
to about two and a half inches so they
really<00:01:04.369> come<00:01:04.729> up<00:01:05.140> basil<00:01:06.140> has<00:01:06.619> got<00:01:07.310> its

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
secondary leaves all the way around so

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.600 
secondary leaves all the way around so
these<00:01:12.140> kinds<00:01:12.530> looking<00:01:12.770> pretty<00:01:13.040> darn<00:01:13.250> healthy

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
these kinds looking pretty darn healthy

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.580 
these kinds looking pretty darn healthy
happy<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.950> tomatoes<00:01:16.690> are<00:01:17.690> quickly<00:01:18.049> catching

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
happy and tomatoes are quickly catching

happy and tomatoes are quickly catching
up<00:01:18.710> with<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.100> transplants<00:01:19.789> in<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.030> garden<00:01:20.720> so

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
up with the transplants in the garden so

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.070 
up with the transplants in the garden so
kind<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.030> racing<00:01:23.330> them<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.509> have<00:01:23.659> some<00:01:23.810> Tramp

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
kind of racing them I have some Tramp

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.300 
kind of racing them I have some Tramp
runs<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.470> garden<00:01:24.740> will<00:01:24.860> show<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.250> a

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
runs in the garden will show you in a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.560 
runs in the garden will show you in a
little<00:01:25.490> bit<00:01:25.670> we're<00:01:26.270> gonna<00:01:26.330> have<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.539> little

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
little bit we're gonna have a little

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.130 
little bit we're gonna have a little
race<00:01:26.840> see<00:01:27.200> which<00:01:27.350> grows<00:01:27.619> faster<00:01:28.130> I<00:01:29.060> have<00:01:29.840> had<00:01:30.110> a

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
race see which grows faster I have had a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.350 
race see which grows faster I have had a
few<00:01:30.319> complications<00:01:30.950> here<00:01:31.550> so<00:01:31.819> i<00:01:31.850> think<00:01:32.090> that

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
few complications here so i think that

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.630 
few complications here so i think that
the<00:01:32.509> growth<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.500> these<00:01:33.800> plants<00:01:34.490> might

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
the growth of these plants might

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.550 
the growth of these plants might
actually<00:01:34.819> be<00:01:35.060> somewhat<00:01:35.390> stunted<00:01:35.869> i<00:01:35.990> decided

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
actually be somewhat stunted i decided

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.529 
actually be somewhat stunted i decided
to<00:01:36.619> put<00:01:36.740> snails<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.759> top<00:01:37.970> tank<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.360> keep

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
to put snails in the top tank to keep

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.690 
to put snails in the top tank to keep
the<00:01:38.659> algae<00:01:38.990> down<00:01:39.140> problem<00:01:40.069> is<00:01:40.190> they<00:01:40.369> kept

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
the algae down problem is they kept

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.880 
the algae down problem is they kept
clogging<00:01:41.240> up<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.450> system<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:42.380> I'd<00:01:42.500> come<00:01:42.740> home

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
clogging up the system so I'd come home

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.460 
clogging up the system so I'd come home
from<00:01:43.159> work<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:44.479> grow<00:01:44.659> beds<00:01:44.929> would<00:01:45.080> be<00:01:45.200> dry

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
from work and the grow beds would be dry

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.620 
from work and the grow beds would be dry
fish<00:01:46.039> would<00:01:46.220> seem<00:01:46.429> to<00:01:46.700> be<00:01:46.759> dead<00:01:47.030> because<00:01:47.240> there

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
fish would seem to be dead because there

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.559 
fish would seem to be dead because there
was<00:01:47.720> no<00:01:47.869> oxygen<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> I<00:01:49.369> lost<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.970> lot<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.270> fish

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
was no oxygen so I lost a lot of fish

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.930 
was no oxygen so I lost a lot of fish
it's<00:01:51.440> true<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.100> lot<00:01:52.220> of<00:01:52.340> fish<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.640> I<00:01:52.700> I

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's true that's a lot of fish and I I

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.630 
it's true that's a lot of fish and I I
worry<00:01:53.899> about<00:01:53.960> some<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.350> plants<00:01:54.799> oh<00:01:54.979> by<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
worry about some the plants oh by the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.540 
worry about some the plants oh by the
way<00:01:55.759> they<00:01:55.970> can't<00:01:56.780> see<00:01:56.989> it<00:01:57.080> valve<00:01:57.289> at<00:01:57.440> the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
way they can't see it valve at the

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.619 
way they can't see it valve at the
chilis<00:01:58.550> are<00:01:58.700> finally<00:01:58.970> starting<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.330> sprout<00:01:59.569> a

00:01:59.619 --> 00:01:59.629 
chilis are finally starting to sprout a

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:01.300 
chilis are finally starting to sprout a
little<00:01:59.899> bit<00:02:00.020> it's<00:02:00.530> kind<00:02:00.739> of<00:02:00.830> sticking<00:02:01.129> out

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
little bit it's kind of sticking out

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.330 
little bit it's kind of sticking out
