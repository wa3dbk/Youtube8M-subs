00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.830
 our products go out to all 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.419
 Our customers can show you each 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.689
 one of the productive stage consumptions 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.689
 per stage 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.800

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560
 yes 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.200
 I have been depending on what has 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.150
 be in Brazil and in the USA and not 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.880
 leaves nothing to envy to another party and 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.790
 customers are proud that their 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.220
 machines the casters are manufactured 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.890
 Cordoba is nice to see how they are made 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.460
 really how the machinery is assembled 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.460
 that does not use 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.420
 It impacts me too much because it's very 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.550
 well assembled very well armadito 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.920
 and good and as a user of the brand the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.950
 I'm surprised because I have 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.390
 this here solves several problems that 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.530
 is a good option so that 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.620
 we have in our country in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.709
 working well and I'm not 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:40.360
 I can say nothing because one thing that I never 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:43.180
 I have seen in my almost 50 years of work in 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.010
 the field the truth that is beautiful me 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.739
 love 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.140
 I really like the explanation they give 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.510
 about cutting as low is not true 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.940
 is armed until you reach the line 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.610
 of armed or not of end full of 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.970
 satisfaction and emotion but I also 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.850
 liked of this tour is to give you the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.540
 gestures and face the customers see the 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:11.799
 Satisfaction face surprise face 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.879
 the face of in some of proud of what 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.879
 they were watching so I did not have it 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.879
 programmed 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.060

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.200
 brand so they can know us more in 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.210
 depth can get closer behind 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 its concessionaires or indirectly the 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.510
