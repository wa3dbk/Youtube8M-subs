here's a mixer take this off very very

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.880 
here's a mixer take this off very very
nice<00:03:52.480> it's<00:03:53.480> actually<00:03:53.660> pretty<00:03:54.020> it's<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.680> pretty

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
nice it's actually pretty it's a pretty

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.910

big<00:03:55.070> size<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.940> can<00:03:55.970> never<00:03:56.180> tell<00:03:56.510> from<00:03:56.920> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
big size and you can never tell from the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.520 
big size and you can never tell from the
videos<00:03:58.280> especially<00:03:59.060> on<00:03:59.540> youtube<00:03:59.930> or<00:04:00.170> anything

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
videos especially on youtube or anything

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
videos especially on youtube or anything
like<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:01.480> how<00:04:02.480> big<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.870> mixer<00:04:03.260> is<00:04:03.410> if<00:04:04.340> you're

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
like that how big the mixer is if you're

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.900 
like that how big the mixer is if you're
familiar<00:04:04.670> with<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.150> djm<00:04:05.780> 400<00:04:06.110> mixer<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:07.880> a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
familiar with the djm 400 mixer it's a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.699 
familiar with the djm 400 mixer it's a
lot<00:04:08.090> bigger<00:04:08.300> than<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:12.380> there's<00:04:12.530> like<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
lot bigger than that so there's like a

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.140 
lot bigger than that so there's like a
pretty<00:04:12.890> big<00:04:13.130> mixer<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.520> don't<00:04:13.790> know<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:14.030> don't

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
pretty big mixer I don't know I don't

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.430 
pretty big mixer I don't know I don't
even<00:04:14.330> know<00:04:14.510> if<00:04:14.600> this<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.780> going<00:04:14.990> to<00:04:15.050> fit<00:04:15.230> in<00:04:15.350> my

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
even know if this is going to fit in my

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.759 
even know if this is going to fit in my
mixer<00:04:15.620> case<00:04:16.209> because<00:04:17.290> right<00:04:18.290> now<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.470> currently

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
mixer case because right now I currently

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.900 
mixer case because right now I currently
have<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.100> Stanton<00:04:19.670> em<00:04:20.030> to<00:04:20.330> a7<00:04:20.810> mixer<00:04:21.910> but

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
have the Stanton em to a7 mixer but

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.960 
have the Stanton em to a7 mixer but
anyways<00:04:23.270> here's<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.600> mixer<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:25.250> looks

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
anyways here's a mixer just looks

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.780 
anyways here's a mixer just looks
exactly<00:04:26.360> like<00:04:26.630> any<00:04:27.020> other<00:04:27.490> video<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:28.700> you

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
exactly like any other video that you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:40.640 
exactly like any other video that you
may<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.090> seen<00:04:29.720> on<00:04:31.420> YouTube

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:49.189 

q<00:04:41.280> Sampat<00:04:41.880> buttons<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.540> side<00:04:43.729> later<00:04:48.199> the

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
q Sampat buttons on the side later the

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.920 
q Sampat buttons on the side later the
nice<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:49.710> smooth<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.580> little<00:04:51.509> bit<00:04:51.600> of<00:04:51.630> tension

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
nice and smooth a little bit of tension

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.409 
nice and smooth a little bit of tension
on<00:04:52.229> them<00:04:52.380> but<00:04:52.860> those<00:04:53.759> really<00:04:54.090> aren't<00:04:54.270> made<00:04:54.389> for

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
on them but those really aren't made for

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.219 
on them but those really aren't made for
scratching<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.139> know<00:04:55.199> this<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.680> adjustable

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
scratching I know this is adjustable

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.400 
scratching I know this is adjustable
using<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:59.820> little<00:05:00.120> hole<00:05:00.300> right<00:05:00.330> there<00:05:00.570> I'm

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
using that little hole right there I'm

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.590 
using that little hole right there I'm
guessing<00:05:01.919> there's<00:05:02.130> a<00:05:02.190> tool<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.789> don't<00:05:03.419> know<00:05:03.509> if

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
guessing there's a tool I don't know if

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.029 
guessing there's a tool I don't know if
it<00:05:03.690> came<00:05:03.810> with<00:05:03.990> one<00:05:04.169> but<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> got<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:04.800> figure

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
it came with one but I got to figure

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.749 
it came with one but I got to figure
that<00:05:05.190> out<00:05:07.970> I'm<00:05:08.970> not<00:05:09.090> going<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.300> go<00:05:09.449> into<00:05:09.720> detail

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
that out I'm not going to go into detail

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.620 
that out I'm not going to go into detail
explaining<00:05:11.759> everything<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.479> guys

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
explaining everything to you guys

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.060 
explaining everything to you guys
because<00:05:12.870> there's<00:05:13.199> other<00:05:13.350> videos<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.770> do

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
because there's other videos that do

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.700 
because there's other videos that do
that<00:05:14.250> but<00:05:15.240> i<00:05:15.270> will<00:05:15.570> be<00:05:15.600> doing<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.110> video

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
that but i will be doing a video

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.010 
that but i will be doing a video
tutorial<00:05:17.130> on<00:05:18.620> setting<00:05:19.620> up<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:21.150> mixer<00:05:21.660> with

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
tutorial on setting up this mixer with

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.460 
tutorial on setting up this mixer with
serato<00:05:22.800> and<00:05:23.870> it's<00:05:24.870> actually<00:05:25.020> going<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.350> be<00:05:25.410> a

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
serato and it's actually going to be a

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.200 
serato and it's actually going to be a
learning<00:05:25.680> process<00:05:25.949> for<00:05:26.160> me<00:05:26.370> because<00:05:26.880> this<00:05:27.030> is

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
learning process for me because this is

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.820 
learning process for me because this is
my<00:05:27.360> first<00:05:27.389> middy<00:05:28.250> mixer<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.410> midi<00:05:31.410> controller

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
my first middy mixer and midi controller

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.159 
my first middy mixer and midi controller
for<00:05:31.949> that<00:05:32.220> matter<00:05:32.430> I've<00:05:32.729> never<00:05:32.940> had<00:05:33.210> anything

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
for that matter I've never had anything

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.040 
for that matter I've never had anything
MIDI<00:05:34.590> before<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:36.300> learning<00:05:36.630> experience

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
MIDI before so to learning experience

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.409 
MIDI before so to learning experience
for<00:05:37.080> me<00:05:37.320> but<00:05:37.979> I've<00:05:38.070> seen<00:05:38.280> some<00:05:38.520> videos<00:05:38.970> on

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
for me but I've seen some videos on

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.230 
for me but I've seen some videos on
YouTube<00:05:39.840> on<00:05:40.050> how<00:05:40.229> to<00:05:40.289> do<00:05:40.530> certain<00:05:41.490> mapping<00:05:42.060> and

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
YouTube on how to do certain mapping and

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.060 
YouTube on how to do certain mapping and
stuff<00:05:42.509> with<00:05:42.750> other<00:05:42.930> controllers<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.830> it

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
stuff with other controllers and it

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.040 
stuff with other controllers and it
doesn't<00:05:44.370> seem<00:05:44.520> too<00:05:44.699> hard<00:05:44.729> so<00:05:45.210> I'll<00:05:45.900> be

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
doesn't seem too hard so I'll be

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.560 
doesn't seem too hard so I'll be
figuring<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.560> out<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.310> i'll<00:05:48.060> be<00:05:48.180> putting<00:05:48.389> on

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
figuring that out and i'll be putting on

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.820 
figuring that out and i'll be putting on
another<00:05:48.690> video<00:05:48.990> soon<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.340> stay<00:05:50.400> tuned
