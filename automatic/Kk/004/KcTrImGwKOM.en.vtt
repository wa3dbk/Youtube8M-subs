but<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.110> still<00:00:01.469> want<00:00:01.740> them<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:02.010> be<00:00:02.159> thinking

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
but I still want them to be thinking

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.370 
but I still want them to be thinking
patterns<00:00:03.000> now<00:00:03.570> what<00:00:03.780> if<00:00:03.870> you're<00:00:04.020> an<00:00:04.110> advanced

okay<00:00:05.250> so<00:00:05.700> you're<00:00:05.850> playing<00:00:06.060> F<00:00:06.299> natural<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:07.020> the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
okay so you're playing F natural on the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.700 
okay so you're playing F natural on the
E<00:00:07.830> string<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.670> an<00:00:08.790> e<00:00:09.110> fourth<00:00:10.110> finger<00:00:10.440> on<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> a

E string to an e fourth finger on the a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.789 
E string to an e fourth finger on the a
string<00:00:11.420> it's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> pretty<00:00:12.690> big<00:00:12.960> pattern<00:00:13.410> you

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
string it's a pretty big pattern you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.589 
string it's a pretty big pattern you
have<00:00:13.910> building<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.030> up<00:00:15.120> from<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> string

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

to three whole step pattern from three
to<00:00:24.210> four<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.050> whole<00:00:25.320> whole<00:00:25.710> whole<00:00:26.900> so

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
to four so you have whole whole whole so

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.070 
to four so you have whole whole whole so
while<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:29.250> half<00:00:29.460> step<00:00:29.490> in

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
while this is really just a half step in

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.010 
while this is really just a half step in

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
pitch F natural to e if you play it from

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.950 
pitch F natural to e if you play it from
one<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> four<00:00:34.910> you<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.090> whole<00:00:36.390> whole<00:00:36.690> whole

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
one to four you have whole whole whole

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.549 
one to four you have whole whole whole
now<00:00:37.829> if<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.219> practicing<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:40.320> you're

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
now if you're practicing this and you're

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.299 
now if you're practicing this and you're
not<00:00:40.590> thinking<00:00:41.719> patterns<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.100> probably

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
not thinking patterns you can probably

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.100 
not thinking patterns you can probably
still<00:00:44.550> play<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:44.910> tune<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.690> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> thought

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
still play it in tune but if you thought

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.750 
still play it in tune but if you thought
well<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.469> whole<00:00:46.649> whole<00:00:46.890> whole<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.640> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
well it's whole whole whole would you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
well it's whole whole whole would you
have<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> better<00:00:48.149> shot<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.510> finding<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.280> what<00:00:50.280> if

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
have a better shot at finding it what if

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.600 
have a better shot at finding it what if
you<00:00:50.489> start<00:00:50.730> from<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.969> f-sharp<00:00:52.460> you<00:00:53.460> could

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you start from an f-sharp you could

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.529 
you start from an f-sharp you could
think<00:00:53.730> half-step<00:00:54.449> whole-step<00:00:54.480> whole-step<00:00:56.539> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
think half-step whole-step whole-step so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
think half-step whole-step whole-step so
it<00:00:57.690> feels<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.789> put<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it feels like that now don't put the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.990 
it feels like that now don't put the
inner<00:01:00.239> fingers<00:01:00.570> down<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.199> about<00:01:01.500> them

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
inner fingers down but think about them

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
inner fingers down but think about them
you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> note<00:01:04.939> one

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
you can have it just over the note one

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.609 
you can have it just over the note one
rule<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.330> string<00:01:06.540> crossing<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.320> should<00:01:07.530> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
rule in string crossing this should be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.620 
rule in string crossing this should be
on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> side<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.909> leave<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.479> old

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
on the side is that you leave the old

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.469 
on the side is that you leave the old
finger<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.490> until<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> new<00:01:11.790> finger<00:01:12.119> begins

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
finger down until the new finger begins

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
finger down until the new finger begins
so<00:01:13.290> even<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.010> you're<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:14.850> doing<00:01:15.240> block

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so even if you're not doing block

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.990 
so even if you're not doing block
fingering<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.560> leave<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.580> until

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
fingering you leave your one down until

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
fingering you leave your one down until
your<00:01:18.150> four<00:01:18.360> begins<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.080> then<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.650> can<00:01:19.830> lift

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
your four begins and then you can lift

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
your four begins and then you can lift
it<00:01:20.189> okay<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.720> hedging<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.259> bets

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it okay so I'm hedging my bets

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.179 
it okay so I'm hedging my bets
you<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.740> students

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you both but I think that if students

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.109 
you both but I think that if students
don't<00:01:26.430> think<00:01:26.820> intervals<00:01:27.390> patterns<00:01:28.790> it's<00:01:29.790> very

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
don't think intervals patterns it's very

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
don't think intervals patterns it's very
hard<00:01:30.560> see<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> violin

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
hard see I like to think of the violin

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.609 
hard see I like to think of the violin
as<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> keyboard<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.479> like<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.290> piano

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
as a keyboard I like to see the piano

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.280 
as a keyboard I like to see the piano
you<00:01:34.979> know<00:01:35.640> e<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> F<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> black<00:01:37.020> note

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you know e to F is there a black note

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
you know e to F is there a black note
between<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.890> B<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> C<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> black<00:01:39.210> note

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
between it B to C is there a black note

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.319 
between it B to C is there a black note
between<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.990> no<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.590> half-step<00:01:41.040> C<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.970> D<00:01:42.150> is

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
between it no it's a half-step C to D is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.969 
between it no it's a half-step C to D is
there<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> black<00:01:42.659> note<00:01:42.899> between<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.380> absolutely

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
there a black note between it absolutely

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
there a black note between it absolutely
so<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> violin<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.450> there's<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.689> black<00:01:45.899> note

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so on the violin if there's a black note

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
so on the violin if there's a black note
between<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.369> there's<00:01:47.490> not

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
between it it's this and if there's not

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.249 
between it it's this and if there's not
it's<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.930> start<00:01:49.110> thinking

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's this and if you start thinking

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.090 
it's this and if you start thinking
everything<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.729> terms<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.750> patterns

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
everything you know in terms of patterns
