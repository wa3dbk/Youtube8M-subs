wire<00:00:20.279> during<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.900> middle<00:00:22.110> if<00:00:22.230> you're<00:00:22.349> in<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
wire during the middle if you're in the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.100 
wire during the middle if you're in the
middle<00:00:22.649> of<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.860> project<00:00:23.239> so<00:00:24.239> in<00:00:24.540> this<00:00:24.689> case<00:00:24.960> I

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
middle of a project so in this case I

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.620 
middle of a project so in this case I
just<00:00:25.140> have<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.439> little<00:00:25.649> bit<00:00:25.770> of<00:00:25.860> wire<00:00:26.040> left<00:00:26.630> you

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
just have a little bit of wire left you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.240 
just have a little bit of wire left you
can<00:00:27.779> see<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.110> the<00:00:28.140> middle<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.739> weave

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
can see I'm in the middle of a weave

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.319 
can see I'm in the middle of a weave
here<00:00:29.669> so<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:30.989> want<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.829> see<00:00:32.040> how<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
here so what I want to do is see how the

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
here so what I want to do is see how the
wrap<00:00:33.329> wraps<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.899> both<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.920> wires

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
wrap wraps around both of these wires

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
wrap wraps around both of these wires
well<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> don't<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> trim<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
well you don't want to trim it at that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
well you don't want to trim it at that
point<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.720> trim<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.200> it's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
point you want to trim it when it's

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.550 
point you want to trim it when it's
wrapped<00:00:40.590> around<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.070> single<00:00:41.670> wire<00:00:42.560> mostly

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
wrapped around a single wire mostly

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.470 
wrapped around a single wire mostly
because<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:44.100> creates<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.730> tighter<00:00:46.100> coil

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
because it just creates a tighter coil

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.290 
because it just creates a tighter coil
it's<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.810> more<00:00:48.960> secure<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it's a little more secure so what I

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.220 
it's a little more secure so what I
generally<00:00:51.810> like<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.740> wrap<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:54.230> you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
generally like to do is to wrap it you

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.480 
generally like to do is to wrap it you
know<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> middle<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.250> doing

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
know get in the middle that I'm doing

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.140 
know get in the middle that I'm doing
three<00:00:57.240> coils<00:00:58.010> around<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.310> single<00:00:59.520> wire<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
three coils around a single wire and

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.360 
three coils around a single wire and
then<00:01:00.270> three<00:01:00.540> coils<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.110> both<00:01:01.530> wires<00:01:01.860> so

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
then three coils around both wires so

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.999 
then three coils around both wires so
you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.960> first<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.379> second<00:01:04.769> coil

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
you know in the first or second coil

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.120 
you know in the first or second coil
around<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.509> wire<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.229> want<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> go<00:01:08.009> ahead

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
around the one wire I want to go ahead

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.990 
around the one wire I want to go ahead
and<00:01:08.340> trim<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.149> I'm<00:01:09.540> using<00:01:09.840> flush<00:01:10.200> nose

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
and trim it with my I'm using flush nose

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.410 
and trim it with my I'm using flush nose
or<00:01:12.080> super<00:01:13.080> flush<00:01:13.290> wire<00:01:14.070> cutters<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
or super flush wire cutters and so I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.160 
or super flush wire cutters and so I
want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:15.930> close<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.800> possible<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
want to get as close as possible and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.950 
want to get as close as possible and
trim<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:21.810> I'll<00:01:21.930> use

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
trim that little bit and then I'll use

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.649 
trim that little bit and then I'll use
my<00:01:22.350> pliers<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.909> sort<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> just<00:01:24.600> roll<00:01:25.049> that

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
my pliers to sort of just roll that

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.940 
my pliers to sort of just roll that
trimmed<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:29.479> around<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:31.140> wire<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.740> gonna

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
trimmed and around the wire I'm gonna

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
trimmed and around the wire I'm gonna
test<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.760> finger<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:34.020> sure

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
test it with your finger just make sure

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.640 
test it with your finger just make sure
nothing<00:01:34.409> sharp<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.280> sticking<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> there

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
nothing sharp is sticking out of there

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.039 
nothing sharp is sticking out of there
then<00:01:37.650> I've<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:37.979> new<00:01:38.280> wire<00:01:38.670> length<00:01:39.090> cut<00:01:39.600> see

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
then I've got my new wire length cut see

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
then I've got my new wire length cut see
if<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.650> focus<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> I've<00:01:44.430> got

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
if I can get this in focus so I've got

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.230 
if I can get this in focus so I've got
my<00:01:44.820> new<00:01:45.000> wire<00:01:45.240> length<00:01:45.600> cut<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> basically<00:01:47.850> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
my new wire length cut and basically and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.109 
my new wire length cut and basically and
it<00:01:48.299> doesn't<00:01:48.659> matter<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.260> like<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.979> try<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> make

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it doesn't matter I like to try to make

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.109 
it doesn't matter I like to try to make
the<00:01:51.390> wire<00:01:51.570> ends<00:01:52.490> point<00:01:53.490> towards<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the wire ends point towards the back of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.320 
the wire ends point towards the back of
the<00:01:54.330> piece<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.740> I've<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.280> end<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
the piece so here I've got the end and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.820 
the piece so here I've got the end and
I'm<00:01:57.720> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.900> stick<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.260> in<00:01:58.380> between<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.740> two

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
I'm going to stick it in between the two

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.340 
I'm going to stick it in between the two
wires<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.540> holding<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.080> tail

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
wires like this I'm holding the tail

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469 
wires like this I'm holding the tail
back<00:02:02.010> here<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.549> holding<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.000> place<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> my

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
back here just holding it in place of my

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.480 
back here just holding it in place of my
finger<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:05.040> I'm<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.220> going<00:02:05.400> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
finger and then I'm just going to

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.979 
finger and then I'm just going to
continue<00:02:06.830> finishing<00:02:07.830> off<00:02:08.250> those<00:02:08.610> those<00:02:09.450> coils

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
continue finishing off those those coils

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.089 
continue finishing off those those coils
on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.560> wire<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:13.159> then<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:16.099> three

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
on the one wire and then do the three

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.030 
on the one wire and then do the three
coils<00:02:17.549> around<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.150> two<00:02:18.359> wires

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
coils around the two wires

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.690 
coils around the two wires
and<00:02:21.299> then<00:02:22.299> continue<00:02:23.230> on<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.829> pattern<00:02:24.459> of

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and then continue on with the pattern of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580 
and then continue on with the pattern of
the<00:02:24.760> weave<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.360> that's<00:02:25.870> really<00:02:26.079> all<00:02:26.290> there<00:02:26.439> is

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
the weave and that's really all there is

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.580 
the weave and that's really all there is
to<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.890> once<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:28.470> situated<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to it once you get this situated a

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.520 
to it once you get this situated a
little<00:02:29.799> bit<00:02:29.950> once<00:02:30.189> you<00:02:30.250> get<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.549> started<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
little bit once you get it started and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.770 
little bit once you get it started and
you've<00:02:32.530> got<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:33.310> know<00:02:33.459> several<00:02:34.090> rotations<00:02:35.049> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
you've got you know several rotations of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.479 
you've got you know several rotations of
the<00:02:37.780> weave<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.170> place<00:02:39.390> then<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.420> can<00:02:40.569> go<00:02:40.900> back

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
the weave in place then you can go back

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.559 
the weave in place then you can go back
flip<00:02:42.489> your<00:02:42.640> piece<00:02:42.819> over<00:02:43.439> take<00:02:44.439> your<00:02:45.569> cutters

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
flip your piece over take your cutters

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.099 
flip your piece over take your cutters
and<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.709> get<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.129> close<00:02:48.730> as<00:02:49.150> possible<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.780> that

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
and and get as close as possible to that

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.509 
and and get as close as possible to that
make<00:02:50.890> sure<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.900> push<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.109> trimmed<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:54.220> cut

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
make sure you push the trimmed the cut

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.069 
make sure you push the trimmed the cut
end<00:02:55.260> flush<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:57.359> test<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.569> make<00:02:58.750> sure<00:02:58.900> that

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
end flush and test it to make sure that

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.589 
end flush and test it to make sure that
there's<00:02:59.379> no<00:02:59.500> sharp<00:03:00.310> bits<00:03:00.609> pointed<00:03:01.150> out<00:03:01.299> and

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
there's no sharp bits pointed out and

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.509 
there's no sharp bits pointed out and
that's<00:03:02.109> really<00:03:02.290> all<00:03:02.530> there<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.250> add

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
that's really all there is to it to add

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.720 
that's really all there is to it to add
a<00:03:03.549> new<00:03:03.819> wire<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.359> a<00:03:04.389> project<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> like<00:03:06.579> to

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
a new wire to a project what I like to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.869 
a new wire to a project what I like to
do<00:03:06.909> once<00:03:07.599> I<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> few<00:03:08.319> rotations<00:03:09.280> going<00:03:09.730> of

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
do once I get a few rotations going of

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.179 
do once I get a few rotations going of
the<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.420> weave<00:03:10.599> that<00:03:10.750> I'm<00:03:10.870> working<00:03:11.019> on<00:03:11.260> use<00:03:12.040> my

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
the the weave that I'm working on use my

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.030 
the the weave that I'm working on use my
fingernails<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.970> kind<00:03:13.209> of<00:03:13.269> press<00:03:13.900> press<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
fingernails and kind of press press the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.759 
fingernails and kind of press press the
weave<00:03:15.220> together<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.720> helps<00:03:17.409> a<00:03:17.530> little

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
weave together and that helps a little

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.690 
weave together and that helps a little
bit<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.250> hiding<00:03:19.030> any<00:03:19.530> areas<00:03:20.530> where<00:03:21.159> there

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
bit in hiding any areas where there

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.110 
bit in hiding any areas where there
might<00:03:21.849> be<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:22.030> small<00:03:22.269> gap<00:03:22.769> due<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.310> start<00:03:25.000> of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
might be a small gap due to the start of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.890 
might be a small gap due to the start of
the<00:03:25.299> new<00:03:25.480> wire<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.760> that's<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.180> when<00:03:28.629> it<00:03:28.750> comes

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
the new wire and that's it when it comes

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.220 
the new wire and that's it when it comes
to<00:03:29.349> adding<00:03:30.250> new<00:03:30.280> wire<00:03:30.639> to<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> project<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.840> hope

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to adding new wire to a project I hope

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.860 
to adding new wire to a project I hope
