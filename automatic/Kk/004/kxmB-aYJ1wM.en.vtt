the<00:00:40.350> problem<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.219> think<00:00:41.550> that

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the problem is I just don't think that

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.010 
the problem is I just don't think that
there<00:00:41.760> are<00:00:41.790> enough<00:00:42.030> detection<00:00:42.540> methods<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
there are enough detection methods to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
there are enough detection methods to
suit<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.350> needs<00:00:43.410> here<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.280> that's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
suit our needs here and I think that's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
suit our needs here and I think that's
the<00:00:44.610> root<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> problem<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> an<00:00:46.170> itch

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the root of the problem that is an itch

that we need to fill so we're ditching
the<00:00:48.210> tranny<00:00:48.450> dark<00:00:48.660> project<00:00:48.840> we're<00:00:49.140> not

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
need to think broader something that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
need to think broader something that
looks<00:00:52.949> out<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.520> world<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> seize
