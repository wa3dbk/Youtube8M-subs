00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.650
 hello to all that such a welcome one day 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.320
 more to the channel today I bring you some 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.020
 you bought what I did in sephora yesterday 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.080
 I went shopping and a little bit are not 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.760
 many things but money, so it's 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.289
 a little bit I behaved quite a bit 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.060
 well still so from time to time a 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.410
 caprice is not bad given so if 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.259
 you want to see what I bought, stay 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.009
 to watch the video the first thing that I teach you 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.989
 it's a benefit kit is this here is 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.790
 the special kit of Mother's Day is 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.790
 flame front line and wii flow 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.060
 and good is a kit that contains your 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.830
 products looks like a mask 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.350
 villarreal and a mini size of the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.899
 colony the whitmill and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.839
 that I've made a separate video for you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.670
 teach us by seeing what it costs 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.829
 what the products cost for their high 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 and others to see it is a bit 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.690
 because I thought it was quite interesting 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.210
 so around here I should more or less 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.090
 the video thumbnail is coming out and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.070
 if you click, you will see it and if not 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.200
 the information box htm the link to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
 video so you can see it if you 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.970
 interesting to see the kit so with this not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 I stop a lot and the next thing happens 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.960
 next you buy is from the brand nars 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.229
 it's the first thing I buy from hamar 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.850
 gray hair and I will not say it's the last but 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.159
 yes the rest of things I think 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.289
 you know pretty well that I'm not very no 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.050
 I am very in favor of spending too much on 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.270
 very expensive brands and to me for example more 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.240
 or benefit I find them quite expensive and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.520
 I spend every so much very much 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.159
 time but they are products for example 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 the benefits are products that I have not 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.530
 found the same and cheaper brands 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 although I searched for them and well searched and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.740
 scenes for more of the same from nars what 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:56.850
 that I fucked is the test is for eyelid 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.220
 is very typical of a base I put it for 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.070
 there 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.830
 hai you have it so I bought the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.200
 ce test for eyelids because the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.570
 proof is that I have already know the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 fashion and I have some more that I do not like 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:14.420
 you do the function well but not 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.970
 it lasts all day super well put to the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.100
 shadow and I was sick of listening to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.650
 talk about the headquarters test 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.840
 I decided to spend online 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.840
 buy it that state here 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.580
 the packaging does not seem to me 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.090
 especially monkey or anything like that is very 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.750
 simple 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:39.140
 has nothing and pre-base it also 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.819
 say it's super long for what it is 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.290
 because what is evidence is the part 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.110
 white and the handle of the super applicator 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.269
 long occupies a lot of time for what it is and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.080
 good applied the blush the test of 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.900
 blanquita is completely transparent 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.940
 in the eyelid and I have not yet tried alone 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.340
 today so I can not tell you much but 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 good at the moment it does not look bad there 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.440
 lots of reviews on her mogollÃ³n 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.870
 of great reviews and that's why I decided 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.459
 make the money in it so I already 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.660
 I will be counting and how happy looking for 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.150
 there costs 27 eurazos is super expensive but 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.680
 Well, I hope it's totally worth the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.480
 penalty and that not only you get euros 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.299
 thrown away I do not think so because I already tell you that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.750
 I thought a lot very much if I bought it 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.340
 or not to go, I decided you can, or by all 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.069
 the good things that people say about 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.900
 her so here is to see how 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.819
 then how will you be and if not then it is 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.910
 I say so in sephora have on offer 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.900
 all lipsticks except the last ones 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.780
 they took out that I do not know how 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 the rest call all the lines of 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.650
 normal greek sand in format 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.540
 liquid all are lowered to six 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.950
 euros so it was a good opportunity 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.280
 to chop 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.920
 I have caught two I fucked these two 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.129
 tell you that I took them because they are cloned 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.010
 of some of mack and another of nars so 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.049
 is the first thing that I show you is the line 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.870
 long-term does not put the name by 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.490
 no side the number is number 20 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.860
 sometimes it welcomes 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.860
 there you have it is number 20 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.780
 if I can open it, this is a red 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.190
 here is a red super super super nice 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.830
 it's a darker darker than I think 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.260
 that you are seeing it on the screen but 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.050
 It's super nice the only thing that does not put 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.730
 planted ahead how much quantity it brings but 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.770
 it seems super little to me because what is the 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.529
 bar is so super finite and it's up 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.749
 here there is no more 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.909
 and so the reds are worth not only 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:42.349
 a light too much us to finish the 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.669
 super fast but I think little 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:50.799
 amount as well as annotation and good to 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.799
 this is something extra 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:57.679
 so pigments super well and apart not 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:05:00.259
 dry nothing is matte finish and is the 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:03.199
 supposedly the clone of russian network of 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.239
 mac the famous russian red 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.099
 I do not have it on my mac but I touch 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:09.769
 tell you that I think it's a super red 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.939
 pretty and with what pigment and how well 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.969
 who talk about the duration of these 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:16.819
 labial and everything because I had to catch it 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:20.230
 there you have it the car that picked me up is 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:23.470
 of the screen lips stein 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.290
 there is this is a liquid lip 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.710
 also super super super mega ultra 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:32.950
 fixed is this kind of red is that not 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.020
 it's red itself because it's not red it's like 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.590
 a coral is the one that carried the post and if 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.850
 It looks very loose but it's like a coral 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.300
 super red with a pink dot is mice 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.700
 and this here you are going to see that it throws more 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.620
 pink that this is like a lot more luxury 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.020
 Dark as I live, so to speak 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.200
 some way is the dragon clone 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.480
 guerlain arts and says that it arrived and you 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.130
 I say and position is pretty dry in the 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.630
 lip puts that one transfers but yes 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.150
 what stain 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.150
 It has been a long time and stain 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.250
 I do not know if you will be able to see it but a 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.990
 little bit that stain still has 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.430
 It looks like it's going to last I'm going to 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.830
 I'm going to leave it for 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.550
 trade and everything to prove it to see what 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.050
 and I do not notice that I dry too much 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.000
 I do not notice that I'm anything uncomfortable 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.370
 take it to count, I notice that it is 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.080
 being quite comfortable and as long as a 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.480
 little more I think I'll go for some 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.910
 more because that's how euros are worth the 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.480
 sorry to buy them and it has already been these are 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.710
 The two that I bought wanted to buy 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.020
 lipsticks a little more special about 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.340
 all these two because it anchored ties of 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.230
 there are people who have compared them is 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.569
 which they are identical this study inclusion 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.779
 network and this is the 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:53.539
 dagong the one that did not come out of me dragon well 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:53.539
 what we said is number 100 0 3 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.310
 ah and sauce number 03 and it's that I already tell you 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.740

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.390
 Nice, both are beautiful and I'm 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.670
 very happy with the purchase and good not 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.290
 buying nothing else but I want to carry 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.050
 well in the rest of the month sometimes what 

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.580
 I do not expect anything that I have 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.800

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.060
