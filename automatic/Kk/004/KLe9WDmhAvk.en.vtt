don't even yeah
just<00:02:29.150> don't<00:02:30.150> be<00:02:30.390> idiot

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.309 

basically<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:38.040> reason<00:02:38.310> why<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.489> do<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.849> is

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
basically the reason why you do this is

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.190 
basically the reason why you do this is
so<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.739> take<00:02:41.190> all<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.700> dirt<00:02:41.910> way<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:43.079> all

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so now you take all the dirt way and all

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.710 
so now you take all the dirt way and all
the<00:02:43.319> grease<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.950> should<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.310> stuck<00:02:44.549> there

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
the grease that should be stuck there

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the grease that should be stuck there
shooting<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:48.030> apply<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:49.940> bond

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740
