so<00:00:35.730> inside<00:00:36.059> taking<00:00:36.390> some<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
so inside taking some of it I think so I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590 
so inside taking some of it I think so I
mean<00:00:38.340> obviously<00:00:38.460> guys<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> focus<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.450> man

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
mean obviously guys have to focus on man

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
mean obviously guys have to focus on man
those<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.899> big<00:00:40.020> big<00:00:40.530> long<00:00:40.890> athletic<00:00:41.489> guys<00:00:41.969> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
those are big big long athletic guys so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.619 
those are big big long athletic guys so
people<00:00:43.200> are<00:00:43.260> gonna<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.090> it<00:00:45.090> takes<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.450> lot

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
people are gonna have to it takes a lot

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
people are gonna have to it takes a lot
of<00:00:45.660> attention<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.950> block<00:00:47.160> him<00:00:47.340> off<00:00:47.489> keep<00:00:47.789> them

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of attention to block him off keep them

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.920 
of attention to block him off keep them
off<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> board<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.510> i<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> would

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
off the board so i think that would

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
off the board so i think that would
create<00:00:49.110> lanes<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.590> opportunity<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.160> me<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
create lanes and opportunity for me to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
create lanes and opportunity for me to
get<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> rim<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.930> putbacks<00:00:52.320> an<00:00:52.590> offensive

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
get to the rim for putbacks an offensive

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
get to the rim for putbacks an offensive
rebound<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.730> then<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.449> just<00:00:54.870> other<00:00:54.960> than

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
rebound and then what just other than

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
rebound and then what just other than
that<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.070> skill<00:00:56.370> set<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> think

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that and what what skill set you think

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
that and what what skill set you think
it's<00:00:57.030> most<00:00:57.239> heated<00:00:57.539> Mitch<00:00:57.930> Kupchak<00:00:58.260> liked<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it's most heated Mitch Kupchak liked and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's most heated Mitch Kupchak liked and
whatever<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.379> i'm<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.160> i'm
