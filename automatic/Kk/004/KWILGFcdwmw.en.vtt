in<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.429> game<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.759> can<00:00:12.090> say<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.300> really<00:00:12.630> do<00:00:12.809> enjoy

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
in this game I can say I really do enjoy

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.530 
in this game I can say I really do enjoy
them<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.440> think<00:00:14.070> they<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.490> far<00:00:15.330> better<00:00:15.420> than

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
them I think they are far better than

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.180 
them I think they are far better than
the<00:00:15.630> battlefield<00:00:16.020> 3<00:00:16.230> Jets<00:00:16.470> cuz<00:00:16.680> now<00:00:16.830> in

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the battlefield 3 Jets cuz now in

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.040 
the battlefield 3 Jets cuz now in
conquest<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> main<00:00:18.720> jet

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
conquest which is really the main jet

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.050 
conquest which is really the main jet
game<00:00:19.260> mode<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.920> was<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> main<00:00:20.369> jet<00:00:20.640> air<00:00:20.820> mode

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
game mode it was the main jet air mode

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.330 
game mode it was the main jet air mode
in<00:00:21.300> alpha<00:00:21.960> 3<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> mean<00:00:22.410> rush<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.920> an<00:00:23.070> attack

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
in alpha 3 I mean rush had an attack

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.769 
in alpha 3 I mean rush had an attack
sure<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.850> wasn't<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.570> popular

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
sure but it wasn't really that popular

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.480 
sure but it wasn't really that popular
because<00:00:25.320> only<00:00:25.590> one<00:00:25.769> person<00:00:26.099> could<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.250> it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
because only one person could have it

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.220 
because only one person could have it
whereas<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.269> conquest<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> could<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:27.990> four

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
whereas in conquest you could have four

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.859 
whereas in conquest you could have four
different<00:00:28.529> Jets<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.099> at<00:00:29.460> any<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
different Jets up at any one time but

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
different Jets up at any one time but
anyways<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> Jets<00:00:32.009> are<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> lot

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
anyways I think the Jets are a lot

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.100 
anyways I think the Jets are a lot
better<00:00:32.730> now<00:00:32.940> if<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.600> didn't<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:33.930> in

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
better now if you didn't know in

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
better now if you didn't know in
conquest<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.250> attack<00:00:35.520> jet<00:00:35.760> at

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
conquest now you get one attack jet at

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
conquest now you get one attack jet at
once<00:00:36.000> tell<00:00:36.210> Chet<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:37.170> stealth<00:00:37.530> jets<00:00:37.829> for

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
once tell Chet these stealth jets for

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
once tell Chet these stealth jets for
all<00:00:38.160> three<00:00:38.430> factions<00:00:38.670> are<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> j-20<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
all three factions are the j-20 for

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.900 
all three factions are the j-20 for
Japan<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.219> SU<00:00:41.879> 50<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:42.420> pak<00:00:42.690> fa<00:00:42.930> for<00:00:43.649> Russia<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
Japan the SU 50 or pak fa for Russia and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.650 
Japan the SU 50 or pak fa for Russia and
the<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:47.010> f-35<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> USA<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.300> by<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> way

the the f-35 for the USA and by the way

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
the the f-35 for the USA and by the way
the<00:00:48.809> f-35<00:00:49.379> honestly<00:00:49.860> makes<00:00:50.039> me<00:00:50.160> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> cry

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the f-35 honestly makes me want to cry

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
the f-35 honestly makes me want to cry
because<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.539> bad<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> worse

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620

a movement penalty compared to the other

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.859 
a movement penalty compared to the other
jets<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.400> look<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:06.299> nice<00:01:06.510> slow-mo

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

structuring<00:01:18.150> issues<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.630> footfall<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
structuring issues about footfall like I

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.890 
structuring issues about footfall like I
can<00:01:20.040> count<00:01:20.250> countless<00:01:21.000> times<00:01:21.299> I've<00:01:21.450> crashed<00:01:21.720> a

can count countless times I've crashed a

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.359 
can count countless times I've crashed a
jet<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.259> whatever<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.070> string

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
jet or whatever because it's a string

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.300 
jet or whatever because it's a string
and<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.299> actually<00:01:24.600> quite<00:01:25.049> bad<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.740> oh<00:01:25.979> well

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and it is actually quite bad but oh well

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
and it is actually quite bad but oh well
I<00:01:26.670> hope<00:01:26.939> deal<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.840> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I hope deal with it I do actually really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.770 
I hope deal with it I do actually really
enjoy<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> game<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.729> more<00:01:30.150> slow<00:01:30.540> mo

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780

enjoy the game so it was more slow mo
yeah<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:33.000> yeah<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> effort<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.500> still

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
yeah but yeah the effort if I was still

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.289 
yeah but yeah the effort if I was still
pretty<00:01:34.920> horrible<00:01:35.400> i<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.090> recommend

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
pretty horrible i would not recommend

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.569 
pretty horrible i would not recommend
using<00:01:36.720> an<00:01:36.930> asshole<00:01:37.350> i'm<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:38.220> sure<00:01:38.549> that

the entire metagame of jets has pretty

the entire metagame of jets has pretty

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
much change because now that you have

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.380 
much change because now that you have
two<00:02:02.770> different<00:02:03.010> kinds<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.460> jets<00:02:03.729> one<00:02:04.119> very

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
two different kinds of jets one very

stealth<00:02:07.360> jet<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.780> really<00:02:08.050> much<00:02:08.229> more<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.590> a

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
stealth jet is really much more of a

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.499 
stealth jet is really much more of a
support<00:02:08.830> role<00:02:09.220> now<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:09.700> should<00:02:09.940> be<00:02:10.209> that

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
support role now so should be that

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.350 
support role now so should be that
powerful<00:02:10.840> but<00:02:11.800> i<00:02:11.830> can<00:02:12.430> see<00:02:12.610> i<00:02:12.760> still<00:02:13.180> think

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
powerful but i can see i still think

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.540 
powerful but i can see i still think
deserves<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.200> bit<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.680> small<00:02:14.950> puff<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.250> haven't

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550

deserves a bit of a small puff I haven't

or<00:02:19.060> whatever<00:02:19.360> yet<00:02:19.630> but<00:02:20.230> I'm<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:21.520> just<00:02:21.640> a

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
or whatever yet but I'm this is just a

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.809 
or whatever yet but I'm this is just a
first<00:02:21.880> impression<00:02:22.090> so<00:02:22.800> yeah<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.310> attacker<00:02:24.610> is

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
first impression so yeah the attacker is

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.940 
first impression so yeah the attacker is
also<00:02:25.270> really<00:02:25.569> really<00:02:25.750> good<00:02:26.110> by<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.290> way<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
also really really good by the way the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220 
also really really good by the way the
attack<00:02:27.220> jet<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.610> pretty<00:02:27.940> much<00:02:28.120> ridiculous<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
attack jet is pretty much ridiculous it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.780 
attack jet is pretty much ridiculous it
is<00:02:29.410> amazing<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.160> can<00:02:30.370> go<00:02:30.519> home<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
is amazing you can go home and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.400 
is amazing you can go home and

incredibly long kill speech on this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.590 
incredibly long kill speech on this
thing<00:02:32.620> this<00:02:33.160> stealth<00:02:33.430> jet<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.820> act<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.330> find

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
thing this stealth jet is act I find

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.120 
thing this stealth jet is act I find
it's<00:02:34.750> actually<00:02:35.019> a<00:02:35.050> lot<00:02:35.170> more<00:02:35.230> fun<00:02:35.590> those<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> lot

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's actually a lot more fun those a lot

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.710 
it's actually a lot more fun those a lot
more<00:02:36.280> fun<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.489> play<00:02:36.640> around<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:37.090> dog<00:02:37.450> by

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
more fun to play around with dog by

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.870 
more fun to play around with dog by
other<00:02:37.959> jets<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:39.370> doesn't<00:02:39.640> give<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.850> much

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
other jets I it doesn't give you much

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.910 
other jets I it doesn't give you much
many<00:02:40.450> points<00:02:40.810> though<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.350> does<00:02:41.620> take

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
many points though because it does take

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.460 
many points though because it does take
a<00:02:42.100> lot<00:02:42.519> of<00:02:42.580> can<00:02:43.000> around<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.630> get<00:02:44.170> something

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
a lot of can around to get something

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.979 
a lot of can around to get something
down<00:02:44.830> low<00:02:45.130> on<00:02:45.280> health<00:02:45.489> like<00:02:45.989> shooting

down low on health like shooting
choppers<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:47.470> was<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.800> able<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.130> take<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.280> single

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
choppers I was not able to take a single

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.540 
choppers I was not able to take a single
helicopter<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:49.930> chopper<00:02:50.170> down<00:02:50.410> because<00:02:51.190> he

helicopter or chopper down because he

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.970 
helicopter or chopper down because he
can<00:02:52.060> around<00:02:52.330> with<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.810> little<00:02:52.840> damage<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.709> it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
can around with so little damage that it

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.309 
can around with so little damage that it
will<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.640> take<00:02:54.700> so<00:02:55.090> many<00:02:55.239> strafing<00:02:55.780> runs<00:02:56.080> to

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
will just take so many strafing runs to

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.370 
will just take so many strafing runs to
get<00:02:56.530> me<00:02:57.160> top<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.640> down<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.120> at<00:02:58.750> most<00:02:59.110> i<00:02:59.290> was

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
get me top and down and at most i was

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.720 
get me top and down and at most i was
getting<00:02:59.560> maybe<00:02:59.680> 30<00:03:00.040> damage<00:03:00.280> was<00:03:00.519> stroking

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
getting maybe 30 damage was stroking

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.090 
getting maybe 30 damage was stroking
room<00:03:01.090> i<00:03:01.330> also<00:03:01.840> think<00:03:02.140> that<00:03:02.260> maybe<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.739> small

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
room i also think that maybe a small

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.740 
room i also think that maybe a small
bhakta<00:03:03.430> balance<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> out<00:03:03.910> would<00:03:04.120> be<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.299> make

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
bhakta balance it out would be to make

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.530 
bhakta balance it out would be to make
the<00:03:05.049> leap<00:03:05.680> hands<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.700> jet<00:03:06.940> or<00:03:07.180> not

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
the leap hands on the jet or not

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.080 
the leap hands on the jet or not
overheat<00:03:08.049> as<00:03:08.200> much<00:03:08.530> or<00:03:09.370> something<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.880> think

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
overheat as much or something I think

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.230 
overheat as much or something I think
that<00:03:10.209> would<00:03:10.299> be<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> good<00:03:10.600> profit

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
that would be a good profit

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.750 
that would be a good profit
could<00:03:12.050> engage<00:03:12.530> from<00:03:12.680> dog<00:03:12.920> fights<00:03:13.190> for<00:03:13.370> longer

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
could engage from dog fights for longer

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.160 
could engage from dog fights for longer
but<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.180> still<00:03:14.240> have<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.570> extra<00:03:15.020> damage

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
but you still have the extra damage

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.130 
but you still have the extra damage
potential<00:03:15.830> for<00:03:16.460> like<00:03:16.750> helicopters<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.990> other

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
potential for like helicopters and other

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.770 
potential for like helicopters and other
targets<00:03:18.740> if<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.310> need<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> bit<00:03:20.030> or<00:03:20.120> whatever

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780

and<00:03:21.110> secondly<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.040> also<00:03:22.340> think<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:23.210> jet<00:03:24.050> can<00:03:24.260> on

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
and secondly I also think the jet can on

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.710 
and secondly I also think the jet can on
the<00:03:24.980> stealth<00:03:25.250> jets<00:03:25.520> really<00:03:26.060> buff<00:03:26.360> against

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the stealth jets really buff against

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.960 
the stealth jets really buff against
aircraft<00:03:26.960> because<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.070> can<00:03:28.190> see<00:03:28.400> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
aircraft because you can see the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.600 
aircraft because you can see the
numerous<00:03:29.240> times<00:03:29.480> I've<00:03:29.770> shot<00:03:30.770> at<00:03:31.010> attackers<00:03:31.580> in

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
numerous times I've shot at attackers in

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.090 
numerous times I've shot at attackers in
this<00:03:31.790> aircraft<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.810> does<00:03:32.990> extremely<00:03:33.350> damaged

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
this aircraft it does extremely damaged

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.130 
this aircraft it does extremely damaged
like<00:03:34.280> I'm<00:03:34.460> lucky<00:03:34.790> cat<00:03:35.270> may<00:03:35.420> be<00:03:35.480> about<00:03:35.780> 40

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
like I'm lucky cat may be about 40

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.140 
like I'm lucky cat may be about 40
damage<00:03:36.320> all<00:03:36.620> on<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.860> single<00:03:37.010> attack<00:03:37.370> sure<00:03:37.610> cuz<00:03:38.120> I

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
damage all on a single attack sure cuz I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.640 
damage all on a single attack sure cuz I
know<00:03:38.330> they<00:03:38.540> have<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> lot<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.870> Allah<00:03:39.110> but<00:03:39.410> myself

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
know they have a lot of Allah but myself

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.160 
know they have a lot of Allah but myself
jet<00:03:40.310> should<00:03:40.490> really<00:03:40.880> be<00:03:41.060> able<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.360> effectively

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
jet should really be able to effectively

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.170 
jet should really be able to effectively
take<00:03:42.530> down<00:03:42.800> all<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.100> Jets<00:03:43.490> really<00:03:43.910> really

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
take down all the Jets really really

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.910 
take down all the Jets really really
easily<00:03:44.360> stealth<00:03:44.780> jurors<00:03:44.960> also<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.650> don't

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
easily stealth jurors also now don't

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.340 
easily stealth jurors also now don't
have<00:03:46.130> any<00:03:46.310> rocket<00:03:46.730> pods<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.840> splash

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
have any rocket pods and the splash

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.430 
have any rocket pods and the splash
cannon<00:03:48.800> or<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.670> 20<00:03:50.630> millimeters<00:03:50.990> can<00:03:51.170> doesn't

cannon or the 20 millimeters can doesn't

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.990 
cannon or the 20 millimeters can doesn't
do<00:03:51.560> hate<00:03:51.950> basically<00:03:52.550> doesn't<00:03:52.670> do<00:03:52.820> any

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
do hate basically doesn't do any

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.490 
do hate basically doesn't do any
damaging<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.420> temperature<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.960> could<00:03:54.170> not<00:03:54.290> kill

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
damaging a temperature I could not kill

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.910 
damaging a temperature I could not kill
its<00:03:54.800> single<00:03:55.460> infy<00:03:55.880> in<00:03:56.150> my<00:03:56.330> time<00:03:56.630> with<00:03:57.230> stealth

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
its single infy in my time with stealth

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.830 
its single infy in my time with stealth
Joe<00:03:58.190> which<00:03:58.400> really<00:03:58.730> does<00:03:58.940> mean<00:03:59.120> it's<00:03:59.330> kind<00:03:59.630> of

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
Joe which really does mean it's kind of

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.830 
Joe which really does mean it's kind of
not<00:04:00.740> being<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.190> anti-aircraft<00:04:01.850> read<00:04:02.600> that<00:04:02.720> it

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
not being the anti-aircraft read that it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.690 
not being the anti-aircraft read that it
is<00:04:03.050> but<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:03.500> think<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.830> really<00:04:03.860> should<00:04:04.490> have<00:04:04.670> a

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
is but I think it really should have a

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.490 
is but I think it really should have a
little<00:04:04.850> bit<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.090> bump<00:04:05.360> against<00:04:05.660> everything

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
little bit of bump against everything

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.880 
little bit of bump against everything
because<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:08.150> use<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> stealth<00:04:08.810> jet<00:04:09.080> or<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.680> hit

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
because to use a stealth jet or to hit

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.070 
because to use a stealth jet or to hit
for<00:04:10.550> the<00:04:10.670> shelter<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.210> effective<00:04:11.690> there

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
for the shelter to be effective there

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.350 
for the shelter to be effective there
has<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.500> be<00:04:12.530> quite<00:04:13.040> versatile<00:04:13.580> because<00:04:13.790> there

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
has to be quite versatile because there

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.240 
has to be quite versatile because there
are<00:04:14.450> only<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:14.870> many<00:04:14.900> air<00:04:15.200> targets<00:04:15.500> up<00:04:15.890> at<00:04:16.040> any

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
are only so many air targets up at any

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.190 
are only so many air targets up at any
one<00:04:16.460> time<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.030> you<00:04:17.060> should<00:04:17.720> have<00:04:17.960> at<00:04:18.170> least

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
one time and you should have at least

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.140 
one time and you should have at least
some<00:04:18.650> killing<00:04:19.100> potential<00:04:19.370> against<00:04:19.790> ground

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
some killing potential against ground

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.290 
some killing potential against ground
targets<00:04:20.270> maybe<00:04:21.140> not<00:04:21.380> that<00:04:21.410> much<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:22.220> slow<00:04:22.910> but

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
targets maybe not that much but slow but

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.290 
targets maybe not that much but slow but
I<00:04:23.450> mean<00:04:23.720> rocket<00:04:24.620> pods<00:04:24.830> are<00:04:24.980> gone<00:04:25.130> now<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
I mean rocket pods are gone now the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580 
I mean rocket pods are gone now the
rocket<00:04:26.540> was<00:04:26.660> about<00:04:26.870> where<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.230> were<00:04:27.320> very

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
rocket was about where you were very

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.470 
rocket was about where you were very
very<00:04:27.740> effective<00:04:28.190> against<00:04:28.490> tanks<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:29.030> think

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
very effective against tanks I think

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.940 
very effective against tanks I think
that's<00:04:29.660> enough<00:04:29.840> of<00:04:30.050> an<00:04:30.230> off-duty

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
that's enough of an off-duty

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.940 
that's enough of an off-duty
such<00:04:32.640> that<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.390> will<00:04:33.840> not<00:04:34.110> really<00:04:34.500> be<00:04:34.590> that

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
such that it will not really be that

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.040 
such that it will not really be that
good<00:04:35.130> against<00:04:35.460> anti-armor<00:04:36.330> whatever<00:04:36.690> or<00:04:37.020> I

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
good against anti-armor whatever or I

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.600 
good against anti-armor whatever or I
think<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.440> stealth<00:04:37.770> jet<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.070> actually<00:04:38.430> kind

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
think the stealth jet is actually kind

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.190 
think the stealth jet is actually kind
of<00:04:38.700> buggy<00:04:38.880> right<00:04:39.120> now<00:04:39.300> because<00:04:39.660> you'll<00:04:39.870> see<00:04:40.050> at

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
of buggy right now because you'll see at

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.690 
of buggy right now because you'll see at
the<00:04:40.230> end<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:40.560> this<00:04:40.620> clip<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.220> do<00:04:41.280> die

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
the end of this clip that I do die

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.520 
the end of this clip that I do die
randomly<00:04:42.000> doesn't<00:04:42.630> say<00:04:42.750> who<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:42.960> was<00:04:43.170> killed<00:04:43.380> by

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
randomly doesn't say who I was killed by

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.320 
randomly doesn't say who I was killed by
just<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:43.860> killed<00:04:44.100> in<00:04:44.190> action<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.180> just

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
just as killed in action and it just

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.810 
just as killed in action and it just
looks<00:04:45.450> like<00:04:45.630> I<00:04:45.870> exploded<00:04:46.860> with<00:04:47.430> no<00:04:47.610> particular

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
looks like I exploded with no particular

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940 
looks like I exploded with no particular
reason<00:04:48.390> i<00:04:48.750> bet<00:04:49.200> that<00:04:49.230> happened<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.800> me<00:04:49.920> a

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
reason i bet that happened to me a

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.760 
reason i bet that happened to me a
longer<00:04:50.550> time<00:04:50.790> i<00:04:50.820> mean<00:04:51.090> i<00:04:51.360> can't<00:04:52.350> really<00:04:52.500> tell

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
longer time i mean i can't really tell

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.070 
longer time i mean i can't really tell
if<00:04:52.800> it's<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.250> a<00:04:53.280> or<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:54.090> I'm<00:04:54.300> just<00:04:54.330> dying<00:04:54.780> around

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
if it's a a or if I'm just dying around

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.750 
if it's a a or if I'm just dying around
like<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> bar<00:04:55.980> water<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.610> is

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
like you to a bar water and that is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.910 
like you to a bar water and that is
actually<00:04:57.240> really<00:04:57.480> was<00:04:57.750> raising<00:04:58.200> having<00:04:58.770> your

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
actually really was raising having your

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.890 
actually really was raising having your
jets<00:04:59.370> free<00:04:59.640> to<00:04:59.820> shut<00:05:00.030> down<00:05:00.060> because<00:05:00.480> you<00:05:00.750> just

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
jets free to shut down because you just
