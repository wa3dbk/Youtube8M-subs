00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.609
 appearances 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.609
 by rafael cano 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.400
 to arrive a beautiful morning 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.790
 where the young man heard a wise elder comment about the poor quality of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.669
 the apples that you have 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.820
 but nevertheless 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 It has nothing to do with it 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.790
 he put his gaze on a beautiful red apple 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.120
 and angle who discovered her that she was totally rotten full of worms for 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.160
 inside 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 which caused great indigestion 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.330
 not all that glitters is gold 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
 and not everything beautiful before our eyes is my thing 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.020
 today many ignore the warning of the elder ie God 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.790
 about cheating that does not 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.790
 just behind a score of wounded 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.560
 it is important that we learn the call of God 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.210
 to know how 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.580
 and with whom you should walk in a world where there are beautiful rotten apples 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.220
 family members 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 Dear Friend 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 yes you yesterday to life 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.960
 If you already name some of your defects, discover 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 if he walked the true path to which he had lost 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.360
 and if someday you know the truth 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.330
 your dignified life 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 never again outside appearances only the idol legal advisor 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.310
 It is sad to know that some cases 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.140
 the greatest happiness and safety of the people 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.620
 they are the unhappiest in insurance when they are in their homes or in areas 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.310
 my good friend 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.310
 appearances are like a product of poor quality 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.160
 many and sooner or later 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.480
 that god knows his true state 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.269
 win is to import their condition 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.259
 and say it in the following way 

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:13.229
 Mr 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.099
 that open the doors of my heart 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.749
 ranked first in 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 I spoke with your friends sorry for all my sins 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.249
 I changed my life and so the person that you want me to be 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.639
 I thank you 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.769
 for changing medium 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.529
 in Jesus 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:35.359
 by making this prayer sincere less 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.359
 the three sons of god 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.479
 and remember 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.929
 the one that grows up being nothing 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.769
 he is also deceived by Galatians 6 3
