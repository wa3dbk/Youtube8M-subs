very fast but it won't hit instantly at
extreme<00:02:23.010> ranges<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.550> will<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.970> to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
extreme ranges you will have to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.210 
extreme ranges you will have to
compensate<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.810> its<00:02:24.930> travel<00:02:25.290> time<00:02:25.470> but<00:02:26.010> once

reticle when you fire is also very

leisure once you get a feel for this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.890 
leisure once you get a feel for this
timing<00:02:56.850> you'll<00:02:57.180> be<00:02:57.330> able<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.630> put<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
timing you'll be able to put the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
timing you'll be able to put the
crosshair<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:58.650> target<00:02:59.070> let<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.730> turn<00:02:59.910> red

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
and then release the round if you wait

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.160 
and then release the round if you wait
for<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.760> weapon<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.150> fire<00:03:03.330> by<00:03:03.540> itself<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
for the weapon to fire by itself a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.290 
for the weapon to fire by itself a
variety<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.010> interruptions<00:03:05.610> may<00:03:05.760> occur<00:03:06.030> and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
variety of interruptions may occur and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.020 
variety of interruptions may occur and
cause<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.900> miss<00:03:07.019> your<00:03:07.080> shot

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
cause you to miss your shot

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.820 
cause you to miss your shot
another<00:03:09.030> trick<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.780> preemptively<00:03:10.320> charge

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
another trick is to preemptively charge

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.860 
another trick is to preemptively charge
the<00:03:11.100> railgun<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.180> see<00:03:12.360> an<00:03:12.450> opponent

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
the railgun if you see an opponent

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.509 
the railgun if you see an opponent
approaching<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.410> your<00:03:13.440> motion<00:03:13.830> sensor<00:03:13.860> then

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
approaching on your motion sensor then

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.009 
approaching on your motion sensor then
begin<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.090> charge<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.630> weapon

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
begin to charge the weapon

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.290 
begin to charge the weapon
assuming<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:17.100> time<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.519> properly<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
assuming that you time it properly you

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.090 
assuming that you time it properly you
should<00:03:18.600> be<00:03:18.750> able<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.019> eliminate<00:03:19.350> them<00:03:19.680> as<00:03:19.860> soon

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
should be able to eliminate them as soon

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.039 
should be able to eliminate them as soon
as<00:03:20.250> they<00:03:20.400> reveal<00:03:20.700> themselves<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.930> you

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
as they reveal themselves and if you

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.800 
as they reveal themselves and if you
miscalculated<00:03:22.829> then<00:03:23.310> swap<00:03:23.790> weapons<00:03:24.120> don't

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
miscalculated then swap weapons don't

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.440 
miscalculated then swap weapons don't
fire<00:03:25.110> a<00:03:25.140> shot<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.860> know<00:03:26.070> will<00:03:26.250> miss<00:03:26.489> this

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
fire a shot that you know will miss this

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.240 
fire a shot that you know will miss this
is<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> basic<00:03:28.110> tactic<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.890> use<00:03:29.070> to

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
is a basic tactic that you can use to

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.490 
is a basic tactic that you can use to
avoid<00:03:29.519> wasting<00:03:29.820> ammo<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:31.019> don't<00:03:31.260> think

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
avoid wasting ammo if you don't think

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.780 
avoid wasting ammo if you don't think
you'll<00:03:31.620> be<00:03:31.739> able<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.950> make<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.130> shot<00:03:32.430> or<00:03:32.579> if<00:03:32.700> you

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
you'll be able to make a shot or if you

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.729 
you'll be able to make a shot or if you
miss<00:03:32.970> an<00:03:33.090> opportunity<00:03:33.690> then<00:03:34.079> switch<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.530> your

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
miss an opportunity then switch to your

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.370 
miss an opportunity then switch to your
other<00:03:34.980> weapon<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.549> avoid<00:03:35.850> firing<00:03:36.209> not<00:03:37.019> only

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
other weapon to avoid firing not only

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.350 
other weapon to avoid firing not only
will<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.650> conserve<00:03:38.040> ammo<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.760> switching<00:03:39.120> to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
will this conserve ammo but switching to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.880 
will this conserve ammo but switching to
another<00:03:39.600> weapon<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.170> then<00:03:40.320> back<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
another weapon and then back to the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.949 
another weapon and then back to the
railgun<00:03:41.070> is<00:03:41.489> faster<00:03:42.060> than<00:03:42.180> firing<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
railgun is faster than firing and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.310 
railgun is faster than firing and
reloading<00:03:43.610> there<00:03:44.610> is<00:03:44.820> one<00:03:45.269> last<00:03:45.540> trick<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.110> hit

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
reloading there is one last trick to hit

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.650 
reloading there is one last trick to hit
targets<00:03:46.739> at<00:03:46.860> extreme<00:03:47.250> distances<00:03:47.850> even<00:03:48.329> though
