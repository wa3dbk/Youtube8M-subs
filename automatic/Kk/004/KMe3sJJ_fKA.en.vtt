00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
modifying it a bit you're adding an

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830 
modifying it a bit you're adding an
extra<00:01:35.610> stitch<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.119> each<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.630> beads

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
and this will allow the seed beads to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.760 
and this will allow the seed beads to
lay<00:01:38.850> next<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.329> each<00:01:39.420> other<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.869> tiny<00:01:40.439> bit<00:01:40.619> better

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
lay next to each other a tiny bit better

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.249 
lay next to each other a tiny bit better

like<00:03:21.519> many<00:03:21.730> bead<00:03:21.970> weaving<00:03:22.209> x'<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.930> can

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
like many bead weaving x' you can

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.990 
like many bead weaving x' you can
actually<00:03:23.260> flip<00:03:23.739> your<00:03:23.920> work<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.670> you<00:03:24.760> work

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
actually flip your work so that you work

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.580 
actually flip your work so that you work
in<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.239> desired<00:03:25.630> direction<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.410> want

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
in the desired direction that you want

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.410 
in the desired direction that you want
each<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.040> every<00:03:27.160> time<00:03:27.489> there's<00:03:28.030> no<00:03:28.209> need<00:03:28.360> for

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
each and every time there's no need for

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.930 
each and every time there's no need for
you<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.690> zigzag<00:03:29.260> back<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.530> forth<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.549> is<00:03:30.790> one

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
you to zigzag back and forth this is one

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.069 
you to zigzag back and forth this is one
of<00:03:30.970> those<00:03:31.120> stitches<00:03:31.390> where<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.750> works<00:03:31.900> out

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
of those stitches where it works out

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.319 
of those stitches where it works out
very<00:03:32.440> well<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:32.890> now<00:03:33.820> we're<00:03:33.970> coming<00:03:34.090> out

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
very well so now we're coming out

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.080 
very well so now we're coming out
through<00:03:34.959> this<00:03:35.110> bead<00:03:35.680> over<00:03:35.920> here<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.579> the<00:03:36.910> right

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
through this bead over here on the right

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.690 
through this bead over here on the right
side<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.690> just<00:03:38.530> like<00:03:38.680> before<00:03:38.860> now<00:03:39.340> you're

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
side and just like before now you're

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.819 
side and just like before now you're
going<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.970> go<00:03:40.090> down<00:03:40.540> through<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.440> second<00:03:41.799> bead

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
going to go down through the second bead

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.220 
going to go down through the second bead
in<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.459> group<00:03:42.700> two<00:03:43.660> things<00:03:43.989> will<00:03:44.200> happen

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
in that group two things will happen

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.110 
in that group two things will happen
here<00:03:44.739> first<00:03:45.250> thing<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.549> you'll<00:03:45.670> notice<00:03:45.850> is

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
that again you get that V pattern with

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.580 
that again you get that V pattern with
your<00:03:48.280> beads<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:49.720> second<00:03:50.109> thing<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.320> you're

in order to secure them now by that I
mean<00:04:09.340> these<00:04:09.790> two<00:04:10.030> stitches<00:04:10.299> are<00:04:10.720> wanting<00:04:11.109> to

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
mean these two stitches are wanting to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.470 
mean these two stitches are wanting to
spread<00:04:11.530> apart<00:04:11.799> from<00:04:11.980> one<00:04:12.130> another<00:04:12.160> I'm<00:04:12.640> going

seed beads together

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.270 
seed beads together
by<00:04:19.479> coming<00:04:19.870> up<00:04:20.079> through<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.769> next<00:04:21.010> seed<00:04:21.250> bead

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
by coming up through that next seed bead

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.210 
by coming up through that next seed bead
this<00:04:22.150> will<00:04:22.390> pull<00:04:22.659> those<00:04:23.590> two<00:04:23.830> rows<00:04:24.039> together

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
this will pull those two rows together

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.970 
this will pull those two rows together
however<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.810> two<00:04:26.020> black<00:04:26.260> seed<00:04:26.560> beads<00:04:26.740> up

next group this is just a little

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.240 
next group this is just a little
time-saving<00:05:05.380> technique<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:05.920> you<00:05:06.010> learn

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
time-saving technique that you learn

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.380 
time-saving technique that you learn
after<00:05:06.850> doing<00:05:07.120> a<00:05:07.150> couple<00:05:07.570> of<00:05:07.630> these<00:05:07.780> rows

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
after doing a couple of these rows

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.760 
after doing a couple of these rows
continue<00:05:10.390> doing<00:05:10.720> as<00:05:10.900> many<00:05:11.170> rows<00:05:11.440> as<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.680> need

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
continue doing as many rows as you need

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.440 
continue doing as many rows as you need
to<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.310> complete<00:05:12.610> your<00:05:12.730> herringbone<00:05:13.180> stitch

and then to finish your stitch up here
at<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.210> top<00:05:16.420> you'll<00:05:17.140> simply<00:05:17.410> go<00:05:17.710> through<00:05:17.820> each

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
at the top you'll simply go through each

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.150 
at the top you'll simply go through each
one<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.270> your<00:05:19.480> beads<00:05:19.720> one<00:05:20.680> time<00:05:20.920> without

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
one of your beads one time without

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.210 
one of your beads one time without
adding<00:05:21.670> additional<00:05:21.880> beads<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.980> let<00:05:23.980> me<00:05:24.070> show

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
adding additional beads and let me show

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.470 
adding additional beads and let me show
you<00:05:24.280> how<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.520> works<00:05:24.790> here<00:05:25.030> in<00:05:25.150> this<00:05:25.270> next

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
you how that works here in this next

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.680 
you how that works here in this next
segment<00:05:25.870> what<00:05:26.770> you<00:05:26.920> do<00:05:27.160> to<00:05:27.610> tie<00:05:27.850> all<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.210> these

segment what you do to tie all of these

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.300 
segment what you do to tie all of these
loose<00:05:28.930> ends<00:05:29.170> together<00:05:29.530> because<00:05:29.800> remember<00:05:30.010> the

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
loose ends together because remember the

take your cording and you're going to do

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.550 
take your cording and you're going to do
a<00:05:36.820> ladder<00:05:37.090> stitch<00:05:37.450> with<00:05:37.660> this<00:05:37.780> very<00:05:38.020> last<00:05:38.260> row

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
a ladder stitch with this very last row

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.640
