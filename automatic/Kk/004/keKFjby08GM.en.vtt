just to see kind of what that turns out

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 
just to see kind of what that turns out
to<00:01:28.080> look<00:01:28.259> like<00:01:28.320> because<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.509> I've<00:01:30.509> done<00:01:30.720> a

leathers<00:06:11.960> you<00:06:12.500> know<00:06:12.699> maybe<00:06:13.699> taking<00:06:14.210> an

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
leathers you know maybe taking an

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.600 
leathers you know maybe taking an
something<00:06:15.229> like<00:06:15.380> they're<00:06:15.830> doing<00:06:16.009> one<00:06:16.280> into<00:06:16.580> a
