that lingering kiss is a matte and media

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
that lingering kiss is a matte and media

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
is a satin dark side is amplified so let

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:56.660 
is a satin dark side is amplified so let

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
me swatch media yeah that's what I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.030 
me swatch media yeah that's what I
thought<00:02:56.730> media<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.870> lingering<00:02:58.560> kiss<00:02:58.800> are

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
thought media and lingering kiss are

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.650 
thought media and lingering kiss are
very<00:02:59.400> very<00:02:59.670> similar<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.670> top<00:03:02.910> one<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.450> is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
very very similar so the top one here is

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.190 
very very similar so the top one here is
media<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:06.690> limited<00:03:07.080> edition

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
media this is the limited edition

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
media this is the limited edition
lingering<00:03:08.040> kiss<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.120> dark<00:03:09.390> side<00:03:13.730> so

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
lingering kiss and this is dark side so

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.340 
lingering kiss and this is dark side so
you<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:16.380> tell<00:03:16.710> media<00:03:17.040> has<00:03:17.459> some<00:03:17.700> purple<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.989> is

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you can tell media has some purple it is

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.340 
you can tell media has some purple it is
very<00:03:19.739> similar<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.370> tone<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.510> lingering<00:03:21.870> kiss<00:03:22.170> I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
very similar in tone to lingering kiss I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.140 
very similar in tone to lingering kiss I
would<00:03:22.530> say<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.370> only<00:03:23.520> thing<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.910> lingering

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
would say the only thing is lingering

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.540 
would say the only thing is lingering
kiss<00:03:24.450> i<00:03:24.630> think<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.230> little<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:26.040> darker

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
kiss i think is just a little bit darker

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.300 
kiss i think is just a little bit darker
and<00:03:27.530> of<00:03:28.530> course<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.130> be<00:03:30.890> it'll<00:03:31.890> be<00:03:31.920> matte

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
and of course it will be it'll be matte

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.590 
and of course it will be it'll be matte
or<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:33.150> mad<00:03:33.360> than<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:34.260> satin<00:03:34.620> will<00:03:34.800> be<00:03:35.600> so

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
or more mad than the satin will be so

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.110 
or more mad than the satin will be so
yeah<00:03:36.870> i<00:03:37.200> hope<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.950> enjoyed<00:03:38.370> this<00:03:38.610> quick<00:03:38.850> video
