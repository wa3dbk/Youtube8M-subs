they<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.290> missing<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.299> think<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.600> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they go missing and I just think it's a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.899 
they go missing and I just think it's a
really<00:01:40.079> nice<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.619> display<00:01:41.040> piece<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
really nice little display piece that

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.940 
really nice little display piece that
you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.479> put<00:01:43.079> stuff<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.740> don't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
you can just put stuff in that you don't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.289 
you can just put stuff in that you don't
want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> lose<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.970> you're<00:01:45.119> anything

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
want to lose because if you're anything

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
want to lose because if you're anything
like<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:46.290> lose<00:01:46.560> things<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> regular

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
like me you lose things on a regular

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.730 
like me you lose things on a regular
basis<00:01:48.329> especially<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.930> they're<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.350> small

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
basis especially if they're really small

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
basis especially if they're really small
so<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.579> think<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.299> may
