00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello hello doll are you welcome today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.359
 I bring you this elegant makeup 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.929
 dramatic in neutral tones and with the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.429
 very red lips shines juicy landmarks and 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.139
 Well I hope you all you can 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.139
 please this idea one more time 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.070
 ok girls let's start we spent a 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.169
 Shade fixer for all our 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.050
 lower and upper eyelid 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.579
 I'm going to use an economic palette 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.289
 I will choose the color brown cited 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.379
 dark I'm going to apply it with a brush 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.559
 super finite and let's make a medium 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:40.260
 arch in our whole basin that is something 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.149
 angular but at the same time a little bit 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.210
 now let's take a tonality 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.179
 This candy is also a matte shadow 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.699
 and we will put up our bow and 

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:54.500
 this we will take it to the party 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.500
 end of our entire basin 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.050
 Now let's change the brush and go 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.640
 to blur our brown arch towards 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.270
 up so that a curettage is created 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.310
 between brown and caramel 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.229
 for the lower area of our dry we are going 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.939
 to apply a vanilla tone 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.530
 this one is also mate so our 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.530
 serious will be spectacular 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.500
 ah 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.630
 immediately we will apply for the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.700
 mobile eyelid a shadow skin color is 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.260
 It is also matte so we will put 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.260
 with a planet brush 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.159
 t 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.840
 now girls we go to delineate our 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.479
 eyes I'm doing it with this 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.040
 product that is from the brand snoopy and 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.170
 let's start making a little wheel 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.810
 Super finite very close to our 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.270
 eyelashes then I'm going to take it up 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.979
 where the part that carries the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.080
 steak on the outer edge of form 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.000
 angular and this is a trick girls 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 so that our delineation is more 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.070
 perfect so do not complicate 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.450
 we can do this and then spin 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 Thickening little by little 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 now let's move on to darken our 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.849
 water line using a black pencil 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.980
 and at the same time we are also going to paint 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.050
 very well the root of our eyelashes 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.349
 now let's darken side more 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.890
 making a smoky with a colored shadow 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.890
 black 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.549
 now I'm going to apply these spiders 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.170
 if you like lashes 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.480
 false can do it but 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.129

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.510
