best combination of off and on road we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.499 
best combination of off and on road we
did<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.189> lot<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.369> testing<00:01:19.820> with<00:01:19.939> them<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.299> we

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
did a lot of testing with them and we

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.929 
did a lot of testing with them and we
were<00:01:20.630> just<00:01:20.899> really<00:01:21.380> blown<00:01:21.649> away<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:22.729> wheel

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939

well<00:01:23.180> has<00:01:23.420> been<00:01:23.630> squared<00:01:24.200> off<00:01:24.409> so<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.219> get<00:01:25.369> a

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
well has been squared off so you get a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:27.370 
well has been squared off so you get a
much<00:01:25.579> more<00:01:25.820> rugged<00:01:26.149> look<00:01:26.509> everything<00:01:27.289> the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
much more rugged look everything the

much more rugged look everything the
Toyota<00:01:27.710> has<00:01:27.859> done<00:01:28.100> with<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.430> redesigned

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
Toyota has done with this redesigned

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.149 
Toyota has done with this redesigned
tundra<00:01:29.689> has<00:01:29.810> been<00:01:30.020> to<00:01:30.140> make<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.439> look<00:01:30.770> tougher

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
tundra has been to make it look tougher

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.490 
tundra has been to make it look tougher
and<00:01:31.340> guess<00:01:31.430> what<00:01:31.609> it<00:01:31.729> is<00:01:31.880> tougher<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:33.320> her<00:01:33.380> to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
and guess what it is tougher to her to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.109 
and guess what it is tougher to her to
talk<00:01:33.680> to<00:01:33.829> a<00:01:33.859> lot<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:34.070> pickup<00:01:34.369> truck<00:01:34.549> owners<00:01:34.909> and

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
talk to a lot of pickup truck owners and

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.940 
talk to a lot of pickup truck owners and
what<00:01:35.810> they<00:01:35.899> found<00:01:36.079> out<00:01:36.259> is<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.469> spend<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.770> lot

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
what they found out is they spend a lot

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.679 
what they found out is they spend a lot
of<00:01:36.979> time<00:01:37.100> back<00:01:37.460> here<00:01:37.759> so<00:01:38.060> they<00:01:38.390> made<00:01:38.570> some

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
of time back here so they made some

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.870 
of time back here so they made some
changes<00:01:38.750> for<00:01:39.469> example<00:01:39.500> this<00:01:40.070> bumper<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.700> now<00:01:40.850> a

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
changes for example this bumper is now a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.060 
changes for example this bumper is now a
three-piece<00:01:41.869> bumper<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.649> reason<00:01:42.979> that's

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
three-piece bumper and the reason that's

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
outgoing tundra model was that the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.500 
outgoing tundra model was that the
interior<00:03:12.379> looked<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.340> felt<00:03:13.519> kind<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.269> cheap

interior looked and felt kind of cheap

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.020 
interior looked and felt kind of cheap
so<00:03:14.840> they<00:03:15.590> really<00:03:15.829> went<00:03:16.069> upscale<00:03:16.609> with<00:03:16.909> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
so they really went upscale with the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.659 
so they really went upscale with the
buttons<00:03:17.359> with<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.349> materials<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.489> think

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
buttons with the materials and I think

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.220 
buttons with the materials and I think
it<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:19.790> works<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.840> other<00:03:20.959> thing<00:03:21.079> they've

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
it really works the other thing they've

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.869 
it really works the other thing they've
done<00:03:21.409> is<00:03:21.560> they've<00:03:21.739> moved<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.400> climate

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
done is they've moved the climate

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.270

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
really dialed back their expectations

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.909 
really dialed back their expectations
for<00:05:05.490> what<00:05:05.819> a<00:05:06.449> full-size<00:05:07.080> pickup<00:05:07.469> truck<00:05:07.710> means

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
for what a full-size pickup truck means

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:10.700 
for what a full-size pickup truck means
to<00:05:08.190> them<00:05:08.310> while<00:05:09.210> GM<00:05:09.690> and<00:05:09.930> Ford<00:05:10.199> continued<00:05:10.620> to

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
to them while GM and Ford continued to

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.580 
to them while GM and Ford continued to
sell<00:05:10.949> between<00:05:11.159> 400<00:05:11.849> and<00:05:11.940> 500<00:05:12.210> thousand<00:05:12.900> units

sell between 400 and 500 thousand units
annually<00:05:14.129> each<00:05:14.490> so<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.479> has<00:05:15.690> more<00:05:15.870> realistic

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
annually each so it has more realistic

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.890 
annually each so it has more realistic
expectations<00:05:17.069> more<00:05:17.279> like<00:05:17.750> 200,000<00:05:18.750> units

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
expectations more like 200,000 units

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.420 
expectations more like 200,000 units
that's<00:05:19.379> not<00:05:19.560> because<00:05:19.680> this<00:05:19.919> is<00:05:20.039> a<00:05:20.069> lesser

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
that's not because this is a lesser

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
really tough segment to break into

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.670 
really tough segment to break into
