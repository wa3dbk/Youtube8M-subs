with ballast and everything but then I
found<00:01:35.450> special<00:01:39.290> cree<00:01:40.290> LED<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:41.340> powerful

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
found special cree LED very powerful

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.080 
found special cree LED very powerful
current<00:01:42.270> which<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:44.040> need<00:01:44.250> any

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
current which do which don't need any

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.180 
current which do which don't need any
ballasts<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.050 

extra<00:01:50.190> modifications<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.840> screen<00:01:52.260> lid<00:01:52.440> here

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
extra modifications the screen lid here

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.820 
extra modifications the screen lid here
so<00:01:54.619> built<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.860> USA<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.260> can<00:01:58.440> see<00:01:58.710> it's

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
so built in USA and as you can see it's

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.250 
so built in USA and as you can see it's
a<00:01:58.920> magnifier<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.210> gives<00:02:00.510> very<00:02:00.750> nice

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
a magnifier so it's it gives very nice

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.020 
a magnifier so it's it gives very nice
and<00:02:01.590> powerful<00:02:02.270> light<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.960> same<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.820> if<00:02:05.820> you

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and powerful light the same as if you

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.979 
and powerful light the same as if you
would<00:02:06.210> use<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.810> heat<00:02:07.650> or<00:02:07.950> hid<00:02:08.670> with<00:02:09.479> ballasts

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
would use the heat or hid with ballasts

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.880 
would use the heat or hid with ballasts
and<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:10.979> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.310> cost<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.880> twice<00:02:12.180> less

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
and it's going to cost you twice less

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.140 
and it's going to cost you twice less
but<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.130> order<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.550> fit<00:02:14.760> this<00:02:15.500> inside<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.940> had<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
but in order to fit this inside I had to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:27.020 
but in order to fit this inside I had to
file<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.730> bigger<00:02:21.440> ring<00:02:22.440> or<00:02:23.420> space<00:02:25.430> because<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
file a bigger ring or space because it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.150 
file a bigger ring or space because it
didn't<00:02:27.330> fit<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> took<00:02:28.019> me<00:02:28.230> around<00:02:28.680> one<00:02:29.130> hour

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
didn't fit so it took me around one hour

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.020 
didn't fit so it took me around one hour
to<00:02:29.550> do<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.820> both<00:02:30.030> properly<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.640> will<00:02:32.850> do

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
to do to both properly so this will do

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.590 
to do to both properly so this will do
the<00:02:34.580> air<00:02:35.580> fog<00:02:36.000> light<00:02:36.209> projector<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:38.600> of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
the air fog light projector and of

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.620

course<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.590> saw<00:02:40.830> from<00:02:41.100> result<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:43.459> the

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
course as you saw from result the the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.910 
course as you saw from result the the
angel<00:02:45.630> eye<00:02:46.010> ring<00:02:47.480> was<00:02:49.310> was<00:02:50.310> not<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:52.680> as

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
angel eye ring was was not that good as

you can see here it's the only two small

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.600 
you can see here it's the only two small
diodes<00:03:01.170> giving<00:03:01.980> light<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:04.130> it's<00:03:05.130> end<00:03:05.400> up

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
diodes giving light and it's it's end up

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.330 
diodes giving light and it's it's end up
only<00:03:06.030> maybe<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:07.320> one<00:03:07.860> inch<00:03:08.040> from<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.579> top<00:03:09.260> and

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
tell that very powerful so they were not

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.789 
tell that very powerful so they were not
matching<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:27.299> I'm<00:03:27.840> gonna<00:03:28.019> show<00:03:28.320> you<00:03:28.380> why

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.460 
matching so I'm gonna show you why
what's<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.610> reason<00:03:29.940> why<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.150> ring<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.989> so

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.000 

doesn't<00:03:34.470> give<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:34.920> much<00:03:35.070> light<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:37.010> here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
doesn't give so much light because here

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.800 
doesn't give so much light because here
as<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.310> can<00:03:38.519> see<00:03:38.730> there<00:03:38.970> are<00:03:39.090> only<00:03:39.269> two<00:03:39.630> small

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
as you can see there are only two small

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.830 
as you can see there are only two small
diodes

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.660 

again<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:45.170> okay<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.470> they<00:03:46.800> are<00:03:46.950> they<00:03:47.550> are<00:03:47.640> not

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
again so okay and they are they are not

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.780 
again so okay and they are they are not
so<00:03:48.000> good<00:03:48.209> quality<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.349> it's<00:03:50.190> only<00:03:50.340> two<00:03:50.610> small

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
so good quality so it's only two small

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.020 
so good quality so it's only two small
diets<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:55.069> ring<00:03:56.069> plastic<00:03:56.519> ring<00:03:56.700> could

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
diets and the ring plastic ring could

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.070 
diets and the ring plastic ring could
just<00:03:57.330> spread<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.700> light<00:03:59.910> inside<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.660> that's

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
just spread the light inside and that's

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.930 
just spread the light inside and that's
why<00:04:01.319> it's<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.650> even<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:03.650> doesn't<00:04:04.650> look

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
why it's not even and doesn't look

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.360 
why it's not even and doesn't look
nicely<00:04:05.940> driving<00:04:08.870> so<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:09.900> did<00:04:10.440> some<00:04:10.680> research<00:04:10.920> I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
nicely driving so I did some research I

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:21.190 
nicely driving so I did some research I
found<00:04:11.400> parts<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:14.209> I<00:04:16.280> built<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.989> 21<00:04:19.880> LED

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
found parts and I built in here 21 LED

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:27.650 
found parts and I built in here 21 LED
ring<00:04:22.200> in<00:04:23.190> order<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.490> get<00:04:23.820> nice<00:04:24.660> even<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:26.660> very
