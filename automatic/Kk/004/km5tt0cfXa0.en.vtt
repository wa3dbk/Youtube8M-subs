video<00:00:14.640> was<00:00:14.790> requested<00:00:15.030> by<00:00:15.349> multiple<00:00:16.349> people

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
video was requested by multiple people

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.850 
video was requested by multiple people
and<00:00:16.939> I<00:00:17.939> decided<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.480> make<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.019> I<00:00:19.349> used<00:00:19.650> all

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
and I decided to make it and I used all

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.109 
and I decided to make it and I used all
my<00:00:19.980> previous<00:00:21.199> positions<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.440> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.039> see<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
my previous positions as you can see the

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.050 
my previous positions as you can see the
first<00:00:24.360> thing<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.779> built<00:00:25.020> was<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.680> binary<00:00:26.550> encoder

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
first thing I built was a binary encoder

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900 
first thing I built was a binary encoder
which<00:00:28.050> turns<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> nine<00:00:29.070> numbers<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.789> are

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
which turns the nine numbers that are

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.979 
which turns the nine numbers that are
positioned<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.140> here<00:00:31.410> one<00:00:31.740> through<00:00:32.189> nine

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
positioned right here one through nine

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
positioned right here one through nine
and<00:00:34.190> then<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.519> zero<00:00:35.789> as<00:00:35.970> well<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.190> encode

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and then the zero as well and encode

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
and then the zero as well and encode
these<00:00:38.399> into<00:00:38.880> a<00:00:38.910> binary<00:00:39.270> encoder<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> don't

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
these into a binary encoder so I don't

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.850 
these into a binary encoder so I don't
have<00:00:40.500> nine<00:00:40.770> outputs<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.820> only<00:00:42.120> four

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
have nine outputs but I have only four

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.560 
have nine outputs but I have only four
then<00:00:43.860> these<00:00:44.100> go<00:00:44.370> into<00:00:44.670> memory<00:00:45.030> cells<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
then these go into memory cells I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
then these go into memory cells I
created<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.260> these<00:00:46.680> are<00:00:46.829> forbid<00:00:47.280> memory

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
created and these are forbid memory

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.280 
created and these are forbid memory
cells<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> tutorial<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:49.110> making

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
cells I have a tutorial on making

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.170 
cells I have a tutorial on making
two-bit<00:00:49.800> memory<00:00:50.070> cells<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.610> exactly<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
two-bit memory cells it's exactly the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.250 
two-bit memory cells it's exactly the
same<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:52.230> wider<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:54.600> made<00:00:54.809> four<00:00:55.110> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
same but to wider and I made four of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.650 
same but to wider and I made four of
them<00:00:55.440> each<00:00:55.770> digit<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.420> memory<00:00:57.780> cell<00:00:59.660> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
them each digit has one memory cell the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.889 
them each digit has one memory cell the
next<00:01:00.930> thing<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.200> did<00:01:01.410> was<00:01:01.820> make<00:01:02.820> an<00:01:03.120> interface

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
next thing I did was make an interface

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.929 
next thing I did was make an interface
where<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.259> select<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.860> number<00:01:05.039> you<00:01:05.850> want

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
where you can select a number you want

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
where you can select a number you want
to<00:01:06.119> push<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.329> in<00:01:06.570> I'll<00:01:07.320> first<00:01:07.710> show<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:08.039> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to push it in I'll first show how it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.169 
to push it in I'll first show how it
works<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:08.579> then<00:01:08.670> show<00:01:08.999> you<00:01:09.060> how<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> made<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
works and then show you how I made it

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.910 
works and then show you how I made it
the<00:01:12.179> default<00:01:12.359> code<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.079> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> see<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.740> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the default code as you can see here is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.419 
the default code as you can see here is
1<00:01:14.189> 3<00:01:14.520> 5<00:01:14.789> 7<00:01:15.139> now<00:01:16.139> if<00:01:16.319> I<00:01:16.880> pull<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:17.909> lever<00:01:19.429> nothing

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
1 3 5 7 now if I pull this lever nothing

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:21.709 
1 3 5 7 now if I pull this lever nothing
will<00:01:20.549> happen<00:01:20.579> because<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.179> door<00:01:21.359> won't<00:01:21.569> open

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
will happen because the door won't open

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.139 
will happen because the door won't open
I'm<00:01:22.170> going<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.799> punch<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.279> the<00:01:23.369> code<00:01:23.399> which

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
I'm going to put punch in the code which

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.469 
I'm going to put punch in the code which
is<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.420> number<00:01:24.569> one<00:01:24.899> on<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.119> number

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
is the number one on the first number

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.989 
is the number one on the first number
you<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:28.770> hear<00:01:28.889> the<00:01:28.979> Pistons<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.609> on<00:01:29.700> behind

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
you can hear the Pistons going on behind

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.370 
you can hear the Pistons going on behind
it<00:01:30.149> then<00:01:30.990> number<00:01:31.409> three<00:01:32.869> for<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.049> second

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it then number three for the second

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.620 
it then number three for the second
position

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.980 

number<00:01:39.380> five<00:01:39.680> for<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.399> third<00:01:40.670> position

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.639 

and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.619> number<00:01:46.740> seven<00:01:48.320> for<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.439> fourth

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and a number seven for the fourth

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.790 
and a number seven for the fourth
position

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.820 

there<00:01:53.370> we<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.990> now<00:01:54.990> I've<00:01:55.110> punched<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.620> this

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
there we go now I've punched in this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.060 
there we go now I've punched in this
code<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.990> memory<00:01:57.990> cells<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.950> it's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
code into the memory cells and what it's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
code into the memory cells and what it's
going<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.460> now<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.090> check<00:02:00.330> if<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
going to do now is going to check if the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.140 
going to do now is going to check if the
number<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.070> punched<00:02:02.430> into<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.910> memory

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
number that is punched into the memory

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.750 
number that is punched into the memory
cell<00:02:03.480> is<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.290> correct<00:02:04.590> number<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> is

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
cell is the correct number and if it is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.910 
cell is the correct number and if it is
full<00:02:06.450> open<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.780> door<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.440> I'll<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.560> pull

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
full open this door so I'll just pull

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.770 
full open this door so I'll just pull
this<00:02:08.070> lever<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.630> voila<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:10.020> door<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.350> open

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
this lever and voila the door will open

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.750 
this lever and voila the door will open
and<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.650> turn<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> off<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.490> will<00:02:14.610> close

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
and I turn it off and it will close

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.720 
and I turn it off and it will close
again<00:02:15.410> now<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.740> reset<00:02:17.130> button<00:02:17.160> it's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
again now this is the reset button it's

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.090 
again now this is the reset button it's
kind<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.000> hidden<00:02:18.150> but<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.100> just

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
kind of hidden but there it is just

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.800 
kind of hidden but there it is just
click<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.770> if<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.940> made<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
click it and if you see now I made a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.450 
click it and if you see now I made a
little<00:02:24.990> mistake<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.890> turn<00:02:26.070> off<00:02:26.100> all

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
little mistake you have to turn off all

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.280 
little mistake you have to turn off all
these<00:02:26.670> levers<00:02:27.600> before<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.760> reset<00:02:29.760> it

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
these levers before you can reset it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.160 
these levers before you can reset it
here<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.410> go<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:33.030> if<00:02:33.120> i<00:02:33.240> try<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> open<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.960> door

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
here we go and if i try to open the door

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.930 
here we go and if i try to open the door
now<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:35.570> think<00:02:36.570> what<00:02:36.840> happen<00:02:37.250> now<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
now I think what happen now for the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.300 
now I think what happen now for the
information<00:02:39.150> behind<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.950> said<00:02:41.280> before

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
information behind it as I said before

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.210 
information behind it as I said before
this<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.030> binary<00:02:42.540> encoder<00:02:43.100> changing<00:02:44.100> the

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
this is the binary encoder changing the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.090 
this is the binary encoder changing the
numbers<00:02:44.550> into<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> binary<00:02:45.240> code<00:02:45.650> which<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.830> four

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
numbers into a binary code which is four

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.030 
numbers into a binary code which is four
bits<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.580> then<00:02:47.870> it's<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.050> into<00:02:49.470> each<00:02:49.710> of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
bits and then it's going into each of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.000 
bits and then it's going into each of
the<00:02:50.430> memory<00:02:50.970> cells<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:52.320> memory<00:02:52.590> cell<00:02:52.830> is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
the memory cells the memory cell is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.229 
the memory cells the memory cell is
built<00:02:53.340> really<00:02:53.610> easy<00:02:54.020> pushes<00:02:55.020> up<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.200> piston

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
built really easy pushes up the piston

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.770 
built really easy pushes up the piston
of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.870> bit<00:02:58.830> that<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.220> turned<00:02:59.520> on<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.850> behind

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
of the bit that is turned on and behind

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.710 
of the bit that is turned on and behind
this<00:03:00.930> I've<00:03:01.230> built<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.760> tiny<00:03:03.150> binary

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
this I've built a really tiny binary

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.290 
this I've built a really tiny binary
decoder<00:03:04.290> which<00:03:04.980> only<00:03:05.250> decodes<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.910> number

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
decoder which only decodes the number

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.050 
decoder which only decodes the number
that<00:03:06.870> should<00:03:07.440> be<00:03:07.620> punched<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:08.940> this

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
that should be punched in so in this

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.150 
that should be punched in so in this
case<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.870> binary<00:03:10.290> code<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.860> number

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
case it's the binary code of the number

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.220 
case it's the binary code of the number
one<00:03:11.550> which<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.000> first<00:03:12.209> bid<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.930> all

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
one which is the first bid on and all

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890 
one which is the first bid on and all
the<00:03:13.320> other<00:03:13.440> bits<00:03:13.680> off<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:15.180> if<00:03:15.450> that<00:03:15.480> code<00:03:15.840> is

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
the other bits off so if that code is

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.520 
the other bits off so if that code is
actually<00:03:16.260> punched<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.360> won't<00:03:18.360> let<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.989> red

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
actually punched in it won't let the red

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.310 
actually punched in it won't let the red
stone<00:03:19.709> on<00:03:19.890> top<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:21.330> second<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.840> is<00:03:22.050> for<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
stone on top the second one is for the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.070 
stone on top the second one is for the
number<00:03:22.590> three<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:24.239> fourth<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
number three the fourth is for the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.979 
number three the fourth is for the
number<00:03:25.489> five<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:27.300> other<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.630> for<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
number five and the other one is for the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.620 
number five and the other one is for the
number<00:03:28.200> seven<00:03:28.590> so<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.180> codes<00:03:30.420> are

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
number seven so if all the codes are

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.750 
number seven so if all the codes are
punished<00:03:30.930> incorrectly<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.220> red<00:03:32.370> stone<00:03:32.580> on

punished incorrectly the red stone on

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.300 
punished incorrectly the red stone on
top<00:03:32.790> won't<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.510> lit<00:03:33.690> if<00:03:33.930> there<00:03:34.320> is<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.220> is

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
power this redstone pull up the Pistons

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.960 
power this redstone pull up the Pistons
down<00:04:14.159> here<00:04:14.430> so<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:16.220> bit<00:04:17.220> information<00:04:17.579> is

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
down here so the bit information is

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.430 
down here so the bit information is
pulled<00:04:18.209> through<00:04:18.500> to<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.859> memory<00:04:20.849> cells<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
pulled through to the memory cells and

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.830 
pulled through to the memory cells and
then<00:04:22.440> they<00:04:22.590> are<00:04:22.650> locked<00:04:22.889> and<00:04:23.509> that<00:04:24.509> happens

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
then they are locked and that happens

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.740 
then they are locked and that happens
with<00:04:25.020> all<00:04:25.199> four<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.669> memory<00:04:27.210> cells<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
with all four of the memory cells the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.620 
with all four of the memory cells the
other<00:04:31.139> thing<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.820> it's<00:04:32.820> very<00:04:33.120> important<00:04:33.509> is

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
other thing that it's very important is

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.070 
other thing that it's very important is
that<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:35.009> information<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:36.060> has<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.930> go

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
that the information that has to go

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.219 
that the information that has to go
through<00:04:37.410> is<00:04:37.949> powered<00:04:38.460> by<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.820> button<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.990> if

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
through is powered by this button so if

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.710

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
Redstone behind the Pistons if you don't

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.930 
Redstone behind the Pistons if you don't
do<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.570> if<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.870> power<00:04:46.229> them<00:04:46.470> by<00:04:46.620> default<00:04:47.039> you

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
do that if you power them by default you

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.140 
do that if you power them by default you
won't<00:04:48.150> be<00:04:48.300> able<00:04:48.419> to<00:04:48.690> reset<00:04:49.199> the<00:04:49.910> memory<00:04:50.910> cells

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
won't be able to reset the memory cells

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.029 
won't be able to reset the memory cells
because<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.900> memory<00:04:52.169> cells<00:04:52.380> will<00:04:52.560> be<00:04:52.680> powered

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
because the memory cells will be powered

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.580 
because the memory cells will be powered
by<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.060> Redstone<00:04:54.570> going<00:04:54.840> through<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.289> it

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
by the Redstone going through and it

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.920 
by the Redstone going through and it
won't<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.860> able<00:04:55.979> to<00:04:56.130> reset<00:04:56.460> them<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:59.240> it<00:05:00.240> pulls

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
won't be able to reset them so it pulls

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.920 
won't be able to reset them so it pulls
the<00:05:01.169> information<00:05:01.650> through<00:05:01.860> now<00:05:02.009> then<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.240> also

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
the information through now then it also

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.850 
the information through now then it also
looks<00:05:04.770> at<00:05:05.729> the<00:05:05.940> information<00:05:06.560> going<00:05:07.560> through

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
looks at the information going through

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.360 
looks at the information going through
this<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.180> input<00:05:09.830> going<00:05:10.830> to<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.070> end<00:05:11.220> and

be turned off and if it's off there is

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.990 
be turned off and if it's off there is
an<00:05:22.740> endless<00:05:23.130> here<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:26.580> button<00:05:26.880> that

an endless here and the button that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.120 
an endless here and the button that
powers<00:05:27.389> all<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.930> feeding<00:05:28.650> through<00:05:28.860> lines

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
powers all the feeding through lines

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.379 
powers all the feeding through lines
also<00:05:30.500> powers<00:05:31.500> this<00:05:32.159> redstone<00:05:32.610> torch<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:34.250> if

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
also powers this redstone torch and if

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.589 
also powers this redstone torch and if
the<00:05:36.389> information<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:37.139> top<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.680> turned<00:05:38.430> off<00:05:38.639> it

the information on top is turned off it

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.610 
the information on top is turned off it
will<00:05:39.780> also<00:05:39.960> empower<00:05:40.680> this<00:05:40.889> one<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:42.259> it<00:05:43.259> will

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
will also empower this one and it will

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.649 
will also empower this one and it will
feed<00:05:43.860> through<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.159> information<00:05:44.699> now<00:05:45.479> what

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
feed through the information now what

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:47.420 
feed through the information now what
I'm<00:05:45.810> also<00:05:45.990> going<00:05:46.289> to<00:05:46.380> build<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.919> what<00:05:47.310> is

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
I'm also going to build and what is

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.110 
I'm also going to build and what is
probably<00:05:47.820> going<00:05:48.000> to<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.240> in<00:05:48.330> next<00:05:48.810> video<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.349> a

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
probably going to be in next video is a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.209 
probably going to be in next video is a
way<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.150> count<00:05:51.990> how<00:05:52.440> many<00:05:52.500> times<00:05:52.710> you<00:05:53.039> have

00:05:53.209 --> 00:05:53.219 
way to count how many times you have

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.670 
way to count how many times you have
made<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> mistake<00:05:53.880> and<00:05:54.229> if<00:05:55.229> you<00:05:55.349> have<00:05:55.440> made

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
made a mistake and if you have made

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.450 
made a mistake and if you have made
three<00:05:56.009> mistakes<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:57.750> will<00:05:57.870> die<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:59.250> floor

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
three mistakes you will die the floor

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.760 
three mistakes you will die the floor
will<00:05:59.639> remove<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.719> will<00:06:00.840> fall<00:06:01.020> into<00:06:01.199> lava

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
will remove and you will fall into lava

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.820 
will remove and you will fall into lava
