00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
hinges on this little pin here and we're

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.570 
hinges on this little pin here and we're
going<00:00:30.470> to<00:00:30.529> want<00:00:30.710> to<00:00:30.830> take<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.130> out<00:00:31.189> first

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
because we're going to reuse that with

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.780 
because we're going to reuse that with
our<00:00:33.320> battery<00:00:33.800> door<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.220> thin<00:00:34.400> goes<00:00:34.610> through

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
our battery door the thin goes through

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.060 
our battery door the thin goes through
this<00:00:34.910> hole<00:00:35.120> here<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:36.110> allows<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.680> door

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
this hole here and that allows the door

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.910 
this hole here and that allows the door
to<00:00:37.250> hinge<00:00:37.489> and<00:00:37.730> close<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.839> what<00:00:39.830> I<00:00:39.860> recommend

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
out a little bit from one side so for

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.299 
out a little bit from one side so for
example<00:01:02.870> say<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:03.559> tapped<00:01:03.859> it<00:01:04.009> the<00:01:04.129> other<00:01:04.190> way

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
that you get a friend to hold the DJI

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
that you get a friend to hold the DJI
phantom<00:01:18.550> 4<00:01:18.880> you<00:01:19.180> from<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.450> other<00:01:19.540> side

because it is quite tough to get it out
in<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.710> first<00:01:24.040> place<00:01:24.250> well<00:01:24.670> as<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:24.880> can<00:01:25.030> see

for me so so once we've got this bar

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.170 
for me so so once we've got this bar
taken<00:01:31.870> out<00:01:32.160> what<00:01:33.160> we<00:01:33.220> need<00:01:33.370> to<00:01:33.460> do<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:33.760> grab<00:01:33.910> our

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
taken out what we need to do is grab our

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.690 
taken out what we need to do is grab our
battery<00:01:34.570> door<00:01:35.400> stick<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.550> bar<00:01:36.760> back<00:01:36.970> in<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.490> it

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
battery door stick the bar back in so it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.820 
battery door stick the bar back in so it
goes<00:01:39.940> through<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.360> first<00:01:40.600> clip<00:01:40.900> but<00:01:41.470> not<00:01:41.620> out

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830
