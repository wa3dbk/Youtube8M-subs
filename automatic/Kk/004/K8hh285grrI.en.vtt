00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.790
 I want to recommend you a good channel 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.010
 man, he also does the gaddy and various 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.139
 useful rollers of this field 4 bomb 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 watch and be sure to subscribe to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.240
 its channel hi guys all you hippies 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.189
 and how have we not seen each other so long ago 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.519
 how the last guide was two weeks ago 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.710
 and it made me make a new i'm on 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.660
 in fact very, very long thought on 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.910
 what did the guide do as the last 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 time I run with guns and stall and 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 did not want to try anything new 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.780
 but suddenly my keen gaze fell on 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.910
 support class as this is the only one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.579
 a class that I don't have any 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.350
 stars and i thought why is this so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.270
 stars and I have for other classes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.860
 enough for support none none 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.809
 you need to fix it urgently and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.670
 accordingly i need to take a weapon with 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.649
 which I will have to choose as well since I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.840
 I can not stand to bite and the planet 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.789
 logic, I accordingly took a pot-bellied 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.559
 machine gun but what you already understood from 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 names as you understand on your 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 m249 screens why this particular machine gun 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.939
 not some assault view 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 I like you more assault but this one 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.750
 I liked the machine gun because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.520
 700 fire shots per minute 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 as you know i love very much 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.420
 quick weapon and therefore what 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.549
 rapid-fire trunk so he me more 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.960
 like how do we open the trunk 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 it opens it is not very difficult you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 spend on it three or four hours of his 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 time but what you will need 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 pass the company and in the last mission in 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.439
 very end you will need to do 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 opt for 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.729
 the Irish and then you get this 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.770
 machine gun in general is actually a machine gun 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.659
 very good I liked it though 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.479
 young bellied only true to me 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.680
 didn't like it its design m249 it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.500
 generally one of three machine guns 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.689
 battlefield 4 which possesses both in 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 200 rounds and in general I found it very 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.340
 good modules and a couple of good tactics like 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.470
 you can be effective but now 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.540
 start take a look at the damage characteristics 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.939
 maximum 25 is applied at a distance 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.490
 up to eight meters and a minimum damage of 18 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.770
 applied at a distance of 65 meters in 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 principle standard and specific to 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.790
 many trunks here it is the most permin with 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.250
 This machine gun is reloading it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.619
 consists of 6.2 seconds that's just 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.360
 imagine 6 seconds the only thing 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.100
 what pleases you patron 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.290
 as many as 200 rounds of ammunition 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.480
 tactically reload from such machine guns 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.340
 unfortunately there is no and can not be 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.240
 well let's take a look at returns 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 vertically we will be 0.325 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.110
 horizontal recoil left is 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.350
 on the street and 45 acres and recoil right 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 is 0.3 here is the return also us 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.980
 it brings unstable and, therefore, 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.130
 firing accuracy should not be expected 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.140
 Incidentally, in the battlefield 3 m 249 was 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.420
 much more stable since its recoil 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.490
 made up four sides in all directions 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.310
 tenths and there it was necessary to fight 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.350
 upward and in bf4 we have to 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.180
 with horizontal recoil do something 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.340
 since the bullets will be after telstv 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.350
 scatter we somehow circle but let's 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.330
 Now I will tell you about fashion and which 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.610
 you should bet for improvement 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.470
 your game is my favorite build and in general 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.540
 probably the most effective for this 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.030
 the barrel is a permanent graphical sight 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.320
 on accessory take magna fire put 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.570
 on the table muzzle brake 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.910
 Must be built mount put bipod 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.010
 lie down somewhere in the aisle and shoot 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.840
 small opening and if holographic 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.170
 sight you do not have enough switch to 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.090
 magna fair general m249 is a good table 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.600
 which in my opinion is intended to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.519
 sushi 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.100
 as when you leave for bipod 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.269
 recoil almost disappears while magna headlights 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.940
 help you shoot for the farthest 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.250
 distances and by the way another clip on 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.110
 200 over the corpses will also help but the second 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.360
 assembly I enjoyed this little 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.000
 assembly for close range on sight 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.370
 we put any middle sight on my own 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 case of this again holographically us 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.390
 that accessories capital for smaller 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.160
 scatter on the trunk can be put 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.690
 muzzle brake like I haven't got you 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 advised and also well suited 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.980
 silencer for mode and tire domains to 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.260
 do not impersonate on the card and on 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.600
 podstvolny slot set ergonomic 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.000
 or vertical 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.520
 q to improve shooting from the hip but 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.890
 I'll say right away that I'm not very good at the second build. 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.140
 love and little with no run well in general what 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.940
 you can say 100 good but hurry 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.060
 notice that battlefield 3 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.160
 He was much better and more stable and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.860
 In general, use the first build as 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.290
 February 18 and this is on Tuesday 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.660
 supplement second aces which adding 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.880
 subway operations map 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.530
 machine gun just the same and drag and what are you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.630
 think about this trunk write to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.490
 comments as well write on what 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.200
 make the next guide comment 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.420
 who collect the most likes on 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.130
 that trunk I will do the guide but now
