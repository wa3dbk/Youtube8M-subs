00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:16.289
 the staff is a microphone test and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.830
 yoga m without microphone to acquire na 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 free market is I paid around 90 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 plus the freight gave about 113 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 to the microphone that has a 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.840
 value for money is good is a good price one 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.840
 good quality 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 the tsl is speaking here record a 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.620
 test 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 I see that turning off my electric fence 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.270
 because the electric fence she was giving 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.860
 a small little microphone signal 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.460
 Mic is only connected to the camera. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 It has nothing on what is in the making 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.809
 to give this interference more 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 always interference electricity 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.840
 even it 's good to be careful who 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.380
 will record somewhere such that 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:11.310
 may have an electric fence nearby 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.229
 something is something of energy and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.400
 will cause some interference in the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.040
 microphone 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.850
 That microphone I bought him there for 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 make some video recordings is 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 in a study I'm riding 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.549
 here is this studio, i'm going to be a studio 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.680
 homemade or make some videos some 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:38.850
 things and that's why I intended to 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.590
 that the team is actually aaa 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.840
 availability to buy a microphone 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.210
 of the lapel that is the one you are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 seeing here I put it inside the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.759
 he has a son of four 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.439
 meters long I still think small 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.920
 because my studio is going to stay 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.649
 big is going to have a chrome here and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.960
 I need what's a little far 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.840
 maybe in the future I can then use 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.780
 one 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.420
 the boom but in case you start doing 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.390
 all the recordings with this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 microphone I found a microphone with a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 very good quality 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.000
 the video you will're seeing there in 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.400
 youtube there is a video that has none 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.040
 editing is editing images do not lie 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:28.299
 sound and video editing and that's it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.440
 personal is yoga m100 is a great 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.450
 microphone 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.080
