00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what is it boss and telling I'm the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.990

they're well-coached should start off

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
they're well-coached should start off
with<00:01:15.930> no<00:01:16.890> starts<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.299> thing<00:01:18.509> starts<00:01:18.810> with

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
with no starts so I thing starts with

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.620
