00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 to capture the light of the sun is one 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.279
 ancient humanity dream 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.340
 Now this dream could finally be 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.230
 truth does not come out clean 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.389
 the whole could 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.820
 but filigree technology and the right one 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:20.980
 know how are indispensable 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.020
 legendary shield citizens lacked that 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.060
 necessary to know light in the dark too 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.710
 bring them try sunrays 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 bucket and sack from outside 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.169
 of course, without success 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.170
 promising it is on the other hand 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.280
 the fh nuremberg 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.750
 we have managed what the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.940
 we did not make it 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.070
 Do not take a bucket for light into the house 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.070
 wear but we take the sleep 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.199
 these three students are the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 turtle of our time 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.850
 alexander kiss is the specialist for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.479
 the optics sebastian schütz takes care of himself 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 about the mechanics and michael kellermann 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:08.460
 is the pro for electronics three 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.530
 years of development work and a lot 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 The young francs have a lot of heart in it 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:21.090
 project the sector stuck core piece 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.319
 is a small sun bulb after the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.909
 aligning the sun and thus 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.940
 that really ensures the light 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.740
 the lenses in the fibers hits the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.360
 the next big challenge was that 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.750
 bundle and direct the light over 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.280
 Longer distances the light what 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.159
 I just moved in this phase 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.319
 always in zigzag at this stage to the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 outside walls reflects and can as well 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.060
 over the entire fiber length also just 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.890
 even if the driver turns or around the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.690
 corner suffers to catch the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.580
 Sunbeams will be the solar collector 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.259
 installed on the roof of the building 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.090
 you only need one for the lines 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.700
 small hole of five centimeters 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 then the light can flow up to 20 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.960
 meter far 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.610
 The 800 fibers of the light tube can 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.260
 you divide as you like and 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.950
 so that different dark corners of the 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.300
 illuminate the building 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 for the operation is however 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.640
 Sunshine is the first sunlight 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.500
 once captured over 60% of the land 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 natural light over the lines in the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.650
 House 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.660
 Overall , the sturdy plexiglas deliver 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.239
 fibers about the same brightness as 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.100
 20 light bulbs with a power of 60 each 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.870
 watt one floor down in the lab shows 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:38.480
 already that the transport of the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:43.790
 sunlight works very small part 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.800
 here are 30 optical fibers in and there 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.140
 right at the end this is really 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.790
 the dry end simply the fibers 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.080
 cut off to the polished and there 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.260
 the light comes out into the 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.569
 angle with 60 degrees and exactly to the end 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.640
 Can you do something like this here? 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.050
 this puts the optics on the light 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.329
 a bit fanned out and 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.690
 better distributed by that it is easy 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.680
 beautiful homogeneous looks there are many 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.290
 different design options 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.360
 and areas of application 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.489
 Sunburn is excluded by the way 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.540
 because the fibers are not harmful uv 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.359
 let waves through 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.900
 only the best of the sunbeams comes 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.519
 to us house is exactly the visible 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.420
 light what you really see with your eyes 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.799
 able to see 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.040
 There are many studies that also say 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.939
 that children, for example, essential 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.590
 are more successful in the long if they are 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.540
 are under sunlight and so are 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.819
 Generally the body is just up 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.530
 sunlight aligned the nürnberger 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.989
 have already founded a company 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.269
 Goals are now series production and 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.670
 a price under 5000 euro already 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.470
 several pieces are sold a sunny one 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.540
 the future the young inventors need 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.470
 because without the sun it stays the same with the sun 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.470
 collector dark
