holidays and other special occasions
enjoy

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.830 

this<00:00:25.150> is<00:00:25.360> three<00:00:25.720> yards<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.320> ribbon<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
this is three yards of ribbon and this

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.510 
this is three yards of ribbon and this
long<00:00:29.170> piece<00:00:29.500> of<00:00:29.530> wire<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:31.750> going<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
long piece of wire we're going to just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.240 
long piece of wire we're going to just
make<00:00:36.520> a<00:00:36.550> loop<00:00:36.910> out<00:00:37.150> of<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:39.010> like<00:00:39.130> that

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
make a loop out of it just like that

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.030 
make a loop out of it just like that
just<00:00:39.760> kind<00:00:39.970> of<00:00:40.090> tighten<00:00:40.510> it<00:00:40.630> just<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.989> tad<00:00:41.230> and

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
just kind of tighten it just a tad and

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
just kind of tighten it just a tad and
then<00:00:42.910> you'll<00:00:43.059> take<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.930> center<00:00:44.440> portion<00:00:44.739> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
then you'll take the center portion of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.200 
then you'll take the center portion of
this<00:00:46.210> particular<00:00:46.870> ribbon<00:00:47.790> which<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:48.820> about

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
this particular ribbon which is about

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.890 
this particular ribbon which is about
here<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.309> you'll<00:00:51.520> make<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:52.000> loop<00:00:54.690> about<00:00:55.690> like

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
here and you'll make a loop about like

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.020 
here and you'll make a loop about like
that<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.440> kind<00:00:56.770> of<00:00:56.829> creates<00:00:57.250> at<00:00:57.520> the<00:00:57.640> center

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
that that kind of creates at the center

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.050 
that that kind of creates at the center
a<00:00:58.240> center<00:00:58.690> loop<00:00:59.370> now<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.430> take<00:01:00.790> this

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.060 
a center loop now you take this

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.970 
a center loop now you take this
particular<00:01:01.329> portion<00:01:02.079> of<00:01:02.380> the<00:01:02.500> ribbon<00:01:02.829> and

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
particular portion of the ribbon and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.120 
particular portion of the ribbon and
twist<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.450> twist<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:08.050> you<00:01:08.350> get<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
twist it when you twist it you get the

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.900 
twist it when you twist it you get the
right<00:01:09.340> side<00:01:09.700> again<00:01:10.300> create<00:01:10.960> another<00:01:11.259> loop

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
right side again create another loop

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.590 
right side again create another loop
this<00:01:12.910> particular<00:01:13.270> three<00:01:13.899> loop<00:01:14.520> bow<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:18.600> fairly

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
this particular three loop bow is fairly

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.859 
this particular three loop bow is fairly
easy<00:01:19.990> if<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.410> keep<00:01:20.619> your<00:01:20.860> twisting<00:01:21.869> under

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
easy if you keep your twisting under

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.940 
easy if you keep your twisting under
your<00:01:23.020> thumb<00:01:23.399> so<00:01:24.399> then<00:01:24.580> twist<00:01:24.910> the<00:01:25.060> other<00:01:25.210> one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
your thumb so then twist the other one

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.600 
your thumb so then twist the other one
keeping<00:01:26.950> your<00:01:27.070> thumb<00:01:27.750> secure<00:01:28.750> on<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.310> then

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
keeping your thumb secure on it and then

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.570 
keeping your thumb secure on it and then
twisting<00:01:34.120> it<00:01:34.240> again<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.950> you'll<00:01:36.100> twist<00:01:36.430> the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
twisting it again then you'll twist the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.800 
twisting it again then you'll twist the
underside<00:01:37.240> ribbon

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.330 

you'll<00:01:40.810> take<00:01:41.110> this<00:01:41.380> loop<00:01:42.299> feed<00:01:43.299> it<00:01:43.479> through

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 

sometimes<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.299> tries<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.690> get<00:01:51.810> away<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
sometimes it tries to get away with you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.560 
sometimes it tries to get away with you
and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:53.909> slip<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> through<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
and then you just slip it through of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
and then you just slip it through of
course<00:01:54.900> and<00:01:55.940> tighten<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.560> now<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> want<00:01:59.009> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
course and tighten it now if you want to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
course and tighten it now if you want to
make<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.460> bow<00:01:59.610> bigger<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.600> add<00:02:00.720> more<00:02:00.990> loops

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
make the bow bigger and add more loops

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.149 
make the bow bigger and add more loops
to<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:03.030> do<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.299> same<00:02:03.479> process<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.440> would

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
to it just do the same process I would

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.300 
to it just do the same process I would
suggest<00:02:05.400> that<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.800> secure<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
suggest that you just secure it at the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.350 
suggest that you just secure it at the
third<00:02:09.410> loop<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.340> start<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.850> process

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
third loop and then start the process

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.809 
third loop and then start the process
over<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> want<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.170> work<00:02:13.319> with<00:02:13.530> say<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.819> a

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
over if you want to work with say a a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.400 
over if you want to work with say a a
five<00:02:15.330> or<00:02:15.510> six<00:02:15.890> yard<00:02:16.890> tail<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.840> then<00:02:18.840> possibly

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
five or six yard tail and then possibly

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.290 
five or six yard tail and then possibly
have<00:02:19.620> seven<00:02:20.160> loops<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> want<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.940> really

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
have seven loops if you want a really

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.810 
have seven loops if you want a really
big<00:02:21.420> bow<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> would<00:02:22.739> secure<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> after<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
big bow but I would secure it after the

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.160 
big bow but I would secure it after the
third<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:25.110> start<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> process<00:02:26.310> again

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
third and then start the process again

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.410 
third and then start the process again
adding<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.350> few<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.940> if<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.300> would

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
adding a few more if you if you would

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.560 
adding a few more if you if you would
like<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.930> make<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.200> bigger<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:32.340> way<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
like to make it bigger that way it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.720 
like to make it bigger that way it
doesn't<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:34.050> away<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.739> sometimes<00:02:35.580> if

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
doesn't get away with you sometimes if

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
doesn't get away with you sometimes if
you<00:02:35.850> do<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> loop<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:36.510> more<00:02:36.930> than<00:02:37.140> three<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you do a loop that's more than three to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.020 
you do a loop that's more than three to
five<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.709> center<00:02:41.160> ends<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:41.970> being

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
five the the center ends up not being
