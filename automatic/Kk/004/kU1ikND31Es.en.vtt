00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
things that you keep you don't go ahead

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.960 
things that you keep you don't go ahead
and<00:01:52.049> buy<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.860> every<00:01:53.159> emblem<00:01:53.549> layer<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and buy you know every emblem layer and

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.880 
and buy you know every emblem layer and
title<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> player<00:01:54.750> card<00:01:55.079> before<00:01:55.619> your

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
title on the player card before your

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.219 
title on the player card before your
prestige<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.420> instant<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.840> open<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
prestige so that the instant you open it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
prestige so that the instant you open it
up<00:01:58.320> again<00:01:58.469> you'll<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> flexibility<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

do<00:01:59.909> whatever<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.659> with<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.290> um

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
do whatever you want with it so um

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
do whatever you want with it so um
anyway<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.310> think<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.360> more

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
anyway I think that this is a more

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.230 
anyway I think that this is a more
complete<00:02:03.899> list<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.649> than<00:02:05.640> anyone<00:02:05.939> else<00:02:06.090> has

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
complete list then than anyone else has

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
complete list then than anyone else has
done<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.450> what<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.079> keep<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> lose

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
done on what you keep and what you lose
