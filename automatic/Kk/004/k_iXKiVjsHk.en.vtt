00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530
 ah 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.280
 and this is the video of the little things that 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.160
 I'm going to teach you can show them and if 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.019
 they like it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.460
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to make hair 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.049
 with a gadget of this I know it is 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.490
 very easy there are people who know proposal 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.290
 well there are people who do not know the case is 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.939
 that's where they are going, these are the materials 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.130
 what we need the director 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.500
 obviously a mirror the cream for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.840
 combing hooks and a simple comb 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.150
 what you use first we are going to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:38.070
 combing after this we are going to prepare 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.540
 I go to receive heat for this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 let's use a cream to comb myself 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.950
 I recommend that it be reparative to use the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.950
 brand that want to repeat 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:06.030
 and wait for it to dry then when 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.220
 I'm dry, apply the one again 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.990
 is the brand you prefer around 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.760
 of the hair in everything because 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.760
 we need for the curls 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.040
 the poÃ©sie to start reviewing the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.420
 hair, it is recommended that 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 choose an address for these yes they are 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.369
 wavy as I tell them to fuck 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.930
 the orientation that your hair has if 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.409
 you can not choose the one you want 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.850
 formless there are other cases 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.350
 that people curl their hair for a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.149
 side and for the other for that style 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.789
 opined if they want to achieve what one 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.950
 Do what you want to divide your hair 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.810
 by sections, it is recommended that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.520
 the top part then do with 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.049
 smaller sections and work 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.360
 be a little bigger to help 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.000
 to your tour and all that but if you want 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.649
 do it all the same do it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.110
 is how you want you can achieve the 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.420
 look that they prefer some people use 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.600
 the planned to bring the thinker to me 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.979
 it seems a bit for everyone in the use and it 's 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.899
 what they must do to undo 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.509
 hair then roll up hair 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.429
 around the chopper, trying to 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.630
 this occupies all the paint that 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.690
 superimpose 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.690
 of the 234 seconds 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.190
 repeat in the carrier process of 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.190
 hair 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.340

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:36.220
 traveling to the fridge I searched for my 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 lost harmonica and although it was not 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.900
 impeded I searched in my pocket what I did not

 when they already have hair like that 15 minutes 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.170
 then they begin to remove the clamps to 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.170
