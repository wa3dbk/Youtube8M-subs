00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.800
 and review the mascara lipu pahrump that 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.679

 I will show and also the pigments below vi 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.589
 I leave a link that goes directly to 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.409
 show you the video tutorial I have 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.899
 made of pupa vamp e pigments 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.260
 even with mascara mascara are 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.140
 these are the colors as you see and that is purple 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.960
 fuchsia purple fuchsia don't mind the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.190
 my finger or who has had an accident is 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.010
 a little serious and joey saying fuchsia purple 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.920
 green and orange turquoise and coral 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.840
 they are beautiful you can use them on 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.479
 the whole china just for an effect 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.969
 shopping in the evening or otherwise you put 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.820
 in black mascara and then on the tips yes 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:29.920
 apply the desired color have 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.920
 effects different monster schedules 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.070
 pigments can be used either 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.500
 wet that dry and really are 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.510
 intense I recommend re-use first 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.810
 application of the pigments of a 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:54.170
 primer and a concealer and as a basis 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.840
 because they are very intense and very pmi 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.530
 pigmented and therefore penetrate 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 quite a lot of 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.009
 and to remove them it is necessary anyway 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 a waterproof product 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450
 these are the same colors that they are 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.480
 combined with mascara 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.410
 and the prices however fluctuate from 9 to 10 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.400
 10 euros of all these products here 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.770
 euro plus euro less and then I was also 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.560
 the glitter and I took advantage of the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.500
 20 percent discount from sephora e 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.330
 every wild dog must be done and those 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.080
 here these are the colors I have 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:43.910
 purchased and I show you and there is a rose 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.000
 a silver white a purple a reason 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 beautiful coral and this green and not 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.989
 is that I had no glitter pro these here 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.989
 they are really fantastic 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.590
 I tried some that I already had too 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.379
 urban decay and other brands but these 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.980
 is that I have also applied below a 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.959
 this make up and stay a lot e 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.450
 soft because you know that sometimes what 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.019
 apply in these glitter after a 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.000
 It attracts little skin to be absolutely 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.120
 very soft not to say does not make the wing 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.829
 so annoying tina strips and you have to 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.680
 advice then I found the dispenser 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:34.489
 dispenser the complete display with everyone 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.450
 the pupa eye shadows because they are yes 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.909
 they divide into cooked eye shadows that yes 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.299
 can use both wet and 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:46.760
 dry or compact here they are I 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.180
 I purchased this baked eyeshadow 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.819
 with these two colors you see the blue and the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.620
 green 300 and 305 and blue and I have to 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:01.040
 say that I used it already for this 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:07.129
 mica you expect with me is intense and also 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.079
 if you apply it and dry without it 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.440
 use the damp brush anyway 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.870
 and it remains very much and very much 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.720
 writing what color is compact ho 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.579
 bought the 101 you say but with 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.799
 all the beautiful colors that were there and weight 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.570
 the call organs, in other words a color and 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.849
 vanilla I call it that because that 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.620
 But the mob always uses the 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.169
 tried it really is really 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.840
 writing this small of the brand yes 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.120
 see a little here and now anyway 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.970
 you will see the efforts of these two 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.860
 products to make you understand the difference 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.380
 and anyway that too 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.400
 used to illuminate this area 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.400
 of the eyebrow arch 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.610
 and finally the three cream eye shadows mi 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.600
 I am very happy because he already has them 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.680
 used 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.870
 the seventeenth century which is a color a little 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.270
 dove you will see this color here that it is 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.360
 the color used here for 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.340
 blend with blue and this tutorial 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.970
 make up and I'll leave you the link below 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:24.570
 when it is online and on a web tv and 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.670
 I must say I applied it either 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:30.370
 inside the eye and also the rhyme 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:33.820
 lower eyelid lashes 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.180
 lower and no sex remains 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.850
 dry that bothers that pull remains 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.700
 soft, still has several hours I 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.770
 this make up and did not take off for 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:48.760
 nothing else color this here 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.890
 six hundred then there is the 201 which is a green 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.260
 beautiful emerald that I don't have yet 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.450
 used which I will now show you of 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.030
 hashish type and that still applies 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:01.860
 Sassari reported and then there is this 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:08.650
 black here that I tried to use e 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:11.680
 the six hundred one I tell him as it seems 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.350
 a little bit the mirifica is inspired 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.550
 and last year's chanel to tell you 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.550
 how beautiful it is 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.000
 and these are the products I wanted you 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.180
 show videos 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.220
 and I hope you have been useful anyway 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.000
 you have seen the four products I have 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:38.510
 used here as in make up as 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.550
 however I keep them as writers and 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.650
 nothing let me know if you have them 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.460
 purchased what you think about it and so on 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.710
 etc 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.320
 b kiss everyone else's parenthesis 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.780
 even if you see these products that 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.090
 you can compare with others that you already have 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.700
 so out of curiosity about e baciamo e 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.180
 of course there is the mixed and that is 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.180
 here with us
