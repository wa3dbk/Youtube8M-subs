00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.099
 good morning we are on the street 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 carts in the heart of madrid and is 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 the winter sales have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.920
 started in a generalized way in all 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.839
 the autonomous communities up to 50% 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.910
 discount we can find in many 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.320
 businesses and up to 70% that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 will continue throughout this time of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 rebates and we want to know between 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.930
 other things how much will be spent if you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.010
 they will spend more or less money now 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 for the January slope that you know 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 which is very complicated and if they have something 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 fixed that buy or buy on the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 everything up we will see this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.860
 tomorrow here on play efe television in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.960
 No bag you have bought with the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.690
 drops some boots you have found a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 good price the same one that had seen them 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.610
 actually I think they did not come down almost 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.170
 nothing but good that is what is most 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.150
 drawing attention to these clothes or what 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.310
 that less 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.720
 I do not know say they will drop much the 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.900
 dams but I think that follows us well 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.460
 going up at all prices is normal 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.050
 I do not notice much the physical difference that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.480
 you have in mind 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.630
 of all a little coats and the odd 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:17.490
 cowboy what we most need a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:18.570
 little good to the party already with a 40 50 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.030
 percent which is fine is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.380
 affordable a little but the bad are 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.090
 sizes are we then not anythin 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.520
 Of course that is the problem that when 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
 we are going to buy, there are only a few sizes left and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:39.660
 what are left are large sizes already 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 you like to buy, it has been 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.900
 been a change and the dresses and now in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 rebates has some budget does not go 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.630
 on the fly I do not usually spend 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 A lot, either, what is it that something 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.720
 what would you like to buy so up 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.730
 let it not be a while until they come down 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.730
 more you do not think about buying anything 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.130
 approximately contrasted then look 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.700
 between yesterday that would be about 100 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.670
 euros approx and today about 70 good the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.650
 truth is that it is very good is a good 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.620
 number not for the dates on which 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 we are and above all because it goes down yes 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.340
 but if I also think about it because 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
 the money is from my mother 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.560
 and I feel a little consumerist but 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 good is that it is usually shelter now makes 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.010
 cold here in madrid and the shoes there 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.780
 that also go well shoes to be 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.350
 They are working all day and all day 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.940
 doing things and it's not like I'm going to 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 buy me an ipad or adapt to the 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 things that you need and above all that you 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.870
 is going to take advantage because the truth 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.920
 like to buy me a quality garment 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.860
 of brand a good brand but well 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.690
 worked but well relaxed but that's 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.430
 very difficult well I do not know I think it's 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.980
 so much is the second day of sales and there are 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.610
 things very well and I think in the end they take 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.069
 better things how much money do you want 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.760
 spend it then 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:16.200
 in a good thing because if in 150 we read 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.239
 that he has already bought not in sales until 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.159
 below but we continue to come from 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.069
 visit and we have bought something has been 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.900
 bought then clothes with the lady and have 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.389
 found some good prices 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.299
 prices may be better at the moment 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.370
 I imagine to do the first ones because 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.409
 still will not be the best prices 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.269
 but how are we visiting here madrid 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.900
 then we take advantage of how much 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.980
 spent more agents 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.980
 without euros 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.269
 markdown itself to begin I can 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.519
 buy what the kings like us have 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.319
 made money you can take advantage 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.849
 and you buy now that the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.099
 rebates that me and that takes mind to 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.810
 buy then right now as I 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.310
 They gave away an ebook as a sleeve 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.989
 looking for the cover and little else more 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.549
 from here from the great thoroughfare of 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.379
 madrid we say goodbye to this 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.030
 report first day of sales 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.829
 thanking that have accompanied us 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.420
 that they have taken good note of what 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.220
 is making people in rebates that 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.900
 know how to economize but above all that 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.620
 take what they like the most 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.620
