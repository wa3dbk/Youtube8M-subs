series<00:00:11.450> on<00:00:11.630> this<00:00:11.870> video<00:00:12.139> i'ma<00:00:12.380> tell<00:00:12.620> you<00:00:12.710> what

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800 
series on this video i'ma tell you what

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.010 
series on this video i'ma tell you what
those<00:00:12.950> numbers<00:00:13.160> mean<00:00:13.370> on<00:00:13.760> props<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:14.809> there<00:00:14.930> are

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
those numbers mean on props so there are

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.630 
those numbers mean on props so there are
two<00:00:15.230> key<00:00:15.500> numbers<00:00:15.860> to<00:00:16.039> props

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
two key numbers to props

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.720 
two key numbers to props
this<00:00:16.910> one<00:00:17.120> is<00:00:17.300> an<00:00:17.539> 8<00:00:17.810> by<00:00:18.050> 4<00:00:18.380> prop<00:00:18.730> specifically

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
this one is an 8 by 4 prop specifically

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.590 
this one is an 8 by 4 prop specifically
the<00:00:20.180> prop<00:00:20.539> is<00:00:20.840> 8<00:00:21.230> inches<00:00:21.980> in<00:00:22.340> diameter<00:00:23.030> and

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
the prop is 8 inches in diameter and

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.300 
the prop is 8 inches in diameter and
length<00:00:24.280> see<00:00:25.280> that<00:00:25.460> 8<00:00:25.730> inches<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:26.680> it's<00:00:27.680> pitch

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
length see that 8 inches and it's pitch

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.690 
length see that 8 inches and it's pitch
is<00:00:29.210> 4<00:00:29.780> inches<00:00:30.100> see<00:00:31.100> how<00:00:31.190> much<00:00:31.310> of<00:00:31.370> an<00:00:31.520> angle

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
is 4 inches see how much of an angle

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.330 
is 4 inches see how much of an angle
this<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.059> that's<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.629> angle<00:00:33.140> of<00:00:33.290> the<00:00:33.410> prop<00:00:33.710> so

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
this is that's the angle of the prop so

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.729 
this is that's the angle of the prop so
this<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.329> greater<00:00:35.750> pitch<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:36.350> this<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.620> a

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
this is a greater pitch and this is a

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.770 
this is a greater pitch and this is a
smaller<00:00:37.129> pitch<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:37.969> to<00:00:38.030> help<00:00:38.180> visualize<00:00:38.390> this

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
smaller pitch so to help visualize this

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.530 
smaller pitch so to help visualize this
let<00:00:38.960> me<00:00:39.050> show<00:00:39.230> you<00:00:39.289> an<00:00:39.410> example<00:00:39.500> this<00:00:40.370> is<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.820> 7

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
let me show you an example this is a 7

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.530 
let me show you an example this is a 7
by<00:00:41.660> 4<00:00:41.930> prop<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.710> is<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:42.980> same<00:00:43.190> company<00:00:43.910> as<00:00:44.120> a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
by 4 prop this is the same company as a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.080 
by 4 prop this is the same company as a
PC<00:00:44.960> makes<00:00:45.230> these<00:00:45.380> props<00:00:45.680> it's<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:46.340> same<00:00:46.520> pitch

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
PC makes these props it's the same pitch

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.020 
PC makes these props it's the same pitch
so<00:00:47.630> they<00:00:47.720> both<00:00:47.930> would<00:00:48.140> move<00:00:48.380> 4<00:00:48.739> inches<00:00:49.190> through

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
so they both would move 4 inches through

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.660 
so they both would move 4 inches through
a<00:00:50.060> medium<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.960> air<00:00:51.500> or<00:00:51.770> water<00:00:51.980> under<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:52.550> know

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
a medium of air or water under you know

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.580 
a medium of air or water under you know
full<00:00:53.000> efficiency<00:00:53.120> and<00:00:53.690> everything<00:00:53.989> since<00:00:54.440> its

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
full efficiency and everything since its

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.130 
full efficiency and everything since its
maximum<00:00:55.130> output<00:00:55.280> is<00:00:55.550> 4<00:00:55.790> inches<00:00:56.030> per<00:00:56.780> rotation

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
maximum output is 4 inches per rotation

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.889 
maximum output is 4 inches per rotation
let's<00:00:57.860> go<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.010> size<00:00:58.220> smaller<00:00:58.550> this<00:00:59.030> is<00:00:59.180> a<00:00:59.300> 6<00:00:59.630> by<00:00:59.840> 4

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
let's go a size smaller this is a 6 by 4

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.030 
let's go a size smaller this is a 6 by 4
again<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.220> same<00:01:01.579> pitch<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:02.720> same<00:01:03.040> made

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
again the same pitch the same made

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.399 
again the same pitch the same made
everything<00:01:04.549> the<00:01:04.610> same<00:01:04.960> properties<00:01:05.960> except

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
everything the same properties except

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.830 
everything the same properties except
that<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:06.920> 6<00:01:07.219> inches<00:01:07.509> now<00:01:08.509> let's<00:01:08.689> go<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
that it's 6 inches now let's go the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
that it's 6 inches now let's go the
other<00:01:08.930> way<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:10.009> a<00:01:10.369> 9<00:01:11.210> by<00:01:11.570> 4<00:01:11.799> so<00:01:12.799> a<00:01:12.830> much

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
other way here is a 9 by 4 so a much

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.210 
other way here is a 9 by 4 so a much
larger<00:01:14.000> problem<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:15.229> these<00:01:15.350> are<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:15.710> 4

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
larger problem so but these are all 4

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.600 
larger problem so but these are all 4
inch<00:01:16.460> pitch<00:01:17.450> props<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:18.920> let<00:01:19.100> me<00:01:19.220> give<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.520> an

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
inch pitch props so let me give you an

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.149 
inch pitch props so let me give you an
example<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.210> different<00:01:20.570> pitched<00:01:20.930> props<00:01:21.500> this

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
example of different pitched props this

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.320 
example of different pitched props this
is<00:01:22.549> an<00:01:23.360> 8<00:01:23.510> by<00:01:23.690> 6<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.820> same<00:01:26.030> diameter

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
is an 8 by 6 so it's the same diameter

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.359 
is an 8 by 6 so it's the same diameter
or<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.020> same<00:01:27.290> length<00:01:27.560> right<00:01:27.770> they're<00:01:27.950> both<00:01:28.100> 8

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
or the same length right they're both 8

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.930 
or the same length right they're both 8
inches<00:01:28.760> but<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.810> pitch<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.500> different<00:01:31.010> look

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
inches but the pitch is different look

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.359 
inches but the pitch is different look
at<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.180> isn't<00:01:32.450> 8<00:01:32.540> by<00:01:32.659> 4<00:01:32.990> see<00:01:33.409> how<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:33.950> an<00:01:34.070> angle

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
at this isn't 8 by 4 see how at an angle

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.580 
at this isn't 8 by 4 see how at an angle
it<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.850> look<00:01:35.390> at<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:35.600> angle<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:36.200> much

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
it is and look at this angle it's much

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.640 
it is and look at this angle it's much
more<00:01:36.920> extreme<00:01:37.600> let's<00:01:38.600> show<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.930> different

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
more extreme let's show you a different

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.730 
more extreme let's show you a different
one<00:01:39.799> this<00:01:39.950> is<00:01:40.250> an<00:01:40.520> 8<00:01:41.270> by<00:01:41.450> 8<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.200> even<00:01:42.530> more

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
one this is an 8 by 8 this is even more

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.130 
one this is an 8 by 8 this is even more
extreme<00:01:43.189> look<00:01:43.490> at<00:01:43.549> that<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:44.510> almost<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.930> a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
extreme look at that it's almost like a

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.649 
extreme look at that it's almost like a
45<00:01:45.560> degree<00:01:45.710> angle<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:46.580> problem<00:01:47.090> an<00:01:47.330> 8<00:01:47.479> by<00:01:47.630> 8

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
45 degree angle this problem an 8 by 8

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.469 
45 degree angle this problem an 8 by 8
and<00:01:48.170> then<00:01:49.010> one<00:01:49.220> more<00:01:49.520> this<00:01:50.180> one<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.689> 8<00:01:51.140> by<00:01:51.619> 10

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
and then one more this one is 8 by 10

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.070 
and then one more this one is 8 by 10
look<00:01:53.479> at<00:01:53.570> that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
look at that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080 
look at that
this<00:01:54.200> was<00:01:54.380> really<00:01:55.159> correct<00:01:55.549> let<00:01:55.790> me<00:01:55.850> show<00:01:56.000> you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
this was really correct let me show you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.530 
this was really correct let me show you
just<00:01:56.150> the<00:01:56.450> two<00:01:56.780> extremes<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.939> make<00:01:59.090> sense<00:01:59.360> 8

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
just the two extremes that make sense 8

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.840 
just the two extremes that make sense 8
by<00:01:59.720> 4<00:02:00.049> 8<00:02:00.380> by<00:02:00.860> 10

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
by 4 8 by 10

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.160 
by 4 8 by 10
I<00:02:01.880> hope<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.240> helps<00:02:02.540> I've<00:02:02.630> got<00:02:02.750> tons<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.080> other

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
I hope that helps I've got tons of other
