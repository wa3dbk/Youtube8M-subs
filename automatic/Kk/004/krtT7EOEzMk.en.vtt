 and what are wave like I'm the meño and 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.850
 Well, today I'm here again to 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.709
 teach them another tutorial we go on the 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.070
 tutorial today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.700
 make him to make a redoubt vaclik 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.350
 what 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.600
 to explain to the best how 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.920
 do it to put together a redondilla with 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.440
 a new low one they have to do 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.110
 is to do which is the next 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.580
 way you do not have to go running grabs 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.370
 the flight and then have to do the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.690
 talacha which is like this is like giving a 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.090
 bounce to after doing the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.430
 and turn around where doing 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.770
 as a kind a car I promise just that 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.080
 turning to face and when it ends 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.670
 ends with the feet together and turning 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.670
 next to where they were running 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.500
 number 2 the next thing you have to 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.110
 do that after having fallen from the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 redondilla should make the jump to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.600
 make it macri co place for that should 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.390
 raise your arms so they can 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.850
 grab some heights and then afterwards 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.729
 have to lean back to 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.170
 being able to do the rest of the return is 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.600
 recommended that when falling into 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 redondilla are included a little and then 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 and take the jump to act if it jumps more 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 high for your number 3 the next thing that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 has to do is that after that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 have made the redondilla and have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.570
 skipped if you want can 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.860
 become a ball to spin faster or 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 if it is that already grab a good height 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 they can stay that way stretched but 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.789
 when they fall they should try to fall with 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.730
 the feet a little separated more or less 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.860
 as at shoulder height 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.240
 in the case that they already have a lot 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.800
 balance and even to do it well 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.400
 can fall if you want with the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.400
 three together 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:56.180
 so they go to a test that 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.070
 these three steps that you just gave them 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.400
 they can work is that I'm going to 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.790
 win back the back to see if 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.790
 it can work 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.940
 the flag with the flag doing something 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 so good sometimes today's tutorial 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.739
 I hope you liked it and that if 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.390
 he wants to try it so they can do it but 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.959
 be careful because if you get them 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:30.150
 more you can reach the mother and good 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.349
 well also to tell them what 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.780
 well I know I remember the second 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.239
 section not yet good because I have not 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.209
 could record because I've been busy and 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.030
 I have not had time to tell my 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.530
 luís friend to come to record your 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.890
 friend because he also been busy 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.840
 Do not worry when at least 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.909
 what they expect more is going to go up the first 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.390
 video of making a section so 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.390
 waiting
