00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.300
 the nintendo console if it is known here 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.120
 like nintendo 64 or nintendo 64 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.849
 I even met these days. 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.820
 when I won the writing of the channel that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.449
 I even made the bo zhang crazy 5 more 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 powder 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 Look, I was sitting here all this time. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:31.769
 that she comes one more by remembering that in this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.350
 season I only had the little one at home 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 who was a microphone fan police station 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.510
 so I end up getting to know each other 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 video games at friends or in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
 famous rental companies 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 the game houses that even was the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 subject in the last one, remembering that the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 competitor of nintendo 64 playstation 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 I played really, really, really. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.660
 ps1 sold a lot more common is to 4 that 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000
 It sold around 32 million 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.949
 while the PS units and sold over 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 100 million units 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.049
 and I think because of that ps1 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.260
 ended up hiding in large part neither having 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.140
 64 I do not really handle much because 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.780
 This happened and such but I have almost 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 sure that he even sold more than 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.100
 cause of piracy 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.930
 logical it is much easier for you to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.890
 cd than fake the cartridge 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 really well at last coming out of the facts 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.090
 these days I was trying to remember the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.119
 because I got so little I understand 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.909
 64 I think it's so in the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 frequented the gargamel had many 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.299
 Super Nintendo 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.630
 But there was always a place in the corner. 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.420
 full of people and there was the nintendo 64 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.479
 I had only one in the whole rental and 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 I believe that one of the only ones in the city is 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.000
 small town in the normal interior 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.890
 I remember well that besides you have to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640
 set time to play 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.590
 Nintendo 64 the price has always been higher 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.079
 in relation to super nintendo for example 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.270
 is that it's not four players and everything else 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.470
 had to be more expensive and there 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.600
 very few gay 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.410
 to play if I 'm not mistaken I only had 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.360
 21 is the worst adventure racing is that the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.040
 people called the fletcher game and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.130
 This was the first game I played. 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.580
 of nintendo 64 that nostalgia cover m 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.950
 until today I played type 1 15 minutes 20 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.080
 and it just ran out of time my money ran out 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.410
 and when I looked last row to play 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.060
 the such of the nintendo 64 coveted video game 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 I do not know how nobody stole 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.220
 that fuck still there the time after 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.310
 finally managed to score more 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 friends cracking big such to play 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.630
 and this time we played the most coveted game 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.260
 of all our goldeneye 007 and I 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.570
 I always liked fps games that you play 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.290
 against a friend all rivalry and 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.470
 the taubaté I've always been hooked in the middle 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.020
 thread on ps1 always called friends to 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.120
 play with me but before you know the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.430
 rohner, I'm pretty sure the 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.400
 goal of nine was the first shooting game 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.220
 that I played verses and the idea of ​​playing 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.040
 one fps four people at the same time in 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.989
 The whole world killing itself was one of the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.450
 Smashing things all my life. 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.910
 it is not yours that if game is known until 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.160
 today is very good and was the first time 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.070
 playing with the analog because when 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.709
 I played ps1 I only used the arrows then 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.200
 It was shameful that I had more than four 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.890
 friends there then, when he died, 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.600
 control 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.459
 only I did not stay alive for 10 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.799
 seconds all that confusion with the 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.680
 analog and that trigger behind the 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:46.950
 control of the 64 is the damaging confusion 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.860
 more worth it as it was worth the feel 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.150
 you to the goal of deceiving our 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.150
 no comments 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.760
 and so was playstation logos 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 will replace all super nintendo sim 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.370
 even 164 disappeared from there and I played 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.830
 one more time and another 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.350
 game of jet ski called wave race and 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.769
 I hated and asked to change the game and 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.380
 I played the 6-frame club for a few years 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.990
 I closed the zelda ocarina of time. 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.780
 but it was an old pc that I had using 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.910
 an emulator but the last time even though 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.160
 I saw the console was in the house of 1 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.920
 from a friend he had the pokémon stadium 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.740
 and I did not know I had to do 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.540
 I was lost in the - it was there beating 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.020
 photos of pokémon does not even know it is 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.970
 doing and I was only playing 164 even in the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.190
 console these days 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.530
 so you realize years and years without seeing the 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.210
 Console I did not have much contact with 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.010
 This video game is a shame because it is 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.510
 great then when people 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.690
 they ask what is the best 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.480
 ps 1 64 ps1 I speak for the fact that the 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.580
 I actually played ps1 and it's your turn to 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.640
 Talk to me, you played a lot in the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.240
 interior 64 met him as he comments 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:02.250
 beneath beauty and here we close another 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.170
 remembering many thanks for having 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.060

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.940

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.330

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.020
