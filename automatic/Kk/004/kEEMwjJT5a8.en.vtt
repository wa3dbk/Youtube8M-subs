00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.049
 batista70phone friends continue i 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.070
 rom test for nexus 5 once 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.380
 of the slim 5.0.2 alpha but it is a roma that 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.810
 little alpha since everything works 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.060
 quietly and also the autonomy I have to 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.340
 say that more than satisfactory is equipped 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.559
 of ambient displays like most 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:37.010
 of the Roma currently on xda 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.719
 let's go see the notifications 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.120
 we say that we particularly have the 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.800
 possibility to go to set some 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.199
 things in the interface here it is 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.670
 quick setting interface we can do 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.370
 so that when we scroll to one side 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.859
 the setting appears directly here 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.249
 before the notifications or the bar of 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.289
 state 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.329
 we can enable the date then 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.519
 as you see I have brought with format 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.829
 long we can set the against 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.839
 brightness making the swipe over double 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.790
 touch to suspend and kicker of 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.290
 I will show you the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.930
 double tap to suspend finding it 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 very comfortable double tap and as you can see yes 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.130
 turn off we can turn on again for example 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.869
 using the volume key 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.950
 I must say that autonomy is very good 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.979
 as you see the grid and 5x5 and not 4x4 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.560
 as on many other Rome or on 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.920
 roma we say standard in this part 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.600
 we have our google as you see the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.600
 fluidity and really very good 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.909
 autonomy is absolutely good me 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.649
 meeting at 72 percent 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.729
 using this morning with three 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:44.259
 email accounts in push whatsapp and all 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:49.420
 my various social media accounts 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.420
 I seem to notice a good yield too 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.740
 maybe a little less than the 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.720
 previous roma the most white seems to me 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.720
 a lower newsletter 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.410
 as you also see the small keys of the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 navigation are smaller then 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.650
 leave more space for the display 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.440
 I repeat it is a rom that in my opinion of alpha 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.430
 I really have little using it from 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.760
 since yesterday and I must say that it absolutely goes 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.760
 no problem whatsoever 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 if you want to try it , I recommend it not 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.600
 has no appointment 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 the only thing I noticed is not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.210
 compatible with the widget that the use of 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.250
 usually that is kronus but it does not matter I am 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.760
 using a meter is just as 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.230
 functional and also good to see for 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.130
 the rest all my various programs 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.680
 games or for example also year as like 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.800
 navigator work without any 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.360
 problem and as you can see is already has 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.580
 already made the fix for which I tell you is a 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.600
 bella roma is as slim as it says 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.610
 the quick name fluid without too many 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.710
 frills as you see appear there 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.350
 directly notifications when there 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.840
 something comes 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.850
 try it now the tests will continue 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.630
 until something new comes to me 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.670
 to test 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.530
 with this concluded under loris le 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.530
 beat st70 for batiste sector
