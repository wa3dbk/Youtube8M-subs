a reference to round robin that we

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.019 
a reference to round robin that we
technically<00:00:02.879> just<00:00:03.210> didn't<00:00:03.600> do<00:00:04.580> but<00:00:05.580> it's<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
technically just didn't do but it's a

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.110 
technically just didn't do but it's a
team<00:00:06.299> of<00:00:06.450> four<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:07.189> brown<00:00:08.189> beans<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.849> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
team of four it brown beans for and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.970 
team of four it brown beans for and
robin<00:00:09.420> means<00:00:09.599> talking<00:00:10.050> alright<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.710> we<00:00:10.860> know

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
robin means talking alright so we know

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.410 
robin means talking alright so we know
the<00:00:11.250> first<00:00:11.280> step<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.059> there's<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the first step in that is there's a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.990 
the first step in that is there's a
teacher<00:00:12.630> post<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> problem<00:00:13.590> question<00:00:14.040> which

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
teacher post the problem question which

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.140 
teacher post the problem question which
harold<00:00:15.529> responses<00:00:16.529> or<00:00:17.369> solutions<00:00:17.940> and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
harold responses or solutions and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.050 
harold responses or solutions and
provides<00:00:18.420> wait<00:00:18.660> time<00:00:19.250> is<00:00:20.250> actually<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> exact

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
provides wait time is actually the exact

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
provides wait time is actually the exact
same<00:00:21.330> instructions<00:00:21.990> as<00:00:22.500> rowdy<00:00:22.890> rowdy<00:00:25.310> rowdy

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
same instructions as rowdy rowdy rowdy

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.509 
same instructions as rowdy rowdy rowdy
needs<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.910> ground<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.449> four<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.340> very

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
needs to ground it's four so is a very

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.130 
needs to ground it's four so is a very
similar<00:00:29.880> structure<00:00:32.000> step<00:00:33.000> two<00:00:33.329> students<00:00:33.960> take

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
similar structure step two students take

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
similar structure step two students take
turns<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.800> leaf<00:00:35.160> immune<00:00:35.489> responses<00:00:36.030> or

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
turns or leaf immune responses or

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.770 
turns or leaf immune responses or
solutions<00:00:37.820> now<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.120> little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
solutions now there's a little bit of a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.680 
solutions now there's a little bit of a
difference<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.450> an

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
difference in this one and it's like an

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.069 
difference in this one and it's like an
Asterix<00:00:46.200> underneath<00:00:47.570> round-robin<00:00:48.570> can

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
Asterix underneath round-robin can

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.049 
Asterix underneath round-robin can
require<00:00:49.410> longer<00:00:49.860> responses<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.940> do

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
require longer responses so you could do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
require longer responses so you could do
open-ended<00:00:51.449> questions<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.039> could<00:00:53.219> do

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
open-ended questions or you could do

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
open-ended questions or you could do
multiple<00:00:53.550> short<00:00:53.940> responses<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.809> one

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
multiple short responses with this one

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380 
multiple short responses with this one
and<00:00:55.469> busted<00:00:55.860> again<00:00:55.920> esteemeth<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.210> could

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
and busted again esteemeth or you could

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.729 
and busted again esteemeth or you could
ask<00:00:57.510> an<00:00:57.690> open-ended<00:00:57.960> question<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> everybody

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
ask an open-ended question and everybody

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.150 
ask an open-ended question and everybody
in<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> team<00:00:59.219> shares<00:00:59.550> their<00:00:59.760> response<00:01:00.120> or

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
in the team shares their response or

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
in the team shares their response or
let's<00:01:02.160> say<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> synonyms<00:01:03.270> for<00:01:03.480> word<00:01:03.690> right

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
let's say we do synonyms for word right

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.469 
let's say we do synonyms for word right
it<00:01:04.619> could<00:01:04.920> be<00:01:05.070> short<00:01:05.400> responses<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it could be short responses and you just

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
it could be short responses and you just
keep<00:01:06.630> going<00:01:06.780> around<00:01:06.990> until<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.650> can't<00:01:07.830> fix<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
keep going around until you can't fix it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.609 
keep going around until you can't fix it
more<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.600> before<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> could<00:01:10.590> be

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
more with your two before so it could be

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.190 
more with your two before so it could be
either<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.900> only

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
either one here that's the only

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.700 
either one here that's the only
difference

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
difference

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.770 
difference
rally<00:01:13.920> robin<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> two<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.360> really<00:01:15.600> want

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
rally robin with the two you really want

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.649 
rally robin with the two you really want
it<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> list<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:17.670> round<00:01:17.970> robin<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> could

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it to be a list but round robin it could

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.160 
it to be a list but round robin it could
be

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.039 

all<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.060> structure<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.869> team

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
all right so our structure for team

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
all right so our structure for team
building<00:01:25.200> today<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.979> brown<00:01:26.310> brother<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
building today was brown brother and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.889 
building today was brown brother and
that's<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.329> we<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:27.810> didn't<00:01:28.289> and<00:01:29.899> we've

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
that's when we just didn't and we've

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.240 
that's when we just didn't and we've
kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.200> already<00:01:31.380> talked<00:01:31.649> about<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.039> with

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
kind of already talked about this with

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.770 
kind of already talked about this with
the<00:01:32.369> questions<00:01:32.789> that<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.210> guys<00:01:33.360> were<00:01:33.570> posed

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the questions that you guys were posed

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.730 
the questions that you guys were posed
earlier

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
earlier

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.469 
earlier
what<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.310> purpose<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.820> team<00:01:36.060> building<00:01:36.210> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
what is the purpose of team building and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
what is the purpose of team building and
Hawks<00:01:36.689> building<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.229> your<00:01:37.320> students<00:01:37.789> and<00:01:38.789> we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
Hawks building for your students and we

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
Hawks building for your students and we
talked<00:01:39.570> about<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.560> build<00:01:40.740> those

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
talked about that is to build those

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
talked about that is to build those
relationships<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.640> build<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.000> easily<00:01:42.179> in

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
relationships to build them easily in

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.800 
relationships to build them easily in
the<00:01:42.539> classroom<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:44.030> does<00:01:45.030> doesn't<00:01:45.509> help

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the classroom and does doesn't help

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.539 
the classroom and does doesn't help
increase<00:01:46.049> student<00:01:46.439> achievement<00:01:46.500> well<00:01:47.280> I

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
increase student achievement well I

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.080 
increase student achievement well I
think<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.869> gives<00:01:49.259> me<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:50.549> instructional

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think so it gives me more instructional

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.899 
think so it gives me more instructional
time<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:52.200> teach<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:53.100> having<00:01:53.459> to<00:01:53.549> deal<00:01:53.729> with

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
time to teach than having to deal with

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.270 
time to teach than having to deal with
problems<00:01:54.299> with<00:01:54.450> my<00:01:54.810> kids<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.990> I<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.890> me<00:01:59.039> and
