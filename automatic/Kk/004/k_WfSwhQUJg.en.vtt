00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 parents I love both 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.230
 but 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.490
 If I have to choose one more, or if 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.070
 I will buy one of the two nothing more 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:08.690
 I would tell them to buy better systems 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.590
 berlingske is because because prince months 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.550
 that is has a story super father is 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.550
 a very long game 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 the online app is amazing to play 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.770
 against other people within all 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.780
 the world this has a lot of 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.750
 options to play online has 2 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.010
 those options all all those options 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.710
 does not have this game there is not a video that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.950
 I have on my channel that teaches them everything 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.500
 of the multiplayer and I think it's going to 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.440
 like a lot to the story your is 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.190
 super father this game is super super 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.650
 chingÃ³n and is the hate I prefer that 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.310
 buy in this game better there apart from 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.710
 that is what is said to the one who has already forgotten 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.230
 the memory of I'm seeing ok 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.870
 here back also what I liked about 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.310
 this game to forgiveness is that it's not that I 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.720
 I wanted to kill me I broke down 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.450
 I can put my camera in one places 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.770
 where you can not fall and well you can 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.170
 change the background of the case so that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.680
 have another 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.670
 another photo showed them 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.220
 As I was telling you this game, I 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:36.280
 I prefer sometimes you have that is more than 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.220
 a 13 also this one has 13 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.920
 gameplay is cool but it makes me like 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.640
 that repeats a lot but as I told you 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.060
 there they have it 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.760
 you can change the case the photo of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.720
 case for something different is cool and 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:58.010
 good as I told you this brand and sky is 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.970
 sorry and 113 is cool but it makes me 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.340
 that the levels repeat a lot and 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.780
 there are like 30 to 40 at levels that you have 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.670
 what to do or missions that you have to 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 pass but when you arrive as 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.870
 level what mission 20 25 27 of 30 like that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.390
 you start repeating the same missions 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.669
 almost nothing changes and that's why I preferred 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.150
 I prefer berni stents best service 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:30.140
 skies and also the one to play 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.580
 online and 113 is more or less because 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.370
 it's the same you have to be playing 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.650
 the same levels happening the same 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.990
 levels that you choose to pass 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.060
 regularly when you play alone but 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.460
 against someone rather when against a 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.180
 this against a friend or against someone 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.919
 more than I'm playing online then for 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.490
 that I prefer resistance burning skies 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.310
 and that is my opinion 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.669
 and I hope you can help them 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.819
 little more in my channel I have in the 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.660
 gameplays of the two games are going to see the 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:07.289
 difference to extension joys what 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:11.460
 I compare like gears of war 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:15.270
 and 113 I compare it more as call of duty 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.759
 but I say kauder and not because I compare them 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.899
 which are what is good as ur broth and 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:24.960
 I compare it more like the gameplay is this 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:27.749
 the type of game does not do not compare it so 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.399
 well that's like call of duty and that's why 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:32.309
 I say it's the gameplay is called 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:34.559
 during and well there they have it like a leaf 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:38.309
 as I said I wish and I can help you and 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:41.849
 then help this choose one of these 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:45.330
 two games and good again
