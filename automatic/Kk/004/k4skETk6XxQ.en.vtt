00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
of all I can you break it down for me

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.420 
of all I can you break it down for me
what<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> Supra<00:00:45.840> national<00:00:46.739> currency

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
what what a Supra national currency

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130 
what what a Supra national currency
really<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.239> like<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.570> does<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> mean<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
really look like what does that mean is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
really look like what does that mean is
it<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.070> compare<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> let's<00:00:50.969> say

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it something we can compare to let's say

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520 
it something we can compare to let's say
the<00:00:51.239> euro<00:00:53.750> well<00:00:54.750> no<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> could<00:00:55.199> compare

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the euro well no way you could compare

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
the euro well no way you could compare
it<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.800> 11<00:00:56.280> let<00:00:56.370> me<00:00:56.430> first<00:00:56.640> say<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.149> don't

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it with 11 let me first say if we don't

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
it with 11 let me first say if we don't
say<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> dollar<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.250> caused

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
say it's just the dollar that caused

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180 
say it's just the dollar that caused
this<00:00:59.789> crisis<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.780> part<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> off

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
this crisis but it was part of the off

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.750 
this crisis but it was part of the off
of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.879> causes<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> led<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.110> crisis

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
of the causes that led to this crisis

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.580 
of the causes that led to this crisis
but<00:01:05.760> coming<00:01:06.090> back<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.540> question<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:07.260> we

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
but coming back to your question what we

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
but coming back to your question what we
think<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.729> creation<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
think of this actually the creation of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.070 
think of this actually the creation of
the<00:01:10.020> true<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> national<00:01:10.950> liquidity<00:01:12.080> which

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the true the national liquidity which

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.340 
the true the national liquidity which
could<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.710> initially<00:01:14.210> composed<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.780> basket

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
could be initially composed of a basket

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
could be initially composed of a basket
of<00:01:16.560> existing<00:01:17.430> currency<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.240> actually

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of existing currency so it actually

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
of existing currency so it actually
could<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> combination<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> euro<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
could be a combination of the euro the

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.499 
could be a combination of the euro the
dollar<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.630> yen<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.210> several<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
dollar the yen and several of the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.370 
dollar the yen and several of the
developing<00:01:25.049> country<00:01:25.380> currencies<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
developing country currencies and so the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
developing country currencies and so the
way<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:28.799> work<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.880> countries

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
way it could work is that if countries

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.399 
way it could work is that if countries
that<00:01:31.729> accumulate<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:33.030> lot<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.409> reserves

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that accumulate a lot of reserves

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.960 
that accumulate a lot of reserves
international<00:01:35.340> reserves<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.700> foreign

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
international reserves of foreign

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.200 
international reserves of foreign
currencies<00:01:36.390> which<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.659> now<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.110> dollars

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
currencies which we now do with dollars

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.240 
currencies which we now do with dollars
would<00:01:39.210> pull<00:01:39.479> those<00:01:39.689> together<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
would pull those together and that

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
would pull those together and that
against<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.420> pool<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.750> reserves<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.229> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
against that pool of reserves you can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980 
against that pool of reserves you can
create<00:01:43.799> new<00:01:43.880> liquidity<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.420> more

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
create new liquidity and more

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.130 
create new liquidity and more
effectively<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:48.180> new

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
effectively put that to use for new

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
effectively put that to use for new
investments<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.579> development

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
hasn't the dollar proven to be stronger

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709 
hasn't the dollar proven to be stronger
than<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.369> euro<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> long<00:02:00.149> run<00:02:00.180> from<00:02:00.570> what

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
than the euro in the long run from what

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.190 
than the euro in the long run from what
we've<00:02:00.869> seen<00:02:00.899> over<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> past<00:02:01.560> year<00:02:02.960> yeah<00:02:03.960> well

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
we've seen over the past year yeah well

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
we've seen over the past year yeah well
actually<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.590> we're<00:02:04.740> saying<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
actually what we're saying is that a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.809 
actually what we're saying is that a
reserve<00:02:06.270> system<00:02:07.020> that's<00:02:07.560> exclusively<00:02:08.520> based

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
reserve system that's exclusively based

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.839 
reserve system that's exclusively based
on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.080> national<00:02:10.500> currency<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.610> country

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
on the national currency of one country

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.770 
on the national currency of one country
or<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> currency<00:02:12.989> of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
or the currency of

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.770 
or the currency of
even<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.530> small<00:02:14.860> group<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.730> countries<00:02:16.030> like

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
even of a small group of countries like

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.830 
even of a small group of countries like
like<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.319> euro<00:02:17.620> is<00:02:18.090> unstable<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.330> reason<00:02:19.630> for

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
like the euro is unstable the reason for

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840 
like the euro is unstable the reason for
that<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.020> that<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.770> if<00:02:21.010> other<00:02:21.160> countries<00:02:21.250> want

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
that is that for if other countries want

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.660 
that is that for if other countries want
to<00:02:22.180> accumulate<00:02:22.450> reserves<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:24.310> order<00:02:24.550> to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
to accumulate reserves in order to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.440 
to accumulate reserves in order to
create<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:24.970> buffer<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:26.440> bad<00:02:26.620> times

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
create a buffer in for bad times

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.690 
create a buffer in for bad times
external<00:02:28.450> shocks<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.200> on<00:02:29.260> like<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.489> lot<00:02:30.670> of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
external shocks and so on like a lot of

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.460 
external shocks and so on like a lot of
the<00:02:30.790> Asian<00:02:30.970> countries<00:02:31.450> started<00:02:31.870> doing<00:02:32.319> but

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
the Asian countries started doing but

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.199 
the Asian countries started doing but
also<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.739> lot<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:32.890> other<00:02:33.100> countries<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
also a lot of other countries in the

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.270 
also a lot of other countries in the
Middle<00:02:34.450> East<00:02:34.569> and<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:34.989> Latin<00:02:35.500> American<00:02:35.830> even

Middle East and in Latin American even

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.699 
Middle East and in Latin American even
in<00:02:36.400> Africa<00:02:36.520> started<00:02:37.270> doing<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.470> create

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
in Africa started doing that you create

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.640 
in Africa started doing that you create
these<00:02:38.800> buffers<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.480> only<00:02:40.630> way<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> accumulate

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
these buffers the only way to accumulate

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.580 
these buffers the only way to accumulate
those<00:02:41.980> resources<00:02:42.430> for<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.690> country<00:02:44.200> reserve

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
those resources for the country reserve

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.199 
those resources for the country reserve
currency<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.370> case<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> United<00:02:46.060> States

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
currency in this case the United States

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.660 
currency in this case the United States
to<00:02:46.450> run<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.630> deficit<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.950> as<00:02:48.100> you<00:02:48.190> now<00:02:48.310> nobody

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
to run a deficit and as you now nobody

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.030 
to run a deficit and as you now nobody
can<00:02:48.730> run<00:02:49.120> deficits<00:02:49.660> forever<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.650> that's<00:02:50.739> been

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
can run deficits forever and that's been

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.060 
can run deficits forever and that's been
part<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.550> build-up<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.269> huge<00:02:53.070> imbalances

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
part of the build-up of huge imbalances

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.090 
part of the build-up of huge imbalances
in<00:02:54.130> indy<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.390> global<00:02:55.690> economy<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:56.920> think

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
in indy in the global economy so I think

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.920 
in indy in the global economy so I think
it's<00:02:57.340> much<00:02:57.489> better<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.209> can<00:02:58.420> avoid<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.690> lot

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it's much better and you can avoid a lot

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.320 
it's much better and you can avoid a lot
of<00:02:58.989> exchange<00:02:59.500> rate<00:02:59.800> instability<00:03:00.580> if

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
of exchange rate instability if

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.970 
of exchange rate instability if
countries<00:03:01.780> pull<00:03:02.019> those<00:03:02.230> reserves<00:03:02.530> together

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
countries pull those reserves together

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.059 
countries pull those reserves together
and<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:04.800> dependence<00:03:05.800> on<00:03:05.890> one

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
and you don't have dependence on one

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.580 
and you don't have dependence on one
single<00:03:06.310> currency<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.090> rather<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:08.350> there's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
single currency but rather that there's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.860 
single currency but rather that there's
an<00:03:08.769> international<00:03:09.459> kind<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.180> currency<00:03:10.450> that

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
an international kind of currency that

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.320 
an international kind of currency that
that<00:03:11.530> could<00:03:11.739> avoid<00:03:11.980> such<00:03:12.250> problems<00:03:12.700> now

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
that could avoid such problems now

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.190 
that could avoid such problems now
something<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.840> found<00:03:14.050> interesting

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
something that I found interesting

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.620 
something that I found interesting
however<00:03:14.769> in<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> report<00:03:15.580> is<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> base<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.510> know

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
however in the report is a base you know

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.819 
however in the report is a base you know
aside<00:03:16.959> from<00:03:17.019> stating<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> dollar

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
aside from stating that the dollar

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.490 
aside from stating that the dollar
obviously<00:03:18.340> remains<00:03:18.640> incredibly<00:03:19.360> popular<00:03:19.959> as

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
obviously remains incredibly popular as

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.880 
obviously remains incredibly popular as
a<00:03:20.560> reserve<00:03:20.920> asset<00:03:21.459> they<00:03:21.970> also<00:03:22.180> said<00:03:22.690> that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
a reserve asset they also said that

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.440 
a reserve asset they also said that
certain<00:03:23.890> developing<00:03:24.430> countries<00:03:24.880> would<00:03:25.120> need

certain developing countries would need

certain developing countries would need

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
to have accumulate more of these

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.979 
to have accumulate more of these
reserves<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.299> order<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.600> keep<00:03:28.720> going<00:03:30.750> well<00:03:31.750> but

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
reserves in order to keep going well but

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.160 
reserves in order to keep going well but
what<00:03:32.500> what<00:03:32.739> countries<00:03:33.160> do<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.910> ending<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.019> the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
what what countries do is ending and the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.870 
what what countries do is ending and the
present<00:03:35.799> crisis<00:03:36.070> has<00:03:36.160> shown<00:03:36.400> there's<00:03:36.670> mean

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
present crisis has shown there's mean

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.780 
present crisis has shown there's mean
enormous<00:03:37.829> negative<00:03:38.829> shocks<00:03:39.070> due<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.670> these

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
enormous negative shocks due to these

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.490 
enormous negative shocks due to these
economies<00:03:40.060> because<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.930> crisis<00:03:41.440> that

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
economies because of the crisis that

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.190 
economies because of the crisis that
started<00:03:41.739> here<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:43.690> led<00:03:44.170> to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
started here and then it led to

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.830 
started here and then it led to
financial<00:03:44.799> problems<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.519> next<00:03:46.030> to<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.450> trade

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
financial problems and next to the trade

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.250 
financial problems and next to the trade
decline<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.560> they<00:03:47.709> had<00:03:48.250> much<00:03:48.430> less<00:03:48.670> income<00:03:49.450> so

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
decline so they had much less income so

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.900 
decline so they had much less income so
when<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.530> have<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.829> lot<00:03:51.010> of<00:03:51.040> reserves<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.579> can

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
when you have a lot of reserves you can

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.240 
when you have a lot of reserves you can
safeguards<00:03:52.660> against<00:03:52.959> those<00:03:53.260> shocks<00:03:53.920> without

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
safeguards against those shocks without

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
tell me this let's say that the world

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
much must come to collapse and we've

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.620 
much must come to collapse and we've
seen<00:05:53.560> in<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:53.979> early<00:05:54.190> seventies<00:05:54.639> that<00:05:55.479> to

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
seen in the early seventies that to

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.710 
seen in the early seventies that to
happen<00:05:55.979> now<00:05:56.979> how<00:05:57.639> well<00:05:57.880> it<00:05:58.000> will<00:05:58.150> work<00:05:58.210> for<00:05:58.630> the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
happen now how well it will work for the

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.420 
happen now how well it will work for the
future<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.410> course<00:05:59.650> the<00:05:59.919> ideas<00:06:00.220> have<00:06:00.400> been

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
future of course the ideas have been

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.400 
future of course the ideas have been
launched<00:06:01.060> in<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.300> past<00:06:01.510> even<00:06:01.720> with<00:06:02.050> the

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
launched in the past even with the

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.100 
launched in the past even with the
creation<00:06:02.740> of<00:06:03.039> the<00:06:03.570> monetary<00:06:04.570> system<00:06:04.630> after

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
creation of the monetary system after

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.719 
creation of the monetary system after
the<00:06:05.380> Second<00:06:05.680> World<00:06:05.710> War<00:06:05.919> this<00:06:06.280> idea<00:06:06.550> was

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
the Second World War this idea was

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.050 
the Second World War this idea was
forwarded<00:06:07.630> that<00:06:07.810> didn't<00:06:08.320> make<00:06:08.650> it<00:06:08.940> into<00:06:09.940> the

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
forwarded that didn't make it into the

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.450 
forwarded that didn't make it into the
final<00:06:10.479> system<00:06:10.840> but<00:06:11.110> i<00:06:11.320> think<00:06:11.620> these<00:06:12.039> ideas

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
final system but i think these ideas

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.379 
final system but i think these ideas
have<00:06:12.880> been<00:06:13.449> there<00:06:13.840> and<00:06:14.530> I<00:06:14.620> think<00:06:14.940> the<00:06:15.940> crisis

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
have been there and I think the crisis

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:17.850 
have been there and I think the crisis
should<00:06:16.570> teach<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.169> world<00:06:17.349> that<00:06:17.590> we're<00:06:17.770> now

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
should teach the world that we're now

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.290 
should teach the world that we're now
ready<00:06:18.070> for<00:06:18.419> transition<00:06:19.419> to<00:06:19.780> a<00:06:20.169> system<00:06:20.650> that<00:06:21.300> we

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
ready for transition to a system that we

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.600 
ready for transition to a system that we
think<00:06:22.570> will<00:06:23.020> be<00:06:23.169> much<00:06:23.349> more<00:06:23.560> stable<00:06:24.010> and<00:06:24.039> more

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
think will be much more stable and more
