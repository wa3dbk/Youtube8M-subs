00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.060
 good morning to all then I'm back on 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.619
 youtube screen 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.990
 we have been saying for a long time and not registering me 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.570
 I find it difficult to talk to the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.310
 camcorder starts by telling you that this 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.490
 is a trick suitable for those who are starting out 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.880
 school and those from work and a lot of makeup 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.860
 intense between the lashes indeed applied 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.620
 see then in the video tutorial in pencil 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.780
 pylons with gradient etc. and so on e 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.840
 at the same time a very fast make-up 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.870
 to be realized believe me really the 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.640
 morning when I have little time for 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 putting on makeup is a trick I always do 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.269
 even in the evening when a little time 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.730
 I do this thing here I used 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.410
 his products a bit special 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.929
 long-lasting products because anyway 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.100
 if you have to stay out for a while 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.220
 hours 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.350
 use waterproof products a 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.200
 fantastic product is this here that the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.320
 its astra color that costs very little 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.650
 in the fantastic I 've already talked about it in 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.520
 video of last year on the return of the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.520
 school really somewhere is a 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.870
 multifunction eyeshadow is fantastic ie 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.940
 I feel great 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.430
 another thing I did is the application 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.340
 of a long-lasting lipstick 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.770
 ok in this case i think a lipstick 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.570
 the hottest tones plus meat were there 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.540
 much better than this here that goes more 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.810
 on the rosano, however, to the name other was 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.030
 the only lipstick of this type that 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.830
 I had it here so I wanted to show you a 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.980
 alternative of a trick anyway 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 long lasting waterproof 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.540
 because this type are those 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 colors that last so long does not make them max 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:05.090
 factor is bad for make up for ever 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.270
 they make many many cosmetic houses too 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.239
 the llorea if I 'm not mistaken it does when you 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.000
 consumes just apply see you it is 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.459
 slightly in the middle and away because 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.190
 part where it is consumed first is the part 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.560
 central so you have quite a bit of time 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.760
 before anyway the consumption is 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.960
 lipstick and is suitable for those unfortunately like 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.460
 to the symmetrical lip that is me to this 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.690
 this lower part of 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.330
 this other is now with time we say 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.420
 when less time is not just myth 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.510
 very precise but also only with a 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.280
 lipstick and the brush I can a 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.470
 redesign the lip thing maybe 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.690
 more difficult for beginners 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.880
 no and so I recommend you 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.250
 first use the pencil and make for 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.130
 well the outline thing which of course 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.050
 crazy about others because it is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.260
 objectively more difficult to redesign 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.690
 I didn't do the lips with the brush 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.080
 the basis is because I am tanned because 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.480
 does not apply to feeling the face of a product 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.940
 which I think is great for this period 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.420
 to make the base are the foundation in 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.610
 mineral powder then these of mimÃ¬ 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.580
 cosmetics are fantastic ie I have 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.730
 this here is the medium that it is 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.580
 very clear compared to my tone 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.530
 of current skin but in June when 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.570
 still mantova bad it was fantastic that is 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.850
 we ask with my peak plus bathroom 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.640
 foundation brushes that mine 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.260
 preferred that is to sigma io ve 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.880
 more talked about my brushes if 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.130
 you are curious and go to see those 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.380
 video also because I saw that those 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.470
 video it took me a lifetime to make them 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.230
 I viewed very little I thought 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.660
 were a were that much video 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.500
 requested, however, perhaps not all of me 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.209
 then followed this however 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.800
 brush is my foundation brush 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.950
 and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.380
 the bathroom with the fix plus with some 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.690
 of water also and I take the foundation 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.209
 halfon of the mineral and is 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.070
 fantastic both a medium-high coverage 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.260
 that 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.980
 with these types of foundation they are 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.150
 those lengthen opacity as an alternative 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.030
 face powder 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.930
 the only thing I don't abandon for the 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.330
 T area is enough and all girls I hope 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.800
 that you like the video to help you 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.860
 I send you a kiss from see you at 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.860
 next one 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.449
 I apply a cream eye shadow with lo 

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:51.239
 waterproof champagne and this way 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.409
 I'm going to light up the look 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:55.409
 especially when I'm more tired 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.940
 I go with an opaque warm brown eye shadow 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.310
 give depth to the eyes 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.650
 I use a gradient brush and apply 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.080
 the color in the fold blending towards 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.680
 the outside towards the inside and a little towards 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.680
 up 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:27.380
 with a brown copper pencil border law 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.380
 that is above and below 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.709
 and with an angled brush it fades a little 

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:45.009
 the color runner pencil towards 

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.009
 the outside 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.529
 fixed the pencil with a little eye shadow 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:59.679
 brown to ensure a lifetime 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:59.679
 greater 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:08.160
 and now I abound with mascara and 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.960
 later I also apply a bit of 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.960
 mascara with the fibrils 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.750
 as I said at the beginning nothing 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.750
 foundation but only a little powder 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:48.610
 I apply the bronze to warm up a little 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.610
 face 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.650
 I apply the dye to the lips if there is 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.580
 feel safer and be the first 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.580
 contour with pencil 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.860
 and a veil of gloss 

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.160
 and finally they redefine the eyebrows 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.160
 without, however, hearing them
