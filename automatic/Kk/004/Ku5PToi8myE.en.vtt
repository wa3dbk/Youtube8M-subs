00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.869
 very good friends who love 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.880
 technology as they are I am techno 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.489
 splash and in this video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.190
 how to pass music from itunes to iphone 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:34.520
 ipod touch or ipad 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.820
 because good because there are many people who 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.060
 you buy iphone and do not know how to use it or not 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.790
 he knows how to pass music to him then 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.739
 those people for this video or also 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.750
 some people that you forget for 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.400
 example to me I accept with the glass I said 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.700
 go to eat something was very good 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.360
 then he started looking for tutorials 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.550
 well logically we should have the 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:03.410
 connected iphone will recognize it 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.700
 iTunes and once we are in habits 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.920
 we will be in this tab 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 after that we're going to go to here in the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 canon tab of that iphone 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.030
 good when we squeeze in there where 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.300
 I said iphone we are going to appear here but 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.850
 we are going to music 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.110
 the oldest 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.479
 on this iphone and here we give you 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.479
 We on the tab below 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.830
 and we give new playlist 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.480
 then once here here we are going to put 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.480
 the name I will put 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.000
 as follows if it seems that yes 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.360
 then we will accept it and once 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.120
 here these are going to be all this what 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.760
 is here is a type of link what 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.210
 we can do is pass music from some 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.600
 or directly from a folder yo 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:26.080
 I have music here 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:29.340
 I want to go one by one 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.530
 taking it from one or are they simply 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.940
 carrying the complete folder to 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.410
 to set an example for them I want to take the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.780
 full folder 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.240
 let's go to itunes and how can they be fixed 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.670
 says link 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.990
 then we do not let go and there they go 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.990
 to go air love 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.260
 with the ski ball 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 well already once we have it here 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.620
 already that means that we already passed it to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.050
 iTunes 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.660
 now to pass it to the iphone 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.930
 where music says here 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.150
 you give in synchronizing music and 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.610
 there are the 53 songs 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.610
 and we simply give in applying 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.090
 will be synchronizing with music 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.090
 what have we passed 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.820
 if you look at the iphone from offering 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.160
 next to the battery sign the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.470
 little circle that is 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.720
 and synchronize them if you show them this is 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.730
 because some purchases 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.400
 they have not been included but well that's not 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.830
 matter here for example we can see 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.830
 that does not matter to me 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.450
 and how good to see above is copying 5 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.450
 of 47 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.050
 and so it's going to happen and happening until 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.060
 that the 53 songs are fulfilled 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.150
 Once this is done, you are going to 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.989
 come here to accept they are going to press here 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.849
 ivana good logically to me does not leave me 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.699
 eject the iphone because they are full 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.850
 in synchronization but you are going 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.220
 to appear that if they want to expel him 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.020
 the iphone if they want to get it out of the way 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.879
 sure keep 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.699
 I 'm going to cancel it logically because 

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:31.979
 I am passing music and you good 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.310
 then disconnect it can disconnect 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.050
 on the cell phone and they're going to have music on 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.300
 the cell phone 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.310
 is to do everything if you liked the video by 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.780

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.710
 that they did not like to follow 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.300
