I<00:01:46.280> need<00:01:46.490> to<00:01:46.610> be<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:46.939> understand<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.020> every

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
I need to be in understand that every

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.139 
I need to be in understand that every
human<00:01:48.259> being<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.979> wired<00:01:49.250> differently<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
human being is wired differently so the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.700 
human being is wired differently so the
way<00:01:50.299> that<00:01:50.329> I<00:01:50.600> think<00:01:50.930> is<00:01:51.110> different<00:01:51.500> from<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
way that I think is different from the

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
the way LeBron thinks what works to get

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.380 
the way LeBron thinks what works to get
me<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.740> my<00:01:57.799> right<00:01:58.159> mindset<00:01:58.579> might<00:01:58.939> not<00:01:59.119> be<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
me and my right mindset might not be the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.389 
me and my right mindset might not be the
same<00:01:59.600> thing<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.960> works<00:02:00.200> for<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.219> what
