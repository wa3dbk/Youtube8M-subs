00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
there's some aftermarket controllers

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.259 
there's some aftermarket controllers
that<00:02:55.800> you<00:02:55.920> could<00:02:56.099> get<00:02:56.310> now<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> were

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
that you could get now if you were

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.509 
that you could get now if you were
really<00:02:57.599> hardcore<00:02:57.900> you'd<00:02:58.260> find<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.560> way<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.739> put

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
really hardcore you'd find a way to put

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.600 
really hardcore you'd find a way to put
your<00:02:59.670> xbox<00:03:00.120> 360<00:03:00.900> game<00:03:01.200> console<00:03:01.830> into<00:03:02.430> an

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
your xbox 360 game console into an

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.210 
your xbox 360 game console into an
arcade<00:03:03.000> style<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.750> stand-up<00:03:04.440> arcade<00:03:04.950> style

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
arcade style a stand-up arcade style

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.850 
arcade style a stand-up arcade style
machine<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.410> then<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.530> could<00:03:07.680> actually

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
machine and then you could actually

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.610 
machine and then you could actually
maybe<00:03:08.640> find<00:03:08.970> some<00:03:09.269> way<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.870> real<00:03:10.140> arcade

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
maybe find some way to get a real arcade

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.110 
maybe find some way to get a real arcade
style<00:03:10.890> joystick<00:03:11.549> because<00:03:11.790> there's<00:03:11.970> just

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
style joystick because there's just

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.910 
style joystick because there's just
nothing<00:03:12.420> like<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.690> arcade<00:03:13.049> style<00:03:13.290> joysticks

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
nothing like the arcade style joysticks

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.460 
nothing like the arcade style joysticks
at<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.220> real<00:03:14.459> arcade<00:03:14.910> joysticks<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> those

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
at the real arcade joysticks and those

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.080 
at the real arcade joysticks and those
big<00:03:16.739> buttons<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.400> can<00:03:17.430> hammer<00:03:17.730> away<00:03:17.910> on

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
big buttons that you can hammer away on

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.390 
big buttons that you can hammer away on
and<00:03:18.569> then<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.349> could<00:03:19.500> actually<00:03:19.650> design<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and then you could actually design the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
and then you could actually design the
graphics<00:03:20.940> on<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.150> outside<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.959> case<00:03:22.349> in

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
graphics on the outside of the case in

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.770 
graphics on the outside of the case in
fact<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.640> could<00:03:23.790> even<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.090> creative<00:03:24.569> and

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
fact you could even be creative and

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.530 
fact you could even be creative and
instead<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.170> writing<00:03:25.380> joust<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:26.069> could<00:03:26.250> write

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
instead of writing joust you could write

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.680 
instead of writing joust you could write
bird<00:03:27.540> ass<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.410> that<00:03:29.069> makes<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:30.150> champion

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
bird ass and that makes you the champion

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.739 
bird ass and that makes you the champion
of<00:03:30.870> bird<00:03:31.470> ass
