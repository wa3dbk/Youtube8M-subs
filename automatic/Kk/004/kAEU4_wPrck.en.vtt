00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
is beyond horrible well it is but I can

is beyond horrible well it is but I can
think<00:05:35.120> of<00:05:35.270> one<00:05:35.600> class<00:05:35.960> where<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.500> should<00:05:36.680> at

think of one class where you should at

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
of hand and scavenger Pro then maybe you
