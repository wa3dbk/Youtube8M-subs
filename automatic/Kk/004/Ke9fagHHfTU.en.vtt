00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
didn't talk for a year ago see what you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.120 
didn't talk for a year ago see what you
don't<00:02:26.270> mind<00:02:26.510> switching<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.290> right<00:02:27.590> tackles

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
don't mind switching the right tackles

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.860 
don't mind switching the right tackles
over<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.520> left<00:02:28.730> tackle<00:02:29.000> what<00:02:29.450> was<00:02:29.690> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
over to left tackle what was the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.990 
over to left tackle what was the
difference<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.380> skill<00:02:30.740> set<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.220> those

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
difference of the skill set that those

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.330 
difference of the skill set that those
two<00:02:32.240> positions<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.870> there<00:02:33.080> well<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:33.980> think<00:02:34.130> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
two positions in there well I think it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.150 
two positions in there well I think it
depends<00:02:34.640> on<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.820> guys<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.420> have<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.160> how

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
depends on the guys and have and how

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.600 
depends on the guys and have and how
they<00:02:37.310> play<00:02:37.490> some<00:02:37.730> guys<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.210> do<00:02:38.390> both<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:40.520> know

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
they play some guys can do both you know

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.460 
they play some guys can do both you know
in<00:02:40.730> general<00:02:41.000> your<00:02:41.390> left<00:02:41.570> tackle<00:02:41.960> is<00:02:41.990> usually

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
in general your left tackle is usually

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.590 
in general your left tackle is usually
going<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.920> be<00:02:43.040> your<00:02:43.310> longer<00:02:43.760> pass<00:02:44.030> protector

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
going to be your longer pass protector

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.260 
going to be your longer pass protector
guy<00:02:44.980> you're<00:02:45.980> right<00:02:46.160> tackle<00:02:46.610> does<00:02:46.760> not<00:02:46.940> have<00:02:47.120> to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
guy you're right tackle does not have to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.850 
guy you're right tackle does not have to
be<00:02:47.300> as<00:02:47.810> quick<00:02:48.520> can<00:02:49.520> be<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:49.850> run-oriented<00:02:50.860> but

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
be as quick can be more run-oriented but

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.410 
be as quick can be more run-oriented but
also<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.280> that's<00:02:52.430> probably<00:02:52.730> exaggerated<00:02:53.360> a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
also that that's probably exaggerated a

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.410 
also that that's probably exaggerated a
little<00:02:53.450> bit<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.380> know<00:02:54.410> our<00:02:55.190> Tyra<00:02:55.910> was<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.150> great

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
little bit you know our Tyra was a great

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.050 
little bit you know our Tyra was a great
player<00:02:56.630> here<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:56.900> played<00:02:57.050> right<00:02:58.060> probably

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
player here and played right probably

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.190 
player here and played right probably
everywhere<00:02:59.360> else<00:02:59.540> would<00:02:59.660> have<00:02:59.750> played<00:02:59.959> left

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
everywhere else would have played left

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.370 
everywhere else would have played left
but<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:01.100> was<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> great<00:03:01.459> player<00:03:01.730> left<00:03:02.000> to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
but there was a great player left to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.380 
but there was a great player left to
Morgan<00:03:03.380> Breslin<00:03:03.820> seems<00:03:04.820> like<00:03:04.970> he's<00:03:05.120> really

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
Morgan Breslin seems like he's really

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.030 
Morgan Breslin seems like he's really
making<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.750> move<00:03:05.959> would<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.530> accurate

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
making a move would that be accurate

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.070 
making a move would that be accurate
