of the blaster bleep I'm flip up this is
really<00:05:36.070> good<00:05:37.980> so<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.220> blast<00:05:39.430> update<00:05:39.760> on

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
really good so the blast update on

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.450 
really good so the blast update on
flipper<00:05:40.480> is<00:05:40.690> whenever<00:05:41.230> blasted<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.130> appears

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
flipper is whenever blasted it appears

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.250 
flipper is whenever blasted it appears
on<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:42.790> got<00:05:43.000> circle<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.510> may<00:05:43.750> unfit<00:05:44.110> one

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
on we got circle you may unfit one

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.450 
on we got circle you may unfit one
damage<00:05:44.590> so<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.460> means<00:05:46.500> you<00:05:47.500> can<00:05:48.070> have<00:05:48.280> three

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
damage so that means you can have three

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.850 
damage so that means you can have three
of<00:05:48.640> this<00:05:48.820> one<00:05:49.450> possibly<00:05:49.900> up<00:05:50.110> here<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.590> you<00:05:50.740> can

flip tree damage or you can have one of

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.920 
flip tree damage or you can have one of
these<00:05:54.280> you<00:05:54.340> have<00:05:54.760> creep<00:05:55.300> last<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.630> bit<00:05:55.660> up<00:05:55.900> here

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
these you have creep last a bit up here

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.380 
these you have creep last a bit up here

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
Bruno's Bruno in fact is whenever a unit

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.890 
Bruno's Bruno in fact is whenever a unit
is<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:17.860> pre<00:06:18.010> record<00:06:18.250> from<00:06:18.370> the<00:06:18.430> deck<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:19.240> gain

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
is the pre record from the deck you gain

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.110 
is the pre record from the deck you gain
3,000<00:06:20.530> this<00:06:20.710> unit<00:06:20.920> gain<00:06:21.070> 3,000<00:06:21.550> power<00:06:21.730> so<00:06:22.090> you

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
3,000 this unit gain 3,000 power so you

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.510 
3,000 this unit gain 3,000 power so you
