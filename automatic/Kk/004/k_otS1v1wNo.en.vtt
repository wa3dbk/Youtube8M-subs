do<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.320> think<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.590> will<00:02:43.620> release<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.330> hope<00:02:45.330> so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
do you think they will release I hope so

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.900 
do you think they will release I hope so
not<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:45.989> blocks<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:47.010> smaller<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.459> it's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
not that this blocks are smaller I it's

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.270 
not that this blocks are smaller I it's
gonna<00:02:48.270> be<00:02:48.450> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> hard<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.080> judge<00:02:49.920> whether

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
gonna be kind of hard to judge whether

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740 
gonna be kind of hard to judge whether
they<00:02:50.520> actually<00:02:50.640> decide<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.570> or<00:02:51.690> not

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
they actually decide to do it or not

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.800 
they actually decide to do it or not
hopefully<00:02:52.200> they<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.880> yeah<00:02:54.420> that's<00:02:54.660> pretty

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
hopefully they do and yeah that's pretty

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.140 
hopefully they do and yeah that's pretty
much<00:02:55.110> all<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.560> say<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.550> those<00:02:56.730> other<00:02:56.910> lens

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150

some people like to use and some people
don't<00:06:04.060> it's<00:06:04.930> not<00:06:05.230> as<00:06:05.440> good<00:06:05.590> as<00:06:05.710> massive<00:06:06.010> earth

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
don't it's not as good as massive earth

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.430 
don't it's not as good as massive earth
because<00:06:06.820> it<00:06:07.030> only<00:06:07.180> reduces<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.870> target

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
because it only reduces the target

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.240 
because it only reduces the target

of just any just removing any creature
from<00:06:14.950> combat<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:16.240> this<00:06:16.630> is<00:06:16.660> slightly

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
from combat so this is slightly

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.840 
from combat so this is slightly
different<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.950> course<00:06:17.980> it's<00:06:18.430> good<00:06:18.610> if<00:06:18.730> your

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
different of course it's good if your

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.520 
different of course it's good if your
opponent<00:06:19.060> swinging<00:06:19.660> at<00:06:19.750> you<00:06:19.930> with<00:06:20.110> a<00:06:20.140> really

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
opponent swinging at you with a really

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.470 
opponent swinging at you with a really
big<00:06:20.830> creature<00:06:21.160> such<00:06:21.520> as<00:06:21.550> a<00:06:21.730> Croma<00:06:22.270> or

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
big creature such as a Croma or

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.060 
big creature such as a Croma or
something<00:06:22.750> like<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:22.930> use<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.590> island<00:06:23.980> and

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
something like that use the island and

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.410 
something like that use the island and
whack<00:06:24.220> whack<00:06:24.430> radiation<00:06:24.880> 20<00:06:25.180> and<00:06:25.270> then<00:06:25.360> you

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
whack whack radiation 20 and then you

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.270 
whack whack radiation 20 and then you
can<00:06:25.570> still<00:06:25.780> block<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:26.170> kill<00:06:26.410> the<00:06:27.130> other

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
can still block to kill the other

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.670 
can still block to kill the other
creature<00:06:27.610> but<00:06:28.120> in<00:06:28.330> general<00:06:28.720> this<00:06:29.110> is<00:06:29.350> probably

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
creature but in general this is probably

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.430 
creature but in general this is probably
