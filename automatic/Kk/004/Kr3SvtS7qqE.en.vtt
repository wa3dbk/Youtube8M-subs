00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
like the last four or five episodes of

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.360 
like the last four or five episodes of
this<00:03:54.239> crest<00:03:54.540> post<00:03:54.750> creation<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.350> played<00:03:55.890> all<00:03:56.190> in

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370

this crest post creation I played all in
one<00:03:56.580> afternoon<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.739> me<00:03:58.950> plain

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
one afternoon and so this is me plain

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.580 
one afternoon and so this is me plain
and<00:03:59.310> probably<00:03:59.730> like<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> 10<00:04:00.390> or<00:04:00.570> 12th<00:04:01.080> game<00:04:01.320> or

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
and probably like the 10 or 12th game or

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.680 
and probably like the 10 or 12th game or
something<00:04:01.950> like<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.850> was<00:04:03.060> stressed

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
something like that and I was stressed

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.050 
something like that and I was stressed
because<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.709> hadn't<00:04:05.040> been<00:04:05.100> going<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.730> best

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
because it hadn't been going the best

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.979 
because it hadn't been going the best
recently<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.140> um<00:04:07.580> going<00:04:08.580> into<00:04:08.790> halftime<00:04:08.940> at<00:04:09.480> 21
