the holes with a tip number three and
again<00:01:57.890> we<00:01:58.190> use<00:01:58.310> water<00:01:59.590> go<00:02:00.590> along<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.069> edges

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.870 
again we use water go along the edges
here

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.390 

and<00:02:08.090> we're<00:02:08.810> going<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.500> attach<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.850> on<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:11.060> back

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
and we're going to attach it on the back

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.190 
and we're going to attach it on the back

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.470 

and<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.280> kind<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.640> make<00:02:18.910> sure<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
and just kind of make sure it's

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.030 
and just kind of make sure it's
connected<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> soul<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.599> sides

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
connected to the soul and to the sides

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.610 
connected to the soul and to the sides
okay

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
okay

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.870 
okay
okay<00:02:26.620> now<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.700> is<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:29.080> front<00:02:30.010> toe<00:02:30.310> strip<00:02:30.670> and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
okay now this is the front toe strip and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.850 
okay now this is the front toe strip and
I<00:02:31.390> did<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.569> little<00:02:31.690> stitching<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:32.349> as<00:02:32.440> well

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
I did a little stitching there as well

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.850 
I did a little stitching there as well
and<00:02:34.050> we're<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> take<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> little<00:02:35.650> bit<00:02:35.800> of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
and we're going to take a little bit of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.300 
and we're going to take a little bit of
water<00:02:36.840> or<00:02:37.840> go<00:02:38.080> whatever<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.100> prefer

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.910 

and<00:02:43.940> I<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.270> that's<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.630> little<00:02:44.870> too<00:02:45.050> big<00:02:45.620> so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
and I think that's a little too big so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.730 
and I think that's a little too big so
I'm<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.220> going<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:47.500> think<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.650> little

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
I'm just going to think it's a little

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.890 
I'm just going to think it's a little
too<00:02:48.890> wide<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.610> just<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.000> run<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.840> a
