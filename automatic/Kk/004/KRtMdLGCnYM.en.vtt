00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.590 
convulses from the electric shock in the
pain<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.310> I<00:04:40.340> guess<00:04:40.610> he's<00:04:40.730> testing<00:04:41.210> this<00:04:41.300> on<00:04:41.480> his

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
pain so I guess he's testing this on his

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.480 
pain so I guess he's testing this on his
face<00:04:41.780> first<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.470> is<00:04:42.740> going<00:04:42.950> to<00:04:43.040> make<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.280> full
