00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.070 
don't know if this is pressed on this
gear<00:01:07.350> or<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.890> what

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
so I bought a new pump was 17 hundred

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.190 
so I bought a new pump was 17 hundred
bucks<00:01:14.130> Canadian<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:17.869> replace<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:20.280> banjo

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
from the previous pump run to this one

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.899 
from the previous pump run to this one
so<00:01:25.590> we'll<00:01:26.040> try<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> new<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.880> on

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.080 
to use a ranch and could only get it you
know<00:01:47.430> turning<00:01:47.939> very<00:01:48.689> very<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.290> very<00:01:49.560> little

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
know turning very very very very little

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.889 
know turning very very very very little
it<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.390> 13<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:52.159> 13<00:01:53.159> mil<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.880> basically<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
it was at 13 on 13 mil so basically just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.380 
it was at 13 on 13 mil so basically just
was<00:01:55.049> able<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.180> going<00:01:57.180> about

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
was able to get it you know going about

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.069 
was able to get it you know going about
this<00:01:58.320> much<00:01:59.219> so<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> took<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> while<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
this much so it took a while to get that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.530 
this much so it took a while to get that
off<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.009> went<00:02:02.250> even<00:02:02.369> bought<00:02:02.610> some<00:02:02.820> tools<00:02:03.270> as

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
off so I went even bought some tools as

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
off so I went even bought some tools as
well<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.110> tools<00:02:04.350> you're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.649> need<00:02:04.850> to

well the tools you're going to need to
replace<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.780> pump<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.750> I've

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
replace this pump as you can see I've

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.660 
replace this pump as you can see I've
got<00:02:09.989> tons<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.410> tools<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.920> garage<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.489> but

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
got tons of tools in the garage here but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.370 
got tons of tools in the garage here but
I<00:02:11.849> didn't<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.239> these<00:02:12.330> tools

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
I didn't have these tools

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.410 
I didn't have these tools
so<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.470> had<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.800> out<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.070> buy<00:02:14.420> inverted

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
so I had to go out and buy inverted

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.050 
so I had to go out and buy inverted
torques<00:02:15.870> set<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:19.520> basically<00:02:20.520> your<00:02:20.730> torques

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
torques set so basically your torques

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.190 
torques set so basically your torques
and<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.240> what<00:02:24.540> they<00:02:24.660> call<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.840> safety

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and this is what they call a safety

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.670 
and this is what they call a safety
torques<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.520> basically<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.120> got<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.680> hole

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
torques so basically it's got the hole

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.830 
torques so basically it's got the hole
in<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> middle<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.340> torques<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:30.630> that's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
in the middle of the torques so that's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.090 
in the middle of the torques so that's
set<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.500> had<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.160> buy<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:33.020> bought<00:02:34.020> some<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.980> know

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
else did I buy yes because of that one

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.370 
else did I buy yes because of that one
nut<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.390> back<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.990> very<00:02:52.140> little

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
nut on the back here with very little

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
nut on the back here with very little
room<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.430> get<00:02:53.520> out<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.940> went<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.330> bought<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
room to get out it I went and bought a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.150 
room to get out it I went and bought a
set<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.220> ratchet<00:02:56.220> wrenches<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.590> way<00:02:58.770> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
set of ratchet wrenches so this way you

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.000 
set of ratchet wrenches so this way you
know<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.550> basically<00:02:59.670> lock<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.860> get<00:03:01.860> on

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
know I can basically lock on get on

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.980 
know I can basically lock on get on
there<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.150> turn<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.510> ratchets

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
there and then just turn the ratchets

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.270 
there and then just turn the ratchets
rather<00:03:04.170> than<00:03:04.350> have<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.530> take<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:04.890> off<00:03:05.010> and

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
rather than have to take it off and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.050 
rather than have to take it off and
reconnect<00:03:06.210> them<00:03:06.330> someone<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:06.960> forth<00:03:08.060> so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
reconnect them someone and so forth so

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.680 
reconnect them someone and so forth so
yeah<00:03:10.070> basically<00:03:11.070> one<00:03:11.550> two<00:03:11.730> three<00:03:12.090> four<00:03:12.390> sets

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
yeah basically one two three four sets

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.260 
yeah basically one two three four sets
of<00:03:12.840> new<00:03:12.960> tools<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.940> work<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.150> this

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
of new tools to work on this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.420 
of new tools to work on this
mercedes-benz<00:03:15.720> SL<00:03:16.470> 55<00:03:18.560> pump<00:03:19.560> replacement<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
mercedes-benz SL 55 pump replacement I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.690 
mercedes-benz SL 55 pump replacement I
also<00:03:21.420> removed<00:03:21.960> all<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.740> panels<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
also removed all of the panels so the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.280 
also removed all of the panels so the
panel's<00:03:24.000> off<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.240> bottom<00:03:24.600> are<00:03:24.750> gone<00:03:24.870> as<00:03:25.230> you

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
panel's off the bottom are gone as you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.250 
panel's off the bottom are gone as you
can<00:03:25.440> see<00:03:25.590> through<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:27.180> also<00:03:27.630> took<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.900> panel

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
can see through I also took the panel

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.790 
can see through I also took the panel
off<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:29.750> wheel<00:03:30.750> here<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.290> see<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:31.650> can

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
off with a wheel here to see if I can

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800 
off with a wheel here to see if I can
get<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.070> way

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
get in that way

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.450 
get in that way
and<00:03:33.810> it<00:03:33.990> really<00:03:34.110> didn't<00:03:34.350> help<00:03:34.470> much<00:03:34.740> this<00:03:35.220> one

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
and it really didn't help much this one

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.920 
and it really didn't help much this one
but<00:03:35.760> certainly<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.150> bottom<00:03:36.390> panels<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:36.810> to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
but certainly the bottom panels have to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.910 
but certainly the bottom panels have to
be<00:03:37.020> removed

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.530 

what<00:03:41.580> else<00:03:41.820> could<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.030> see<00:03:43.730> yeah<00:03:44.730> I<00:03:44.760> once<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:45.420> get

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
what else could I see yeah I once I get

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.960 
what else could I see yeah I once I get
the<00:03:45.630> new<00:03:45.720> pump<00:03:45.990> on<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.170> will<00:03:46.440> get<00:03:47.430> some<00:03:47.610> spray<00:03:47.850> in

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the new pump on I will get some spray in

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.690 
the new pump on I will get some spray in
there<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.240> clean<00:03:48.420> off<00:03:48.630> all<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.080> extra<00:03:49.500> oil

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
there and clean off all that extra oil

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.180 
there and clean off all that extra oil
that<00:03:50.700> basically<00:03:51.830> got<00:03:52.830> over<00:03:53.100> everything<00:03:55.190> all

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that basically got over everything all

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.460 
that basically got over everything all
right<00:03:56.370> okay<00:03:56.850> step<00:03:57.090> one<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.480> replace<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.320> will

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
right okay step one to replace it I will

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.800 
right okay step one to replace it I will
get<00:03:58.590> that<00:03:58.740> pump<00:03:58.950> back<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.310> there<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.810> start

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
get that pump back in there and start

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.640 
get that pump back in there and start
with<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.080> back<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.070> back<00:04:02.250> nut<00:04:03.470> which<00:04:04.470> goes

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
with that back the back nut which goes

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.490 
with that back the back nut which goes
right<00:04:04.890> here<00:04:04.950> onto<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:07.020> get<00:04:07.170> some<00:04:07.200> light

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
right here onto this and get some light

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.940 
right here onto this and get some light
in<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.830> for<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:12.530> yeah<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:13.740> it<00:04:13.800> basically

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
in there for you yeah so it basically

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.800 
in there for you yeah so it basically
gets<00:04:14.370> right<00:04:14.610> into<00:04:15.620> on<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.830> this<00:04:16.950> point<00:04:17.370> right

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
gets right into on to this point right

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.640 
gets right into on to this point right
there<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:21.419> we'll<00:04:21.570> slide<00:04:21.720> in<00:04:21.989> there<00:04:22.200> we'll<00:04:22.530> get

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
there so we'll slide in there we'll get

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.890 
there so we'll slide in there we'll get
that<00:04:22.770> screw<00:04:23.100> on<00:04:23.280> her<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.760> sorry<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.180> bolt<00:04:24.750> on

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
that screw on her that sorry the bolt on

that screw on her that sorry the bolt on
the<00:04:25.020> back<00:04:25.370> not<00:04:26.370> on<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.669> back

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
the back not on the back

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.710 
the back not on the back
and<00:04:28.240> then<00:04:28.510> we<00:04:28.630> will<00:04:28.750> work<00:04:28.870> on<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.250> banjo<00:04:30.250> and

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
and then we will work on the banjo and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.150 
and then we will work on the banjo and
you<00:04:31.720> see<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.960> banjo<00:04:32.320> sitting<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:32.950> right

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
you see the banjo sitting there right

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.420 
you see the banjo sitting there right
there<00:04:34.230> that<00:04:35.230> one<00:04:35.380> as<00:04:35.530> well<00:04:35.560> was<00:04:35.890> quite<00:04:36.160> hard<00:04:36.370> to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
there that one as well was quite hard to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.210 
there that one as well was quite hard to
get<00:04:36.580> off<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:37.090> had<00:04:37.420> to<00:04:37.450> actually<00:04:37.630> go<00:04:38.130> from<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
get off I had to actually go from the

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.410 
get off I had to actually go from the
bottom<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:41.020> get<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.290> banjo<00:04:41.470> pump<00:04:41.830> off<00:04:42.420> you

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
bottom to get that banjo pump off you

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.650 
bottom to get that banjo pump off you
can't<00:04:43.780> really<00:04:43.960> see<00:04:44.290> it<00:04:44.320> very<00:04:44.710> good<00:04:45.660> there
