at the upper levels first and you can

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.140 
at the upper levels first and you can
see<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.650> big<00:04:35.800> trough<00:04:36.039> axis<00:04:36.280> off<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.819> the<00:04:36.909> west

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
classic tornadoes set up this is the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.529

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
instability late wednesday night just

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.550

after midnight the early Thursday

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.779 
after midnight the early Thursday
morning<00:05:35.589> there's<00:05:36.009> a<00:05:36.099> little<00:05:36.250> bit<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:36.610> that's

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
morning there's a little bit but that's

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.450 
morning there's a little bit but that's
not<00:05:36.940> really<00:05:37.150> overwhelming<00:05:38.009> but<00:05:39.009> we<00:05:39.129> all<00:05:39.279> know

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
not really overwhelming but we all know

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.159 
not really overwhelming but we all know
it<00:05:39.580> doesn't<00:05:39.849> take<00:05:39.879> a<00:05:40.000> lot<00:05:40.270> of<00:05:40.330> cape<00:05:40.629> for<00:05:40.839> severe

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
it doesn't take a lot of cape for severe

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.950 
it doesn't take a lot of cape for severe
weather<00:05:41.199> here<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:41.800> showing<00:05:42.069> amounts<00:05:42.430> of

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
weather here that's showing amounts of

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.230 
weather here that's showing amounts of
under<00:05:43.960> two<00:05:44.110> thousand<00:05:44.589> joules<00:05:45.180> where<00:05:46.180> you

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
under two thousand joules where you

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.579 
under two thousand joules where you
started<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.539> see<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.779> yellows<00:05:47.169> that's<00:05:47.440> the

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:47.589 
started to see the yellows that's the

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.050 
started to see the yellows that's the
numbers<00:05:47.860> over<00:05:48.069> two<00:05:48.219> thousand<00:05:48.669> joules<00:05:48.849> and

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
numbers over two thousand joules and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.040 
numbers over two thousand joules and
really<00:05:49.300> there's<00:05:49.479> a<00:05:49.509> little<00:05:49.629> tongue<00:05:49.900> of

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
really there's a little tongue of

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.269 
really there's a little tongue of
instability<00:05:50.589> but<00:05:50.710> it's<00:05:50.830> not<00:05:50.949> overwhelming

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
instability but it's not overwhelming

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.670 
instability but it's not overwhelming
and<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:52.330> shear<00:05:52.599> values<00:05:53.020> are<00:05:53.169> just<00:05:53.349> not<00:05:53.469> all

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
and the shear values are just not all

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.189 
and the shear values are just not all
that<00:05:53.830> great<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.360> better<00:05:55.539> numbers<00:05:55.810> are<00:05:55.960> way<00:05:56.050> up

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
that great the better numbers are way up

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.320 
that great the better numbers are way up
north<00:05:56.529> away<00:05:56.740> from<00:05:56.889> the<00:05:57.159> instability<00:05:57.759> so<00:05:58.000> this

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
north away from the instability so this

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.929 
north away from the instability so this
run<00:05:58.839> is<00:05:59.740> suggesting<00:06:00.400> yes<00:06:00.610> there<00:06:00.789> could<00:06:00.879> be

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:00.939 
run is suggesting yes there could be

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.700 
run is suggesting yes there could be
some<00:06:01.180> strong<00:06:01.479> storms<00:06:01.779> may<00:06:02.080> be<00:06:02.110> severe<00:06:02.560> but

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
some strong storms may be severe but

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.010 
some strong storms may be severe but
it's<00:06:02.830> not<00:06:02.949> an<00:06:03.039> overwhelming<00:06:03.699> threat<00:06:04.029> but<00:06:04.240> look

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
it's not an overwhelming threat but look

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.269 
it's not an overwhelming threat but look
it's<00:06:05.169> just<00:06:05.409> too<00:06:05.560> early<00:06:05.589> this<00:06:05.979> could<00:06:06.159> look

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
it's just too early this could look

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.740 
it's just too early this could look
radically<00:06:06.520> different<00:06:07.089> by<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.270> time<00:06:07.360> we<00:06:07.659> get

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
radically different by the time we get

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.570 
radically different by the time we get
to<00:06:07.810> Monday<00:06:08.050> morning<00:06:08.199> so<00:06:08.710> just<00:06:09.129> something<00:06:09.400> to

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
to Monday morning so just something to

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.429 
to Monday morning so just something to
watch<00:06:09.849> nobody<00:06:10.449> at<00:06:10.599> this<00:06:10.719> point<00:06:11.050> knows<00:06:11.259> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
watch nobody at this point knows the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.070 
watch nobody at this point knows the
magnitude<00:06:12.039> of<00:06:12.310> this<00:06:12.849> event<00:06:13.089> the<00:06:13.509> timing<00:06:13.960> the

magnitude of this event the timing the

we'll<00:06:17.349> just<00:06:17.529> need<00:06:17.680> to<00:06:17.830> wait<00:06:18.009> and<00:06:18.520> then<00:06:18.669> a<00:06:18.759> week

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:18.879 
we'll just need to wait and then a week

north and west of the state and we might

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.749 
north and west of the state and we might
have<00:06:29.319> to<00:06:29.409> deal<00:06:29.560> with<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:29.860> later<00:06:30.069> if<00:06:30.310> indeed

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
have to deal with that later if indeed

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.309 
have to deal with that later if indeed
that<00:06:30.789> is<00:06:31.120> correct<00:06:31.419> that's<00:06:31.990> it<00:06:32.110> for<00:06:32.259> the
