00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.629
 here today wins as a team because I'm on 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.629
 can drive the best car 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.670
 how is it with you we have good 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.710
 feeling was just so our tactics 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.310
 but then we betrayed 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310
 if it worked 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.050
 how have you tried the consumption 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.700
 to contribute a little bit to yourself 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.620
 First gear really only to use 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.030
 that once you start im immediately 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.270
 second gear then switch quickly 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.790
 upshift the top speed 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.040
 reduce and if possible 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.440
 to drive in traffic 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.810
 one and a half days co2 challenge as is 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.100
 her conclusion after the co2 challenge 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.580
 has brought me two results 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.080
 once the new sx4 s cross is on 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.420
 really economical car that have the 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.050
 results of our candidates all 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.790
 yield 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.740
 Hardly anyone has the standard consumption 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.160
 severely interrupted the winner has in the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.360
 Standard consumption by 0.5 liters undercut 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.520
 second result is that one nevertheless 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.320
 He can do that very economically 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.210
 conclusion is that with the sx4 s cross 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.070
 can be really economical on the way 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.840
 The winner has 3.9 liters 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.270
 average consumption is needed and that 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 yes on a track really all 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.780
 differentiate one daily also otherwise 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.370
 In the route has offers with the mountain 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.990
 factory started up and of course in the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.260
 city outside the city since 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.620
 realistic consumption suzuki way of 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.620
