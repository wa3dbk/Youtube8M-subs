why'd I do it to myself why do I let
myself<00:00:09.240> believe<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.480> no<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:13.820> shouldn't<00:00:14.820> have

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
myself believe so no I shouldn't have

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.849 
myself believe so no I shouldn't have
cared<00:00:15.179> about<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.540> game<00:00:15.750> because<00:00:16.139> we<00:00:16.289> lost<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
cared about this game because we lost it

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
cared about this game because we lost it
in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.150> leg<00:00:19.189> with<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.660> ridiculous

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
in the first leg with a ridiculous

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
in the first leg with a ridiculous
performance<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> yet<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.730> got<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.090> caught<00:00:27.449> up

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
performance and yet I got so caught up

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.169 
performance and yet I got so caught up
as<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:28.380> sure<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.830> did<00:00:29.039> too<00:00:29.250> especially

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
as I'm sure you all did too especially

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.260 
as I'm sure you all did too especially
once<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.660> got<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.869> second<00:00:31.349> girl<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:32.270> suddenly

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
once we got that second girl I suddenly

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
once we got that second girl I suddenly
seemed<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.840> were<00:00:33.960> actually<00:00:34.260> gonna<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.649> it

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
seemed like we were actually gonna do it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
seemed like we were actually gonna do it
and<00:00:36.590> I<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.430> slightly<00:00:38.850> haunted<00:00:39.480> by<00:00:39.629> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and I will be slightly haunted by that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.639 
and I will be slightly haunted by that
sort<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> Giroud<00:00:41.309> Sanchez<00:00:42.649> combination

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
sort of Giroud Sanchez combination

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.979 
sort of Giroud Sanchez combination
chance<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> bat<00:00:44.489> post<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.120> switch<00:00:45.600> turned

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
chance at the bat post the switch turned

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.940 
chance at the bat post the switch turned
away<00:00:48.230> because<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> good<00:00:49.710> chance

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
away because that was a good chance

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.189 
away because that was a good chance
really<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> had<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> communication<00:00:52.050> been<00:00:52.170> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
really and had the communication been a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.069 
really and had the communication been a
bit<00:00:52.410> better<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.770> one<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> them<00:00:54.079> would

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
bit better I think one of them would

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
bit better I think one of them would
have<00:00:55.140> put<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> away<00:00:55.500> ah<00:00:58.579> what<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> do

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
have put it away ah what can you do

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
have put it away ah what can you do
Arsenal<00:01:00.660> basically<00:01:01.289> did<00:01:01.890> everything<00:01:01.980> they

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
Arsenal basically did everything they

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.889 
Arsenal basically did everything they
needed<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.670> do<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:03.030> probably<00:01:03.660> still<00:01:03.809> go

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
needed to do they probably still go

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.149 
needed to do they probably still go
through<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.260> were<00:01:04.320> gonna<00:01:04.439> need<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> luck

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
through we were gonna need a bit of luck

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.270 
through we were gonna need a bit of luck
and<00:01:05.460> we<00:01:06.390> didn't<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:08.040> didn't

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and we didn't really get that we didn't

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.160 
and we didn't really get that we didn't
get<00:01:08.369> many<00:01:08.610> breaks<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.630> alexis<00:01:10.020> was

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
get many breaks you know alexis was

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.179 
get many breaks you know alexis was
booked<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.280> dive<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:13.710> light<00:01:13.920> chance

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
booked but that dive that light chance

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
booked but that dive that light chance
was<00:01:14.430> trying<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> add<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> couple<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.360> crosses

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
was trying to add a couple of crosses

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.999 
was trying to add a couple of crosses
visit<00:01:16.049> across<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> box<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:16.890> no

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
visit across the box but there was no

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.539 
visit across the box but there was no
one<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:19.229> just<00:01:19.439> didn't<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:19.950> catch<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
one there we just didn't quite catch the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.429 
one there we just didn't quite catch the
break<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.299> would<00:01:21.450> probably<00:01:21.750> need<00:01:22.170> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
break that you would probably need to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840 
break that you would probably need to
pull<00:01:22.619> off<00:01:22.710> something<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.700> in

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pull off something like this but in

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.289 
pull off something like this but in
terms<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.509> had<00:01:24.689> control<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
terms of what we had control of I

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.149 
terms of what we had control of I
thought<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.420> did<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> lot<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:27.990> quite<00:01:28.650> amazing

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
thought we did a lot right quite amazing

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.560 
thought we did a lot right quite amazing
to<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.430> us<00:01:29.579> play<00:01:30.079> with<00:01:31.079> more<00:01:31.579> patience<00:01:32.579> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to see us play with more patience in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.429 
to see us play with more patience in
this<00:01:33.990> second<00:01:34.439> leg<00:01:35.270> when<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.350> was

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this second leg when we when there was

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.260 
this second leg when we when there was
something<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.009> when<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:38.850> incumbent

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
something you know when it was incumbent

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.460 
something you know when it was incumbent
us<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.689> get<00:01:39.810> goals<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.229> did<00:01:40.350> in

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
us to go and get goals than we did in

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
us to go and get goals than we did in
the<00:01:40.560> first<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> crazy<00:01:41.820> unnecessary

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the first just the crazy unnecessary

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569 
the first just the crazy unnecessary
urgency<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> first<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.860> cost<00:01:44.130> us<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
urgency of the first has cost us so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.719 
urgency of the first has cost us so
badly<00:01:45.860> and<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.070> know<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> lesson<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
badly and you know the lesson is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.889 
badly and you know the lesson is
obviously<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.420> can't<00:01:48.659> recover

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
obviously that you just can't recover

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.530 
obviously that you just can't recover
from<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
from that

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.130 
from that
unfortunately<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> lesson<00:01:51.869> we've<00:01:51.990> been

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
unfortunately the lesson we've been

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.249 
unfortunately the lesson we've been
taught<00:01:52.290> several<00:01:52.590> times<00:01:52.950> before<00:01:53.930> Milan<00:01:54.930> and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
taught several times before Milan and

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.959 
taught several times before Milan and
buying<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:56.820> doesn't<00:01:57.119> seem<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> have

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
buying it doesn't seem to have

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.600 
buying it doesn't seem to have
registered<00:01:59.969> with<00:02:00.000> us<00:02:00.149> yet<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.399> go

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
registered with us yet but there you go

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.959 
registered with us yet but there you go
I<00:02:02.960> mean<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> win<00:02:04.729> positive<00:02:05.729> momentum

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
I mean look it's a win positive momentum

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.260 
I mean look it's a win positive momentum
continues<00:02:07.369> just<00:02:08.369> frustrating<00:02:08.849> isn't<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
continues just frustrating isn't it to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.420 
continues just frustrating isn't it to
be<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.539> close<00:02:09.840> no<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.470> come<00:02:10.679> off

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
be so close no it not come off

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.230 
be so close no it not come off
but<00:02:13.430> lots<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.700> good<00:02:13.850> things<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.090> talk<00:02:14.180> about

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
but lots of good things to talk about

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.690 
but lots of good things to talk about

at<00:02:58.430> its<00:02:58.520> form<00:02:58.790> since<00:02:59.120> Christmas<00:02:59.540> he<00:02:59.660> has

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
at its form since Christmas he has

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.370 
at its form since Christmas he has
dipped<00:03:00.050> massively<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.810> mistakes<00:03:03.170> he<00:03:03.290> was

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
dipped massively the mistakes he was

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.750 
dipped massively the mistakes he was
making<00:03:03.740> tonight<00:03:04.010> are<00:03:04.220> actually<00:03:04.490> mistakes

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
making tonight are actually mistakes

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.100 
making tonight are actually mistakes
he'd<00:03:04.910> been<00:03:05.030> making<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.450> season<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:05.960> know

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
he'd been making all season you know

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.800 
he'd been making all season you know
dribbling<00:03:06.500> into<00:03:06.680> defenders<00:03:07.540> losing<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.630> ball

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
dribbling into defenders losing the ball

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.950 
dribbling into defenders losing the ball
trying<00:03:09.260> things<00:03:10.210> that<00:03:11.210> don't<00:03:11.360> quite<00:03:11.600> come<00:03:11.810> off

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
trying things that don't quite come off

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.450 
trying things that don't quite come off
I<00:03:12.200> think<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.470> difference<00:03:12.830> is<00:03:12.920> he<00:03:13.040> was<00:03:13.160> scoring

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
I think the difference is he was scoring

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.610 
I think the difference is he was scoring
then<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.060> he's<00:03:14.180> not<00:03:14.390> now<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.020> we<00:03:15.110> pick<00:03:15.320> up<00:03:15.470> on

then and he's not now so we pick up on

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.920 
then and he's not now so we pick up on
it<00:03:15.770> more<00:03:16.010> I've<00:03:16.550> got<00:03:16.820> surprised<00:03:17.210> he<00:03:17.480> saw<00:03:17.630> out

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930
