00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
want to put it in its own container

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.220 
want to put it in its own container
because<00:00:27.359> mint<00:00:27.660> likes<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.199> send<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:29.150> runners

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
because mint likes to send out runners

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.020 
because mint likes to send out runners
underneath<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.500> ground<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.820> will

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
underneath the ground and it will

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.959 
underneath the ground and it will
actually<00:00:33.450> take<00:00:34.200> over<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:35.070> entire<00:00:35.160> garden

bed<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.510> did<00:00:37.079> make<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.440> mistake<00:00:37.800> once<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
bed I did make the mistake once of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000 
bed I did make the mistake once of
putting<00:00:38.700> mint<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.930> garden<00:00:40.530> bed<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.890> other

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
putting mint in a garden bed with other

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.500 
putting mint in a garden bed with other
things<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> took<00:00:42.300> over

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
things in it just it took over

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.180 
things in it just it took over
everything<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.110> smelled<00:00:43.440> great<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.980> wasn't

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
everything it smelled great but I wasn't

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160 
everything it smelled great but I wasn't
really<00:00:44.430> able<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.850> plant<00:00:45.120> anything<00:00:45.450> else<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
really able to plant anything else in it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.770 
really able to plant anything else in it
so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> always<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.520> having<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:48.059> separate<00:00:48.450> mint

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so I always like having a separate mint

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.110 
so I always like having a separate mint
container<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> starts<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
container but if it starts to get a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.600 
container but if it starts to get a
little<00:00:51.420> unruly<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.289> if<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> starts<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.340> dry

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
little unruly or if it starts to get dry

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
little unruly or if it starts to get dry
underneath<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.559> idea<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.160> get

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
underneath then it's a good idea to get

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.729 
underneath then it's a good idea to get
your<00:00:56.579> herb<00:00:57.239> shears<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.350> kitchen

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
your herb shears out or some kitchen

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.729 
your herb shears out or some kitchen
shears<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.969> give<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.960> little<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
shears out and give it a little bit of a

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.160 
shears out and give it a little bit of a
haircut<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> doesn't<00:01:02.789> look<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.019> rangy<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
haircut so it doesn't look so rangy and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
haircut so it doesn't look so rangy and
I'm<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> trim<00:01:05.250> some<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.790> down

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm going to trim some of this down

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.109 
I'm going to trim some of this down
you'll<00:01:06.689> see<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.530> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.040> pot<00:01:08.549> there's<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> lot

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you'll see here in the pot there's a lot

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.359 
you'll see here in the pot there's a lot
of<00:01:09.270> new<00:01:09.479> growth<00:01:09.689> coming<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.439> underneath<00:01:10.860> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of new growth coming up underneath so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.190 
of new growth coming up underneath so
I'll<00:01:11.549> leave<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> alone<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.780> mint<00:01:13.020> will

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I'll leave that alone because mint will

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
I'll leave that alone because mint will
grow<00:01:13.470> pretty<00:01:13.830> quickly<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.640> I'm<00:01:15.150> going<00:01:15.330> to

leaves off if they look like they've

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.260 
leaves off if they look like they've
been<00:01:21.320> had<00:01:22.320> some<00:01:22.530> insects<00:01:23.150> infestation<00:01:24.150> on

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
those off too and this will also shape

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.730 
those off too and this will also shape
it<00:01:31.140> nicely<00:01:31.610> before<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.909> plant<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> do

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it nicely before I plant it you can do

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
it nicely before I plant it you can do
this<00:01:34.890> after<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.579> into<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.939> container

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
this after you put it into a container

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.280 
this after you put it into a container
or<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> before<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
or you can do it before it's up to you

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
or you can do it before it's up to you
but<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> before<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> looks

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
but I like to do it before so it looks

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.730 
but I like to do it before so it looks
good<00:01:42.420> once<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:43.500> gonna<00:01:43.619> take

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
good once I get it in and I'm gonna take

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.679 
good once I get it in and I'm gonna take
a<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.220> from<00:01:44.729> down<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.450> because

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
a little bit from down here because

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.160 
a little bit from down here because
there's<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.020> lot<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.380> dry<00:01:46.619> stuff<00:01:47.180> under<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.659> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
there's a lot of dry stuff under here so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
there's a lot of dry stuff under here so
it's<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.470> matter<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.310> doing<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it's a matter of kind of just doing it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.960 
it's a matter of kind of just doing it
