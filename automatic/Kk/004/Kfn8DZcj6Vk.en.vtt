that's<00:04:04.510> probably<00:04:04.750> even<00:04:05.049> longer<00:04:05.350> than<00:04:05.620> this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
clipper well they'd be pretty much the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.640 
clipper well they'd be pretty much the
same<00:04:09.340> length<00:04:09.640> but<00:04:10.239> all<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.660> Caribbeans<00:04:11.380> had<00:04:11.620> a
