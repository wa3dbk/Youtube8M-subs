00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.120
 chipotle macaroni soup 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.620
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.780
 are 200 grams which is the equivalent to 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.420
 a bag of these that are sold in the 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.010
 super or in the little bird stores 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.170
 delgadito of number 2 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.559
 two sausages of the exception of his 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.579
 medium choice cream cheese bar that 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:49.329
 it's 95 grams a can of half cream 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.180
 which are 225 grams if you can not get 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.210
 the tula you can prepare put half 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.940
 of sour cream and the other half of milk 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.079
 evaporated 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.960
 Carlos Bergoglio powder 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.920
 the analysts of tomato puree 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.920
 flavored 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.560
 in marinade 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.720
 this water fair or 400 milliliters 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.980
 approximately the equivalent 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.400
 63 and ground black pepper 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:27.410
 let's put in a pot oil 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.410
 for kind of follow the sausages 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.940
 this same oil later we will 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.520
 serve to let the 7 get hot and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 while we are going to start our 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.690
 sausages if not so girls of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.500
 get themselves they have plastic there 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.580
 remove it this plastic there are some to 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.580
 I remove it bring 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.630
 ah 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.420
 we remove and we will cut into wheels 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.560
 that are not too thick or too thin 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.560
 more or less this size 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 and that's how the oil heated up, we're going to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.760
 keep on medium heat and here we are going to 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 put the sausages 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.140
 we are going to let them surround themselves 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140
 bit 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.140
 we will mix it occasionally until 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.510
 that we get a golden one in this way 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.450
 since it is in the row we remove from 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.110
 fire trying to discover a little the 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.110
 oil 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.850
 this is the amount of oil that we 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.850
 is enough to fry the lack 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.850
 so 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.790
 and we're going to mix it here 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.790
 bit 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.130
 I kissed her for four minutes here 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.550
 I'm going to turn off while preparing the collection 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.790
 without stopping moving in this way is 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.610
 how we wanted it without it burning 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.620
 here we leave it for a while, let's put 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.880
 in the blender jar or in a 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.430
 tap one of the boxes of 210 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.430
 grams a trickle of water 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.610
 and we are going to put a chile trainer 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.790
 same if you do not want to put chili 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.560
 because you 're going to serve children not 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.840
 put tiles but here we are going to put 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.700
 a small chile 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.440
 I'm doing it here because I'm going 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.580
 to do with the manual blender but if 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.580
 Can not wait in your blender 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.930
 we are going to liquefy it only 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.680
 perfectly bolivia and chile since what 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.260
 we have what we are going to integrate to the lack 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.080
 that is already golden brown and while 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.260
 We prepare the santa and it's already cold and 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.360
 Adriano does not jump if the oil when 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.699
 It is down 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.849
 here we are going to put the rest of the 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.849
 Water 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.770
 and the other box of the tomato puree 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.550
 Spice up 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.550
 now 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.050
 here we will also put the broth 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.689
 chicken powder to taste what I'm going 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.429
 to put this spoonful 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:00.429
 the mixture 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:12.580
 and I'm going to let it be reduced 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.580
 here we will have it at medium heat 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.660
 On the other hand the same mounts liquefy 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.980
 Lets put 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.980
 the half cream 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.879
 yes 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:37.900
 with the cream cheese we distribute a little 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.419
 we are going to put it here 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.660
 and we're going to leave it to integrate 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.660
 all right 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.930
 either in your blender or what I say with 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.930
 does your hand blender 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.710
 only to be integrated 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.710
 here is ready 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.020
 to the part you have to be mixing 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.259
 occasionally for 20 minutes here 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.909
 already reduced the salt is synthesized now 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:28.000
 what we are going to do here we are going to 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:31.530
 put half cream and cream cheese 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.530
 that we already mix 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.669
 Paul and quarte as has been the case 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.000
 Blog 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.600
 with another mixture that integrates everything 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.600
 perfectly 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.160
 Here we are going to put the pepper 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.490
 black ground 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.490
 this 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.400
 and we're going to let it reduce a bit 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.400
 nothing more 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.980
 three minutes later without stopping moving 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.140
 because these parts are regularly 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.420
 they stick from below if they have cream then 

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.930
 you have to move it since the three 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:16.330
 minutes and below and they're ready to 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.850
 to serve well is how we are going to serve it 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.580
 over we will put the successes that 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.460
 we had previously fried you 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.370
 a leaf of peppermint Abkhazia 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.020
 cilantro of the parsley of the one that has and 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.570
 If you want it more spicy we put it 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.450
 registered and marinated for 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:37.570
