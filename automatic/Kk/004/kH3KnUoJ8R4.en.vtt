fan which is probably going to be a
little<00:01:54.840> loud<00:01:55.079> not<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.820> loudest

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259

you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.219> graphics<00:02:02.610> card<00:02:02.790> does<00:02:03.000> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
you can see this graphics card does not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.230

take<00:02:03.420> any<00:02:03.689> 6-pin<00:02:04.350> connector<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:06.060> don't

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
take any 6-pin connector so we don't

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.559 
take any 6-pin connector so we don't
need<00:02:06.479> damn<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.369> power<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:09.360> all

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
need damn that much power at all

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.899 
need damn that much power at all
and<00:02:10.959> it's<00:02:11.200> also<00:02:11.379> good<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:11.950> don't<00:02:12.370> know<00:02:12.430> how<00:02:12.670> it

and it's also good I don't know how it

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.580 
and it's also good I don't know how it
doesn't<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.480> a<00:02:13.510> 6-pin<00:02:13.989> connector<00:02:14.019> it's<00:02:14.469> so

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
doesn't have a 6-pin connector it's so

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.589 
doesn't have a 6-pin connector it's so
powerful<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:15.310> haven't<00:02:15.849> tested<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.239> yet<00:02:16.299> but
