00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
yeah I'm psyched about this pad another

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.690 
yeah I'm psyched about this pad another
really<00:02:39.700> good<00:02:39.820> feature<00:02:40.090> is<00:02:41.340> you<00:02:42.340> know<00:02:42.459> crash

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
really good feature is you know crash

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.030 
really good feature is you know crash
pads<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.300> past<00:02:43.510> I've<00:02:43.750> always<00:02:44.050> you've

choose the you can choose the hinge

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.250 
choose the you can choose the hinge
closure<00:02:50.260> which<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:52.690> kind<00:02:52.870> of<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.050> bummer

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
closure which it's kind of a bummer

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.340 
closure which it's kind of a bummer
because<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:54.040> know<00:02:54.160> it'll<00:02:54.489> give<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> dead<00:02:55.000> space

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
because you know it'll give a dead space

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.130 
because you know it'll give a dead space
in<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.030> middle<00:02:58.390> there<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.600> can<00:02:58.900> see

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
in the in the middle there you can see

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.229 
in the in the middle there you can see
which<00:02:59.769> is<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.340> know<00:03:00.430> in<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.580> budget<00:03:00.970> crash

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
which is you know in the budget crash

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.210 
which is you know in the budget crash
pad<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.690> have<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:02.110> or<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.830> can<00:03:02.980> use<00:03:03.040> the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
pad you have that or you can use the

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.840 
pad you have that or you can use the
taco<00:03:03.640> vault<00:03:03.940> which<00:03:04.299> is<00:03:05.049> like<00:03:05.470> this<00:03:05.680> guy<00:03:05.890> the

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
taco vault which is like this guy the

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.140 
taco vault which is like this guy the
whole<00:03:07.060> pad<00:03:07.420> folds<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:09.519> weakens<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
whole pad folds and that weakens the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.520 
whole pad folds and that weakens the
foam<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> sin<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.080> pads<00:03:11.320> and

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
foam in the sin of your pads and

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.479 
foam in the sin of your pads and
constantly<00:03:12.250> folding<00:03:12.880> opening<00:03:13.750> it's<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.709> not

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
constantly folding opening it's just not

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.080 
constantly folding opening it's just not
a<00:03:15.519> good<00:03:15.880> setup<00:03:16.120> we're<00:03:16.870> told<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
a good setup we're told is with the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.000 
a good setup we're told is with the
first<00:03:19.360> to<00:03:19.540> do<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
first to do the

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.400 
first to do the
they<00:03:24.010> make<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> wedge<00:03:24.730> design<00:03:25.210> so<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.990> thumb

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
they make this wedge design so the thumb

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.650 
they make this wedge design so the thumb
overlaps<00:03:27.190> like<00:03:27.490> that<00:03:27.730> so<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.030> don't<00:03:28.270> have<00:03:28.420> any

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
overlaps like that so you don't have any

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.450 
overlaps like that so you don't have any
dead<00:03:28.930> space<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.410> middle<00:03:29.710> but<00:03:30.190> it<00:03:30.280> still

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
dead space in the middle but it still

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.110 
dead space in the middle but it still
packs<00:03:30.760> down<00:03:31.060> nice<00:03:31.800> like<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.830> like<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> normal

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
packs down nice like a like a normal

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.030 
packs down nice like a like a normal
hinge<00:03:34.360> pad<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.290> other<00:03:35.440> thing<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.890> has<00:03:36.010> a

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
hinge pad the other thing is it has a

hinge pad the other thing is it has a
continuous<00:03:36.730> layer<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:37.210> foam<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:38.320> right<00:03:38.620> here

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
continuous layer of foam this right here

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.190 
continuous layer of foam this right here
is<00:03:38.980> actually<00:03:39.210> about<00:03:40.210> half-inch<00:03:40.810> thick

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
is actually about half-inch thick

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590 
is actually about half-inch thick
continuous<00:03:41.830> layer<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.670> foam<00:03:42.910> over<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.300> entire

continuous layer of foam over the entire

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.410 
continuous layer of foam over the entire
top<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.740> have<00:03:44.920> absolutely<00:03:45.340> no<00:03:45.940> dead<00:03:46.180> space

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
top so you have absolutely no dead space
