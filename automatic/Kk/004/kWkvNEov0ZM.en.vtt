00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
we'll go up to the solid tunnel there's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.210 
we'll go up to the solid tunnel there's
all<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.830> leaves<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> I've<00:01:23.340> taken<00:01:23.549> off<00:01:23.820> so

all the leaves that I've taken off so
really<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.400> don't<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.729> small<00:01:27.509> thin<00:01:27.810> bits

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
really you don't want small thin bits

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
really you don't want small thin bits
like<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.680> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.920> put<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
like this so I'm going to put this to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.850 
like this so I'm going to put this to
one<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.140> weeps<00:01:31.380> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
one side and see if it weeps just

putting in water and I've almost
finished<00:01:35.070> now<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.729> very<00:01:38.729> easy

finished now the the very very easy

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.410 
finished now the the very very easy
topper<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.790> going<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.000> be

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
topper and now I'm just going to be

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.819 
topper and now I'm just going to be
using<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.860> general<00:01:44.540> mix<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:51.829> compost

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
using the general mix here of compost

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.340 
using the general mix here of compost
you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.369> use<00:01:53.729> seed<00:01:54.149> compost<00:01:54.780> preferably

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you can use seed compost preferably

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.760 
you can use seed compost preferably
cutting<00:01:55.829> compost<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.200> put<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> through<00:01:58.710> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
cutting compost you can put it through a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.789 
cutting compost you can put it through a
sieve<00:01:59.070> if<00:01:59.250> you'd<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.939> create<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.240> nice

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
sieve if you'd like to create a nice

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.069 
sieve if you'd like to create a nice
fine<00:02:01.799> soil<00:02:02.280> mix<00:02:02.880> your<00:02:03.119> lighter<00:02:03.299> organic

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
fine soil mix your lighter organic

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.990 
fine soil mix your lighter organic
compost<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.280> got<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.849> good

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
compost and you got it from a good

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.670 
compost and you got it from a good
source<00:02:09.440> try<00:02:10.440> if<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.920> haven't<00:02:11.840> got

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
source try if you haven't got

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.000 
source try if you haven't got
for<00:02:13.860> steep<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.340> advise<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.689> is<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> great<00:02:16.560> fun

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
for steep I advise you it is a great fun

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.660 
for steep I advise you it is a great fun
and<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.579> get<00:02:17.790> lots<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.269> nice<00:02:18.450> compost<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.670> so

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
and you get lots of nice compost out so

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.140 
and you get lots of nice compost out so
that<00:02:20.970> might<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.180> another<00:02:21.299> video<00:02:21.890> anyway

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
that might be another video anyway

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.619 
that might be another video anyway
there's<00:02:24.150> my<00:02:24.390> tray<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:25.650> seeds<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.610> might<00:02:27.420> be

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
there's my tray of seeds now I might be

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.289 
there's my tray of seeds now I might be
using<00:02:27.870> some<00:02:28.140> hormone<00:02:28.980> treating<00:02:29.459> powder<00:02:29.760> and

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
using some hormone treating powder and

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.750 
using some hormone treating powder and
I'm<00:02:31.140> not<00:02:31.290> sure<00:02:31.500> whether<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.920> is<00:02:32.099> organic<00:02:32.640> but

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
I'm not sure whether this is organic but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.599 
I'm not sure whether this is organic but
I'll<00:02:33.689> try<00:02:34.109> and<00:02:34.140> find<00:02:34.470> some<00:02:34.709> organic<00:02:35.159> stuff<00:02:35.430> you

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
I'll try and find some organic stuff you

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.940 
I'll try and find some organic stuff you
