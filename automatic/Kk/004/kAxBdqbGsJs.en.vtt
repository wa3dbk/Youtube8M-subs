00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
got a question about the good morning

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.180 
got a question about the good morning
technique<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.349> Chris<00:00:10.620> Moore<00:00:10.890> did

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
technique was it that Chris Moore did

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.070 
technique was it that Chris Moore did
because<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:11.910> says<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.360> don't<00:00:12.420> understand<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
because it says I don't understand the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.140 
because it says I don't understand the
concept<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.710> arching<00:00:14.130> your<00:00:14.220> back<00:00:14.280> all<00:00:14.730> I'll<00:00:15.120> be

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
concept of arching your back all I'll be

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.149 
concept of arching your back all I'll be
a<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:15.780> morning<00:00:16.230> technique<00:00:16.590> while<00:00:16.769> I<00:00:16.919> thought

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:17.159 
a good morning technique while I thought

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.380 
a good morning technique while I thought
we<00:00:17.279> were<00:00:17.369> supposed<00:00:17.489> to<00:00:17.669> have<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.849> neutral<00:00:18.179> spine

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
we were supposed to have a neutral spine

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.050 
we were supposed to have a neutral spine
for<00:00:18.659> all<00:00:18.839> lift<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:20.159> what<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.489> the<00:00:20.609> spine<00:00:20.909> or

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
for all lift now what is the spine or

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.849 
for all lift now what is the spine or
back<00:00:21.239> doing<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:21.960> its<00:00:22.079> arched<00:00:22.499> and<00:00:22.679> what

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
back doing when its arched and what

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.519 
back doing when its arched and what
exercises<00:00:23.489> would<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.419> arch<00:00:24.689> your<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.989> for

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
exercises would you arch your back for

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.759 
exercises would you arch your back for
so<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.269> saying<00:00:30.269> arch<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.809> back<00:00:30.869> basically

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so so saying arch your back basically

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.800 
so so saying arch your back basically
usually<00:00:32.130> means<00:00:32.369> don't<00:00:32.970> round<00:00:33.150> your<00:00:33.300> back<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
usually means don't round your back and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.940 
usually means don't round your back and
it<00:00:33.870> means<00:00:33.990> to<00:00:34.110> keep<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> neutral<00:00:34.380> spine<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it means to keep a neutral spine so it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
it means to keep a neutral spine so it
really<00:00:34.980> means<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> same<00:00:35.520> thing<00:00:35.580> so<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.660> doing

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
really means the same thing so I'm doing

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
really means the same thing so I'm doing
a<00:00:36.990> good<00:00:37.140> morning<00:00:37.590> where<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.040> bending<00:00:38.280> at<00:00:38.490> the
