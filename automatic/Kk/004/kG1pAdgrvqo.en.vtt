00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
um I'm 25 decks I guess that's count

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.680 
um I'm 25 decks I guess that's count
somewhat<00:03:33.430> ask<00:03:33.639> decklist<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.359> like<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.660> really

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
somewhat ask decklist not like it really

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.470 
somewhat ask decklist not like it really
matters<00:03:34.959> anymore<00:03:35.880> because<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.090> potential

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
matters anymore because the potential

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.110 
matters anymore because the potential
system<00:03:37.889> because<00:03:38.889> I<00:03:39.010> back<00:03:39.190> then<00:03:39.340> using<00:03:39.850> scanned

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
system because I back then using scanned

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.819 
system because I back then using scanned
I<00:03:40.239> was<00:03:40.450> like<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:41.530> something<00:03:41.560> like

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
I was like the or something like

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.500 
I was like the or something like
that<00:03:41.889> Joe<00:03:42.220> Budden<00:03:42.459> now<00:03:42.819> it<00:03:42.970> doesn't<00:03:43.389> matter

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
that Joe Budden now it doesn't matter

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.500 
that Joe Budden now it doesn't matter
anymore<00:03:43.750> usually<00:03:44.620> feel<00:03:44.799> go<00:03:45.010> for<00:03:45.220> like

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
anymore usually feel go for like

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.879 
anymore usually feel go for like
cravings<00:03:46.510> at<00:03:46.720> least<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.139> higher<00:03:47.380> level<00:03:47.650> cloud

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
cravings at least a higher level cloud

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.470 
cravings at least a higher level cloud
just<00:03:48.190> for<00:03:48.400> better<00:03:48.579> potential<00:03:48.910> step<00:03:49.209> so

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
just for better potential step so

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.330 
just for better potential step so
decklist<00:03:50.319> or<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.769> doesn't<00:03:50.799> really<00:03:51.160> matter

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
decklist or not it doesn't really matter

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.479 
decklist or not it doesn't really matter
anymore<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.000> guess<00:03:52.690> it's<00:03:53.500> good<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.280> can't

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
anymore I guess it's good if you can't

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.860 
anymore I guess it's good if you can't
afford<00:03:54.549> it<00:03:54.819> but<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:55.630> okay<00:03:55.989> if<00:03:56.019> you<00:03:56.230> can<00:03:56.470> and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
afford it but it's okay if you can and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.390 
afford it but it's okay if you can and

thinking<00:04:17.069> what<00:04:17.220> I'm<00:04:17.310> trying<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.489> do<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.699> I'm

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:17.879 
thinking what I'm trying to do is I'm

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.099 
thinking what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.120> mix<00:04:18.269> work<00:04:18.479> we<00:04:18.629> will<00:04:18.720> find<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:18.989> your

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
trying to mix work we will find to your

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.779 
trying to mix work we will find to your
brand<00:04:19.349> and<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:21.269> guess<00:04:21.810> that's<00:04:22.650> what<00:04:23.009> 4005<00:04:23.550> means

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
brand and I guess that's what 4005 means

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.640 
brand and I guess that's what 4005 means
it<00:04:24.000> doesn't<00:04:24.150> really<00:04:24.419> have<00:04:24.659> a<00:04:24.690> solid<00:04:25.199> meaning

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
it doesn't really have a solid meaning

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.950 
it doesn't really have a solid meaning
to<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.860> yet<00:04:26.009> but<00:04:26.300> it's<00:04:27.300> kind<00:04:27.479> of<00:04:27.509> like<00:04:27.599> a<00:04:27.659> bread

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
to it yet but it's kind of like a bread

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.809 
to it yet but it's kind of like a bread
