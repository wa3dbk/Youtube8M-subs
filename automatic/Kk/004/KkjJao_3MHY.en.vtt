and now this is for I use it on a first

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.780 
and now this is for I use it on a first
aid<00:05:47.440> because<00:05:47.800> it's<00:05:48.010> very<00:05:48.220> hard<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.640> beat

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.300 
chartreuse but not only does it preserve
it<00:05:58.840> but<00:05:59.020> with<00:05:59.290> the<00:05:59.440> salt<00:05:59.710> it<00:05:59.860> helps<00:06:00.130> make<00:06:00.280> it

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
it but with the salt it helps make it

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.240 
it but with the salt it helps make it
tough<00:06:00.640> because<00:06:00.880> they<00:06:01.150> really<00:06:01.450> get<00:06:01.950> soft<00:06:02.950> after

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
tough because they really get soft after

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.520 
tough because they really get soft after
the<00:06:03.490> first<00:06:03.729> day<00:06:04.000> and<00:06:04.360> as<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:04.780> color<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:05.260> pedes

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
the first day and as the color in pedes

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.130 
the first day and as the color in pedes
and<00:06:05.919> gets<00:06:06.700> inside<00:06:07.090> of<00:06:07.300> these<00:06:07.419> it's<00:06:07.930> also

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
and gets inside of these it's also

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.520 
and gets inside of these it's also
putting<00:06:08.500> another<00:06:08.770> scent<00:06:09.160> in<00:06:09.340> there<00:06:09.520> with<00:06:10.180> the

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.580 
components that past
he<00:06:16.100> puts<00:06:16.340> into<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.820> connector<00:06:17.750> it<00:06:17.990> does<00:06:18.560> a

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
he puts into the connector it does a

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.940 
he puts into the connector it does a
really<00:06:18.860> good<00:06:19.070> job<00:06:19.130> then<00:06:20.120> what<00:06:20.870> I<00:06:20.900> do<00:06:21.020> after<00:06:21.470> you

after I run these for 15-20 minutes I'll

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.460 
after I run these for 15-20 minutes I'll
take<00:06:31.670> and<00:06:32.120> I'll<00:06:32.240> take<00:06:32.690> my<00:06:32.870> knife<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.380> I'll

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
the each side and put four in there

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.030

don't<00:06:38.960> matter<00:06:39.200> what<00:06:39.440> you're<00:06:39.620> doing<00:06:39.830> is<00:06:39.920> you're

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
don't matter what you're doing is you're

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.880 
don't matter what you're doing is you're
letting<00:06:40.190> sent<00:06:40.580> out<00:06:40.790> and<00:06:41.150> all<00:06:41.840> this<00:06:42.050> red<00:06:42.650> and

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
letting sent out and all this red and

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.100 
letting sent out and all this red and
all<00:06:42.980> this<00:06:43.130> blue<00:06:43.370> is<00:06:43.610> digging<00:06:44.270> inside<00:06:44.750> of<00:06:44.960> these

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
all this blue is digging inside of these

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.860 
all this blue is digging inside of these
bait<00:06:45.980> fish<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.490> it's<00:06:46.760> it's<00:06:47.030> putting<00:06:47.330> extra

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
bait fish and it's it's putting extra

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.570 
bait fish and it's it's putting extra
scent<00:06:48.800> into<00:06:49.010> the<00:06:49.190> water

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
scent into the water

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.810 
scent into the water
so<00:06:50.240> you<00:06:51.140> know<00:06:51.260> a<00:06:51.590> lot<00:06:52.160> of<00:06:52.340> people<00:06:52.580> have<00:06:52.700> a<00:06:52.730> hard

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820 
so you know a lot of people have a hard

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.050 
so you know a lot of people have a hard
time<00:06:53.150> using<00:06:53.420> whole<00:06:53.720> bait<00:06:53.930> compared<00:06:54.470> to<00:06:54.590> using

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
time using whole bait compared to using

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.730 
time using whole bait compared to using
cut<00:06:56.060> bait<00:06:56.300> but<00:06:56.660> the<00:06:56.870> reason<00:06:57.200> is<00:06:57.350> is<00:06:57.560> they're

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
cut bait but the reason is is they're

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.110 
cut bait but the reason is is they're
not<00:06:57.860> getting<00:06:58.130> that<00:06:58.190> sent<00:06:58.520> out<00:06:58.670> of<00:06:58.820> the<00:06:58.850> fish

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
not getting that sent out of the fish

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.120 
not getting that sent out of the fish
and<00:06:59.300> that's<00:06:59.840> key<00:07:00.080> really<00:07:00.260> does<00:07:00.470> a<00:07:00.500> good<00:07:00.620> job<00:07:00.680> at

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
and that's key really does a good job at

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.580 
and that's key really does a good job at
that<00:07:01.160> and
