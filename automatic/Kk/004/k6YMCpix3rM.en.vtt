with Rousseff to pay per views ago I
think<00:02:08.759> he<00:02:08.879> had<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.000> best<00:02:09.239> match<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.869> me<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think he had the best match to me on the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
think he had the best match to me on the
card<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.510> it's<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.810> hard

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
card so it's really hard

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.310 
card so it's really hard
to<00:02:14.130> say<00:02:14.340> because<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.420> really<00:02:15.630> depends<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
to say because it really depends on the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200 
to say because it really depends on the
amount<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.770> w/e<00:02:17.160> allows<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.880> look<00:02:18.060> at

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
amount of time w/e allows you look at

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.450 
amount of time w/e allows you look at
