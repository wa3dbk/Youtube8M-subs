00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 they drag themselves together 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 the therapy people so they go in 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.119
 Therapy sessions with a stranger

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.529
 on your side 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.180
 But what happens when you come back 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 is detected under another 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.920
 identity what a chaos arises and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 whether in the end all therapies themselves 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.610
 really really need that has 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.610

 conductor lechner innsbrucker alpenzoo 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.240
 such a little polar bear with the bottle 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.990
 raised in the alps, animals set fire 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 I master my old ones 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.140
 gustaf v heart surgeon the relationship 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.670
 already therapy crasher rule number three 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.719
 the cvs can not overly intellectual 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.369
 enough I had one 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.810
 twin sister this need my 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.750
 mother in the storm we do not see fear 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.009
 it always goes to take a lot 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.869
 Number 8 always go to your partner 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.110
 and also had the feeling something 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.110
 out 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.689
 I will not therapy out again 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 crasher rule number 10 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.280
 just stay away from his ex 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 and the most important rule of all 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 never fall in love with you 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.640
 Participant is not the same 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 you're the first one with me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 do not understand at all 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.450
 we establish a sexual relationship 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.600
 but is normal 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.400
 then I put it in a thick bernd knows that 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:44.020
 flaccid limb sorry the sharp 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:45.850
 cliffs the basic orientation of the 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.530
 history is completely absurd though 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.140
 somehow I find the idea now even 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.720
 Not so shit that you feel the same way 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.490
 Therapy sessions creep around there 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 to tow in the girls that he 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.600
 works before everything in the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.640
 that's because it's so 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.740
 two complete normalos are those one 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.750
 this slight despair also decreases 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.010
 that they do not really 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.950
 know how are we going to use the now 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.690
 women at home in our bed 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.240
 I also like that one or the other 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.650
 other funny subplot the movie like that 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.750
 trying to spice things up 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.570
 there is already so sympathetic 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.250
 moments and also the general look is 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.930
 become very professional 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.780
 you really can not say anything that looks 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.310
 like a very high quality movie 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.140
 unfortunately and that is for a comedy 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.000
 pretty stupid, the film is simple 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.070
 not funny and we are 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.660
 at the first really big massive 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.459
 problems it is of course a problem 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.930
 if the comedy is not funny that 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.280
 is due to the poorly written gags 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.989
 It was in our room 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.090
 quietly you would have any 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.400
 chirping a cricket can hear 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.810
 and that's because the gags are real 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.190
 are written badly and he is so 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.700
 try under the belt line too 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.410
 pull 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.780
 that does not work here 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
 because actually the joke at this 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.660
 therapy session itself is there and there 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.700
 You could just be smart with humor 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.260
 use but here is just 08 15 with 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.760
 force the crowbar 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.590
 So here are all really completely 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.209
 mentally deranged the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.030
 either do the sessions or the 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.100
 go and that's just more complete 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.660
 nonsense because there are people in 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.130
 some way and problem 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.750
 what the rules want but are yes 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.750
 otherwise just ordinary people 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.010
 and by impression I will 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.690
 just do not let go that just the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.980
 People have a major role in this 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.050
 got cosmos 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.630
 seemingly reasonable can think that 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.330
 I find somehow completely inappropriate and 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.370
 makes the film complete for me 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.800
 unbearable and even if I say that 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.510
 I think it's cool that you're normalos 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.430
 because that's the whole thing 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.410
 simply a higher credibility in 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.420
 the basic orientation is where it is 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.550
 is not credible if this then 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.780
 but in turn, get every woman 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.220
 what they want 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.490
 they will not talk like that now 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.290
 misunderstand and then it does 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.450
 just no sense and you are bored 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.670
 itself to death and it is such a pity though 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.260
 what should I do because it is easy 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.930
 but not of you I would like 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.030
 know in which therapy session you 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.620
 because you would go in for the people 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.540
 want to get to know more exactly 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.860
 write that one the comments 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.810
 my personal rating falls 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.370
 of course, from there too 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.830
 Not enough if you are here and there 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.690
 is sympathetic and has a nice idea 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.050
 as well as professional optics therefore exist 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.750
 I score it only three out of ten 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.880
 I really did not think I found that 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.560
 everything embarrassing was not cool 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.150
 staged what should you do 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.920
 unfortunately I can only do three out of ten 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.200
 give it points can not always 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240
 to have everything running well but maybe 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.250
 we at others make a possibility 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.840
 to get two good movies presented 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.160
 and then I suggest I stay 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.200
 but at the film factory one here 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.520
 Once here I have two reviews for you 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.440
 he likes to visit and link 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.150
 then we'll see each other in this one 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.130
 reviews or soon at one again 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.660
 new film criticism here the film factory 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.660
 lay with me the double
