00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 very good to everyone in the forn or if 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 we are on my computer 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.460
 if you want the pirate is in the video 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 previous I will leave it in in the description 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 or on the screen and good first thing 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.090
 let's do is go to create access 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.770
 direct that we created the other day if not 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.920
 you have to remember where the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.199
 folder and we open the location in this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 If we open the folder in which 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.160
 find that in which we are going to use 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.160
 let's go to this folder 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.920
 configurations and here we will leave a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 predefined man that is the one that they have 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.269
 all users who use download the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.039
 pirate game in this case we have to 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.290
 change for ours put our 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.030
 link as you want but does not have 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.210
 that be the same as ours 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 colleagues that go to the server 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.150
 then here in the language there are only 2 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.270
 is 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.720
 in English and another that I do not know which one is now 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.720
 same 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.800
 If they put their parents in Spanish it will last a 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.510
 more time to start the game but not 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.870
 it will come out in English because it's not state 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 language once done that we start the 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.350
 server 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.859
 will start the server will last a little while 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.470
 because it is generating our world but 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.930
 In the net 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.430
 and we'll have the server created I'm not going 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 to come into play now when orienting 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.750
 then because you have to wait is 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.060
 illicit fishing 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.830
 the second step that we should do and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.590
 also our rivers is to download the 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.090
 hamchi for the k play minecraft online 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.679
 pirate to used many times 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.679
 and well we download it 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.430
 we look for it here 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.420
 and in this case what you are looking for nothing 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.000
 when internet 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.000
 dot windows is not planning 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.290
 controversy 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.500
 once started what we should do is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.500
 create a network 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.040
 and you put the name of the network in this 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.040
 case are bone 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.910
 the password that you want me to always 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.910
 I put a 23 23 and he creates it 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.210
 and it will have been created here or I 've given it 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.080
 if you give it to create new network but as 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.640
 I think I have the network limit like this 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.480
 that created it here at the bottom because 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.430
 start with that and good people will have 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
 to join this assistant network and 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.150
 will have to put the idea that starbucks and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.150
 the password 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.210
 answer what is now 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.220
 connect to your computer network as 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.220
 these people who are here connected 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.490
 and you can play together and enter the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.300
 two to comment 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.730
 you will have to copy the address 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.970
 pass them or these friends start the 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.140
 game as it is already loaded the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.140
 what would he be 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:56.200
 in this and good does not stop charging and 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.890
 I will enter the game and now 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.760
 Tenneco and the server think it 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.580
 load is going to be loaded with this 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.010
 this ruin dice or the option to 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.110
 multiplayer we choose our character 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.290
 and we put in light control and if we have 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.709
 state of the number plus we removed it and already 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.019
 we will not be able to focus 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.880
 we got there I noticed we went back to 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.310
 load the game and as you know is in 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.000
 beta and for a little bit we are already in 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.070
 our server 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.420
 in this case, people can enter 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.180
 these videos do not know if exactly 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.250
 we appear in the same galaxy in 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.250
 different galaxies but 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.740
 and we appear with the objects of 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.910
 character and in the world of the character 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.550
 this is good because if we stay the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:54.220
 characters can enter 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:58.390
 their worlds from online and good 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.140
 like in this world but now it's 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.140
 online and inside 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.520
 and in good people up here the interior 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.530
 goodbye good so that among the others 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.110
 consonance in that the same steps to 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.780
 maximum after the server 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.169
 hamÃ¡s and also to create but to join 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.169
 to network
