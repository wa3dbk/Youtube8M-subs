go<00:04:08.489> ahead<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.090> do<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.860> do<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.070> right<00:04:11.310> quick

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
go ahead and do that do that right quick

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.370 
go ahead and do that do that right quick
it<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:14.040> just<00:04:14.760> under<00:04:14.970> three<00:04:15.270> millimeters<00:04:15.840> well

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
it is just under three millimeters well

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.300 
it is just under three millimeters well
a<00:04:16.650> little<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.430> more<00:04:17.580> than<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:17.880> under<00:04:18.090> 2.9

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
a little bit more than just under 2.9

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.469 
a little bit more than just under 2.9
maybe<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.430> little<00:04:20.760> thicker<00:04:21.000> back<00:04:21.239> here

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
maybe a little thicker back here

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.240 
maybe a little thicker back here
actually

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
actually

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.530 
actually
yeah<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.300> just<00:04:23.420> over<00:04:23.630> three<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:25.180> actual<00:04:26.180> stock

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
yeah so just over three the actual stock

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.980 
yeah so just over three the actual stock
and<00:04:27.470> then<00:04:27.590> it's<00:04:27.710> got<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.040> full<00:04:28.310> flat<00:04:28.580> grind

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
and then it's got the full flat grind

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.060 
and then it's got the full flat grind
which<00:04:30.610> thins<00:04:31.610> out<00:04:31.820> this<00:04:32.060> way<00:04:32.240> as<00:04:32.390> well<00:04:32.770> as<00:04:33.770> well

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
which thins out this way as well as well

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.580 
which thins out this way as well as well
and<00:04:34.250> ends<00:04:34.340> down<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.120> very<00:04:35.690> good<00:04:35.960> piercing

see<00:05:13.700> on<00:05:13.730> custom<00:05:14.300> knife<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.720> wish<00:05:15.380> that<00:05:15.650> they

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
see on custom knife I wish that they

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.290 
see on custom knife I wish that they
would<00:05:15.919> have<00:05:16.070> followed<00:05:16.250> through<00:05:16.550> back<00:05:16.820> here

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
would have followed through back here

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.750 
would have followed through back here
because<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.470> doesn't<00:05:18.710> quite<00:05:19.070> have<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.460> same

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
because this doesn't quite have the same

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.310 
because this doesn't quite have the same
effect<00:05:20.830> as<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:22.640> does<00:05:22.820> over<00:05:23.090> there<00:05:23.270> but<00:05:23.630> but

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
effect as it does over there but but

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.580 
effect as it does over there but but
anyways<00:05:25.030> looks<00:05:26.030> good<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.720> quality<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.260> good

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
anyways looks good the quality is good

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.800 
anyways looks good the quality is good
everything<00:05:28.250> matches<00:05:29.150> up<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.480> fit<00:05:29.660> and

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
everything matches up the fit and

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.370 
everything matches up the fit and
finishes<00:05:30.260> you<00:05:30.380> would<00:05:30.530> say<00:05:30.770> is<00:05:31.330> spot-on<00:05:32.380> you

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
finishes you would say is spot-on you

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.720 
finishes you would say is spot-on you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
detent flies open locks up good I would

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.710 
detent flies open locks up good I would
definitely<00:05:40.370> recommend<00:05:40.460> this<00:05:40.880> knife<00:05:41.090> for<00:05:41.540> the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
definitely recommend this knife for the

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.130 
definitely recommend this knife for the

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
price point I think it's a pretty pretty
