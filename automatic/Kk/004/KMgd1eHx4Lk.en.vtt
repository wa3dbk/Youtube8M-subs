on YouTube a fellow by the name is robot

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.349 
on YouTube a fellow by the name is robot
rough<00:00:26.590> robot<00:00:26.980> has<00:00:27.130> ever<00:00:27.340> developed<00:00:27.910> but

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
rough robot has ever developed but

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.790 
rough robot has ever developed but
essentially<00:00:28.779> what<00:00:28.930> this<00:00:29.109> does<00:00:29.350> is<00:00:29.529> it<00:00:29.650> adds

turn<00:00:33.070> signal<00:00:33.489> assemblies<00:00:34.120> again<00:00:34.870> on<00:00:34.989> any

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
turn signal assemblies again on any

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200 
turn signal assemblies again on any
Vespa<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:36.220> anybody<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.550> has<00:00:36.790> that<00:00:37.000> bike

Vespa so anybody that has that bike

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.700 
Vespa so anybody that has that bike
realizes<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:37.809> those<00:00:38.050> turn<00:00:38.290> signals

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
realizes that those turn signals

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.860 
realizes that those turn signals
literally<00:00:39.070> all<00:00:39.250> they<00:00:39.430> do<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.870> illuminate

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
literally all they do is illuminate

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.120 
literally all they do is illuminate
yellow<00:00:41.140> when<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.410> hit<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.620> turn<00:00:41.800> signal

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
yellow when you hit the turn signal

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.130 
yellow when you hit the turn signal
switch<00:00:42.250> what<00:00:42.850> this<00:00:43.030> kit<00:00:43.270> does<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.840> it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
switch what this kit does is it

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.630 
switch what this kit does is it
basically<00:00:44.410> gives<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.829> red<00:00:45.100> running<00:00:45.430> lights

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
basically gives you red running lights

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.610 
basically gives you red running lights
and<00:00:45.910> each<00:00:46.030> one<00:00:46.239> of<00:00:46.329> those<00:00:46.390> turn<00:00:46.630> signals<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.530> if

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and each one of those turn signals so if

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.840 
and each one of those turn signals so if
you<00:00:47.710> kind<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:47.980> pan<00:00:48.219> down<00:00:48.460> you'll<00:00:48.700> see

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
you kind of pan down you'll see

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.280 
you kind of pan down you'll see
everything<00:00:49.059> that's<00:00:49.239> included<00:00:49.719> in<00:00:49.809> these<00:00:49.960> kits

you<00:01:00.820> know<00:01:00.910> our<00:01:01.149> beloved<00:01:01.510> robot<00:01:01.899> has<00:01:02.079> a<00:01:02.110> very

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
you know our beloved robot has a very

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.410 
you know our beloved robot has a very
detailed<00:01:02.590> installation<00:01:03.129> video<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:04.119> how<00:01:04.360> you

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
detailed installation video of how you

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.060 
detailed installation video of how you
install<00:01:04.899> these<00:01:05.049> on<00:01:05.259> any<00:01:05.350> Vespa<00:01:05.860> but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
install these on any Vespa but

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.590 
install these on any Vespa but
essentially<00:01:06.729> we<00:01:06.850> send<00:01:07.060> these<00:01:07.209> out<00:01:07.359> with<00:01:07.539> a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
essentially we send these out with a

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.779 
essentially we send these out with a
special<00:01:07.840> drill<00:01:08.319> bit<00:01:08.529> the<00:01:09.039> special<00:01:09.459> drill<00:01:09.670> bit

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
special drill bit the special drill bit

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.819 
special drill bit the special drill bit
is<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.029> exact<00:01:10.420> size<00:01:10.659> so<00:01:11.319> you<00:01:11.380> can<00:01:11.469> drill<00:01:11.799> a

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
is the exact size so you can drill a

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.830 
is the exact size so you can drill a
hole<00:01:12.039> in<00:01:12.219> your<00:01:12.310> turn<00:01:12.520> signal<00:01:12.880> assembly<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.719> be

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
hole in your turn signal assembly and be

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.080 
hole in your turn signal assembly and be
able<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:14.109> plug<00:01:14.439> this<00:01:15.100> bulb<00:01:15.459> holder<00:01:15.759> with<00:01:16.060> the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
able to plug this bulb holder with the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.319 
able to plug this bulb holder with the
red<00:01:16.359> LED<00:01:16.810> directly<00:01:17.319> into<00:01:17.649> it<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.340> again

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
red LED directly into it so again

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.760 
red LED directly into it so again
specific<00:01:20.200> drill<00:01:20.409> bit<00:01:20.590> for<00:01:22.109> the<00:01:23.109> actual<00:01:23.439> bulb

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
specific drill bit for the actual bulb

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.089 
specific drill bit for the actual bulb
socket<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.549> then<00:01:25.420> we<00:01:25.749> include<00:01:25.899> four<00:01:26.679> zip<00:01:26.889> ties

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:27.099 
socket and then we include four zip ties

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:29.039 
socket and then we include four zip ties
to<00:01:27.369> zip<00:01:27.549> tie<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.759> excess<00:01:28.299> wiring<00:01:28.509> out<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.959> the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
to zip tie the excess wiring out of the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.279 
to zip tie the excess wiring out of the
way<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.670> attaches<00:01:31.389> to<00:01:31.779> the<00:01:31.899> electrical

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:32.289 
way and this attaches to the electrical

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.349 
way and this attaches to the electrical
system<00:01:32.349> via<00:01:32.799> these<00:01:32.979> very<00:01:33.249> very<00:01:33.579> cool<00:01:33.849> posi

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
system via these very very cool posi

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.139 
system via these very very cool posi
locks<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.319> again<00:01:35.740> like<00:01:35.919> I<00:01:36.069> said<00:01:36.130> we<00:01:36.429> send<00:01:36.999> this

another<00:02:52.959> thing<00:02:53.200> about<00:02:53.379> these<00:02:53.560> if<00:02:53.769> you<00:02:53.859> wanted

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
another thing about these if you wanted

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.319 
another thing about these if you wanted
to<00:02:54.250> you<00:02:54.370> could<00:02:54.459> actually<00:02:54.609> tie<00:02:54.879> them<00:02:55.060> into<00:02:55.239> your

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
to you could actually tie them into your

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.270 
to you could actually tie them into your
brake<00:02:55.540> lights<00:02:55.780> for<00:02:55.989> example<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.889> not<00:02:57.099> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
brake lights for example and not the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.679 
brake lights for example and not the
running<00:02:57.459> lights<00:02:57.760> so<00:02:57.970> that<00:02:58.359> would<00:02:58.569> basically

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
running lights so that would basically

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.240 
running lights so that would basically
mean<00:02:59.109> that<00:02:59.169> when<00:02:59.439> you<00:02:59.470> hit<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.799> brake<00:03:00.040> light

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
mean that when you hit the brake light

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.099 
mean that when you hit the brake light
lever<00:03:00.489> they<00:03:00.939> would<00:03:01.090> illuminate<00:03:01.299> red<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.930> there

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
lever they would illuminate red in there

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.750 
lever they would illuminate red in there
as<00:03:02.230> well<00:03:02.439> if<00:03:02.889> that<00:03:03.069> was<00:03:03.250> your<00:03:03.370> ultimate
