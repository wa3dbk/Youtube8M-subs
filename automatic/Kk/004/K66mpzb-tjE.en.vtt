00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.020
Hello and welcome to today's lecture.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.280
The personality that we're going to talk about is called The Tank.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.320
Who is the Tank?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.020
This person tends to be overconfident.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.840
When his aims are put in jeopardy, he takes out all his anger on the person in front of him. 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.480
He has nothing personal against him, but there are 2 main purposes behind taking out his angry. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
The first one is that he wants something to be done in perfect time.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.760
The second one is that he wants it done in the best way.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.640
So, who is this person? We'll understand more through this video.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.080
Hello.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.980
How are you doing, man?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.360
Hey, buddy. I'm fine.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.320
Man, please don't forget about the phone.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.760
The phone? Yeah, don’t worry. I got this, man. Actually, I'm going to go get it right now.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:00.905
Please do. I'll leave it to you, all right? My work depends on it. I've borrowed my friend's phone to call you.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.560
Okay, don’t worry. I told you I've got this. In fact, I'm on my way to get it. I'll bet there in five minutes

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.780
All right. Thank you. Bye.

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:14.648
Three hours later.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.660
Come here, Abud. Here you are. Did you bring me the phone?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.860
What phone? Ohh! Eh no.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.580
Why didn't you bring the phone with you? 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.100
I left at th—

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.547
Didn't I remind you to bring it with you?

00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:42.667
Calm down. I left it at that place in Abu Rumaneh, but they didn't have bat—

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:47.747
What do you mean Abu Rumaneh? Did I say Abu Rumaneh? I told you to get it fixed in Albahsa.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.120
What can I do? I left it in Abu Rumaneh. They said they didn’t have any batteri—

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.100
Don’t make me hit you. What do you mean "what can I do"? I need to fix my phone.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
How else will I make phone calls? I have work to do. All my work's on hold!

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.169
Use a street phone.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.380
Enough, man, there's no need for all of this.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.060
Abd!

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.640
- I'm serious
- I'm about to kill you.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.484
I left it there. I swear.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.520
So what? Go get it, now.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.460
Hey, you better show some respect—

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.960
Enough already, I said go get it. Abd!

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.260
It's not my problem. Go find a solution yourself.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.940
Why did I leave it with you? So you would go get it for me!

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.560
- Make do without it.
- Dam—

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.360
There's nothing I can do. I went there, asked for a battery, they didn't have any, so I came back.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.940
Are you sure?

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.520
Yeah.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.260
And all my work will be put on hold without it?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.720
Yeah, whatever…

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.451
Get out of my face!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.360
As we've just seen, the Tank blew up at the person in front of him.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.980
The usual reactions are either we do the same thing, or we stay silent and get away from him.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.900
How to deal with this personality?

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.740
First I keep calm, breathe slowly and let him finish.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.660
Second, I interrupt him if he goes too far.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.760
So, I could simply say his name in the same pitch of voice,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.480
But without changing the tone or showing any aggression towards him.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.800
Third, I repeat the points that he has just said..

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.460
Because this will prove to him that I was completely listening to him and interested in his words.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.100
Fourth, I focus on the bottom line and give him my view on it.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.820
Finally, I should never close the door of making peace in the Tank's face.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.600
However, just a little note, if the Tank's accusations are true,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.260
I should immediately admit to my mistake and assure him that I will avoid committing it again in the future.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.680
This was all for today, but before concluding; let's take a look at this video.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.260
Here.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.340
To know what had happened, stay tuned for the next episode.
