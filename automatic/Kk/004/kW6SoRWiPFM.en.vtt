00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.950
 good my people this bad to rage you 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.510
 let's go a little bit quick here 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.200
 first that they presented in the event of 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.660
 apple was basically to statistics 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.789
 the iphone 5 already learned its first week 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 in 5 million copies if 5 million 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.990
 units sold additional to that there are 26 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.270
 it was the operating system we have accepted 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.730
 fastest of all time 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.430
 apple just released a new version 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.920
 of ibooks you can basically go down 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.750
 the pages as if it were a web page 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.059
 and you can share by facebook and by 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.660
 twitter or send by messages part of 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.300
 book 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 Here you can see three photos including if 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.350
 the iphone mini was revealed in the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.770
 next conference we are going to move to 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.570
 a new 13 inch pro macbook 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.110
 it's basically the same as the retina 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.580
 macbook pro of 15 but in 13 inches 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 has a not so large display retina 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.510
 like the 15 but has 2500 for the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 1800 additional retinal to that has 22 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 web ports and 3.0 has a hdmi has 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 max 62 etc. here you can see the new 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 mac mini if at last the mini mac got it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.920
 a little bit of love is basically what 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.570
 but we have new processors 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.680
 ivy additional bridge are in those 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.960
 new processors also have 4 and 9 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.280
 3.0 has a new sticker and everything 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.110
 wait for the mac mini starts at 599 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840
 clear as all previous machines 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.630
 now we move to the star of the show 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.580
 the imac here are all the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.810
 generations of plus but there's the 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.810
 beast basically the thinnest 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.780
 ridiculously thin to 19 that has a 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.770
 bridge processor 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.570
 and 7 has nothing 'retina display' pity 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.480
 but it has everything else that could 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.080
 wait and 3.7 cetera added that 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.240
 has a hard disk terra or three 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.070
 hard disk lands or what can you 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.720
 choose one of 783 additional gigabytes 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.820
 or you can use a new mix that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.120
 Paul made a combination of a 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.670
 exist and a classic disk in the SSD there 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.709
 128 say that there you can put all your 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.720
 operating system and your applications and 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.610
 on the disk or on the regular disk 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.320
 You can put all your desperation and it's 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.640
 smart so choose the things that 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.290
 they would go to each disc 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.680
 this would also work for the macro 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.250
 new additional to that the new man 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.050
 the new imac 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.780
 this brutal 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.780
 ok now we move to what I think 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.640
 that is really what was the most 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.540
 hard to everyone who bought a new 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.820
 ipad because let's be honest if six 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.640
 months you bought an ipad you do not have a 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.220
 new team can announce the fourth 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.580
 ipad generation basically the same 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.290
 that the new ipad 'retina display' all 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.350
 what can you expect previsional to that 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.750
 has an a6 x processor that gives you the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.460
 double of graph or whatever and dessert 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.880
 she had some impressive graphics 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.920
 imagine with an a6 x processor that's 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.310
 basically a qualcomm is going to have a 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.500
 additional ram guide to that has the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.840
 new line connector as you can expect 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.580
 the audio to poli is not going to come out is a 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.890
 new processor is a new connectors 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.080
 the redesign was a shame basically 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.350
 it looks the same simply that they change those 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.770
 ports and now we move to the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.940
 star of the show yes to what all 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:48.300
 they are waiting for the mini mac that you now 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.030
 I'm going to tell you that it's amazing me 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.550
 cancel the order I made of annex 7 and 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.130
 I'm going to wait for this baby basically 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.690
 It has the same design as the iphone 5 but 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.520
 larger 7.9 inch is not retina 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.070
 display but if you are going to see more pixels 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.340
 because it has the same dimension there is more 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:13.070
 resolution of an ipad2 only that more 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.300
 caught that is from an ipad 2 that 9.7 to 7.9 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.510
 work on more pixels and you will not have 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.640
 that download applications or opde and all 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.240
 the applications they had on your ipad 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.560
 They work the same for the new iPad mini 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.320
 I find that it is the best saiz contributed 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.890
 a lot of time to throw 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.280
 google tablet annex 7 can see by 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:39.460
 here 7.9 really that brutal super 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.130
 thin and they spent a lot of time 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.330
 going to Annex 7 as you can see 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:48.640
 here the black dark vader style 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.010
 is the one I want I do not want any more 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.050
 brutal headquarters nothing my people this went to 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.760
 give it to rage of any other 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.220
 question can you follow by twitter and I 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.010
 You can let me know my trip to Álex Rage 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.850
 alexander is with rage and nothing through 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.850
 let's continue next
