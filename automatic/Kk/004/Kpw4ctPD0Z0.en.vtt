00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.850
 I have found all of you are one and I bring you 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.319
 another tutorial of the cris john keats and 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.480
 Many of you asked me how 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.750
 merged two mods 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.589
 and for this what we have to do is 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.829
 have let's say the two many prepared 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.289
 in the data folder of skyrim I have 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:25.699
 here one of them civil war extend 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.949
 and cw test and the two are point is like 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:31.039
 you can see and what we are going to do is going to 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:36.460
 be having all the tickets already 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.460
 created that we want to merge 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 this tutorial is based mostly on 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.850
 the entries for example this from here is 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.470
 an entry what we are going to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.480
 do is going to be duplicate the entries 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.230
 before what we have to do is going to be 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.079
 and here we are going to select screen point 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.980
 It's ma 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.320
 we select the way that more entries 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.079
 have that in my case is to disclose 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.409
 extend and I can put it as 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.920
 activate file and we also open cw text 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.789
 here we are going to open three files 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 Well what are we gonna do us 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.770
 it's going to be when we open this one they're going to leave us 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.259
 the tickets just like we get here 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.810
 but without the asterisk this here is this 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.310
 asterisk means that this entry is 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.549
 part of the way we loaded here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.819
 up as this mode is as active 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.009
 file and all entries in this way 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.569
 they will appear with the asterisk in 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.209
 change those of this will appear 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.759
 like any of these here well 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.290
 Well I will load the mods will take 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.840
 a little bit 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.360
 but we'll see each other when when 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.430
 seized the mods 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.750
 Well guys, as you can see, I know 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.860
 they have loaded all the points and as 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 you can see I have here as a city asset 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.090
 Extended place which is what we had 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 put here that was like how 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.930
 active file well then now what 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.240
 let's do is going to be looking for the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.619
 files that the tickets sorry that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.459
 I had this mold here is cw test 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.099
 I will answer them now for 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.209
 this for this tutorial I'm going I've created 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.360
 I did this not because I needed it 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.680
 really in this mode there are some things 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.739
 I know I need but there are others that 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.840
 no but I have done it basically 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.299
 for this tutorial so good we're going to 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.930
 look for the tickets that we had to 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:39.210
 they were one of these is here 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.090
 cw first person are sugar action 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.950
 what we have to do to is 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.070
 this entry 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.920
 begins to be part of this way is going to 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.830
 be right click duplicates 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.349
 As you can see, it has doubled and a 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.900
 0 with an asterisk ye have 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.750
 set here a 0 comes out simply if in 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.739
 this album because it says because 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:07.380
 basically this mode is this entry is 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.170
 otherwise not from the civil war is 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.030
 extend well then I will look for the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.380
 other tickets 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.280
 this one here was double 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.890
 and he's here too 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.830
 Well, as you can see here, it has 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.430
 duplicate 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 Let's see 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.290
 they are different 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.600
 as you see here it has doubled we have 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.450
 duplicate too 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.840
 these are these two entries that the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.350
 mod and this one is here right click 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.360
 duplicate as you see everything everything that 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.160
 we have doubled begins to be part 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.810
 in this way another asterisk does not come out 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.120
 which means that we can save because 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.440
 there are new things 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.570
 we keep and then when we open this 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.930
 mode will appear 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.990
 this as part of the mod and they will disappear 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.430
 these two others here because these 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.590
 they belong to another way that we do not 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.760
 we have also loaded for you to see 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.760
 I have created a new cell 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.479
 here we have it the asterisk does not appear 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:27.000
 as we have here because this way 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.400
 part of the other way and as exposed to 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.500
 aktiv there is the civil war is tender 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.949
 do not know the asterisks in the tickets 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.780
 Of that girl, here was the only thing that 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.580
 we have to do we can open the no 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.449
 we can open it this is simply a 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.629
 d duplication 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.449
 of an excel simply right click to 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.400
 duplicate the already is already beginning to form 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.910
 part d 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.940
 receive war extend and well this is 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.039
 just how to merge mods is 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.949
 pretty simple the biggest problem comes 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.930
 to be when we have two modes that 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.570
 they have too many entries that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.180
 simply what I advise you is that 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.180
 you go for example to one of these to a 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.270
 a box of these is that meshal the 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.310
 name in English and in Spanish you get 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.770
 any of these or directly 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.020
 take all of them and duplicate the 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.580
 they duplicate all so well these and the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.890
 tutorial today I hope that I have you 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.180
 liked and served you so good 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.330
 thank you very much for watching the video and we 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.330
 we see
