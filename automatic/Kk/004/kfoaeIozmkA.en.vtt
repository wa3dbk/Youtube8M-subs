 we lay out if we sow a beam under 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.970
 first winter 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.750
 we keep planting material as 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.630
 spring he was us just not there but lay 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 second we get the covenant in time then

 2-3 weeks earlier than at spring 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.320
 sowing 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.900
 Separately sort the average and more 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.119
 large bulbs for spring planting and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.250
 here will lie Leonid March depends on

 preferably two to three weeks before 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.940
 the onset of stable frosts of this 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 there will be enough time for the onions 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.740
 rooted but did not have time to germinate 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.590
 do rare at a distance of 20 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.700
 centimeters onion planted after 5-7 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.140
 centimeters apart but the weight is very 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.560
 it is important to comply
