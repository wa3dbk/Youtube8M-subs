00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.350 

so<00:00:01.439> I've<00:00:01.560> just<00:00:01.589> installed<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.610> equal<00:00:03.120> one

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
so I've just installed a equal one

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.900 
so I've just installed a equal one
protein<00:00:04.020> skimmer<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.890> side<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.029> this<00:00:07.020> some

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:07.910 
protein skimmer on the side of this some

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.330 
protein skimmer on the side of this some
Sequeira<00:00:09.200> and<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.290> really<00:00:10.740> believe<00:00:11.040> these<00:00:11.280> are

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
Sequeira and I really believe these are

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.730 
Sequeira and I really believe these are
the<00:00:11.550> best<00:00:12.059> value<00:00:12.750> protein<00:00:13.320> skimmer<00:00:13.620> on<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
the best value protein skimmer on the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.279 
the best value protein skimmer on the
market<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.910> bubble<00:00:15.269> consistency<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
market the bubble consistency is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.920 
market the bubble consistency is
absolutely<00:00:16.980> phenomenal<00:00:17.779> considering<00:00:18.779> these

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
absolutely phenomenal considering these

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.370 
absolutely phenomenal considering these
skimmers<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.189> cheap<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> amount<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
skimmers are so cheap the amount of

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.200 
skimmers are so cheap the amount of
money<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.680> pay<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:22.949> them<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.519> unbelievable

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
money you pay for them is unbelievable

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.450 
money you pay for them is unbelievable
value<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.230> hook<00:00:25.439> them<00:00:25.590> onto<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> side<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
value so you hook them onto the side and

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
value so you hook them onto the side and
then<00:00:26.550> basically<00:00:26.970> what<00:00:27.150> happens<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.410> water

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
then basically what happens is the water

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.830 
then basically what happens is the water
goes<00:00:29.039> through<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.609> goes<00:00:30.090> through<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> inside

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
goes through the goes through the inside

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.819 
goes through the goes through the inside
then<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.120> channels<00:00:33.120> its<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.660> I'll<00:00:34.590> just

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
then it channels its way up I'll just

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.299 
then it channels its way up I'll just
turn<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.219> off<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> can<00:00:35.880> see<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:37.129> so<00:00:38.129> if<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
turn it off so you can see it so if I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.369 
turn it off so you can see it so if I
turn<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.670> off<00:00:38.850> you'll<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> bubbles

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
turn it off you'll see all the bubbles

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
turn it off you'll see all the bubbles
go<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> surface<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.670> you'll<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
go to the surface and you'll see the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
go to the surface and you'll see the
water<00:00:42.840> comes<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> bottom<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.000> spins

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
water comes in at the bottom and spins

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.110 
water comes in at the bottom and spins
up<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.360> tube<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> inside<00:00:46.520> then<00:00:47.520> spins

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
up a tube on the inside then spins

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
up a tube on the inside then spins
around<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.719> outside<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.559> goes<00:00:49.739> back<00:00:49.980> down

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
around the outside and goes back down

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.660 
around the outside and goes back down
again<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.660> reverse<00:00:52.079> venturi<00:00:52.920> protein

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
again so it's a reverse venturi protein

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.430 
again so it's a reverse venturi protein
skimmer<00:00:54.530> vortex<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> design<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.170> very

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
skimmer vortex and the design is very

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.520 
skimmer vortex and the design is very
simple<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> water<00:00:59.940> comes<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> spins

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
simple so the water comes in it spins

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.680 
simple so the water comes in it spins
all<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.969> spins<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
all the way up and then spins all the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420 
all the way up and then spins all the
way<00:01:03.809> back<00:01:04.019> down<00:01:04.229> again<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.559> escapes<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
way back down again and escapes from the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.480 
way back down again and escapes from the
bottom<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> aquarium

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
bottom out into the aquarium

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
bottom out into the aquarium
so<00:01:08.490> therefore<00:01:09.110> it's<00:01:10.110> extremely<00:01:10.320> large

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
so therefore it's extremely large

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.230 
so therefore it's extremely large
contact<00:01:11.880> time<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> bubbles<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.729> bond<00:01:15.000> any

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
contact time for the bubbles to bond any

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
contact time for the bubbles to bond any
organics<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> water<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
organics that are in the water and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
organics that are in the water and
basically<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> bubbles<00:01:18.270> propel<00:01:18.720> their<00:01:18.930> way

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
basically the bubbles propel their way

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
basically the bubbles propel their way
up<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:20.009> any<00:01:20.250> organics<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> they've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
up with any organics that they've

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.710 
up with any organics that they've
actually<00:01:21.390> bonded<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.479> turn

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
actually bonded and then so just turn

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.940 
actually bonded and then so just turn
that<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.110> again<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:28.320> basically<00:01:28.770> it's

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
that back on again so basically it's

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.929 
that back on again so basically it's
like<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.130> whirlpool<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:30.509> comes<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.939> then

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
like a whirlpool that comes up and then

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
like a whirlpool that comes up and then
if<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.570> restrict<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.259> outlet<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.890> there's<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
if you restrict the outlet so there's a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.760 
if you restrict the outlet so there's a
little<00:01:35.250> valve<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.869> turn<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.229> Valve

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
little valve here if I turn that Valve

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.460 
little valve here if I turn that Valve
closed<00:01:38.369> shut<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.820> valve<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.509> bit<00:01:39.659> then

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
closed shut that valve a little bit then

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
closed shut that valve a little bit then
the<00:01:41.310> water<00:01:41.579> can't<00:01:41.880> escape<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.509> quickly<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the water can't escape as quickly and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
the water can't escape as quickly and
the<00:01:43.860> level<00:01:44.250> will<00:01:44.430> rise<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.600> neck<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the level will rise in the neck of the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.670 
the level will rise in the neck of the
skimmer<00:01:46.470> now<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> aim<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> ensure<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
skimmer now the aim is to ensure that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.719 
skimmer now the aim is to ensure that
the<00:01:50.310> bubbles<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:51.119> white<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.950> skimmer<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the bubbles are white in the skimmer and

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.240 
the bubbles are white in the skimmer and
if<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> bubbles<00:01:54.810> start<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> form<00:01:55.320> yellows<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
if the bubbles start to form yellows and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.609 
if the bubbles start to form yellows and
browns<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> blacks<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.899> want<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> yellows

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
browns and blacks you want the yellows

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
browns and blacks you want the yellows
Browns<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.280> blacks<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.790> make<00:01:59.969> their<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.329> out

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
Browns and blacks to make their way out

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
Browns and blacks to make their way out
into<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.229> collection<00:02:01.590> cup<00:02:01.979> once<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> starts

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
into this collection cup once it starts

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.670 
into this collection cup once it starts
collecting<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.170> pull<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.469> whole

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
collecting you can just pull this whole

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.889 
collecting you can just pull this whole
lid<00:02:04.950> off<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> when<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.210> cleaning<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.719> lid

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
lid off and when you're cleaning the lid

it's<00:02:10.660> also<00:02:10.900> important<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> connect<00:02:12.010> onto<00:02:12.370> here

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
it's also important to connect onto here

you<00:02:25.930> can<00:02:26.080> run<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.320> scheme<00:02:26.560> all<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> time<00:02:27.160> if

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
you can run the scheme all the time if

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.410 
you can run the scheme all the time if
you<00:02:28.270> do<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.570> an<00:02:28.660> aquarium<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:31.000> would

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
you do have an aquarium and I would

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.680 
you do have an aquarium and I would
recommend<00:02:32.640> running<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.850> skimmer<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.330> a<00:02:34.360> time

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
recommend running the skimmer on a time

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.140 
recommend running the skimmer on a time
at<00:02:34.930> nighttime<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.710> not<00:02:36.130> during<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.490> day<00:02:36.550> the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
at nighttime and not during the day the

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000 
at nighttime and not during the day the
reason<00:02:37.330> why<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.660> would<00:02:37.960> do<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
reason why I would do that is that a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.540 
reason why I would do that is that a
skimmer

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
skimmer

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.880 
skimmer
is<00:02:39.760> run<00:02:40.570> straight<00:02:40.960> on<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.230> agreement<00:02:41.500> self

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
is run straight on the agreement self

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.310 
is run straight on the agreement self
will<00:02:42.040> create<00:02:42.280> micro<00:02:42.670> bubbles<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:43.870> hate

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
will create micro bubbles and I hate

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.650 
will create micro bubbles and I hate
micro<00:02:44.770> bubbles<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:46.120> therefore<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.570> you're

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
micro bubbles so therefore if you're

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.540 
micro bubbles so therefore if you're
going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.900> dose<00:02:47.080> products<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.710> npx<00:02:48.280> that

going to dose products like npx that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.110 
going to dose products like npx that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
require a protein skimmer you can dose

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880 
require a protein skimmer you can dose
the<00:02:52.330> product<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> morning<00:02:53.260> oh<00:02:53.350> sorry<00:02:53.740> at

that 12 hour or eight hour period it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.590 
that 12 hour or eight hour period it
will<00:02:58.690> be<00:02:58.750> absolutely<00:02:59.230> fine<00:02:59.730> then<00:03:00.730> during<00:03:01.480> the

daytime or just if you're viewing the
aquarium<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.510> can<00:03:04.540> ensure<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.080> skimmers<00:03:05.410> off

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
aquarium you can ensure the skimmers off

setting<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:10.960> skin<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.410> very<00:03:11.620> easy<00:03:11.860> all<00:03:12.070> I

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
setting up this skin was very easy all I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.000 
setting up this skin was very easy all I
did<00:03:12.400> was<00:03:12.550> plug<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.420> pump<00:03:13.660> into<00:03:13.990> it<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.980> sure

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
did was plug the pump into it make sure

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.590 
did was plug the pump into it make sure
the<00:03:15.190> air<00:03:15.520> line<00:03:15.810> was<00:03:16.810> on<00:03:16.990> the<00:03:17.140> pump<00:03:17.970> then<00:03:18.970> I<00:03:19.209> just

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
the air line was on the pump then I just

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.230 
the air line was on the pump then I just
turned<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.200> on<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:21.190> filled<00:03:21.520> itself<00:03:21.910> up<00:03:22.090> with

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
turned it on it filled itself up with

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.270 
turned it on it filled itself up with
water<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.720> flowing<00:03:23.440> back<00:03:23.709> in<00:03:23.890> through<00:03:24.130> those

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
water and flowing back in through those

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.280 
water and flowing back in through those
sponges<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.060> make<00:03:25.270> sure<00:03:25.300> those<00:03:25.570> sponges<00:03:26.080> stay

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
sponges so make sure those sponges stay

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.930 
sponges so make sure those sponges stay
clean

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
clean

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.910 
clean
so<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.000> don't<00:03:28.330> um<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.200> it<00:03:29.350> doesn't<00:03:29.620> protrude

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
so you don't um so it doesn't protrude

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.560 
so you don't um so it doesn't protrude
the<00:03:30.040> water<00:03:30.310> going<00:03:30.520> out<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.940> skimmer<00:03:31.240> and

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
the water going out of the skimmer and

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
the water going out of the skimmer and
cause<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.230> to<00:03:32.440> overflow<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:34.380> you've<00:03:35.380> got

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
cause this to overflow and you've got

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.250 
cause this to overflow and you've got
yourself<00:03:36.040> one<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.300> best<00:03:37.480> value<00:03:37.870> protein

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
yourself one of the best value protein

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.380 
yourself one of the best value protein
skimmers<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.770> challenge<00:03:39.250> anyone<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.670> make<00:03:40.120> one

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
skimmers I challenge anyone to make one

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.120 
skimmers I challenge anyone to make one
the<00:03:40.630> price<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.800> aqua<00:03:42.459> lund<00:03:42.640> sell<00:03:42.910> them<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:45.100> I

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
the price that aqua lund sell them so I

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.760 
the price that aqua lund sell them so I
think<00:03:45.280> they're<00:03:45.550> just<00:03:45.700> fabulous<00:03:46.090> value<00:03:46.660> as<00:03:47.020> I

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
think they're just fabulous value as I

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.830 
think they're just fabulous value as I
said<00:03:47.980> there's<00:03:48.190> probably<00:03:48.610> better<00:03:49.300> skimmers<00:03:49.720> on

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
said there's probably better skimmers on

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.140 
said there's probably better skimmers on
the<00:03:49.930> market<00:03:50.350> but<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.700> money<00:03:51.910> you're

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the market but for the money you're

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.600 
the market but for the money you're
paying<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.860> don't<00:03:53.860> think<00:03:54.070> anything<00:03:54.400> comes

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
paying I don't think anything comes

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.360 
paying I don't think anything comes
close<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.330> if<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.500> skimmer<00:03:56.860> isn't

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
close and if this skimmer isn't

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.370 
close and if this skimmer isn't
performing<00:03:57.850> enough<00:03:58.270> for<00:03:58.450> what<00:03:58.570> you<00:03:58.750> need<00:03:59.050> just

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
performing enough for what you need just

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.699 
performing enough for what you need just
get<00:03:59.980> another<00:04:00.220> one<00:04:00.340> they're<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:00.880> cheap

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
get another one they're so cheap

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.130 
get another one they're so cheap
and<00:04:02.709> away<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.950> go
