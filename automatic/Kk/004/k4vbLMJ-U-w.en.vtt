00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 but 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.459
 the story of Charterer 10 in 1974 as the automaker uses one 

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:34.410
 sporty coupÃ© study presented 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.960
 according to the time and fashion the designers registered a car 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.110
 hatchback 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.110
 the FARC Bexten should address particularly young customers 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 Thus, sportiness was in the foreground 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.330
 the big radiator grille and the so popular v8 engine could not be missing 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.810
 the standard model of the charter came on the market in 1966 and corresponded 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.030
 as far as possible of the study 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.600
 the platforms and some bodywork came from the Dodge 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.460
 Charger with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 less for the time were also the four individual seats 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.320
 the rear two were foldable leaving the coupe a huge one 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 Boot volume he flees 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.780
 Especially nice was the cockpit for the first models 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.509
 so that it also sporty on the streets precede were several v8 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:29.990
 Engines to choose from 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.440
 318 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.910
 360 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.860
 383 there are 426 team of the TSV 18 minute clock 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.360
 this one to watch here is a 360 watch burning at the beginning 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.369
 The manufacturer German was very quickly the opinion that the first 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.590
 Batch l too cumbersome and not athletic enough seemed 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.610
 So in 1968, just two years later, a whole new design came on board 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:59.480
 the market 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 it should be even sleeker than its predecessor 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:25.049
 The only states in the world belonged to the so-called Master Kaos 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.789
 around 700 to find 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:29.849
 Art in classic OS vehicles 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.659
 the first models were not only the most popular but also success 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.259
 the sales could be in the year 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.259
 never be reached again 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.199
 Slowly pass against this mass career 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.090
 he combines comfort as a sporty car 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.780
 and due to harder emission laws gates off the Charger 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.209
 in the eighties 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.329
 the Charter merely as designation of a copy variant 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.849
 it also reminded that he had to save his life
