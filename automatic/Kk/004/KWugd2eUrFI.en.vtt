00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.150
 Hi girls 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.940
 then the video I am making today is a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.029
 video about with loved ones with to put 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.580
 in the pole position of important videos 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.300
 and therefore I advise you to see it vi 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.279
 i want to talk about acres gel that is a 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.560
 practically method used for 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.540
 being able to merge together what is 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.610
 the gel is what the acrylic is 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.550
 You can make gels as you know it is 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.829
 possible to make acrylic is possible to do 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.500
 the acrylic frame and then do the 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.000
 gel above I recommend but the opposite 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.059
 because in any case the acrylic is a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.710
 heavier material than gel instead 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.890
 acrylic is an elastic material 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.449
 instead, rigid breast is still good to do 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.330
 possibly the acrylic structure 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.030
 under angel above but not vice versa 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.159
 this is something I advise you against 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.750
 then in some houses photos of the tests are 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.960
 sincere but still upright 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.840
 but I've always been taught to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.540
 avoid precisely what is there 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.970
 I explained before however it is possible 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.680
 being able to combine this method with that 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.380
 precisely I want to go to show a 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.540
 method that I recommend if you are 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.340
 used to work the gel you do not have 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.260
 therefore still familiar with 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.890
 acrylic that a method completely 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.490
 different and allows you, however, let's say 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.200
 will initiate a little bit more resistance 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.580
 so however where you are dealing 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.070
 with humiliation that maybe was gold 1 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.300
 it can happen that the gel does not hold up 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 well you can try doing this method 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.910
 because it could go to give you precisely 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.220
 success and what we need to succeed in 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.350
 do this method here we will need the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.820
 our practically usual gel then 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.330
 anyway in this case I'm going to go 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.729
 to use a monophasic but you can do it 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.370
 also with the gel builder so anyway 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.819
 you have preceded a basic gel first 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.800
 you will be followed with a polishing gel in 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.810
 this case instead used in monophasic 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.550
 normally use single phase yellow c very much 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.160
 very dense as a man been at other times 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:28.900
 especially now that they make 40 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.790
 in degrees however that already the sense that it is of 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.290
 medium density no matter why 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.180
 however I can method we can do it 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.370
 quietly the same we prepare a 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.050
 nail to ours in our usual 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.120
 so it changes absolutely nothing 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.410
 we put our preparation DVDs 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.660
 that we are used to using 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.610
 the only thing if we went to use 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.150
 a three-phase we would have applied anyway 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.850
 first the basic gel ok we mark use 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.860
 monophasic instead we can afford to 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.130
 do the application this way 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.130
 here I will show you we can do 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.340
 with this method also the eventual 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.130
 stretching and obviously when we go 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.220
 to use acrylic we have to go to 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.290
 use a brush suitable for acrylic but 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.900
 because we love to immerse it in the monomer 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.000
 that the liquid is helping us 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.370
 practically then to model what 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.270
 it is the critical dust that this is 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.610
 here we see in this jar 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.110
 this is a particular method because 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.970
 let's go and merge together what is 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.660
 the gel is what the acrylic 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.000
 so let's do a method we say molten 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.740
 together then let's go and get that 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.940
 which is the gel but now let's go and get it 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:51.310
 the totality of what it is instead 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:53.890
 the acrylic ok then let's go and see 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.900
 I took the type so anyway vi 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.730
 I show you what to do though 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.070
 quietly you can with this 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.200
 method also go stretch you will have to 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.590
 take the one that has a ball of 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.030
 gel as we are used to take 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.209
 again to do before going to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.230
 structure reprimands rafa stretching e 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.910
 it will be enough to puccia we say that it is not a 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.410
 correct Italian but in short it does us 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.890
 understand what we need to do 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.470
 this little ball in what the dust 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.300
 acrylic you see that it becomes transparent 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.320
 and becomes the one who has about 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.030
 consistency precisely from our acrylic 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.729
 the advantage, however, that we should not 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.939
 go for an acrylic modeling 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:41.089
 but we will have the structure that can be 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:44.089
 modeled these two gels exclusively 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:49.150
 but methods that blend together there 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.150
 they go to give the hammock we say 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:55.849
 flexibility of the gel because it is gel 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:59.629
 and flexible and what is instead the 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.059
 hardness or a little more resistance 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:04.370
 of what the knit I see it 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:07.779
 simply extended I could long king 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.830
 I could do what I wanted 

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:11.960
 do the cambering right now 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.669
 everything is with atp it's hard for me to do 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.749
 see but I'm going to let you see again 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.729
 the important thing is that the powder does not 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:26.539
 remain unmelted within the gel 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:29.229
 so anyway let's go and put this down 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:32.800
 method and also makes you gel anyway 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.539
 even more consistent so maybe if 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.120
 you have mistakenly taken a consistency 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:42.020
 average you have a hard time working it or now 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.899
 fatigue is greater with heat 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.029
 you can safely blend together 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:49.459
 these two methods also to help you 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:52.459
 to work better because when it's hot 

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:56.479
 unfortunately, how thick it is 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:59.419
 really hot and thriving himself 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.039
 you have seen it is very easy therefore not 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.289
 we use yellow exactly as we are 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.120
 used to using these methods though 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.770
 together you don't even see anyway 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.069
 because you see it possible that I end up 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
 I added the acrylic powder to it 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:15.559
 added because they also cost manual 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:20.800
 but he came to give you some of it 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:23.149
 sorry account in any resistance e 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.509
 cling more on a nail than 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:31.279
 maybe it's just gel makes it hard to 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:34.879
 hold on ok so definitely the one 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:38.330
 which of course is advice but a lot 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:40.189
 very let's say valid crossover 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:42.050
 obviously the one who has a good gel with 

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.399
 a good acrylic powder have it 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.050
 said to cross what can be 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:47.329
 a valid gel with a clinical powder 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.050
 poor because in any case also there and being able to 

00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:51.169
 strict 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:54.139
 trani instead of obviously resistance 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:57.650
 so I recommend paired and two 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.030
 good products is not important that if 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.849
 not from the same brand as long as 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.789
 however they are valid brands 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.889
 ok the girls would say to have told you 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.500
 all 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.889
 remember that you can safely 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.960
 structuring long natural cover 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.639
 stretch a bit to make a point on a game 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.500
 with effort you can create a stretch 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.330
 on a map that is you can do 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:24.669
 exactly what you want with this 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:27.800
 method and you will have greater resistance 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:32.509
 so maybe in those nails that 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:35.000
 they are very heavily exploited or not 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.919
 we have what can be the 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.930
 habitual resistance of the other long ones 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:41.539
 I'm collegial, try to blend 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.639
 together gel and acrylic in this way 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:46.789
 you will see that you will have more results more 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:49.370
 satisfying the girls I send you a 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:51.680
 kiss and saw the period because still 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.460
 she didn't go on vacation and I also wish him 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.419
 Happy holidays 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.419
 hello to all
