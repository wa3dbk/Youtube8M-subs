00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.780 

so<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:15.590> concept<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.979> sandwiches<00:01:16.460> on<00:01:16.640> one

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
so the concept of sandwiches on one

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.600 
so the concept of sandwiches on one
circle<00:01:17.150> is<00:01:17.330> wrapping<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.350> blank<00:01:18.620> with<00:01:19.370> a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
circle is wrapping the blank with a

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.570 
circle is wrapping the blank with a
high-density<00:01:20.540> foam<00:01:21.110> skin<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:24.580> laminating

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
high-density foam skin and laminating

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.760 
high-density foam skin and laminating
either<00:01:25.820> side<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.540> so<00:01:27.350> your<00:01:27.500> basic

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
either side of that and so your basic

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.710 
either side of that and so your basic
spacing<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> laminates<00:01:28.729> apart<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.240> 30<00:01:29.420> space

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
spacing the laminates apart and 30 space

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.940 
spacing the laminates apart and 30 space
of<00:01:29.869> apartness<00:01:30.200> difference<00:01:30.650> going<00:01:30.800> to<00:01:30.860> be

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
of apartness difference going to be

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.770 
of apartness difference going to be
similar<00:01:31.520> on<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.759> i-beam<00:01:32.240> we<00:01:32.360> might<00:01:32.509> see<00:01:32.690> in

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
similar on the i-beam we might see in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.910 
similar on the i-beam we might see in
constructions<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.960> what<00:01:36.140> we<00:01:36.229> basically<00:01:36.440> do<00:01:36.710> is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
constructions so what we basically do is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.609 
constructions so what we basically do is
take<00:01:37.610> our<00:01:37.850> EPS<00:01:38.240> blank<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.720> wrap<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.530> in

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
take our EPS blank and wrap it in

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.969 
take our EPS blank and wrap it in
high-density<00:01:39.920> foam<00:01:41.560> starting<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.650> create<00:01:42.950> a

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the lemonade born five-millimeter issued

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.290 
the lemonade born five-millimeter issued

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.690 

we<00:02:02.840> add<00:02:03.080> an<00:02:03.290> epoxy<00:02:03.560> resin<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:04.190> a<00:02:04.220> foaming

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
we add an epoxy resin with a foaming

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.969 
we add an epoxy resin with a foaming
editor<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:07.660> get<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> better<00:02:08.930> bond<00:02:09.229> between<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
editor to get a better bond between the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.370 
editor to get a better bond between the
two<00:02:10.010> foam<00:02:10.670> surfaces<00:02:11.450> because<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.320> imagine

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
two foam surfaces because if you imagine

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.110 
two foam surfaces because if you imagine
clears<00:02:13.010> up<00:02:13.190> they're<00:02:13.370> quite<00:02:13.550> coarse<00:02:13.820> or<00:02:14.000> not

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
clears up they're quite coarse or not

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.780 
clears up they're quite coarse or not
that<00:02:14.300> smooth<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.500> allows<00:02:15.740> resin<00:02:16.130> to

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
that smooth and so that allows resin to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.610 
that smooth and so that allows resin to
really<00:02:17.030> lock<00:02:17.210> into<00:02:17.540> this<00:02:17.660> these<00:02:18.440> two

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
really lock into this these two

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.930 
really lock into this these two
structures<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.220> bring<00:02:19.400> them<00:02:19.550> together<00:02:19.670> with

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
structures and bring them together with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:03:05.809 
structures and bring them together with
a<00:02:20.090> flame<00:02:20.480> layer<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.720> between

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.370 

so<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:06.970> shaping<00:03:07.209> stage<00:03:07.569> we<00:03:07.870> still<00:03:08.080> call<00:03:08.260> this

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
so the shaping stage we still call this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.990 
so the shaping stage we still call this
joking<00:03:08.620> but<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> better<00:03:09.250> description<00:03:09.640> would<00:03:09.880> be

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
joking but a better description would be

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:22.380 
joking but a better description would be
cleaning<00:03:10.300> up<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:11.050> CNC<00:03:11.530> shake<00:03:11.800> blank

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.640 

so<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.480> main<00:03:23.630> thing<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.900> need<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.140> do<00:03:24.260> here<00:03:24.470> is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
so the main thing I need to do here is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.080 
so the main thing I need to do here is
to<00:03:24.830> shape<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.190> tack<00:03:25.430> into<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.820> bottom

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
to shape the tack into the bottom

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.330 
to shape the tack into the bottom
sandwich<00:03:26.510> that's<00:03:26.990> being<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.470> tack<00:03:27.680> edge<00:03:27.920> and

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
sandwich that's being the tack edge and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.730 
sandwich that's being the tack edge and
then<00:03:28.550> feed<00:03:28.760> that<00:03:28.790> back<00:03:29.060> into<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.510> route

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.140 

one<00:03:35.740> thing<00:03:36.010> here<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.580> get<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.000> good

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
one thing here is to get a really good

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.120 
one thing here is to get a really good
transition<00:03:37.390> back<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.080> into<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.410> route<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:39.010> get

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
transition back up into the route to get

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.280 
transition back up into the route to get
up<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:39.340> performing<00:03:39.760> as<00:03:39.849> designed<00:03:40.209> then<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
up on performing as designed then the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.660 
up on performing as designed then the
next<00:03:41.500> thing<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.739> do<00:03:41.830> is<00:03:41.920> clean<00:03:42.160> up<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> machine

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
next thing to do is clean up the machine

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.000 
next thing to do is clean up the machine
marks<00:03:42.940> on<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.360> blank<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.780> get<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.770> all<00:03:44.890> there

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
marks on the blank and get it all there

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.350 
marks on the blank and get it all there
before<00:03:45.340> putting<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> Dex<00:03:46.239> image<00:03:46.480> on<00:03:48.180> deck<00:03:49.180> set

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
before putting the Dex image on deck set

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.720 
before putting the Dex image on deck set
which<00:03:49.450> needs<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.690> be<00:03:49.780> cut<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.140> size<00:03:50.319> and<00:03:50.730> then

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
which needs to be cut to size and then

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.900 
which needs to be cut to size and then
needs<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.270> be<00:03:52.360> darted<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.440> slits<00:03:54.430> taken<00:03:54.790> out

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
needs to be darted and slits taken out

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.220 
needs to be darted and slits taken out
of<00:03:54.940> its<00:03:55.120> layout<00:03:55.390> be<00:03:55.569> wrapped<00:03:55.810> around<00:03:55.959> the

of its layout be wrapped around the
three-dimensional<00:03:56.950> shape<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.160> XM<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.519> needs

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
three-dimensional shape the XM is needs

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.839 
three-dimensional shape the XM is needs
to<00:04:00.850> be<00:04:01.000> bonded<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.019> deck<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.290> rails<00:04:02.849> we

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
to be bonded to the deck and rails we

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.460 
to be bonded to the deck and rails we
use<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.000> mixture<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.510> glass<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.200> two<00:04:05.319> different

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
use a mixture of glass and two different

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.090 
use a mixture of glass and two different
weights<00:04:05.800> carbon<00:04:06.340> fiber<00:04:06.610> and<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:08.290> high<00:04:08.470> load

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
weights carbon fiber and the high load

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.180 
weights carbon fiber and the high load
areas<00:04:09.510> such<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:10.540> heels<00:04:11.200> mass<00:04:11.620> track<00:04:11.890> area

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
areas such as heels mass track area

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.920 
areas such as heels mass track area
we'll<00:04:12.580> put<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> double<00:04:13.150> layer<00:04:13.360> but<00:04:13.690> then<00:04:13.810> we'll

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
we'll put a double layer but then we'll

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.349 
we'll put a double layer but then we'll
actually<00:04:14.200> put<00:04:14.319> that<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.620> 45<00:04:15.250> degrees<00:04:15.549> so

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
actually put that on 45 degrees so

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.520 
actually put that on 45 degrees so
you've<00:04:16.479> got<00:04:16.600> glass<00:04:16.750> fibers<00:04:17.139> running<00:04:17.410> in

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
you've got glass fibers running in

the<00:05:20.869> vacuuming<00:05:21.349> the<00:05:21.529> PVC<00:05:22.249> decks<00:05:22.489> damaged<00:05:22.789> on

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:22.999 
the vacuuming the PVC decks damaged on

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.179 
the vacuuming the PVC decks damaged on
to<00:05:23.599> the<00:05:23.719> board<00:05:23.929> text<00:05:24.319> placed<00:05:24.529> on<00:05:24.649> what<00:05:24.919> we<00:05:25.009> call

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
to the board text placed on what we call

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.919 
to the board text placed on what we call
a<00:05:25.219> table<00:05:25.639> which<00:05:25.789> is<00:05:25.819> essentially<00:05:26.299> a<00:05:26.419> half<00:05:26.659> mole

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:26.929 
a table which is essentially a half mole

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:30.309 
a table which is essentially a half mole
so<00:05:27.739> it's<00:05:28.179> has<00:05:29.179> the<00:05:29.329> bottom<00:05:29.629> shape<00:05:29.899> machined

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
so it's has the bottom shape machined

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.199 
so it's has the bottom shape machined
into<00:05:30.559> it<00:05:30.739> using<00:05:30.919> the<00:05:31.129> CNC<00:05:31.489> machine<00:05:31.759> so<00:05:32.059> it

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:32.209 
into it using the CNC machine so it

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:33.789 
into it using the CNC machine so it
guarantees<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:32.689> the<00:05:32.959> perfect<00:05:33.379> bottle<00:05:33.649> shape

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:33.799 
guarantees that the perfect bottle shape

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:36.699 
guarantees that the perfect bottle shape
and<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:35.029> also<00:05:35.149> allows<00:05:35.479> us<00:05:35.509> to<00:05:35.719> use<00:05:35.989> quite<00:05:36.529> high

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:36.709 
and it also allows us to use quite high

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:38.199 
and it also allows us to use quite high
pressures<00:05:37.129> if<00:05:37.429> you<00:05:37.579> use<00:05:37.699> higher<00:05:37.879> pressure<00:05:38.119> and

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:38.209 
pressures if you use higher pressure and

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:39.850 
pressures if you use higher pressure and
you<00:05:38.329> better<00:05:38.539> vacuum<00:05:38.959> stages<00:05:39.439> you<00:05:39.829> can

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
you better vacuum stages you can

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.679 
you better vacuum stages you can
actually<00:05:40.219> get<00:05:40.339> away<00:05:40.549> with<00:05:40.729> slightly<00:05:41.479> less

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:41.689 
actually get away with slightly less

00:05:41.689 --> 00:06:04.899 
actually get away with slightly less
resin<00:05:42.139> which<00:05:42.649> relates<00:05:43.039> lower<00:05:43.729> way

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:04.909 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:07.279 

okay<00:06:05.909> so<00:06:05.969> just<00:06:06.300> in<00:06:06.449> the<00:06:06.569> am<00:06:06.719> sandwiching

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
okay so just in the am sandwiching

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:10.100 
okay so just in the am sandwiching
process<00:06:07.770> top<00:06:08.310> and<00:06:08.430> bottom<00:06:08.639> sandwich<00:06:08.939> and<00:06:09.180> the

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
process top and bottom sandwich and the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.040 
process top and bottom sandwich and the
next<00:06:10.529> stage<00:06:10.830> will<00:06:11.129> be<00:06:11.310> will<00:06:11.610> be<00:06:11.639> reshaping<00:06:12.240> so

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
next stage will be will be reshaping so

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.450 
next stage will be will be reshaping so
there's<00:06:13.229> checking<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.710> whole<00:06:13.830> shape<00:06:14.159> and

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
there's checking the whole shape and

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.459 
there's checking the whole shape and
sandwich<00:06:15.090> shape<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:15.509> cleaning<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.139> all<00:06:16.319> up

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
sandwich shape and cleaning that all up

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.499 
sandwich shape and cleaning that all up
and<00:06:16.650> installing<00:06:17.520> on<00:06:17.699> the<00:06:17.789> parts<00:06:18.120> ready<00:06:18.360> for

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
and installing on the parts ready for

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:37.220 
and installing on the parts ready for
laminating<00:06:18.779> so<00:06:19.349> come<00:06:19.740> check<00:06:19.919> out<00:06:20.009> next

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.900 

the<00:06:38.230> bottom<00:06:38.530> shape<00:06:38.710> in<00:06:38.830> these<00:06:38.980> tables<00:06:39.190> is

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
the bottom shape in these tables is

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.870 
the bottom shape in these tables is
matched<00:06:40.450> to<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:41.050> CAD<00:06:41.260> shape<00:06:41.590> in<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:42.610> early

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
matched to the CAD shape in the early

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.720 
matched to the CAD shape in the early
stages<00:06:43.150> so<00:06:43.590> basically<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:45.280> bottom<00:06:45.460> is<00:06:45.610> open

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
stages so basically the bottom is open

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.700 
stages so basically the bottom is open
the<00:06:45.880> table<00:06:46.180> matches<00:06:46.450> the<00:06:47.110> shape<00:06:47.320> that<00:06:47.590> we've

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
the table matches the shape that we've

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.050 
the table matches the shape that we've
actually<00:06:47.860> shaped<00:06:48.280> two<00:06:48.400> ends<00:06:48.520> of<00:06:48.670> the<00:06:48.790> mission

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
actually shaped two ends of the mission

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.150 
actually shaped two ends of the mission
the<00:06:49.270> bottom<00:06:49.990> is<00:06:50.050> open<00:06:50.200> the<00:06:50.350> tables<00:06:50.740> match<00:06:50.950> to

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
the bottom is open the tables match to

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.640 
the bottom is open the tables match to
the<00:06:51.250> can<00:06:51.460> so<00:06:51.670> the<00:06:52.060> bottom<00:06:52.330> shape<00:06:52.540> matches<00:06:53.020> the

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650 
the can so the bottom shape matches the
