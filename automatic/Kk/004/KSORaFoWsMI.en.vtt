00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.930 
commercial course no heart and I
obviously<00:00:31.279> typically<00:00:33.250> it's<00:00:34.250> really<00:00:34.579> only<00:00:34.699> for

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
obviously typically it's really only for

obviously typically it's really only for
healing<00:00:35.150> things<00:00:35.600> like<00:00:35.780> that<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.769> it<00:00:37.400> will

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
healing things like that so it will

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.750 
healing things like that so it will
start<00:00:37.909> up<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.239> liberal<00:00:38.629> anything<00:00:39.610> that's<00:00:40.610> on

their turn aries and obviously that's

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.049 
their turn aries and obviously that's
going<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.670> be<00:00:46.790> a<00:00:46.820> stunt<00:00:47.440> around<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.649> pier<00:00:49.059> so

town<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.679> here<00:01:07.210> penny<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.300> think<00:01:08.539> any<00:01:08.690> case<00:01:08.899> we

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
town in here penny I think any case we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.330 
town in here penny I think any case we
just<00:01:09.229> stopped<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.679> the<00:01:09.770> tip<00:01:09.950> of<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.130> toe

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
just stopped on the tip of the toe

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.010 
just stopped on the tip of the toe
you're<00:01:11.030> going<00:01:11.179> to<00:01:11.240> get<00:01:11.300> live<00:01:11.479> around<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.899> can

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
you're going to get live around it can

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.180 
you're going to get live around it can
be<00:01:12.110> used<00:01:12.259> both<00:01:12.920> as<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.190> setup<00:01:13.640> point<00:01:15.190> four

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
be used both as a setup point four

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.109 
be used both as a setup point four
points<00:01:16.700> like<00:01:16.940> liver<00:01:17.300> 13<00:01:17.840> for<00:01:18.289> instance<00:01:19.119> used

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
points like liver 13 for instance used

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.300 
points like liver 13 for instance used
with<00:01:20.450> liver<00:01:20.750> 13<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.409> makes<00:01:21.649> little<00:01:21.830> getting

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
with liver 13 it makes little getting

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.300 
with liver 13 it makes little getting
really<00:01:22.729> really<00:01:22.880> deadly<00:01:23.679> it<00:01:24.679> can<00:01:24.739> be<00:01:25.009> also<00:01:25.099> used

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
really really deadly it can be also used

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.570 
really really deadly it can be also used
as<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.209> point<00:01:27.080> of<00:01:27.200> itself<00:01:27.560> because<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.130> it's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
as a point of itself because it's it's

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.469 
as a point of itself because it's it's
quite<00:01:28.910> an<00:01:29.090> energy<00:01:29.360> drainage<00:01:29.840> point<00:01:31.479> partly

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
quite an energy drainage point partly

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
quite an energy drainage point partly
this<00:01:32.630> job<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.170> send<00:01:33.470> achieve<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:35.800> bottom

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this job is to send achieve the bottom

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.740 
this job is to send achieve the bottom
this<00:01:37.229> also<00:01:37.680> has<00:01:38.609> a<00:01:38.640> delayed<00:01:39.060> effect<00:01:39.240> whereby

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this also has a delayed effect whereby

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
this also has a delayed effect whereby
just<00:01:40.170> stop<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.679> point<00:01:40.920> really<00:01:41.100> hard

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
just stop on this point really hard

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120 
just stop on this point really hard
really<00:01:41.640> good<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:43.560> Chi<00:01:43.799> would<00:01:44.009> be

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
really good that the Chi would be

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.179 
really good that the Chi would be
impaired<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.289> sometime<00:01:46.289> later<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.009> if

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
impaired you know sometime later so if

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.399 
impaired you know sometime later so if
you<00:01:47.280> do<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.579> stuck<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.329> toe<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.380> a

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
you do get stuck on the toe so as a

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.580 
you do get stuck on the toe so as a
puzzle<00:01:49.829> Garcia<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.399> Chinese<00:01:50.789> doctor<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.590> just
