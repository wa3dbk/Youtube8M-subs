cocoons<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.810> you're<00:01:40.350> throwing<00:01:40.530> these<00:01:40.829> things

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
cocoons and you're throwing these things

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.760 
cocoons and you're throwing these things
and<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.600> how<00:01:42.750> fast<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.409> flick<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and you know how fast you flick it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
and you know how fast you flick it
determines<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> strength<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.090> throw

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
determines the strength of your throw

enemies and various objects in the
environment<00:02:20.970> yeah<00:02:21.750> i<00:02:21.990> was<00:02:22.410> using<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.740> gamepad

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
environment yeah i was using the gamepad

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.710 
environment yeah i was using the gamepad
so<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.400> was<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.970> charge<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.330> archery

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so I was actually in charge of archery

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330 
so I was actually in charge of archery
and<00:02:24.960> what<00:02:25.140> was<00:02:25.260> cool<00:02:25.440> about<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and what was cool about that is that so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.950 
and what was cool about that is that so
you<00:02:26.400> hold<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> gamepad<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.330> this<00:02:27.600> and

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
you hold the gamepad like this and

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.390 
you hold the gamepad like this and
basically<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.950> look<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
basically you can look around the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.820 
basically you can look around the
environment<00:02:29.940> by<00:02:30.030> going<00:02:30.330> like<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.710> or<00:02:31.710> you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
environment by going like this or you

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.560 
environment by going like this or you
can<00:02:31.980> use<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> left<00:02:32.610> analog<00:02:32.790> stick<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.480> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
can use the left analog stick on the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.730 
can use the left analog stick on the
controller<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.990> look<00:02:34.110> around<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.470> basically

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
controller to look around it's basically

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.440 
controller to look around it's basically
whatever<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.220> find<00:02:35.370> more<00:02:35.640> comfortable<00:02:36.210> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
whatever you find more comfortable I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.090 
whatever you find more comfortable I
actually<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.170> doing<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.620> little<00:02:37.770> bit<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> both

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
actually like doing a little bit of both

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.190 
actually like doing a little bit of both
because<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:38.910> found<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.330> when<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.900> it

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
because I found that when you do this it

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.660 
because I found that when you do this it
kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.710> lose<00:02:40.920> your<00:02:41.130> alignment<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.610> you

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
kind of you lose your alignment and you

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.980 
kind of you lose your alignment and you
can<00:02:41.790> kind<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.030> end<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.420> keep<00:02:42.690> turning

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
can kind of just end up keep turning

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.500 
can kind of just end up keep turning
around<00:02:43.080> towards<00:02:43.590> zero<00:02:43.920> right<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.330> when<00:02:45.420> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
around towards zero right so when you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.150 
around towards zero right so when you
flick<00:02:46.020> down<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.380> right<00:02:46.500> analog<00:02:46.770> stick<00:02:46.860> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
flick down the right analog stick to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.710 
flick down the right analog stick to
fire<00:02:47.340> arrows<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.850> flick<00:02:48.090> back<00:02:48.210> up<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> shoot

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
fire arrows and flick back up to shoot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.440 
fire arrows and flick back up to shoot
it<00:02:48.930> really<00:02:49.890> simple<00:02:50.220> straightforward<00:02:50.670> kind<00:02:51.240> of

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it really simple straightforward kind of

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.330 
it really simple straightforward kind of
a<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:52.320> one<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.740> those<00:02:52.800> things<00:02:52.860> again<00:02:53.130> that's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
a just one of those things again that's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.380 
a just one of those things again that's
just<00:02:53.400> showing<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.670> how<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.850> use<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> system

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
just showing you how to use the system

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.110 
just showing you how to use the system
yeah<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:56.010> then<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> third<00:02:56.580> one<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.090> saw

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120

it was not as punishing ass but in a way
kind<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.540> similar<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.140> trials<00:03:37.560> games

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
kind of similar to like the trials games

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.440 
kind of similar to like the trials games
right<00:03:38.340> where<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.760> was<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.150> didn't

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
right where it was like if you didn't

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.570 
right where it was like if you didn't
hit<00:03:39.600> something<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.050> right<00:03:40.260> speed<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.459> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
hit something at the right speed you you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.860 
hit something at the right speed you you
know<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.790> would<00:03:41.910> flip<00:03:42.060> over<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.570> they<00:03:42.720> say

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
know you would flip over and they say

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.360 
know you would flip over and they say
you're<00:03:43.020> back<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.440> last<00:03:43.620> checkpoint<00:03:43.950> and
