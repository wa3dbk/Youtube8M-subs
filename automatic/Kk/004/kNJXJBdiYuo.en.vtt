00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.670 
I think the suspensions fine it's mainly
just<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.680> fender<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:04.049> know<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.470> it's<00:03:04.620> just

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
just a fender and you know and it's just

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.740 
just a fender and you know and it's just
in<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.190> tire<00:03:05.400> right<00:03:05.430> now<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:06.329> jerked<00:03:06.630> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
back in traffic

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.990 
back in traffic
even<00:03:50.130> though<00:03:50.250> we're<00:03:50.460> on<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:50.640> short<00:03:50.850> track

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
even though we're on the short track

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.360 
even though we're on the short track
arrow<00:03:51.330> does<00:03:51.840> doesn't<00:03:52.230> mean<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> little<00:03:52.950> bit<00:03:53.100> so

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
arrow does doesn't mean a little bit so

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.680 
arrow does doesn't mean a little bit so
especially<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> don't<00:03:54.180> know<00:03:54.420> what<00:03:54.570> that

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
especially I don't know what that

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.000 
especially I don't know what that
fenders<00:03:55.050> gonna<00:03:55.230> be<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.470> when<00:03:55.620> we<00:03:55.710> get<00:03:55.860> done

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
fenders gonna be like when we get done

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.280 
fenders gonna be like when we get done
so<00:03:56.340> we've<00:03:57.210> certainly<00:03:57.390> got<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.840> car<00:03:58.020> I<00:03:58.050> don't

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
so we've certainly got the car I don't

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.360 
so we've certainly got the car I don't
think<00:03:58.410> there's<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.620> better<00:03:58.740> car<00:03:59.040> out<00:03:59.190> there

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
think there's a better car out there

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.700 
think there's a better car out there
that's<00:03:59.520> for<00:03:59.610> sure
