00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
have trouble turning around it would

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.350 
have trouble turning around it would
want<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.370> be<00:03:57.459> a<00:03:57.490> little<00:03:57.640> bit<00:03:57.790> hoppy<00:03:58.030> when<00:03:58.270> it

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
want to be a little bit hoppy when it

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.720 
want to be a little bit hoppy when it
spins<00:03:58.660> a<00:03:59.470> shorter<00:04:00.069> horse<00:04:00.280> will<00:04:00.459> be<00:04:00.550> more

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
spins a shorter horse will be more

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.320 
spins a shorter horse will be more
compact<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.420> more<00:04:01.860> agile<00:04:02.860> so<00:04:03.430> for<00:04:03.640> me<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:04.030> horse

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
compact and more agile so for me a horse

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.350 
compact and more agile so for me a horse
between<00:04:04.540> 14<00:04:05.140> 2<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.500> 15<00:04:05.800> hands<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.250> ideal<00:04:06.610> but

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
between 14 2 and 15 hands is ideal but

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.030 
between 14 2 and 15 hands is ideal but
having<00:04:07.810> said<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:07.989> I've<00:04:08.260> seen<00:04:08.590> some<00:04:08.770> horses

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
having said that I've seen some horses

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.220 
having said that I've seen some horses
that<00:04:09.220> are<00:04:09.280> quite<00:04:09.520> big<00:04:09.760> that<00:04:10.300> can<00:04:10.510> really<00:04:11.020> do

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
that are quite big that can really do

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.229 
that are quite big that can really do
the<00:04:11.319> stuff<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.770> again<00:04:12.430> pretty<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.090> as<00:04:13.209> pretty

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
the stuff so again pretty is as pretty

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.330 
the stuff so again pretty is as pretty
does<00:04:14.220> there's<00:04:15.220> no<00:04:15.400> real<00:04:15.730> height<00:04:16.000> restriction

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
does there's no real height restriction

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.409 
does there's no real height restriction
but<00:04:18.340> they've<00:04:18.609> got<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.850> be<00:04:18.910> able<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.120> do<00:04:19.239> what

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
but they've got to be able to do what

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.450 
but they've got to be able to do what
you're<00:04:19.540> asking

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.400 

when<00:04:25.120> I'm<00:04:25.210> training<00:04:25.419> my<00:04:25.630> reining<00:04:25.900> horses<00:04:26.139> I<00:04:26.350> do

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
when I'm training my reining horses I do

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.050 
when I'm training my reining horses I do
use<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> lot<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:26.949> seat<00:04:27.310> I<00:04:27.460> like<00:04:27.669> to<00:04:27.820> ride<00:04:28.030> my

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
use a lot of seat I like to ride my

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.120 
use a lot of seat I like to ride my
muscles<00:04:28.600> up<00:04:28.720> into<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.050> bridle<00:04:29.380> and<00:04:29.650> use<00:04:29.949> my

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
muscles up into the bridle and use my

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.460 
muscles up into the bridle and use my
leg<00:04:30.310> as<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.550> secondary<00:04:30.940> aid<00:04:31.290> very<00:04:32.290> nice

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
leg as a secondary aid very nice

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.950 
leg as a secondary aid very nice
electrosurgical<00:04:32.979> to<00:04:33.400> outside<00:04:34.300> rein<00:04:34.570> for<00:04:34.840> me

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
electrosurgical to outside rein for me

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.689 
electrosurgical to outside rein for me
is<00:04:35.080> really<00:04:35.350> important<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:35.949> ride<00:04:36.190> inside<00:04:36.520> lead

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
is really important I ride inside lead

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.700 
is really important I ride inside lead
to<00:04:36.850> outside<00:04:37.180> rein<00:04:37.389> very<00:04:38.199> much<00:04:38.380> like<00:04:38.590> the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
to outside rein very much like the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.159 
to outside rein very much like the
dressage<00:04:39.040> riders<00:04:39.400> ride<00:04:39.660> because<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.870> want<00:04:41.050> my

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
dressage riders ride because I want my

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.719 
dressage riders ride because I want my
horse<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.650> work<00:04:41.860> off<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> outside<00:04:42.580> rein

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
horse to work off the outside rein

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.340 
horse to work off the outside rein
ultimately<00:04:43.210> when<00:04:43.479> we're<00:04:43.630> steering<00:04:43.900> a<00:04:44.050> reining

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
ultimately when we're steering a reining

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.540 
ultimately when we're steering a reining
horse<00:04:44.500> everything<00:04:44.949> comes<00:04:45.130> from<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.370> outside

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
horse everything comes from the outside

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.210 
horse everything comes from the outside
rein<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.810> inside<00:04:47.080> rein<00:04:47.229> should<00:04:47.470> be<00:04:47.560> loose<00:04:47.740> so

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
rein the inside rein should be loose so

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.500 
rein the inside rein should be loose so
the<00:04:48.310> horse<00:04:48.460> must<00:04:48.639> understand<00:04:49.210> how<00:04:49.449> that

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
the horse must understand how that

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.629 
the horse must understand how that
outside<00:04:49.960> rein<00:04:50.169> works<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.160> spend<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.460> lot<00:04:51.610> of

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
outside rein works so I spend a lot of

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.250 
outside rein works so I spend a lot of
time<00:04:51.880> working<00:04:52.120> inside<00:04:52.510> lead<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.780> outs<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:53.080> rain

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
time working inside lead to outs of rain

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.930 
time working inside lead to outs of rain
making<00:04:53.620> sure<00:04:53.740> my<00:04:53.889> almost<00:04:54.160> bends<00:04:54.400> around<00:04:54.639> that

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
making sure my almost bends around that

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.450 
making sure my almost bends around that
plain<00:04:55.180> side<00:04:55.449> leg<00:04:55.770> and<00:04:56.770> this<00:04:56.950> soft<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
plain side leg and this soft to the

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.070 
plain side leg and this soft to the
outside<00:04:57.880> rein<00:04:58.030> so<00:04:58.240> when<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.450> lay<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.690> outs<00:04:58.930> I

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
outside rein so when I lay the outs I

solid<00:05:16.539> into<00:05:16.689> maneuvers<00:05:17.139> because<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.889> best

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
solid into maneuvers because the best

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.189 
solid into maneuvers because the best
way<00:05:18.309> to<00:05:18.339> learn<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:19.059> to<00:05:19.120> have<00:05:19.449> a<00:05:19.479> horse<00:05:19.749> that<00:05:19.809> can

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
way to learn is to have a horse that can

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.320 
way to learn is to have a horse that can
really<00:05:20.409> do<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:20.770> maneuver<00:05:21.159> if<00:05:21.819> you're<00:05:22.089> running

stop and you don't know whether it's
