00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.680
 hello the coating of serious re spoke to us 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.270
 of an extremely thorny subject is far 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.480
 to be superficial since we are going 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 talk about wearing heels and keenly 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.869
 this video is over so I can 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.009
 put back my slippers are a lot of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.119
 transvestites who often say that in fact 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.009
 if they had been women 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.170
 he would have liked to wear all the time 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.720
 all day and heels 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.220
 ultimately these people disguises very 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.560
 fast since 20 the edge of the heels has 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.810
 necessarily much more difficult than 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.580
 wore a pair of basketes landes 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.260
 like for all walking with heels 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.150
 his request and a lot of practice and not 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 training bad I mean that a 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.290
 wader he has not put stilts for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.660
 the first time and customers 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.170
 indelicate with and walk well with 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.210
 heels it's the same and to start there 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.720
 better start small rather than 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 see immediately heels goualade of 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.020
 this size their approach and on the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.140
 paved streets with that since ben there 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.470
 it's sure the slip is assured 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.560
 and gade for the crowd the idea of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.510
 start small and is good but what 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 is important also it's precisely the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.430
 compensation of the week at the front 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.620
 since for example on a pair like 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.880
 that the talent is not very high but 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.290
 the shoe is net since they the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 pressure not at all compensate at the front 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.180
 whereas on this one example here 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.010
 there is still a week a lot 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.830
 more and leaves in front rewarded 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.450
 so the foot with less than a physio and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.540
 it's not necessarily more difficult 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.770
 than with the previous ones by the way 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.510
 know that there are some who are anti 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 shoes to the haves because I understand 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.010
 we thought but according to shoes 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.490
 to train is just the ideal 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.760
 past that's it gives a stability that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.830
 that we do not necessarily have with the with a 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.080
 stiletto heel and that will allow already 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.080
 to better understand the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.570
 feline women with 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.730
 heels much higher another idea 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.980
 this is going to be that kind of ankle boots 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.800
 for example or shoes actually where 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.810
 there will be there is a little heel that's it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.930
 it allows to see training to walk 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.850
 with heels and a catalan that is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.170
 pretty little kiki plus enough money 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.730
 like this it will give but 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.800
 certain stability to be able to 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.200
 start taking to each state world 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.600
 because it's really not easy to 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.280
 start with 16 cm so already 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.920
 firstly, we will have to learn how to 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.540
 do not step smaller is not more 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.330
 tight to just have a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.420
 better balance regarding the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.550
 step in itself 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.489
 we can advise you from ben 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.220
 review our pace etc 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.870
 and next to that a walker 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.989
 every talent or not race 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.790
 so maybe also learn to 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.620
 slow down your pace a market that wants 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.750
 more gently for just that's it 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.910
 to avoid them from falling then 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.340
 what is important is really 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.319
 put the heel to find a balance 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.950
 and then to put the spikes and not 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.330
 not the opposite 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.500
 because it's true that when we walk 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.019
 sometimes that the land can be 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.660
 quite confusing and we are quite tempted to 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.430
 walk on tiptoe and the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.470
 selune loses insured customers actually 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.530
 at the level of the lure 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.090
 finally we have to succeed in staying upright and 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.319
 not to curl up since then 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.390
 there if you curl up 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.310
 it really looks like two 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.049
 beginner transvestites who knows not too much 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.670
 how to move in his shoes 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.940
 too big and hurting 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.120
 feet 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.370
 we must also get in the habit of 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.489
 tighten up the market kinds in fact for 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.430
 avoid giving that cowboy look that 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.930
 mark his cowards to what ben here 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.730
 you will notice that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.780
 women Morocco an approach to which 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.190
 much tighter it's more elegant 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.320
 for talents will also be more 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.030
 simple if you have problems for 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.750
 put on your pair of shoes 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.880
 favorite as resonance yesterday me 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.060
 had advised him or as many 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.109
 logo as the write what is a 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.670
 good idea is to put the cream 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.440
 moisturizing on the feet to be able to 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.269
 slide the dock into the pump made in 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.430
 kind of have enough shoes 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.859
 relaxed I had made a video on 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.130
 order extend his leather shoes 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.320
 and I think that it will avoid 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.160
 to have foot pain and therefore having 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.450
 less sore feet 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 your step may have necessarily 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.740
 better for example you 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 try a pair of shoes 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.970
 try it barefoot but also 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.950
 with tights because who is 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.270
 no one because cries of evil envied then 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.660
 that sticky it comes alone 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.970
 and unfortunately when you try it 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.680
 some sense the sticky you could 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.880
 to have the bad surprise we are you 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.830
 well the mayor of basic doves 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.140
 social duties simply slip 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.870
 so your advice for your first 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.940
 exit with a pair of shoes it's 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.800
 to provide a spare pair and has 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.660
 especially if the long evening with you 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.580
 an hour new internal rules of 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.300
 fo on flatter because precisely if 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.980
 you have sore feet 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.640
 it will save you from spending the rest of 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.900
 the evening barefoot and elsewhere for 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.190
 your first out as 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.600
 transvestite avoid taking a shoe 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.640
 at heel because when we do not have 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.710
 still practice etc. 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.510
 it's really not going to make you feel comfortable 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.100
 and as it is the shoes that are 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.380
 still difficult to wear without 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.600
 training it really risks you 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.000
 ruin the evening 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.560
 but having said that I invite you to 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.600
 train you to practice at home 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.760
 already to start for for good 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.380
 find stability etc but also to 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.050
 to train yourself out because really 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:44.050
 walk in his rhinestone apartment on the 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.850
 right and right 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.620
 he does not like to walk on 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.390
 in the street me paved streets or the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.540
 macadam and not always well 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.740
 unstable and has therefore trained you and 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.740
 you will see that it is not so complicated
