oven and I didn't grab the camera fast
enough<00:01:48.149> before<00:01:48.270> we<00:01:48.990> started<00:01:49.290> munching<00:01:49.470> on

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
enough before we started munching on

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.940 
enough before we started munching on
them<00:01:49.860> they're<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.880> good<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.649> they<00:01:52.649> were

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
them they're really good and they were

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
them they're really good and they were
sliced<00:01:53.399> by<00:01:53.820> hand<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.390> they're<00:01:54.540> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.780> thick

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sliced by hand so they're kind of thick

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.080 
sliced by hand so they're kind of thick
but<00:01:55.740> when<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:55.979> dry<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.790> dry<00:01:57.060> out

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
but when they dry out they dry out

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080 
but when they dry out they dry out
pretty<00:01:57.479> thinly<00:01:58.490> now<00:01:59.490> they're<00:01:59.700> cool<00:01:59.909> because

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
pretty thinly now they're cool because

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
pretty thinly now they're cool because
it<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> stripes<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.439> any<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.890> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it we have the stripes but any kind of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520 
it we have the stripes but any kind of
beat<00:02:02.159> will<00:02:02.340> work<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.229> would<00:02:04.229> recommend

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
beat will work on this I would recommend

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
beat will work on this I would recommend
that<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.829> give<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.420> Cuisinart<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.960> try<00:02:07.259> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
that you give the Cuisinart they try and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.380 
that you give the Cuisinart they try and
slice<00:02:07.950> them<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.399> way<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:09.090> you'll

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
slice them up that way I think you'll

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.290 
slice them up that way I think you'll
get<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.660> beats<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.849> they'll<00:02:11.849> cook<00:02:12.060> much

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
get more beats and they'll cook much

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.520 
get more beats and they'll cook much
faster

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
faster

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
faster
