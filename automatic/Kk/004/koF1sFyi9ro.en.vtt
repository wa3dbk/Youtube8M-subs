00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
way that it works is simple is that the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
way that it works is simple is that the
back<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.319> it<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:17.039> has<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> car<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
back of it that has a car that you can

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.790 
back of it that has a car that you can

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
directly control it from here this is

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.789 
directly control it from here this is
obviously<00:01:29.789> stopped<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.630> pause<00:01:31.049> this

obviously stopped that's pause this
place<00:01:32.100> side<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.399> this<00:01:32.909> place<00:01:33.240> I'd<00:01:33.539> be<00:01:33.810> if

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
place side a this place I'd be if

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.050 
place side a this place I'd be if
there's<00:01:34.950> audio<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.429> into<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.819> you<00:01:35.940> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
there's audio going into it you can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.430 
there's audio going into it you can
actually<00:01:36.270> record<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.720> tape<00:01:36.899> why<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> would

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
have a microphone jack to this one is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
have a microphone jack to this one is
just<00:01:46.679> indicators<00:01:47.429> if<00:01:47.580> you're<00:01:47.759> fast

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just indicators if you're fast

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.199 
just indicators if you're fast
forwarding<00:01:48.959> you'll<00:01:49.649> see<00:01:49.800> a<00:01:49.830> flash<00:01:50.190> they<00:01:51.060> have

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
forwarding you'll see a flash they have

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.350 
forwarding you'll see a flash they have
to<00:01:51.300> stop<00:01:51.590> if<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.920> rewind<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.940> shows<00:01:54.149> it's
