00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:14.429
 And there, folks, the day and day I came to bring 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.410
 for you a performance test here of the 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.310
 tablet I received these days 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.160
 I think you two saw a boxing there 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.630
 Official Galaxy Tab 3 If You Have not Seen 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.849
 I leave the video in the description the link and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 I promised I would do is an analysis of the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.669
 device will're coming in a few days this 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.050
 analyze 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.989
 I'll give my opinion that I found the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 apparatus etc etc but today in bring to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.219
 Here you are a test I did in the two 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.860
 but the focus here is on the tablet is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.680
 I used the antidote that is a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 free app for you to do tests 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 There, on your device, that's it. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 interesting for those who have an interest in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 buy the device and want to know just for 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 it is potent or it is not worth it if 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.030
 going to run the applications is good without 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.549
 stop running games are also 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.580
 center, so it's very interesting to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.140
 Who is interested in buying is then the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.689
 that's enough of a curse I did a test 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.330
 here however let the camera approach 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.270
 It's easier, then this is the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.030
 galaxy tab three more and more 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:27.119
 he received 11,410 points and stayed below 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.979
 just here from htc nexus 4 galaxy 3 e 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.430
 so it goes 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:37.770
 ok go 1 x 1 thank you year 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.180
 so the xis and stayed above the galaxy s2 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 as I said in another video that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.439
 device here is not top of the line 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.450
 but as he expected the good device 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.649
 I managed to run several games. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.140
 heavy and without locking, then it is 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.240
 a good device for those looking there is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.430
 a small tablet this is the tablet 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.990
 that has a good 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.579
 performance to run applications 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.930
 heavy to run heavy games 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.509
 Okay, so I'm having a good time, it's a good 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.280
 And I wanted it for him, that's it. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.020
 with 7 inches 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.350
 he was 10 inches is very 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.290
 great 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.480
 not not get used anyway for you 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.600
 will have a notion the king says he 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.290
 he received 7,000 600 points this is 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.660
 stayed below the galaxy s2 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.250
 then it is much weaker and the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.390
 galaxy tab 3 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:38.330
 there the settings are a bit similar 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.500
 galaxy is has a dual core processor the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.750
 teacher who is not from al-khor but is a 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.610
 teacher who is from intel who is more 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.850
 powerful and so then I thought it would be a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.740
 similar score but it was not so 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.770
 and to finish the video about the game 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.270
 real racing 3 for you to see what 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:00.420
 running and good on galaxy tab 3 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.960
 what's there then what good is running 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.090
 no galaxy tab 3 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.900
 unfortunately the king would not be able to 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.210
 run this game 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.300
 I do not know if it 's because you do not have 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.540
 can stand or time processor 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.040
 hence it uses the marketing architecture 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.550
 different then I believe it to be 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.780
 that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:26.730
 but finally aquino is galaxy tab three wheels 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.830
 Okay, it's okay, then it was just that. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.310
 it was one more test to show you 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.310
 and show me and the performance of the device 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.740
 Any questions, please comment below and I 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.630
 I will leave the link to download the 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.490
 application that I used to do the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.860
 test is if you want to take a test 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.740
 there on your device and see the performance 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:55.250
 I'm staying here 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.250
 A big hug and thanks
