dual-core Novato processor it's a u8 500
unit<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:40.340> 5.2<00:04:41.340> Meg's<00:04:41.699> of<00:04:41.909> RAM<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
unit you have 5.2 Meg's of RAM and a

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.180 
unit you have 5.2 Meg's of RAM and a
very<00:04:44.280> small<00:04:44.909> full<00:04:45.539> gig<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.710> on-board<00:04:46.949> storage

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
very small full gig of on-board storage

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.040 
very small full gig of on-board storage
so<00:04:47.820> that's<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.300> bit<00:04:48.449> of<00:04:48.570> a<00:04:48.630> bummer

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
so that's a bit of a bummer

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.770 
so that's a bit of a bummer
and<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.800> know<00:04:49.919> it's<00:04:50.550> compounded<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.449> with

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
and you know it's compounded that with

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.270 
and you know it's compounded that with
the<00:04:51.870> fact<00:04:52.080> that<00:04:52.139> you<00:04:52.320> don't<00:04:52.530> get<00:04:53.900> micro<00:04:55.280> SD

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
the fact that you don't get micro SD

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.420 
the fact that you don't get micro SD
card<00:04:56.760> expansion<00:04:57.620> ok<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:58.889> that's<00:04:59.130> pretty<00:04:59.310> much

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
card expansion ok so that's pretty much

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.969 
card expansion ok so that's pretty much
it<00:04:59.669> that<00:04:59.909> was<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.330> unboxing<00:05:00.449> of<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.380> xperia

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
it that was the unboxing of the xperia

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.779 
it that was the unboxing of the xperia
