00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
it works now works beautifully primer

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
it works now works beautifully primer
bulb<00:00:55.920> doesn't<00:00:56.340> work<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.910> always<00:00:57.239> takes<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
bulb doesn't work so it always takes a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.799 
bulb doesn't work so it always takes a
good<00:00:58.170> amount<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.440> poles<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> start<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.809> but

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
good amount of poles to start it but

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
good amount of poles to start it but
that's<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> big<00:01:01.680> douche<00:01:01.890> because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that's not really a big douche because

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.039 
that's not really a big douche because
I'm<00:01:02.760> young<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.359> can<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.750> kind<00:01:03.899> of

an exhaust not a month where things and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.790 
an exhaust not a month where things and
loud<00:01:51.220> when<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.310> start<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.700> more<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:55.300> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.630 
blower is always on it's got a little
belt<00:02:00.649> tensioner<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.340> could<00:02:01.460> probably

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
belt tensioner that I could probably

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.139 
belt tensioner that I could probably
modify<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:03.070> being<00:02:04.070> on/off<00:02:04.460> for<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.880> thing

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
modify to being on/off for that thing

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.040 
modify to being on/off for that thing
but<00:02:06.009> that's<00:02:07.009> gonna<00:02:07.250> cook<00:02:10.600> if<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.840> get<00:02:11.930> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
but that's gonna cook if I can get the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.030 
but that's gonna cook if I can get the
cam<00:02:12.290> here<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:14.750> really<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.110> any<00:02:15.290> places<00:02:15.920> to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
cam here don't really have any places to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.420 
cam here don't really have any places to
put<00:02:16.190> it

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:03:14.750 

working<00:02:22.430> yeah<00:02:22.820> should<00:02:23.150> be<00:02:23.180> good

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.119 

so<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.980> works<00:03:18.190> pretty<00:03:18.459> well

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
so it works pretty well

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.460 
so it works pretty well
not<00:03:21.129> bad<00:03:21.370> for<00:03:21.400> 20<00:03:22.299> or<00:03:22.330> 30<00:03:22.420> bucks<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:25.290> got<00:03:26.290> some

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
not bad for 20 or 30 bucks and got some

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.420 
not bad for 20 or 30 bucks and got some
balls<00:03:26.680> I<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:28.140> go<00:03:29.140> up<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.379> here<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.890> can<00:03:30.280> actually

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
balls I can go up to here I can actually

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.330 
balls I can go up to here I can actually
load<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.819> full<00:03:31.269> this<00:03:32.230> thing<00:03:32.530> full<00:03:32.799> with<00:03:33.099> snow

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
load it full this thing full with snow

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.650 
load it full this thing full with snow
and<00:03:33.489> it<00:03:33.549> doesn't<00:03:33.879> stall<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.180> engine

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
and it doesn't stall the engine

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.080 
and it doesn't stall the engine
I<00:03:35.069> think<00:03:36.069> it's<00:03:36.160> an<00:03:36.250> underrated<00:03:36.489> 3<00:03:36.879> horse

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
I think it's an underrated 3 horse

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.780 
I think it's an underrated 3 horse
honestly<00:03:37.980> because<00:03:38.980> this<00:03:39.280> thing<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:39.549> just

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
honestly because this thing it just

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.130 
honestly because this thing it just
keeps<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.840> going<00:03:41.349> and<00:03:41.590> going<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:43.140> now

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
keeps going and going and going and now

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.650 
keeps going and going and going and now

a<00:03:54.700> town<00:03:54.970> house<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:55.569> I<00:03:56.459> did<00:03:57.459> those<00:03:57.670> three

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a town house so I did those three

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.729 
a town house so I did those three
because<00:03:58.450> a<00:03:58.480> plow<00:03:58.750> didn't<00:03:59.049> come<00:03:59.260> yet<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.650> the

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
because a plow didn't come yet and the

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.759 
because a plow didn't come yet and the
plough<00:03:59.980> guy<00:04:00.190> usually<00:04:00.400> just<00:04:00.760> does<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.329> area

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
plough guy usually just does that area

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.229 
plough guy usually just does that area
and<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.890> did<00:04:03.099> that<00:04:03.310> area<00:04:03.700> all<00:04:03.819> by<00:04:03.940> myself

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
and I did that area all by myself

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.869 
and I did that area all by myself
without<00:04:04.980> excluding<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.220> road<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.790> I

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
without excluding the road and then I

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.449 
without excluding the road and then I
there's<00:04:07.209> an<00:04:07.329> older<00:04:07.540> lady<00:04:07.690> over<00:04:08.079> there<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.370> I

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
there's an older lady over there and I

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.030 
there's an older lady over there and I
did<00:04:09.640> her<00:04:09.790> driveway<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.540> all<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.410> for<00:04:11.890> her

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
did her driveway and all that for her

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
did her driveway and all that for her
can't<00:04:12.549> shovel<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> great<00:04:16.419> little

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
can't shovel and it's a great little

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.270 
can't shovel and it's a great little
thing<00:04:16.720> but<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.380> only<00:04:17.440> problem<00:04:17.709> I've<00:04:17.950> had<00:04:17.979> with

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
thing but the only problem I've had with

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.339 
thing but the only problem I've had with
it<00:04:18.430> is<00:04:18.459> this<00:04:18.760> belts<00:04:19.209> pretty<00:04:19.570> old<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.109> think

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
it is this belts pretty old and I think

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.020 
it is this belts pretty old and I think
the<00:04:20.500> spring<00:04:20.950> on<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.160> belt<00:04:21.430> tensioner<00:04:21.940> is

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
the spring on the belt tensioner is

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.879 
the spring on the belt tensioner is
going<00:04:22.680> so<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:24.099> it's<00:04:24.340> if<00:04:24.760> you<00:04:24.970> get<00:04:25.889> anything

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
going so if it's if you get anything

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.129 
going so if it's if you get anything
really<00:04:27.430> heavy<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:27.970> there<00:04:28.120> like<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:28.539> ice<00:04:28.780> from

really heavy in there like the ice from

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.620 
really heavy in there like the ice from
the<00:04:29.200> bottom<00:04:29.349> of<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.770> car<00:04:30.090> formed<00:04:31.090> from<00:04:31.300> like

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
the bottom of a car formed from like

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.350 
the bottom of a car formed from like
snow<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.520> street<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.180> weather
