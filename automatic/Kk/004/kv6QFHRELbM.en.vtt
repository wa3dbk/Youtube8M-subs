00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
the top of my head down and I know it

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.060 
the top of my head down and I know it
looks<00:05:36.570> really<00:05:36.840> weird<00:05:37.080> now<00:05:37.320> but<00:05:37.530> it<00:05:37.620> will<00:05:37.830> look

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
looks really weird now but it will look

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.900 
looks really weird now but it will look
good<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.990> this<00:05:39.990> is<00:05:40.170> the<00:05:40.350> back<00:05:40.770> of<00:05:41.130> my<00:05:41.190> head<00:05:41.610> and

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
good and this is the back of my head and

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.300 
good and this is the back of my head and
the<00:05:42.810> reason<00:05:43.020> I'm<00:05:43.320> pinning<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.770> all<00:05:43.890> up<00:05:44.100> again

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
the reason I'm pinning it all up again

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.030 
the reason I'm pinning it all up again
is<00:05:44.880> because<00:05:45.210> gravity<00:05:46.080> is<00:05:46.110> your<00:05:46.230> enemy<00:05:46.410> with

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.040 
is because gravity is your enemy with

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.310 
is because gravity is your enemy with
curls<00:05:47.460> just<00:05:47.640> use<00:05:48.510> this<00:05:48.780> clip<00:05:49.380> okay<00:05:51.140> so<00:05:52.140> after

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
curls just use this clip okay so after

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.180 
curls just use this clip okay so after
you've<00:05:52.680> sprayed<00:05:53.190> start<00:05:53.910> out<00:05:54.090> in<00:05:54.330> the<00:05:54.450> middle

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
you've sprayed start out in the middle

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.940 
you've sprayed start out in the middle
and<00:05:56.190> I<00:05:56.340> can't<00:05:56.640> see<00:05:57.030> so<00:05:57.420> I'm<00:05:57.540> hoping<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:58.110> works

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
and I can't see so I'm hoping this works

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.780 
and I can't see so I'm hoping this works
well<00:05:59.540> okay<00:06:00.540> so<00:06:01.170> I<00:06:01.200> brought<00:06:01.950> it<00:06:02.160> in<00:06:02.280> half<00:06:02.520> and

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
well okay so I brought it in half and

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.430 
well okay so I brought it in half and
I'm<00:06:02.850> just<00:06:03.030> going<00:06:03.150> to<00:06:03.240> curl<00:06:03.600> it<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:03.990> miss<00:06:04.260> it

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
I'm just going to curl it and I miss it

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.250 
I'm just going to curl it and I miss it
there<00:06:04.650> so<00:06:04.950> I'm<00:06:05.010> going<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.370> gently<00:06:06.110> clip<00:06:07.110> it

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
there so I'm going to gently clip it

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.060 
there so I'm going to gently clip it
down<00:06:07.470> a<00:06:07.500> little<00:06:07.860> and<00:06:08.760> curl<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.180> up<00:06:09.270> again<00:06:09.630> and

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
down a little and curl it up again and

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.340 
down a little and curl it up again and
the<00:06:11.070> what<00:06:11.220> this<00:06:11.400> is<00:06:11.550> doing<00:06:11.760> is<00:06:12.090> if<00:06:12.780> you<00:06:13.080> start

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
the what this is doing is if you start

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.810 
the what this is doing is if you start
in<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.530> middle<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:14.040> go<00:06:14.220> towards<00:06:14.520> the<00:06:14.610> root

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
in the middle and go towards the root

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.780 
in the middle and go towards the root
and<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.150> root<00:06:15.180> is<00:06:15.680> your<00:06:16.680> whole<00:06:16.920> strand<00:06:17.610> of

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
and the root is your whole strand of

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.080 
and the root is your whole strand of
hair<00:06:17.970> is<00:06:18.150> getting<00:06:18.590> an<00:06:19.590> equal<00:06:20.280> distribution<00:06:20.430> of

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
hair is getting an equal distribution of

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
hair is getting an equal distribution of
heat<00:06:21.390> release<00:06:21.870> again<00:06:22.350> until<00:06:23.510> get<00:06:24.510> towards<00:06:24.930> the

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
heat release again until get towards the

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.870 
heat release again until get towards the
bottom<00:06:26.000> yes<00:06:27.000> there<00:06:27.330> we<00:06:27.450> go<00:06:27.570> perfect<00:06:28.400> and<00:06:29.400> then

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
bottom yes there we go perfect and then

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:35.330 
bottom yes there we go perfect and then
curl<00:06:30.180> up<00:06:30.330> again<00:06:30.720> oh<00:06:33.260> and<00:06:34.260> look<00:06:34.470> at<00:06:34.560> that<00:06:34.620> such

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
curl up again oh and look at that such
