you can see here it's not a virus or

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.700 
you can see here it's not a virus or
anything<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.840> I've<00:00:42.840> still<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
anything and I've still got we back to

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.340 
anything and I've still got we back to
go<00:00:44.090> but<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.020> easy<00:00:46.050> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
go but it's really really easy so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.790 
go but it's really really easy so
basically<00:00:46.829> once<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.190> these<00:00:47.340> files<00:00:47.789> here

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
basically once you get these files here

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.270 
basically once you get these files here
you're<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.879> extras<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.280> go

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you're going to go on to extras you go

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.139 
you're going to go on to extras you go
on<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.750> custom<00:00:54.750> ipsw<00:00:55.280> now<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> big<00:00:56.820> fail

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
on to custom ipsw now this is a big fail

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.849 
on to custom ipsw now this is a big fail
you'll<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> probably<00:00:58.289> better<00:00:58.559> save

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you'll get so you probably better save

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.150 
you'll get so you probably better save
it<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.070> desktop<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.390> come<00:01:00.539> up

i'll come up straight Rick sees on ipsw

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.960 
i'll come up straight Rick sees on ipsw
fails<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.129> should<00:01:05.339> come<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.489> straight<00:01:05.850> away

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
fails so should come up straight away

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.010
