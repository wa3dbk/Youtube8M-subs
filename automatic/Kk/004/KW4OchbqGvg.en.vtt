00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
them up and arranging them and thinking

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.710 
them up and arranging them and thinking
out<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.870> design<00:04:58.030> unlike<00:04:59.030> knitting<00:04:59.449> where

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
out a design unlike knitting where

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.350 
out a design unlike knitting where
you're<00:04:59.930> living<00:05:00.319> dangerously<00:05:00.590> row<00:05:01.250> by<00:05:01.610> row<00:05:01.909> and

you're living dangerously row by row and
trying<00:05:02.659> to<00:05:02.810> build<00:05:02.990> a<00:05:03.259> pattern<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.610> can

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
trying to build a pattern this you can

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.680 
trying to build a pattern this you can
arrange<00:05:05.120> and<00:05:05.360> rearrange<00:05:05.569> and<00:05:06.699> we<00:05:07.699> can<00:05:08.000> enter

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
arrange and rearrange and we can enter

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.930 
arrange and rearrange and we can enter
the<00:05:08.780> process<00:05:08.990> together<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.889> have<00:05:10.610> opinions

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
the process together and have opinions

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.680 
the process together and have opinions
about<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.539> and<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.680> when<00:05:13.460> Liza<00:05:13.759> would<00:05:14.180> sew<00:05:14.539> it

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
about it and then when Liza would sew it

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.320 
about it and then when Liza would sew it
together<00:05:14.870> she<00:05:15.800> could<00:05:16.099> make<00:05:16.340> decisions<00:05:16.580> based

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
together she could make decisions based

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.510 
together she could make decisions based
on<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:18.050> process<00:05:18.530> that<00:05:18.680> we<00:05:18.830> had<00:05:18.919> both<00:05:19.130> just

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
on the process that we had both just

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.600 
on the process that we had both just
lived<00:05:19.789> through<00:05:20.000> so<00:05:20.690> if<00:05:20.990> she<00:05:21.289> needed<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:21.889> stick

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
lived through so if she needed to stick

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.200 
lived through so if she needed to stick
in<00:05:22.759> an<00:05:22.880> extra<00:05:23.180> fabric<00:05:23.479> or<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.800> know<00:05:25.210> eliminate

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
in an extra fabric or you know eliminate

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.149 
in an extra fabric or you know eliminate
something<00:05:26.479> she<00:05:26.810> could<00:05:26.990> do<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.199> with

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
something she could do that with

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.580 
something she could do that with
confidence<00:05:28.460> because<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.389> had<00:05:29.569> both<00:05:29.780> come<00:05:30.440> to

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
confidence because we had both come to

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.499 
confidence because we had both come to
these<00:05:30.770> decisions<00:05:31.159> the<00:05:31.580> other<00:05:32.180> thing<00:05:32.479> about

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
these decisions the other thing about

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.600 
these decisions the other thing about
patchwork<00:05:33.229> I<00:05:33.380> love<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.949> it's<00:05:34.099> collaborative
