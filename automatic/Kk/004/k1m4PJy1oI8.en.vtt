 m 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.350
 at the base 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350

 here are the appropriate guarantees 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.889
 no wonder that at the close the law enforcement forces again called m 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.399
 the miracles of technology 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 the canvas wow rigor 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.439
 all in all you will pass 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 still 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.629
 the prior agreement the ppe 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 otherwise 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.839
 it is mathematical place in the department of aude 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.760
 however there is too much time before appearing no no google did not 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.189
 fear 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.439
 Walloon Brabant 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.150
 otherwise it's clear 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.769
 he has the secret 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.259
 the winger was tackled for them 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.629

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.389

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.389
 steeve moms 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.519
 - the prosecution has opened a high investigation see the video why 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:54.999
 3 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.999
 it is true 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.349
 it is just now you were so groups 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.289
 of friends of these diedrick receipts but they mean to work together 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.529
 so 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:12.119
 to form this group 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:14.679
 it's been a few months since 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:17.689
 we knew the known game a few days 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.139
 golf drouot 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.590
 I have never known another 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.989
 also the site 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.260
 face these few words it's about working you're already 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.350
 done well anyway 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.340
 you have a musical background anyway 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.360
 we can all 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.629
 of the organist I have already played the other well 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.939
 this work of will that concerns the desire to play together that because 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.680
 we have the opportunity this report 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.069
 we play in a garage 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:43.659
 we are lucky because 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.469
 we can play three times a week 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.490
 which is enough I think 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.789
 as for the instruments the stops of play 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.090
 we already had most of the instruments 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.970
 it was necessary to fill the departure of a few days more one or two 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.979
 victories 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.689
 and for the question of giving and the question of doubting his quads 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.660
 ask people to pay taxes that work to comply with 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.779
 new standards of 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:09.460
 then update you call you support the other ap launches 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.960
 this community is also pretty friendly 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.280
 - you have chosen to face who may seem a little curious to very afraid of 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.190
 playing rock sometimes so proud 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.650
 finally to play rock to the point that all 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.270
 that you are completely and at length 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.970
 year-round besides headdresses and eyes she does not realize what I 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.659
 think 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.830
 you look good with some kind of small currency small areas 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.819
 flat 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:34.279
 in the end then to the year you chose to leave the banana more to the 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.449
 banana and how to make stable good point tonight at turns for the 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:38.130
 broths 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.310
 we're not as good at maths but you always stay that way 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.189
 pretty well when you catch morning at the evening of his prison hortefeux 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.919
 about the outgoing mayor to bake the hair before eating 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.999

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.330

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:11.439
 their handicap 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.550
