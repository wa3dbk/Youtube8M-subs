00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.980
 speak personal but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.049
 beginning today we will try to do 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 a light pudding 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.030
 the clear day to a delicious recipe and the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.429
 people discovered that it's very easy then 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.190
 You also have to learn, we'll go. 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.010
 start by adding water and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.930
 sugar in a medium saucepan of you will 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 mix it all together 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.970
 homogeneous here then we are 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.340
 making our codin caramel and when already 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.460
 I have mixed you will turn the fire on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.829
 high fire and you will start to bubble 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.309
 this mixture will start to bubble and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.890
 more or less than 10 to 15 minutes she goes 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.780
 start to get dark 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 during this process does not need to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 with a spoon you can move from time to time 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 when the pan but do not need to move 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.899
 with spoon and no spatula just wait 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.030
 bubbling for 15 minutes 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 It will start to get dark, and you are. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.859
 seeing that it is already dark and people 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 will put in our pudding form 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 being very careful because this 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 mix this caramel is very hot 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.580
 and their shape and pan will also 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.189
 get too hot then add is 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.060
 just move and go through the whole side 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.640
 stop it covers fashion and done that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.710
 You 'll reserve your form and we'll go 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 start making the pudding 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.509
 you then add all your 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.750
 clear in the mixer and you will start 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.909
 beat on average speed for more or 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 less two to three minutes 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.640
 until it forms a foam with this fourth 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.530
 formed then that foam you go 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 start adding your sugar one 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 spoon at a time 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.649
 every time you add sugar 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.520
 You tip more or less 5 to 10 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:02.549
 seconds and adds to the other until you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.409
 add all the sugar after 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.899
 add all the sugar you 're going to hit 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.780
 this in high average speed for more 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.739
 or at least five minutes you do not want 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.900
 here form high peaks as in the 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.970
 Sigh, you're going to spend a little bit of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.580
 point of the sigh until it becomes a 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.370
 a little softer than the sigh 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.620
 then you hit your clear 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.600
 being is simply going to add to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.269
 clear in its shape that you had 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.880
 high upon the caramel 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.580
 so you patiently and with a 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.120
 spatula is adding all this clear 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.120
 in the form 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.810
 and for this clear is well distributed 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.300
 You can from time to time hit this one. 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.670
 against the table and you can also 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.280
 press a little with your spatula 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.680
 until the air comes out but does not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.990
 need to be concerned about this and if the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.970
 I do not have to quit totally and it's normal 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.440
 your pudding get a little bumpy 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.540
 after you misinform it now is 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.790
 just put your pudding shape inside 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 rectangular shape and add a 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.320
 a little bit of water we will pass 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.000
 this pudding in a water bath and this is a 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.130
 very important step of the whole 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.890
 process has no water bath 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.400
 then you put it in the oven at 120 degrees 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.430
 for more or less 30 minutes than your 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.500
 light pudding will come out so you go 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.810
 realize that it stays a little bit 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.160
 colorado over but it does not stay 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.810
 fully cured 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 but you saw that he was a little bit 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.950
 darker and its consistency is 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.230
 exactly this 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.330
 it will stay a little if you press 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.790
 your hand you realize that it gets a 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.760
 little to very soft molly inside 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.280
 Now you need to misinform the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.650
 could and you can not tell him 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.360
 neither so hot nor so cold then 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.320
 when he spends more or less ten 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.300
 minutes 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.230
 You can inform by passing a little bit 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.120
 the knife on the side to separate it 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.180
 ready your clear pudding 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.100
 just put it on a plate with your head and 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.690
 Turn over that your egg whites pudding will 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.690
 disinform very easy 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.000
 the ae 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.710
 if you have never tried pudding 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.040
 Clear, I recommend you do 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.320
 try is a delight is very soft 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.510
 and is totally different from all other 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.460
 other desserts you've ever eaten 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.180
 Look at the consistency of it 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.180
 interesting 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.040

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.930
