check it out and also I don't know why I
just<00:01:11.040> went<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:12.290> let<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.380> pull<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just went out of there let me pull this

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.469 
just went out of there let me pull this
back<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.450> plasma<00:01:16.170> beam<00:01:16.409> handgun

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
back up we have the plasma beam handgun

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
back up we have the plasma beam handgun
it<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:20.270> ranged<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.450> gun<00:01:21.689> energy<00:01:22.350> weapon<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.189> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it is a ranged a gun energy weapon so it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.320 
it is a ranged a gun energy weapon so it
counts<00:01:23.460> as<00:01:23.670> an<00:01:23.820> energy<00:01:24.150> weapon<00:01:24.710> it<00:01:25.710> uses<00:01:26.330> 749

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
counts as an energy weapon it uses 749

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.010 
counts as an energy weapon it uses 749
stamina<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.820> customizable<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
stamina and it's a customizable to the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
stamina and it's a customizable to the
weapon<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> level<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.299> acquire

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
weapon or to the level that you acquire

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.200 
weapon or to the level that you acquire
it<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.820> up<00:01:35.970> with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it at so it's not going to go up with

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.350 
it at so it's not going to go up with
your<00:01:36.780> level<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.890> has<00:01:38.130> self<00:01:38.460> sacrifice<00:01:39.060> which

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
your level it has self sacrifice which

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.090 
your level it has self sacrifice which
is<00:01:39.509> agent<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.020> protect<00:01:40.259> allies<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.829> low

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
is agent will protect allies with low

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.359 
is agent will protect allies with low
health<00:01:41.400> after<00:01:42.140> protecting<00:01:43.140> allies<00:01:43.500> gain

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
health after protecting allies gain

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.840 
health after protecting allies gain
heroic<00:01:45.030> revival<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.740> what<00:01:46.979> her<00:01:47.130> oak<00:01:47.310> revival

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
heroic revival and what her oak revival

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.289 
heroic revival and what her oak revival
is<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:49.189> heals<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.520> allies<00:01:52.700> each<00:01:53.700> turn<00:01:54.090> I'm

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
is it heals your allies each turn I'm

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
is it heals your allies each turn I'm
guessing<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> doesn't<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.560> into<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.950> lot

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
guessing it doesn't really go into a lot

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.679 
guessing it doesn't really go into a lot
about<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.729> I've<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.270> played

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
about it and I've not actually played

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.630 
about it and I've not actually played
with<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> seems<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> good<00:01:59.579> thing

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
with it but it seems like a good thing

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.200 
with it but it seems like a good thing
if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:01.820> can't<00:02:02.820> really<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.090> it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
if you like the I can't really what it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.780 
if you like the I can't really what it
is<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.869> low<00:02:04.049> fees<00:02:04.549> one<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.670> has

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is the low fees one that has

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.639 
is the low fees one that has
self-sacrifice<00:02:06.600> on<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.530> this

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
self-sacrifice on it I think it's this

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.309 
self-sacrifice on it I think it's this
one<00:02:07.860> yeah<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.369> has<00:02:08.700> sacrifice<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:10.020> protects

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
one yeah it has sacrifice it protects

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.140 
one yeah it has sacrifice it protects
the<00:02:10.440> Allies<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.340> time<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.879> then<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
the Allies all the time and then you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.120 
the Allies all the time and then you
gain

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
gain

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.280 
gain
sacrificial<00:02:14.090> strength<00:02:14.600> if<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
sacrificial strength if you like that

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.950 
sacrificial strength if you like that
one<00:02:15.410> then<00:02:15.590> you'll<00:02:15.710> probably<00:02:15.980> like<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.960> plasma

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
one then you'll probably like the plasma

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.860 
one then you'll probably like the plasma
beam<00:02:18.170> gun<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.770> check<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.040> out<00:02:19.270> also<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.840> can

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
beam gun so check that out also you can

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.600 
beam gun so check that out also you can
