00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay so this is the installation video

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.670 
okay so this is the installation video
for<00:00:03.210> the<00:00:04.080> spacebar<00:00:06.230> we're<00:00:07.230> going<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> start

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
for the spacebar we're going to start

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.970 
for the spacebar we're going to start
out<00:00:07.830> by<00:00:08.040> looking<00:00:08.400> at<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.790> metal<00:00:09.300> plate<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:10.080> the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
out by looking at the metal plate on the

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.060 
out by looking at the metal plate on the
keyboard<00:00:11.490> itself<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.860> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
keyboard itself you can see that at the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.790 
keyboard itself you can see that at the
very<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.610> there's<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.240> metal<00:00:15.599> piece<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.770> a

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
very right there's a metal piece with a

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.670 
very right there's a metal piece with a
hole<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.430> middle<00:00:17.810> that<00:00:18.810> same<00:00:19.109> piece<00:00:19.410> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
hole in the middle that same piece is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.420 
hole in the middle that same piece is
here<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.670> very<00:00:20.910> left<00:00:22.010> they<00:00:23.010> both<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.400> a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
here at the very left they both have a

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.220 
here at the very left they both have a
hole<00:00:23.640> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.850> middle<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.390> they<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.689> grab<00:00:24.960> on

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
hole in the middle so they can grab on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.269 
hole in the middle so they can grab on
to<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.449> metal<00:00:27.449> wire<00:00:27.779> that's<00:00:28.710> underneath<00:00:29.990> the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
to a metal wire that's underneath the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.590 
to a metal wire that's underneath the
key<00:00:32.279> itself<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:34.579> we're<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> use<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
key itself so we're going to use the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.020 
key itself so we're going to use the
fitting<00:00:37.110> or<00:00:37.829> metal<00:00:38.489> pieces<00:00:39.000> next<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.050> those

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
fitting or metal pieces next to those

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.709 
fitting or metal pieces next to those
which<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.270> these<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:43.110> there's<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
which is these here there's two at the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.110 
which is these here there's two at the
top<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.710> holes<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> then

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
top here with holes in them and then

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.380 
top here with holes in them and then
there's<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.539> large<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:48.960> with<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> hook<00:00:50.390> make

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
there's one large one with a hook make

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.750 
there's one large one with a hook make
sure<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.020> different<00:00:52.379> keys

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
sure to look at the different keys

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.479 
sure to look at the different keys
because<00:00:55.039> sometimes<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.129> can<00:00:56.160> change

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
because sometimes they can change

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.029 
because sometimes they can change
position<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.510> large<00:00:57.899> hook<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
position the large hook can be at the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.130 
position the large hook can be at the
top<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.489> maybe<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:03.629> position

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
top or maybe to the side so the position

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
top or maybe to the side so the position
for<00:01:04.350> those<00:01:04.500> pieces<00:01:04.939> determines<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.180> position

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
for those pieces determines the position

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.109 
for those pieces determines the position
for<00:01:06.960> these<00:01:07.229> pieces<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.850> we're<00:01:08.970> going

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
for these pieces here what we're going

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
for these pieces here what we're going
to<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.810> determine<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.920> position<00:01:11.400> for

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
to do now is determine the position for

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.670 
to do now is determine the position for
these<00:01:11.729> two<00:01:11.970> pieces<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> click<00:01:13.500> them

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
these two pieces going to click them

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.999 
these two pieces going to click them
together<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.729> insert<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.530> onto

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
together then insert them you know onto

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
together then insert them you know onto
the<00:01:17.159> keyboard<00:01:17.869> we're<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.259> out

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the keyboard we're going to start out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.649 
the keyboard we're going to start out
with<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.710> large<00:01:19.920> piece<00:01:20.250> here<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.390> see

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

that at the top it has two holes like

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.960 
that at the top it has two holes like
rectangle<00:01:25.380> holes<00:01:25.590> those<00:01:26.369> are<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> go

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
rectangle holes those are going to go

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.840 
rectangle holes those are going to go
wherever<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.780> two<00:01:30.380> hooks<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:32.520> small

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
wherever the two hooks are two small

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.249 
wherever the two hooks are two small
hooks<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.630> they're<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.840> holes

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
hooks actually they're not holes

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.350 
hooks actually they're not holes
nevermind<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.610> small<00:01:35.880> holes<00:01:36.090> and

that<00:02:06.060> face<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.860> ahead<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.129> insert

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that face is up so go ahead and insert

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.760 
that face is up so go ahead and insert
those<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.690> holes<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.770> top

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
those two holes at the top

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.110 
those two holes at the top
wherever<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.130> two<00:02:12.310> small<00:02:12.670> hooks<00:02:12.910> are<00:02:13.770> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
wherever the two small hooks are and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.890 
wherever the two small hooks are and
push<00:02:16.120> down<00:02:16.440> fairly<00:02:17.440> hard<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.820> kind<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.630> down

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
push down fairly hard and kind of down

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.650 
push down fairly hard and kind of down
so<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> hook<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:21.130> grab<00:02:22.000> onto<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.510> metal

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
so that the hook can grab onto the metal

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.040 
so that the hook can grab onto the metal
plastic<00:02:23.530> pieces<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.480> get<00:02:25.660> your<00:02:25.810> next

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
plastic pieces then you get your next

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620

side<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:51.720> we're<00:04:52.720> going<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.930> determine<00:04:53.259> the

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:53.379 
side so we're going to determine the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.469 
side so we're going to determine the
position<00:04:53.560> for<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:54.009> spacebar<00:04:54.490> now<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:55.330> can

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
position for the spacebar now you can

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.839 
position for the spacebar now you can
see<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.169> top<00:04:56.199> it's<00:04:56.770> flat<00:04:57.219> and<00:04:57.520> over

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
see that at the top it's flat and over

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:00.570 
see that at the top it's flat and over
here<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.210> kind<00:04:58.449> of<00:04:58.860> it's<00:04:59.860> like<00:05:00.039> little<00:05:00.340> hill

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
going down so we're going to flip this

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.939 
going down so we're going to flip this
piece<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:04.990> way<00:05:06.449> don't<00:05:07.449> flip<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.810> piece<00:05:08.229> like

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
piece this way don't flip the piece like

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.550 
piece this way don't flip the piece like
