already<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.560> right<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> get-go<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
already know right from the get-go that

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.100 
already know right from the get-go that
there's<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:26.090> some<00:01:27.090> minor<00:01:28.009> pampy<00:01:29.840> switches<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
there's a some minor pampy switches and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.820 
there's a some minor pampy switches and
the<00:01:31.979> camera<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.180> press<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:34.020> two<00:01:34.619> or

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
the camera you have to press a or two or

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.050 
the camera you have to press a or two or
any<00:01:35.039> other<00:01:35.250> button<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:37.680> escape<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
any other button like that to escape the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.430 
any other button like that to escape the
intro<00:01:39.570> cameras<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:41.280> like

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:02:01.530 

this<00:01:46.440> track<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.190> too<00:01:47.250> small<00:01:48.319> my<00:01:49.319> opinion

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.110 

and<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:02.260> ramp<00:02:02.500> could<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.640> ramp<00:02:03.880> right

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
and the ramp could have the ramp right

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.609 
and the ramp could have the ramp right
here<00:02:04.150> could<00:02:04.810> have<00:02:04.990> been<00:02:05.200> expanded<00:02:06.160> on<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.530> you

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
here could have been expanded on so you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.700 
here could have been expanded on so you
could<00:02:08.860> get<00:02:09.040> across<00:02:09.929> instead<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.200> use<00:02:11.380> of<00:02:11.410> a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
could get across instead of the use of a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:22.130 
could get across instead of the use of a
cannon<00:02:12.100> which<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.550> redundant<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.540> me

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.300 

Wow

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.960 

there<00:02:25.910> could<00:02:26.209> also<00:02:26.239> be<00:02:26.630> some<00:02:27.020> moon<00:02:27.940> well<00:02:28.940> I

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
there could also be some moon well I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.760 
there could also be some moon well I
think<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.420> test<00:02:29.660> effects<00:02:30.050> is<00:02:30.260> fine

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:44.410 

brick

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.630 

so<00:02:45.420> i<00:02:45.450> would<00:02:45.780> highly<00:02:45.959> recommend<00:02:46.170> DC<00:02:46.890> Circuit

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.050 

and<00:02:52.300> he<00:02:52.750> does<00:02:52.960> state<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.850> texture<00:02:54.850> mapping

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
and he does state that texture mapping

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.960 
and he does state that texture mapping
in<00:02:55.300> this<00:02:55.450> track<00:02:55.690> also<00:02:55.959> need<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.470> be<00:02:56.620> done

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.010 

basically<00:03:00.970> that's<00:03:01.090> all<00:03:01.360> I<00:03:01.390> have<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:01.780> say<00:03:01.810> for
