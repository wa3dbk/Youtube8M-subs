00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.000 

hello<00:00:01.390> YouTube<00:00:01.780> once<00:00:02.080> again<00:00:02.260> I<00:00:02.409> have<00:00:02.560> my<00:00:02.770> car

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.010 
hello YouTube once again I have my car

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.139 
hello YouTube once again I have my car
running<00:00:03.220> on<00:00:03.550> vapor<00:00:04.200> here's<00:00:05.200> the<00:00:05.440> newer<00:00:05.620> setup

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
running on vapor here's the newer setup

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.790 
running on vapor here's the newer setup
I've<00:00:07.149> got<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:08.010> little<00:00:09.010> weak<00:00:09.340> on<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.469> bottom

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800 
I've got a little weak on the bottom

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.950 
I've got a little weak on the bottom
side<00:00:12.009> of<00:00:12.070> that<00:00:12.340> which<00:00:12.820> is<00:00:12.849> we<00:00:13.299> can<00:00:13.450> exhaust<00:00:13.780> gas

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
side of that which is we can exhaust gas

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740 
side of that which is we can exhaust gas
sure<00:00:16.960> it<00:00:17.109> could<00:00:17.260> run<00:00:17.500> better<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.300> wanted<00:00:19.689> to

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
sure it could run better but I wanted to

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.040 
sure it could run better but I wanted to
get<00:00:19.810> this<00:00:19.930> up<00:00:20.170> here<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.970> you<00:00:22.270> see<00:00:22.480> I've<00:00:22.600> got<00:00:22.779> the

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
get this up here is you see I've got the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.920 
get this up here is you see I've got the
exhaust<00:00:23.800> tube<00:00:24.279> and<00:00:24.789> exhaust<00:00:25.180> tooth<00:00:25.510> without<00:00:25.720> a

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:25.930 
exhaust tube and exhaust tooth without a

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.560 
exhaust tube and exhaust tooth without a
manifold<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.960> feed<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.320> vapor<00:00:30.330> through<00:00:31.330> my

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
manifold to feed the vapor through my

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.350 
manifold to feed the vapor through my
lumpy<00:00:32.610> third<00:00:33.610> book<00:00:33.850> in<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.840> heater<00:00:36.360> which

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
lumpy third book in to the heater which

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.870 
lumpy third book in to the heater which
is<00:00:37.510> on

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.260 

and<00:00:42.420> my<00:00:43.320> sight<00:00:43.590> glass<00:00:46.160> will<00:00:47.160> recur<00:00:47.490> this<00:00:47.670> part

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
and my sight glass will recur this part

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
and my sight glass will recur this part
WC<00:00:49.050> 2102<00:00:50.990> I'm<00:00:51.990> not<00:00:52.140> sure<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.470> we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
WC 2102 I'm not sure if we're going to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.390 
WC 2102 I'm not sure if we're going to
get<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:54.200> don't<00:00:55.200> usually<00:00:55.380> actually<00:00:55.740> see<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
get you don't usually actually see the

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:13.660 
get you don't usually actually see the
vapor

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.280 

maybe<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.000> picked<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.450> camera<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:15.930> wasn't

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
maybe that picked up on camera I wasn't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.850 
maybe that picked up on camera I wasn't
looking<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> screen

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.250 

but<00:01:24.790> i'm<00:01:24.850> pretty<00:01:25.030> sure<00:01:25.150> that<00:01:25.240> leak<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.780> helping

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
but i'm pretty sure that leak is helping

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.090 
but i'm pretty sure that leak is helping
me<00:01:26.410> I<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:27.340> very<00:01:27.910> very<00:01:28.120> slowly<00:01:28.510> get<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.560> RPMs

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
me I can very very slowly get the RPMs

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.000 
me I can very very slowly get the RPMs
up<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:31.210> another<00:01:31.510> thing<00:01:31.660> I<00:01:31.780> had<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.960> do<00:01:32.170> was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
up and another thing I had to do was

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.640 
up and another thing I had to do was
this<00:01:33.730> is<00:01:33.880> not<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> mass<00:01:34.300> airflow<00:01:34.570> sensor<00:01:34.780> forgot

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
this is not a mass airflow sensor forgot

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.120 
this is not a mass airflow sensor forgot
this<00:01:35.830> is<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> bashed<00:01:36.340> designed<00:01:37.740> air<00:01:38.740> flow<00:01:39.100> meter

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
this is a bashed designed air flow meter

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.610 
this is a bashed designed air flow meter
a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:41.200> flapper<00:01:41.530> inside<00:01:42.100> their<00:01:42.370> moves<00:01:42.760> this

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
a little flapper inside their moves this

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.460 
a little flapper inside their moves this
across<00:01:44.620> a<00:01:44.680> couple<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.190> potentiometers<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:47.290> on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
across a couple of potentiometers or on

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.630 
across a couple of potentiometers or on
the<00:01:47.560> circuit<00:01:47.950> here<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:49.120> I<00:01:49.150> had<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:50.640> adjust

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
the circuit here and so I had to adjust

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.680 
the circuit here and so I had to adjust
the<00:01:53.580> spring<00:01:54.580> wheel<00:01:54.820> here<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:57.479> increase<00:01:58.479> the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the spring wheel here to increase the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.870 
the spring wheel here to increase the
spring<00:01:58.960> tension<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.440> little<00:01:59.470> bit<00:01:59.830> just<00:02:00.640> for

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
spring tension a little bit just for

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.180 
spring tension a little bit just for
running<00:02:01.030> off<00:02:01.240> a<00:02:01.300> vapor<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:02.650> I<00:02:02.800> helped<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
running off a vapor and I helped a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.180 
running off a vapor and I helped a
slight<00:02:03.700> amount

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.570 

it's<00:02:09.119> running<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.630> see<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.080> patch<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.979> hole<00:02:11.010> some

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it's running I see the patch a hole some

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.250 
it's running I see the patch a hole some
more<00:02:11.730> fine-tuning

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.170 

but<00:02:16.799> if<00:02:16.890> he<00:02:17.010> actually<00:02:17.189> accelerates<00:02:17.939> low

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
but if he actually accelerates low

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.730 
but if he actually accelerates low
enough

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
enough

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.960 
enough
I<00:02:19.830> feel<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.130> get<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.430> thing<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.910> road

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.430 

but<00:02:29.980> yep<00:02:30.980> some<00:02:31.310> more<00:02:31.460> fine-tuning<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:33.290> will

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
but yep some more fine-tuning you will

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.100 
but yep some more fine-tuning you will
be<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.770> streets
