00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.870
 all hold for once as one 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.489
 widow or something to do is basically 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.930
 residents turn it on 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 I will play in the next game 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.410
 and and sits my opponent and he does 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 by players such as falco 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.030
 but only from persie and donate the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.589
 ikea well apparently we just build 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.780
 not win because this is not an easy one 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.729
 violation of smiling so I bring too 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 still them on a penalty and for us too 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.400
 niÃ«ns hospitality industry and that arrow that flies 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.720
 there and 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.580
 and then you immediately stand behind or behind and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 yes then i am a dick and then five mira 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 there will be a new boats balotelli 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
 certain times that shoots at the stake 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.740
 yes dory this had just lost it 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.200
 take him there and take a lookie guy this 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 Anyways always had to go all the way 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.829
 only towards the keeper 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.320
 I don't think so no well then I do n't 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.299
 no then so don't join s20 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.100
 After giving away of course, never could not 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.210
 a nice ball on sterling and study that 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.070
 takes on my and mine 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.759
 shooting then so state is inactive him 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.229
 by two 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.000
 with the full cart the delivery person 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710
 that meant 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.510
 a very nice final score can be as 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.310
 we continue like this and then a little later there 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.690
 goes young he passes by a man and 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.580
 who comes to the well to get past what he 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.720
 if margot runs through one then he goes one 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.220
 very stupid mistake but get it 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.690
 a piece of to the side and in ijssel 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.860
 once as slow as a potato 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.240
 take the no then we still have you 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.440
 well the cat with balotelli pratham 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.119
 sterling and sterling 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.650
 but he doesn't shoot that knife 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.090
 because then as long as you give one 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.110
 beautiful pass interference stern in 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.130
 lock set 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 for which this is all going to be good 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.570
 is it gonna be alright he'll shoot him 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.800
 in and as far as the two 72nd minute and as 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.150
 You already have two distances and the word 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.650
 two second go of course year on that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.330
 three two and now sterling also goes and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.209
 sterling who just shot him again 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.620
 lat and balotelli through the rebound your it 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.970
 way and then a little later 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 he goes balotelli who is coming so me 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.330
 Over the easter still very beautiful game on 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.130
 failures string that just takes again 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.060
 good to where your keeper has just returned 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 can have a moment 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.470
 so final score is 2 2 and after a draw 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.270
 gradually had a contract 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.220
 only i was so stupid again 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.320
 normal and our charney 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.670
 cool contract is to buy because yes you 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320
 can of course be better than in this case 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.390
 take a silver one that was 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.640
 so forget and so we just buy one 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.750
 few of those non charlie and of those 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.340
 contract immediately embarrassed me to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.200
 this new match this is against one 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 great earth someone who we accept 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.930
 salt and your friends list from i do 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.549
 just a game against him what he then 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.080
 also called level he comes in a him now 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.209
 immediately and so he scores the one 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.590
 zero and after 30 minutes he comes 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.810
 finally a good chance 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.340
 sterling deep voice and dude do you 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 do you guys think this is going in or out 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.360
 go this knife he goes in and the menu 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.360
 never the audience got loose 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.820
 and then you have to check and this is only the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.820
 a 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.609
 but yes in short one 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.409
 balls 13 very nice base on sterling 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.219
 and sterling has of course the pc goes off 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.989
 everyone beyond 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.129
 only this citizen come training that 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 in itself is logical because it is different 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.879
 I was by level the ref was light 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.379
 immediately a red k and also the rich and 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.269
 each he his very pretty free one on one 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.069
 stairs on a very nice place and behind the 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.840
 ball now stands daniel alves and then half is 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.939
 who see these things while the and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.260
 she would stay with two one before and there 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.209
 it not because of the extra time 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 the first minute comes a very nice ball 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.870
 ball the e-book comes out to then 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.189
 the logical burano around it and then we do 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.540
 another kind of show for something or would he 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.829
 its the it would just be three one and 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.639
 then we win this competition with 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.689
 three one 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.000
 and that remained a bit more coins 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:53.760
 in encouraging and he did that he a 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.650
 kind of 3kb there or something you go to the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.030
 glove 3kw I said ok yes is good yes 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.799
 it's obviously a lot of nothing 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.629
 margin of no matter we have three carla 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.340
 with a yes and of course you still have 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.450
 bonus coins and after this match I had 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.700
 actually also two other port 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.590
 done in the three four in that vision 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.819
 only unfortunately j sports do not have those 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.319
 are included 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.549
 only i was it by her i was it 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.200
 I have had twice an evening 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.639
 recorded and then I had to eat immediately 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.410
 will end in adolescent no 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.079
 it of course to show it because 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.799
 I lose 500 so because yes it was me 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.449
 Nope 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.979

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.440

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.930

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.110
 to buy 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.539
 many of you are pitfalls of persia 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.010
 and it is also huge to see who I am 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.330
 to buy something not for the 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.250
 images water recorded earlier 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.380
 I can't do anything with it now 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.940
 I already looked at who I am for this 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.659
 would buy and I already have something in it 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.889
 thoughts 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.270

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.270
