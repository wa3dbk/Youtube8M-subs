00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.740
 the side here to give you a tip today I'm trying one of them lilac 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.219
 find it difficult to see 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.579
 move your professional camera in the right place 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.039
 the source said, I will accompany

 He is jealous that he is defenseless in the Senate. 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.009
 find difficulty in 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.009
 the blue part the list because it is very annoying 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.689
 two weeks ago 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.689
 Very simple to read. 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.880
 the hard way 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.910
 keep trying 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.200
 and pressing the 0 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.130
 reaching 0 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 representing the heroes 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.400
 the plot is achieved 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.780
 another way is that each one in that line 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.160
 famous team of romario plot right click right incipient 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.880
 Ariana 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.060
 if selected 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.680
 some piece of sharia you think of what is best 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.050
 protect the screen or as if one of those before was 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.300
 comes closer so you can see the camera is that you can see 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.740
 the camera to see 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 this line is giving this line with presentations 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 Can you get your camera, but Roberto here? 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 to vote 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.820
 Do you follow the best? 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 What happens in your understanding? 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 but only now you cobalt 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.120
 with a colleague, a part of it just does not seem to us great 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 that's what we wanted another way to do it 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
 another decent way to position your camera better 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 Let's go patient for the vote. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.910
 spelling 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.680
 questions a neighborhood flavio clicks in the center of the square that is what people 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.820
 Do you want to win at the moment? 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.400
 the river bowl losing 3 pedro stirred quoted squares design perfectly 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.409
 his innocence 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.199
 despite the space 

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.719
 yes before 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.799
 then on the field here 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.909
 I'm quiet with nothing India says pressure companies if they can have it all 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:24.019
 the outlines - I could see better that we created 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 but there is a company also power was the best 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.169
 still in the camera 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.709
 selected 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.929
 nothing homicide 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.239
 I ask another keyboard 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.769
 this minor appears and selected the active unintentional first offense 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.339
 option 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.549
 we select 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.869
 It's for now that we have a line in case the camera is turned on 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.389
 our 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.739
 then say 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.099
 select camera 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.049
 I'm going to talk, watch. 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.569
 in the second frame 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 that the camera account always presided over them 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.449
 so if you can move 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:08.449
 your camera working with what you want 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.579
 you will also select the angle 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.579
 soap operas that the camera is always pointed at him 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.589
 the leader of the beneficial key 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.089
 a very interesting point not 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.049
 one more tip is to select the camera by clicking on that last line 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.609
 Jackie did not contain anything. 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:34.249
 and novel 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.629
 around here also you can do this conventional day 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.999
 press the middle mouse button in November front 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.999
 and back your fingers if you can give 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.069
 left click to stop 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.249
