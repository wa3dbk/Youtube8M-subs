now<00:00:06.790> that<00:00:06.940> we<00:00:07.060> have<00:00:07.090> the<00:00:07.300> word<00:00:07.540> at<00:00:07.840> the<00:00:07.930> correct

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.290 
now that we have the word at the correct

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.320 
now that we have the word at the correct
temperature<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:09.639> going<00:00:09.760> to<00:00:09.820> add<00:00:10.000> it<00:00:10.150> to<00:00:10.300> our

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
temperature we're going to add it to our

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.260 
temperature we're going to add it to our
primary<00:00:10.690> fermentation<00:00:11.200> bucket<00:00:11.969> I've<00:00:12.969> already

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
primary fermentation bucket I've already

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.600 
primary fermentation bucket I've already
added<00:00:13.660> three<00:00:14.170> gallons<00:00:14.590> of<00:00:14.770> cool<00:00:14.980> water<00:00:15.280> to

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
added three gallons of cool water to

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.880 
added three gallons of cool water to
this<00:00:15.760> bucket<00:00:16.209> and<00:00:16.390> now<00:00:17.350> I'm<00:00:17.470> going<00:00:17.650> to<00:00:17.710> pour

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
this bucket and now I'm going to pour

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:45.390 
this bucket and now I'm going to pour
the<00:00:18.070> word<00:00:18.250> into<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.869> bucket

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600 

I<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:47.440> to<00:00:47.470> use<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> strainer<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.130> strain<00:00:48.280> all

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
I like to use a strainer to strain all

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.020 
I like to use a strainer to strain all
the<00:00:48.670> hops<00:00:48.880> up<00:00:50.040> now<00:00:51.040> you<00:00:51.100> can't<00:00:51.370> see<00:00:51.670> this<00:00:51.820> on

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
the hops up now you can't see this on

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.410 
the hops up now you can't see this on
the<00:00:52.090> camera<00:00:52.510> but<00:00:53.250> we're<00:00:54.250> just<00:00:54.280> under<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.180> five

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the camera but we're just under the five

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.210 
the camera but we're just under the five
gallon<00:00:55.840> mark<00:00:55.960> on<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.290> bucket<00:00:56.620> because<00:00:56.770> of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
gallon mark on the bucket because of

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.060 
gallon mark on the bucket because of
boil<00:00:57.550> off<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.900> what<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.170> did<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.350> just<00:00:59.560> take<00:00:59.890> some

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
boil off so what I did is just take some

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.810 
boil off so what I did is just take some
more<00:01:00.220> water<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:03.540> we<00:01:04.540> want<00:01:04.809> to<00:01:05.020> go<00:01:05.260> to<00:01:05.820> just

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
more water and we want to go to just

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.350 
more water and we want to go to just
above<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.150> five<00:01:07.480> gallon<00:01:07.870> mark<00:01:09.360> because

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
above the five gallon mark because

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.240 
above the five gallon mark because
there's<00:01:10.660> going<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.930> be<00:01:10.990> some<00:01:11.290> left<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.950> we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
there's going to be some left when we

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.190 
there's going to be some left when we
got<00:01:15.790> our<00:01:15.970> second<00:01:16.300> stage<00:01:16.450> fermentation<00:01:17.110> and

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
got our second stage fermentation and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
got our second stage fermentation and
also<00:01:17.880> when<00:01:18.880> we<00:01:19.030> finally<00:01:19.360> bottle<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.900> beer<00:01:21.060> so

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
also when we finally bottle the beer so

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.570 
also when we finally bottle the beer so
now<00:01:22.210> we've<00:01:22.420> got<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.720> right<00:01:22.869> level<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:24.310> want<00:01:24.520> to

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
now we've got the right level we want to

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:33.660 
now we've got the right level we want to
do<00:01:24.640> next<00:01:24.820> is<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.690> our<00:01:25.840> yeast<00:01:32.430> after<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> add

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
do next is that our yeast after the add

what<00:02:59.390> this<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.660> going<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> do<00:03:00.050> is<00:03:00.770> as<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:04.060> sugar

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
what this is going to do is as the sugar

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.600 
what this is going to do is as the sugar
starts<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:05.960> be<00:03:06.020> eaten<00:03:06.200> by<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.440> yeast<00:03:06.920> it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
starts to be eaten by the yeast it

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.790 
starts to be eaten by the yeast it
produces<00:03:08.120> carbon<00:03:08.450> dioxide<00:03:08.840> bubbles<00:03:09.050> you<00:03:09.620> see

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
produces carbon dioxide bubbles you see

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.870 
produces carbon dioxide bubbles you see
when<00:03:09.920> i<00:03:09.950> press<00:03:10.190> down<00:03:10.400> on<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.670> how<00:03:10.820> the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
when i press down on this how the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.330 
when i press down on this how the
airlock<00:03:11.240> and<00:03:11.450> bounces<00:03:11.780> up<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:11.990> down<00:03:12.340> what

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
airlock and bounces up and down what

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.370 
airlock and bounces up and down what
that<00:03:13.520> does<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.730> a<00:03:14.060> lot<00:03:14.300> of<00:03:14.510> bubbles<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.960> escape

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
that does is a lot of bubbles to escape

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.800 
that does is a lot of bubbles to escape
but<00:03:16.340> doesn't<00:03:16.670> allow<00:03:16.790> any<00:03:16.970> air<00:03:17.270> back<00:03:17.600> down

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.740 
but doesn't allow any air back down
inside<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.940> we're<00:03:20.090> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.270> put<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.690> a

inside so we're going to put this in a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.440 
inside so we're going to put this in a
cool<00:03:20.930> dark<00:03:21.080> place<00:03:21.170> for<00:03:21.680> about<00:03:22.180> three<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.210> four

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
cool dark place for about three to four

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.990 
cool dark place for about three to four
days<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.220> then<00:03:25.220> we're<00:03:25.460> going<00:03:25.580> to<00:03:25.640> go<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.820> a

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
days and then we're going to go to a

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.950 
days and then we're going to go to a
second<00:03:26.450> stage<00:03:26.630> fermentation
