00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and I stocked up so if you can't find it

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
and I stocked up so if you can't find it
don't<00:01:05.070> worry<00:01:05.250> about<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.760> kind<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
don't worry about it it just kind of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.929 
don't worry about it it just kind of
gives<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.720> kielbasa<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.340> kick<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> it

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
gives the kielbasa a little kick to it

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.750 
gives the kielbasa a little kick to it
and<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> chili<00:01:10.979> pepper<00:01:11.159> already<00:01:11.610> does

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and but the chili pepper already does

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
and but the chili pepper already does
that<00:01:11.790> for<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.750> kind<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.990> adds<00:01:13.500> a

that for you so it just kind of adds a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
find this on amazon.com I did not see

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
find this on amazon.com I did not see
this<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> Target<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.820> least<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> three

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this in Target at least the three

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
this in Target at least the three
targets<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.930> went<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> didn't<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.920> them

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
targets that I went to I didn't see them

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
targets that I went to I didn't see them
but<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.270> is<00:01:24.420> good<00:01:24.600> stuff<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.049> good<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.320> pork

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but this is good stuff it's good on pork

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.789 
but this is good stuff it's good on pork
as<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.000> I've<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.720> kielbasa<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
as well and then I've got a kielbasa a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240 
as well and then I've got a kielbasa a
medium<00:01:29.640> yellow<00:01:29.880> onion<00:01:30.259> I<00:01:31.259> tend<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.710> find<00:01:31.979> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
medium yellow onion I tend to find that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.249 
medium yellow onion I tend to find that
the<00:01:32.610> yellow<00:01:32.939> red<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.210> orange<00:01:33.659> bell<00:01:33.869> peppers

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the yellow red and orange bell peppers

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.960 
the yellow red and orange bell peppers
are<00:01:34.409> more<00:01:34.680> sweeter<00:01:35.009> than<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> greens<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
are more sweeter than the greens so I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.690 
are more sweeter than the greens so I
gravitate<00:01:36.570> toward<00:01:36.840> these<00:01:37.110> colors<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.430> I'm

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
gravitate toward these colors so I'm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.819 
gravitate toward these colors so I'm
gonna<00:01:38.850> chop<00:01:39.540> those<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.560> secret

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
gonna chop those up and then the secret

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.350 
gonna chop those up and then the secret
ingredient<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.610> know<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> sounds<00:01:42.180> totally

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.580 
goes really well with kielbasa so I
thought<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.720> creating<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.110> recipe

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
thought when I was creating this recipe

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.810 
thought when I was creating this recipe
a<00:01:49.619> long<00:01:49.770> time<00:01:49.950> ago<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.340> thought<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> would<00:01:50.790> be

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
a long time ago I thought that would be

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.370 
a long time ago I thought that would be
really<00:01:51.149> nice<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.630> ended<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:51.930> working<00:01:52.079> out

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
really nice and it ended up working out

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.910 
really nice and it ended up working out
really<00:01:52.619> great

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
really great

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.999 
really great
so<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.520> serve<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.240> over<00:01:54.420> rice<00:01:54.710> let<00:01:55.710> me<00:01:55.829> show

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.520 
you guys how I make this dish it's
really<00:01:59.369> easy<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.850> forgot<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.840> mention<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.380> need

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
really easy I forgot to mention we need

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
really easy I forgot to mention we need
some<00:02:01.770> garlic<00:02:02.009> as<00:02:02.340> well

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
some garlic as well

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.440 

i<00:02:05.720> roughly<00:02:06.720> chopped<00:02:07.080> up<00:02:07.230> about<00:02:07.530> four<00:02:07.890> or<00:02:08.039> five

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
i roughly chopped up about four or five

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.200 
i roughly chopped up about four or five
cloves<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.690> garlic<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:11.340> did<00:02:11.700> rough<00:02:11.940> chop

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
cloves of garlic and I did rough chop

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.060 
cloves of garlic and I did rough chop
but<00:02:12.540> if<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.020> don't<00:02:13.380> really<00:02:13.560> like<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.830> flavor

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
but if you don't really like the flavor

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.630 
but if you don't really like the flavor
of<00:02:14.190> garlic<00:02:14.430> you<00:02:14.850> can<00:02:14.940> either<00:02:15.270> omit<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.870> or<00:02:16.020> just

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
of garlic you can either omit it or just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.700 
of garlic you can either omit it or just
mince<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.170> small

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
mince it so that it's just really small

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.990 
mince it so that it's just really small
and<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.310> get<00:02:20.460> chunks<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
and you don't really get chunks of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.090 
and you don't really get chunks of
garlic<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.200> think<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.530> adds<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.800> nice<00:02:22.920> little

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
garlic but I think it adds a nice little

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.610 
garlic but I think it adds a nice little
flavor<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:24.180> are<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.360> garlic<00:02:24.810> loving<00:02:25.110> family

flavor and we are a garlic loving family

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.290 
flavor and we are a garlic loving family

and now I'm just gonna kind of slice
them<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.870> thickness<00:02:55.500> maybe<00:02:55.950> about<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.400> big

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.510 

now<00:04:32.080> we're<00:04:32.260> going<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.410> add<00:04:32.650> our<00:04:32.950> bell<00:04:33.460> peppers

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.900 

and<00:04:36.610> except<00:04:37.830> we<00:04:38.830> don't<00:04:38.949> want<00:04:39.190> to<00:04:39.280> put<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.610> too

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
and except we don't want to put this too

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.089 
and except we don't want to put this too
long<00:04:40.150> because<00:04:40.449> we<00:04:40.930> still<00:04:41.199> want<00:04:41.259> everything<00:04:42.009> to

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
long because we still want everything to

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.909 
long because we still want everything to
have<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.310> little<00:04:42.610> bite<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:42.849> it<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.210> little<00:04:43.449> crunch

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
so pretty much about the same timing for

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.809 
so pretty much about the same timing for
the<00:04:47.470> bell<00:04:47.620> pepper<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:48.009> about<00:04:48.220> five<00:04:48.460> minutes
