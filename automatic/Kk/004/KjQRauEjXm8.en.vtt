 as many professionals as possible 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.370

 reference to pear 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.190
 all vegetarians and for all those who want to become such over the years 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.250
 future x will always be more waaa 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.340
 ah if we want that it was to those that are the estimates l 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.649
 Major survey topics have been made naryto 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.439
 female doctor 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.639
 she often says that in a plant-based diet one does not 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:29.360
 it's about removing food but adding more 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 explain what he means 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.900
 well if I like you and this type of delivery starts from the consideration that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.650
 a diet every time in life bitterly 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.790
 lacking in food variety fireplaces 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.500
 so here being as lacking as the civic network also lies to the point of 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.520
 nutritional view this criterion my mind 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340
 should not be applied 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.170
 add to any type of diet so even to the vegetarian diet 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
 so in a vegetarian diet you are important 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.950
 for those who pass a vegetarian diet don't start 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:15.399
 removing animal foods and but starting by adding more and more plant foods 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.099
 variety number of plant foods maybe cbt 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.540
 if little known little used gave to be used instead of 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.859
 usually 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.529
 until practically no more space is left in the diet, however 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:33.079
 the inclusion of animal judges who 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:33.769
 Street 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.769
 first seara sera used to consume 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.199
 independent 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:45.439
 what are the basic ingredients of a 100% vegetable diet 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:51.119
 Basic elements consist of rich foods and make up 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.820
 vegetable food groups and yes 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.649
 we say that for practical reasons paul have been 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.629
 Well 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.169
 from lake batini i need in what is the vegetarian pyramid 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.800
 then cereals are obviously made up of cereals 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.589
 in the major cereal mib minor and it's a real wedding little bit there 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.449
 hey duccio in what foods rich in protein in the pyramid that is 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.329
 consisting of legumes from nuts and other foods 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.889
 hey soy derivatives such as printing - hopefully we say 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:27.959
 That 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.369
 and then there is the vegetable hardly its ten abundancia because it is the food in 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.440
 absolute most valuable for our health catch 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.729
 sa donato 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:41.379
 it's peace the fruit and then there are videos so they are obviously not estranged 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.379
 such expenses 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:46.629
 almost never born 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.999
 tine can be prevented with this type of feeding 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
 and which can even be cure 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:04:02.529
 then the scientific studies that are now ebay put solid banks on 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:03.210
 this 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.789
 at the moment they tell us that people 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:10.629
 vegetarian people who consume high amounts of plant foods a year 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.850
 bury schio reduced by many 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.690
 chronic diseases 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.320
 palate hepatology which are extremely widespread now nx 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.570
 western countries precisely because sebastiano 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 correlated to the Cilentan law habits above all on the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.840
 here a thousand diet I just said the main diseases that can be 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.660
 prevented in this with this type of feeding alone. this marks here 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.900
 then 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.560
 in cardiovascular diseases and it has been shown that vegetarians are a risk 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.689
 d delphi 5 25% less of developing cardiovascular disease 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.769
 some types of cancer and especially prostate and neck cancer 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.150
 then there is a reduced risk domino incidence of overweight obesity 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.360
 via third parties 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.020
 hypertension 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.599
 some studies are suggesting to us that there may be a reduced risk of 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:03.699
 osteoporosis 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.009
 sale 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 Alzheimer's-type dementia 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.259
 inspiring treatment 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.120
 treatment beppe. like these 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.870
 these hurt the principle is what a disease when 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.190
 is caused by a factor eliminating that blemish factor this summer 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.379
 can regress 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.960
 these same diseases that are accepted can also be cured 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.259
 with this type of diet especially with the vegan diet then 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.360
 abbas excluded from plant foods and low fat 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.219
 there are some and he controlled clinical studies that show how it is 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.120
 It is possible to get the disease regression to a stop 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.460
 cardiovascular 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.570
 of diabetes hypertension 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.010
 overweight obesity and even rheumatoid Africa with care every age. of this 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.460
 genus found without often need to put limits on calories portions 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.470
 because it is externally satiating cb that
