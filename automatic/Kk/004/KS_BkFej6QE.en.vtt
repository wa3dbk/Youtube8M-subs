00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.410
 previously not done and this cartoon based 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.270
 on marvel big heroes x city 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.300
 heroes who managed to grasp on 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.300

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 another character gum and ralf 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.700
 the main character of the same name as the cartoon 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.830
 as the villain of the game about Felix 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.850
 writer 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.220
 the police station we can notice 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 the poster on it depicts the wanted 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.330
 hans from the cartoon cold heart in 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 the same scene can be seen two more 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.800
 Easter eggs that send us to the cartoon 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 volt on this photo we see one of 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.729
 characters cartoon and ester she this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 volts look at his turnip to 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 beak I give this stick somewhere saw 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.539
 Hans from a cold heart apparently strongly 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 annoyed hero in one of the scenes we can 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.030
 notice his statue that will figure 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.390
 missax fighter missile 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.060
 block 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.740
 I cry with happiness once the cartoon though 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.200
 somehow refers to the marvel universe 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 we have a cameo wall 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.479
 It has long become a tradition and here he is the father 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.479
 Freeda our urchin everywhere ripened father 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.880
 how much we have to tell each other 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.960
 many comic characters never arrived 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.880
 before the cartoon 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 due to problems with getting copyright 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.330
 right the protagonist changed their 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.910
 appearance and also some 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.500
 ability to talk about the characters say 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.930
 what's in cartoons for doing about 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.210
 seven hundred unique characters for 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.900
 comparison in the cold heart was 270 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.210
 only 185 characters were formed okay 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.190
 you athletic body technique 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.080
 motion gogogo damage received from 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.120
 professional skaters character 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.500
 America was copied from such actors as 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.300
 john vane cl Eastwood 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.730
 and Gary bought his time 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.560
 embodied the images of the legendary 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.360
 caba wild west animators 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.250
 working on the image of Freddie 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.920
 drew inspiration he's standing on a board 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.650
 becoming skateboarders and surfers then i 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.510
 In general, we â€™ve gotten five months of our route 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.260
 days so then five days 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.640
 set takes twisted and five but 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.200
 working on improving combat 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.150
 technicians beimaks animators drew 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.250
 focus on the popular eastern species 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 martial arts karate for detailed 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.820
 studying this technique team 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.070
 went to martial arts studio 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.690
 where they turned to carat masters with 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.400
 request to demonstrate standing on 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.500
 lap a few tricks from this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.880
 ancient practice because it is in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.620
 kneeling human body 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.590
 becomes proportional torso 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.450
 Beymax And 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:30.940
 put yako 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:32.500
 and styles as we remember hero invented 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.599
 small micro bots which 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.760
 grouped could apply any 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.349
 form before you implement this idea 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.340
 filmmakers got acquainted with 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.440
 works of scientists 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.019
 working on creating and exploring 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000
 it is necessary robots creators of the picture were convinced 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.680
 that despite the fact that the prototype in such 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.019
 robots which collected hero until 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.940
 exists theoretically they are quite 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:57.040
 possible creators of the picture is very 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.410
 Seriously approached graphic content 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 film picture artists used 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.519
 the real city plan san francisco his 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.709
 created it in the cartoon down to 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.140
 location of streets and neighborhoods mixed like 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.849
 everyone knows with Tokyo's styling 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.959
 the result in the cartoon is impossible to find 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.810
 the same camp 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.489
 even though they all look like one of the most 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.979
 great animation puzzles was lighting 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:19.660
 beymaks vinyl suit 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.120
 to understand how you should 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.260
 look like a robot with different lighting 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.180
 the creators had to study in detail 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.700
 Lisa's conventional lighting sword 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.210
 which served as a prototype for beimax 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.220
 he is like a big breeze don't be offended 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.720
 technical director of the film admitted 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.710
 which is usually during computer 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.050
 processing in computer memory 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.150
 all images are laid 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.280
 however, with the city of heroes it is not rolled 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 the whole image was just impossible 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.389
 fit in the same computer creators 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.490
 I had to share the prices for the layers that 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.870
 processed separately and only 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.870
 then they gathered the final image 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.279
 right ok that's such a city 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.619
 heroes like easter eggs want 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.569
