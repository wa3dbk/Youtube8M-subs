information can't really be shared

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.850 
information can't really be shared
anyway<00:00:56.600> because<00:00:56.870> James<00:00:57.230> gathered<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.710> from

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
anyway because James gathered it from

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.470 
anyway because James gathered it from
industry<00:00:58.250> people<00:00:58.399> he<00:00:58.610> works<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:58.850> other<00:00:59.360> than

industry people he works with other than

industry people he works with other than
that<00:00:59.719> though<00:00:59.930> all<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.289> information<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:00.829> use

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
that though all the information we use

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.680 
that though all the information we use
is<00:01:01.219> publicly<00:01:01.610> available<00:01:01.699> on<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.210> internet<00:01:02.510> or

through the u.s. Library System we try
very<00:01:04.759> hard<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.300> keep<00:01:05.420> things<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:05.840> are

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
very hard to keep things that are

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.900 
very hard to keep things that are
speculative<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.649> a<00:01:06.740> speculative<00:01:07.160> voice<00:01:07.460> like

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
speculative in a speculative voice like

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.520 
speculative in a speculative voice like
the<00:01:08.119> possibilities<00:01:08.660> of<00:01:08.810> tangential<00:01:09.289> learning

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the possibilities of tangential learning

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.440 
the possibilities of tangential learning
for<00:01:09.649> example<00:01:09.680> we<00:01:10.340> also<00:01:10.460> try<00:01:10.820> to<00:01:10.880> always<00:01:11.060> call

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
for example we also try to always call

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.029 
for example we also try to always call
out<00:01:11.600> when<00:01:11.720> we're<00:01:11.930> making<00:01:12.200> a<00:01:12.259> logical<00:01:12.680> leap<00:01:12.860> in

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
out when we're making a logical leap in

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.620 
out when we're making a logical leap in
an<00:01:13.130> episode<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:13.640> suggest<00:01:14.149> other<00:01:14.240> valid

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
an episode and suggest other valid

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.179 
an episode and suggest other valid
possibilities<00:01:15.290> but<00:01:15.619> we're<00:01:15.890> going<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.040> miss

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
possibilities but we're going to miss

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.190 
possibilities but we're going to miss
this<00:01:16.340> one<00:01:16.400> sometimes<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.180> fact<00:01:17.570> check<00:01:17.840> us<00:01:17.990> and

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
this one sometimes so fact check us and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.539 
this one sometimes so fact check us and
dig<00:01:18.380> deeper<00:01:18.680> wherever<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.010> can<00:01:19.220> that's

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
dig deeper wherever you can that's

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.679 
dig deeper wherever you can that's
actually<00:01:19.880> something<00:01:20.030> I'd<00:01:20.180> love<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.540> see<00:01:20.659> come

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
most importantly it's a sign that EA
