in a brain and a shot as long if you

in a brain and a shot as long if you
look<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.079> shot<00:00:43.290> I've<00:00:43.410> got<00:00:43.559> here<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
look at this shot I've got here on the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
look at this shot I've got here on the
table<00:00:44.070> I've<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> cue<00:00:45.210> ball<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.840> eight

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
table I've got a cue ball and an eight

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
table I've got a cue ball and an eight
ball<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.860> five<00:00:47.129> feet<00:00:47.370> between

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
ball there's about five feet between

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
ball there's about five feet between
them<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.809> for<00:00:48.989> most<00:00:49.200> players<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> would

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
them and and for most players that would

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
them and and for most players that would
be<00:00:49.829> considered<00:00:50.190> our<00:00:50.250> role<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> long<00:00:50.969> shot

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
be considered our role to be a long shot

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.450 
be considered our role to be a long shot
however<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.710> actually<00:00:52.890> explain<00:00:53.340> what

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
however I want to actually explain what

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.130 
however I want to actually explain what
a<00:00:53.520> long<00:00:53.760> shot<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.120> by<00:00:54.300> simply<00:00:54.600> doing<00:00:54.870> something

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
a long shot is by simply doing something

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.540 
a long shot is by simply doing something
very<00:00:55.170> simple<00:00:55.710> by<00:00:55.770> moving<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.219> from<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
very simple by moving back from the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.520 
very simple by moving back from the
table<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.930> gonna<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.260> up

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
table like this and I'm gonna back up

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.740 
table like this and I'm gonna back up
all<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.190> way<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.449> if<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.600> had

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
all the way back like this now if I had

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
all the way back like this now if I had
room<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.109> might<00:01:01.260> even<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.680> another<00:01:02.070> 15<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
room I might even back up another 15 or

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.910 
room I might even back up another 15 or
20<00:01:02.820> feet<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> illustrate<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> point<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
20 feet just to illustrate the point but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.399 
20 feet just to illustrate the point but
if<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> am<00:01:05.939> right<00:01:06.180> now

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
if you look at this where I am right now

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.690 
if you look at this where I am right now
this<00:01:07.409> would<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.710> considered<00:01:08.040> an<00:01:08.250> extra<00:01:08.549> long

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this would be considered an extra long

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.140 
this would be considered an extra long
shot<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> long<00:01:10.409> shot<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.150> because

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
shot or really a long shot so because

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.320 
shot or really a long shot so because
the<00:01:12.299> brain<00:01:12.540> perceives<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> distance<00:01:13.890> greater

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the brain perceives the distance greater

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.510 
the brain perceives the distance greater
you<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.869> truly<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> long<00:01:16.740> shot<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.280> pool

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you now have truly the long shot in pool

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.730 
you now have truly the long shot in pool
if<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.270> come<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.689> closer<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> shot<00:01:19.590> like

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
if I come then closer to the shot like

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.310 
if I come then closer to the shot like
this<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.060> shot<00:01:21.270> becomes<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> refer

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
this then the shot becomes what I refer

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
this then the shot becomes what I refer
to<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.619> short<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.009> disguise<00:01:23.400> because<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to as short in disguise because the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
to as short in disguise because the
brain<00:01:24.180> perceives<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.780> differently<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
brain perceives it differently in that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.370 
brain perceives it differently in that
mental<00:01:26.040> imagery<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.450> order<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
mental imagery so in order to take this

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.770 
mental imagery so in order to take this
to<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:29.579> game<00:01:29.820> situation<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> would<00:01:30.750> be

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to the your game situation it would be

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
to the your game situation it would be
very<00:01:30.960> simple<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> shot<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
very simple that if you had a shot that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.530 
very simple that if you had a shot that
you<00:01:32.430> perceive<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.939> long<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.360> whatever

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
you perceive this long for whatever

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.510 
you perceive this long for whatever
reason<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.650> simply<00:01:34.829> backup<00:01:35.369> from<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
reason you would simply backup from the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
reason you would simply backup from the
shot<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.820> take<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> couple<00:01:36.360> paces<00:01:36.840> back<00:01:37.020> like

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
shot just take a couple paces back like

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
shot just take a couple paces back like
this<00:01:37.560> even<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.579> move<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.970> only<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.420> or

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this even if you move back only three or

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.330 
this even if you move back only three or
four<00:01:39.659> feet<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.470> perceiving<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> longer

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
four feet you're perceiving that longer

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.789 
four feet you're perceiving that longer
shot<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.450> look<00:01:42.540> at<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> shot<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.380> then

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
shot you would look at the shot and then

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.109 
shot you would look at the shot and then
when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.009> come<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.220> into<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> shot<00:01:44.909> like

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
when you come back into the shot like

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.789 
when you come back into the shot like
this<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.930> get<00:01:46.049> ready<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.350> shoot<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this and you get ready to shoot it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.980 
this and you get ready to shoot it
you're<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.939> shooting<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> short<00:01:48.750> shot

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
you're actually shooting that short shot

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.480 
you're actually shooting that short shot
in<00:01:49.110> disguise<00:01:49.439> even<00:01:49.920> though<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
in disguise even though it's the same

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
in disguise even though it's the same
length<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> first<00:01:52.020> started

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
length as it was when you first started

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.770 
length as it was when you first started
so<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.399> brain<00:01:53.670> perceives<00:01:54.240> things<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
so the brain perceives things in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.090 
so the brain perceives things in
different<00:01:54.930> ways<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.829> actually

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
different ways but we have to actually

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
different ways but we have to actually
train<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.640> brain<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.540> look<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.840> things

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
train the brain to look at things

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.120 
train the brain to look at things
differently<00:01:58.500> than<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:58.799> we've<00:01:59.009> always

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
differently than the way we've always

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
differently than the way we've always
either<00:01:59.430> been<00:01:59.579> told<00:01:59.820> or<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> way<00:02:00.240> we've<00:02:00.390> read

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
either been told or the way we've read

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.240 
either been told or the way we've read
it<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> book<00:02:01.049> or<00:02:01.200> whatever<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> situation

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it in a book or whatever the situation

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.399 
it in a book or whatever the situation
might<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> start<00:02:04.200> looking
