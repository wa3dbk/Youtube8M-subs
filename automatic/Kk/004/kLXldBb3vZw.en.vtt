it's<00:03:07.030> really<00:03:07.209> hard<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.480> see<00:03:07.720> steel<00:03:08.230> light<00:03:08.500> in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
it's really hard to see steel light in

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.039 
it's really hard to see steel light in
here<00:03:08.799> much<00:03:09.040> all<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.450> original<00:03:10.569> stock

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
here much all the the original stock

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.430 
here much all the the original stock
headlight<00:03:11.440> wires<00:03:11.650> they<00:03:12.370> plug<00:03:12.700> into<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.090> and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
headlight wires they plug into this and

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.170 
headlight wires they plug into this and
this<00:03:14.440> goes<00:03:14.680> into<00:03:14.859> the<00:03:15.010> ballast<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.639> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
this goes into the ballast and the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.569 
this goes into the ballast and the
ballast<00:03:16.510> wire<00:03:16.840> right<00:03:17.139> here<00:03:17.200> goes<00:03:17.920> back<00:03:18.159> out<00:03:18.400> to

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
ballast wire right here goes back out to

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.059 
ballast wire right here goes back out to
the<00:03:18.700> new<00:03:18.819> HID<00:03:19.209> bulb<00:03:19.569> and<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:20.290> literally<00:03:20.680> put<00:03:20.950> the

really not need for it the HIDs are

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.740 
really not need for it the HIDs are
bright<00:03:42.549> enough<00:03:42.760> as<00:03:42.970> they<00:03:43.120> are<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.510> uh<00:03:44.489> uh
