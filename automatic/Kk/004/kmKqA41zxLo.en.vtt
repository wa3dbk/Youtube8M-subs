here now you've stripped away a portion

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.279

of<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.340> existing<00:00:31.850> roof<00:00:32.360> there's<00:00:32.899> two<00:00:33.050> rooms

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
of the existing roof there's two rooms

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.200 
of the existing roof there's two rooms
there<00:00:33.530> right<00:00:33.710> yep<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.489> have<00:00:34.579> two<00:00:34.820> roofs<00:00:35.030> are

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
on this one and we figured that that top

on this one and we figured that that top
roof<00:00:37.219> was<00:00:37.370> probably<00:00:37.670> at<00:00:37.789> least<00:00:37.909> 20<00:00:38.269> years<00:00:38.300> old

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:38.659 
roof was probably at least 20 years old

roof was probably at least 20 years old
you<00:00:38.989> see<00:00:39.409> where<00:00:39.559> there's<00:00:39.710> a<00:00:39.769> lot<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:40.010> curled

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
and we're gonna shingle right over that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.160 
and we're gonna shingle right over that
but<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:43.970> between<00:01:44.270> we're<00:01:44.600> putting<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:44.960> some

nice damn right this is a nice Dam right
now<00:01:51.110> exactly<00:01:51.650> this<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.100> where<00:01:52.250> you'd<00:01:52.370> have<00:01:52.400> a

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
now exactly this is where you'd have a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.370 
now exactly this is where you'd have a
backup<00:01:52.820> problem<00:01:53.480> yeah<00:01:53.660> so<00:01:54.020> what<00:01:54.200> we're<00:01:54.350> doing

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
backup problem yeah so what we're doing

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380 
backup problem yeah so what we're doing
is<00:01:54.770> putting<00:01:54.920> down<00:01:55.160> this<00:01:55.310> ice<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.210> water

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
is putting down this ice and water

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.490 
is putting down this ice and water
shield<00:01:56.590> exactly<00:01:58.210> okay<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.840> back<00:02:00.110> apart

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
shield exactly okay this is a back apart

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
shield exactly okay this is a back apart
so<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.890> doesn't<00:02:01.159> stick<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.490> itself<00:02:01.760> is<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.120> that

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so it doesn't stick to itself is it that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.300 
so it doesn't stick to itself is it that
goes<00:02:02.390> right<00:02:02.600> through<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.990> copper<00:02:03.590> apron<00:02:04.159> this

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
goes right through the copper apron this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.880 
goes right through the copper apron this
down<00:02:04.550> here<00:02:04.790> this<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.080> relatively<00:02:06.740> new

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
down here this is a relatively new

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.919 
down here this is a relatively new
product<00:02:07.340> what's<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:07.790> ring<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.539> is<00:02:08.690> called

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
product what's this ring this is called

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.220 
product what's this ring this is called
cedar<00:02:09.289> breather<00:02:09.619> right<00:02:10.099> and<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:11.360> does<00:02:11.690> exactly

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
cedar breather right and it does exactly

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.500 
cedar breather right and it does exactly
what<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.770> sounds<00:02:13.130> like<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.490> allows<00:02:13.880> to<00:02:14.150> seat<00:02:14.360> it

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
what it sounds like it allows to seat it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.700 
what it sounds like it allows to seat it
to<00:02:14.630> breathe<00:02:14.930> yeah

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
to breathe yeah

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.140 
to breathe yeah
look<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.130> even<00:02:16.370> when<00:02:16.520> it's<00:02:16.670> nailed<00:02:16.940> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
look at it even when it's nailed and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.820 
look at it even when it's nailed and
compressed<00:02:17.660> they're<00:02:17.870> still<00:02:18.140> going<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.320> be<00:02:18.530> a

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
compressed they're still going to be a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.310 
compressed they're still going to be a
space<00:02:19.430> maintained<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.420> throughout<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
space maintained all throughout the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.190 
space maintained all throughout the
surface<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.160> roof<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.360> there's<00:02:23.780> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
surface of the roof so that there's a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.470 
surface of the roof so that there's a
bit<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.620> air<00:02:24.860> circulation<00:02:25.130> underneath<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.450> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
bit of air circulation underneath that I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.390 
bit of air circulation underneath that I
think<00:02:26.690> that's<00:02:27.110> exactly<00:02:27.260> right<00:02:27.740> because<00:02:27.860> the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
think that's exactly right because the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.980 
think that's exactly right because the
shingles<00:02:28.730> we're<00:02:28.850> putting<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.480> are<00:02:29.690> dry

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
shingles we're putting on here are dry

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.500 
shingles we're putting on here are dry
that's<00:02:30.680> why<00:02:30.890> their<00:02:31.070> spacing<00:02:31.580> them<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:32.330> they

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that's why their spacing them as they

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.330 
that's why their spacing them as they
put<00:02:32.690> them<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:32.930> when<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.290> rains<00:02:33.590> they're<00:02:33.980> going

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
put them on when it rains they're going

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.760 
put them on when it rains they're going
to<00:02:34.660> absorb<00:02:35.660> moisture<00:02:35.900> they'll<00:02:36.350> reach<00:02:36.560> what's

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
to absorb moisture they'll reach what's

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.920 
to absorb moisture they'll reach what's
called<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.100> saturation<00:02:37.610> point<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.570> they're

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
called the saturation point and they're

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.840 
called the saturation point and they're
virtually<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.770> sponges<00:02:40.220> up<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.670> roof

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
virtually like sponges up on the roof

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.000 
virtually like sponges up on the roof
that<00:02:41.450> water's<00:02:41.840> gonna<00:02:41.990> drip<00:02:42.320> through<00:02:42.530> hit<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that water's gonna drip through hit the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.620 
that water's gonna drip through hit the
paper<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.550> come<00:02:43.730> down<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.420> stops

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
paper and come down but when it stops

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.230 
paper and come down but when it stops
raining<00:02:44.770> they're<00:02:45.770> gonna<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.520> soaking<00:02:46.730> wet<00:02:47.030> and

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
raining they're gonna be soaking wet and

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.150 
raining they're gonna be soaking wet and
they<00:02:47.450> don't<00:02:47.660> drive<00:02:47.930> right<00:02:48.260> exactly<00:02:49.040> that's

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
they don't drive right exactly that's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.550 
they don't drive right exactly that's
one<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.820> reasons<00:02:50.150> why<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.270> lot<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.560> cedar

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
one of the reasons why a lot of cedar

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.020 
one of the reasons why a lot of cedar
shingle<00:02:52.160> roofs<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.460> are<00:02:52.580> applied<00:02:52.880> directly

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
shingle roofs that are applied directly

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.390 
shingle roofs that are applied directly
onto<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> plywood<00:02:53.840> sometimes<00:02:54.620> don't<00:02:54.860> have<00:02:54.980> as

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
onto the plywood sometimes don't have as

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.100 
onto the plywood sometimes don't have as
long<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.640> life<00:02:55.940> expectancy<00:02:56.360> because<00:02:56.780> there's

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
long a life expectancy because there's

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.080 
long a life expectancy because there's
no<00:02:57.290> breather<00:02:57.740> space<00:02:58.160> that's<00:02:58.430> right<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.820> cedar

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
no breather space that's right the cedar

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.200 
no breather space that's right the cedar
breathers<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.480> real<00:02:59.720> good<00:02:59.870> idea
