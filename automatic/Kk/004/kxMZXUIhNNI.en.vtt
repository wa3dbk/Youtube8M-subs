00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.720
 hello girls this new video that you 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.450
 I bring today is about how to maintain a 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.119
 bulky hair without sacrificing 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.279
 hydration as you should already know 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.040
 deduction is very important for the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.110
 retention and hair growth as 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.470
 I already have at least one year taking care of myself 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.199
 Peru is not necessary to trace so 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.320
 with products the problem I had with 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.989
 my last routine was that the hair was 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.210
 sufficiently hydrated but I do not 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.610
 I liked how the colorful ones looked 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 it was running out of volume so it has 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.110
 gone a little boring that is what 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.480
 totally against what the 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.329
 curl hair then the routine that I bring 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.879
 Today is one that we give luxury in the hair 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.500
 yes but it also has not hydrated me 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.180
 which is something super important to me 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.180
 then we will start 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.120
 I'm not going to talk much about the shampoo and 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.820
 conditioner because I feel that what 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.920
 actually makes this routine functional 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.460
 are the other products the shampoo that 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460

 it's called man a nicole krauss 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.290
 what I'm going to talk about now is about 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.830
 the treatment now the treatment myself 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.869
 I do it before washing my hair and 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.690
 treatment that you call coaching 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.119
 and crabs that poison team x-raid 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.580
 unconditional treatment is the basis 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.350
 and the most important thing about a hydrated hair 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 it can not be any treatment has 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.060
 to be one with natural ingredients 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.070
 that not only give shine to hair but 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 They also help to strengthen the hair and 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.229
 they make it healthy we usually choose 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.570
 with the products for how the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.800
 hair when we have to think about that in 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.230
 what benefits 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.230
 this product was with healthy hair a 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.420
 Well- groomed hair shines on its own 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:15.200
 way and do not need many products 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:17.210
 to leave Seville what the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.730
 great difference in the process and the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.030
 routine that I have now and what the 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.700
 volume in the hair is the conditioner 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 xinhua ghee what use is a conventional or 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.170
 without rinsing or having all the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.290
 Benefits of hydration is a spray 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.540
 without the load that proves the volume that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.870
 it means that you have ingredients that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.320
 if it gives you help to hydrate the hair but 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.050
 It's not heavy, it does not load your hair 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:52.220
 much product in the way that the curl 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.800
 can not have the necessary volume what 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.870
 next he left a cream to give him 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.120
 more hydration because that's the most 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.360
 important with products with 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.250
 ingredients again 100% natural 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:14.810
 and it's called is to hydrate more and give it 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:17.240
 shine to the hair and the last thing that went is 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.580
 an angel to fix and so that 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.070
 ready they did not curl then what 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.640
 does that the last touch is like 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.980
 the last barrier where the hair and all 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.290
 the products using that seal in the 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.290
 curl and keep the shape you want 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.350
 now when I dried my hair I try to 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.560
 throw me all the hair on one side of a 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.230
 under the dryer for 15 minutes after 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.860
 I change it for the other side or 13 minutes 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.530
 and then like all the hair and I threw it 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.510
 forward and I stay for another 10 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.750
 minutes there will be a dryer until 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.080
 all the hair is completely dry 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.540
 some people use the diffuser with it 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.400
 with the hand dryer but in my 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.500
 opinion is not something I like to use 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.530
 because I feel like you have to use the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.380
 hands of maciÃ¡ 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:16.950
 and move the hair a lot and that disrupts the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:20.489
 floor when you come out of the hair dryer 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.800
 there is a little time left for people 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:33.450
 important to compress and squeeze the hair 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:36.419
 a little then hopefully they like this 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.730

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.530
