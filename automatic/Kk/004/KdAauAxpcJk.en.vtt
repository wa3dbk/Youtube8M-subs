00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hello friends received the parcel 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.620
 phone number and here I see it 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.650
 the parcel is not me the parcel for my 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.220
 Comrade would have looked at his account 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.810
 probably did not order anything like this 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.109
 something with a tracking number is not either 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.090
 the seller was wrong or something else that I 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.980
 very interesting what's inside but now 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.539
 we will watch something here 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.930
 solid with no idea in general i am now 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.460
 video put information about how much 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.239
 it all cost and how long did it go that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.969
 you've all seen interesting on the one hand 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 and but on the other hand since itâ€™s not me 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:56.399
 so interesting as louis parcels which 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:59.090
 I come without a track number 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.090
 piece of iron 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.979
 shine this close arteka 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:40.219
 Give daytime running lights so I understand 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:44.659
 on a car or on a bicycle so what 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.659
 like u to -5 such a fool 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.170
 this news is not written now by the Chinese 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.170
 will you write 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:08.869
 even the washers did not give four nuts and you 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:14.210
 you will laugh but these screws are not at all 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:17.530
 plastics themselves cold warm 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.530
 more precisely yes it is plastic 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.560
 although there is no metal on some 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:40.250
 plastic this metal and nuts too 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:42.800
 metal here already burst here she 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.530
 crack that is throwing the legends and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.959
 plastics burst here bye all 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.420
 ok but i think that time here she is 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.700
 the quality here has burst such that in 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.730
 by the way he is here about here 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.250
 In general, as a flower revealed also 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.350
 here plastic is subject to a bang and i 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.280
 I think that if you buy one 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.380
 thing then in the car she's from vibrations 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.360
 from shaking very quickly it will fall apart 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 I don't know my opinion. I hope that 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.370
 I am mistaken but it seems to me that this is so 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.620
 either way the link to the seller will be in 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.140
 description under the video buy not buy 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.570
 it's up to you but this video will probably be 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.239
 no wonder let me just show you 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.810
 let's see what's inside forever 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.700
 I can unscrew this little screwdriver 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.930
 the inside of that LEDs I already see there 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.860
 chinese glue or this seems to me and 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.120
 glitches 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:46.549
 heat and hot melt adhesive that is heated it 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:52.180
 melts and cooling hardens no i 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.180
 wrong song glue here reflector 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.099
 and board with LEDs LEDs 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.870
 included in the group then there are 2 groups by 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.430
 three LEDs on each group 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.430
 the resistor is well ok everything is done 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.989
 do take 12 volts to dedicate 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.810
 the board is by the way made on gettin ax 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.310
 This is the cheapest material for 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.139
 manufacturing printed circuit boards 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.479
 it is clear that here on everything 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.850
 saved but it can be seen on the outside 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:25.610
 mind pablo and that is just look easy 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.800
 here is a healthy bald that is, but the product 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.960
 I hope that it costs 2 kopecks differently 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.440
 it makes no sense at all to buy it by the way 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.389
 another interesting point is right 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.190
 here is not fixed to him 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.849
 just didn't get out of here 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.310
 that is, pull it a couple of times you have it 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.449
 just come off i mean no usually 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.099
 the Chinese at least do the knot but here 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.470
 the node will not climb and here the board falls 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.750
 flush 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.780
 that is, well, not at all thought out at all 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.880
 It did not do a full on trash 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.949
 my opinion I will not even include 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.960
 at least something interesting in this video 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.729
 disassembled showed that inside it will be necessary 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.389
 probably more often disassemble electronic 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.039
 component 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.710
 but not component something to do with 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.250
 I think electronics will be interesting 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.360
 than just a review is more accurate than a review and 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:28.449
 unpacking carefully put 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.449
 all sat down but now we collect 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.090
 even looked ordered this thing 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:28.290
 On aliexpress cost $ 1 7 there 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:31.680
 699 he package was 20 days very very 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.870
 quickly here u on scotch when clicking on not 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.810
 I know why it's all done in general 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.460
 it should be daytime running lights or 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.440
 as they are properly called that is but 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.550
 under the headlights probably shine daytime 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.530
 running lights for 123 mercedes 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.190
 Now you see how they look 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:53.330
 on a real car by car is no longer 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:57.090
 It will be seen all of these Ablai so 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:59.250
 so that's it but all the link to 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.200
 the seller will be in the description under the video is not 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.580
 forget to like 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200
 support me and of course 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.000
 subscribe to my channel here will be 

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.130
 a lot of interesting things and if there is 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.690
 Be sure to write the question in the comments 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:14.730
 yes not just questions of the sentence 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:17.940
 some requests whale ideas advice i don't 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:22.160
 I know everything, everything, write everything to everyone 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.160
 thank you all bye and good luck
