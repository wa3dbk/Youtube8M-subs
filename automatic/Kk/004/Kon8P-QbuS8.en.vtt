00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.819
 the viewer is with you again captain league skype 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.130
 and welcome to my new heading 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.320
 reviews on school guides in minecraft 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.800
 there is like this that no tutorial ask 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.170
 me you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.330
 Well, as if this is actually a tutorial but 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 just not my performance to be honest 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 it never occurred to me that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.670
 someone still takes away from worked on 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.769
 minecraft but when I google on where 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.810
 such a ton of square heads has spilled 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 schoolchildren a drop does not understand water 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.220
 the game but for some reason trying to me something 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.789
 tell and at the beginning of this type that well 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.560
 see 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.329
 but when I saw a masterpiece that will show 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 I understood to you today that I just keep quiet 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 meaningless really worth 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 show it to you so what 's all 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.940
 tells let's go 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.940
 directly tutorial 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.539
 probably this is the most honest student 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.159
 whom ever looked through for 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.350
 it is immediately written here for what reason 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.300
 schoolchildren usually do this type 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.039
 video and yes I was surprised too that 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.179
 in fact, absolutely no reason for 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.719
 they don't have that 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:00.320
 and hello to everyone with you ordered with me 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.619
 suddenly 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.409
 but he was already in my series there 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.180
 when mining after a few 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.710
 seconds after the start in the form of this little 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.200
 the larva of man begins to carry some 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.360
 nonsense about a friend of a miner about miners 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.920
 days 100 fucking why are you giving us this 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.659
 telling let's just get started 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.420
 video with you is just your tutorial and 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.200
 why did you take it off I decided to just delete 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.240
 your microsd 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.770
 great decision i think that in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.649
 principle on this tutorial could be 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.959
 and finish and teach you how to re 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.000

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.539
 do what to install mikroft nahuya 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.520
 then you deleted it I do not understand we go 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.659

 dusty the constant such advertising 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.750
 which could in principle and cut 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.819
 or on the pinch put this block in what 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.170
 your problem but no , he is again from 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.190
