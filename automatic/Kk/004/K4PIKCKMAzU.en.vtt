know<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> guys<00:01:57.600> remember<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.140> on

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
know if you guys remember that game on

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.050 
know if you guys remember that game on
the<00:01:58.380> playstation<00:01:58.469> 3<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.579> i<00:01:59.610> think<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.969> had

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the playstation 3 but i think it had

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.490 
the playstation 3 but i think it had
somewhere<00:02:00.360> between<00:02:01.610> 180<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.909> 256<00:02:03.810> players<00:02:04.259> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
somewhere between 180 to 256 players of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.520 
somewhere between 180 to 256 players of
match<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.360> huge<00:02:06.630> battlefields<00:02:07.409> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
match so it was huge battlefields and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.830 
match so it was huge battlefields and
just<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.489> lot<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> players<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.420> that's

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
just a lot of players on it that's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.420 
just a lot of players on it that's
basically<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.129> i<00:02:11.190> guess

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
basically what this is but i guess

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.620 
basically what this is but i guess
dimmed<00:02:11.730> down<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.910> little<00:02:12.180> bit

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
dimmed down a little bit

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.970 
dimmed down a little bit
I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.080> max<00:02:13.290> is<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
I think the max is going to be like a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.540 
I think the max is going to be like a
hundred<00:02:14.250> players<00:02:14.550> on<00:02:14.850> each<00:02:15.690> team<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:16.550> it's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
hundred players on each team or it's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.370 
hundred players on each team or it's
it's<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.210> hundred<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.630> together<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> map

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
it's a hundred all together on the map

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.840 
it's a hundred all together on the map
I'm<00:02:19.530> not<00:02:19.680> entirely<00:02:19.890> sure<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.460> how<00:02:20.790> many

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
I'm not entirely sure and how many

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.490 
I'm not entirely sure and how many
players<00:02:21.150> there<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.350> there's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
players there is going to be but there's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.870 
players there is going to be but there's
going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.680> be<00:02:22.710> a<00:02:22.800> lot<00:02:22.980> more<00:02:23.040> than<00:02:23.430> battlefield

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to be a lot more than battlefield

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.320 
going to be a lot more than battlefield
and<00:02:24.150> call<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.900> duty<00:02:25.110> combined<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:26.790> put<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.210> at
