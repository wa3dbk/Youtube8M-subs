00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.299
 welcome to the further video 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.750
 with me captain regulator and this time that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.029
 the topic of music is the theme and off you go 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.090
 the music is not only a beautiful one 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.310
 Pastime but can be very us 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.070
 influence and also control us and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 Not just as private entertainment 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 or used as an entertainment medium 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.770
 but is also an aid in the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 medicine and indeed it is required 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.059
 or is the music used right there? 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.489
 because the music affects us humans 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.800
 because music changes the heartbeat 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.180
 blood pressure the respiratory rate the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 muscle tension and whatever 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 until the end of the hormone balance 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.469
 the lambs music then stops swimming the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.629
 hormones in a just inside by the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.270
 all the emotions that sparked in one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 and indeed it is so if 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.619
 one hears music everybody has his song like that 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 especially his favorite song, too 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.729
 especially triggers emotions because of it 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 probably to a certain 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.939
 situation just fits in one's self 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.979
 So the hormones shut out the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.409
 then you're in there and then 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.170
 certain emotions prevail in one 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.420
 and that's why music can and steers us 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.939
 influence and has the power 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.130
 about our body in the moment because 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.720
 the music changes us in this moment 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.610
 simply that can just say now 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.229
 beats the heart faster now beats 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.579
 slower now and we ourselves 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.000
 I can not say no I want that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.340
 not at all 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.579
 we can not influence that and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.240
 the school is already with 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.850
 that encourages music instruction that means 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.399
 Educational care in subjects 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.009
 as German math naturally preferred 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.500
 But music is also important and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 music is also promoted because easy 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.079
 so 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.409
 the first contact with music music 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.600
 can also mean that you have the brain 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.069
 promotes because I say music 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.250
 trains the brain pretty Doll 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.560
 because these are all individual things 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.480
 which has to process the brain and 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.760
 that's why it brings a lot for his 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 you also have musical early education 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.110
 ever heard and I think so 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.090
 nice interesting that it is something then 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.000
 is the music and so can influence 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.490
 is really quite interesting how 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 said you can also be with music 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.410
 exercise memory 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.180
 that means if you often music or 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.510
 you probably can hear radio too 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.340
 better at any hearing tests or 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.840
 so I do not mean it 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.370
 loud music but just like that you can 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.340
 that he can do things better 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.860
 understand because it just exists 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.420
 different music types and if you are 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.830
 then just in the radio constantly that 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.280
 then you will come with all kinds 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.050
 actually in almost all kinds in 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.820
 touch or in contact and hear the 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.440
 then and thus you can be heard too 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.570
 just fine and his brain accordingly 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.860
 school what you hear the words then 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.500
 also to implement quickly 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.270
 because that's actually the sticking point 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.160
 So that was the music has a large 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.230
 makes us humans and can be pretty 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.700
 how influence that is the result 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.230
 from this I follow wish them 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.230
 Nice at night until next time 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.480
 on 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.880
 you want more of the class completely 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.660
 just on my channel 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.660
 just click
