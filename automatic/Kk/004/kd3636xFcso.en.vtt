00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
different groups in the generation this

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.819 
different groups in the generation this
is<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.170> an<00:00:34.350> original<00:00:34.770> pair<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> boots<00:00:35.719> 1954

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
is about an original pair of boots 1954

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
is about an original pair of boots 1954
so<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.129> soleplate<00:00:38.640> as<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
so the soleplate as you can see is are

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380 
so the soleplate as you can see is are
more<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.110> guess<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> shoe<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:42.149> why

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
more I guess more like a shoe that's why

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.479 
more I guess more like a shoe that's why
in<00:00:42.690> England<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.230> around<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> world<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> say

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
in England or around the world we say

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.100 
in England or around the world we say
their<00:00:44.640> football<00:00:44.969> boots<00:00:45.210> rather<00:00:45.690> than<00:00:45.809> cleats

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
their football boots rather than cleats

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.080 
their football boots rather than cleats
because<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.649> used<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.920> be<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> food<00:00:47.309> shape<00:00:47.610> so

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
because they used to be a food shape so
