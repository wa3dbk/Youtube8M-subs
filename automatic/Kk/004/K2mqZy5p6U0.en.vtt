00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.230
 very good people here we are in luque 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.180
 town and now you know that now you 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.950
 days and it can get harder for you 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.360
 pressure equipment that is on edit 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.480
 good you have already seen some video 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 informative of güidi or of frano or some 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.289
 thing so then well then I was 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.739
 with your video it's worth and nothing, so we decided 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 play a little here in what is a 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.839
 a demolition and well then nothing 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 kids this is I started to throw a 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:37.350
 little bit how the hard shrapnel is fixed 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.780
 This last one is valid with search engine 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.539
 whites and grip and honestly not 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.339
 I put it on so, man, they were 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.249
 bothering a little bit is the gusts 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.510
 of all the story then I said go 

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.879
 to shit now I'm not going to put the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 shrapnel dora to the image is che country 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 and more than two weeks how are you going to win 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.020
 the pearl and then obviously 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.080
 I put it on but 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.510
 and honestly gave me a great idea 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.640
 value your pig that you are going to have the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.170
 next week the only thing that still 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.390
 I'm thinking of burning to do it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.760
 OK because I need a map that has 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.340
 as well a long corridor that happens a lot 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.260
 people you know so that they do not see me and 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.110
 I see them and good god is 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.640
 it's a little surprise you're going to say fuck 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.780
 to see what the bastard since you're done 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.450
 but the truth is that I like it 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.070
 much the idea italy is more with a 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.210
 machine gun that I'm going to tell you 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.619
 come or I will not have to say but good 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.729
 so the next pig I'm going to 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:40.310
 do with a machine gun it's worth but not 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.560
 you know neither how or what accessories or what 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.710
 I will do nothing like that but 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.009
 that I was not given a great idea and 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.899
 Well, I hope nothing mole 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.000
 I'll upload it in the next week what 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.190
 I do not know yet it 's a map yes and if you have 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.860
 you any idea of ​​any map like that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.630
 I have like a little bit of a walk or something 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.069
 so spend a lot of people and all 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.230
 story because the truth always 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.020
 you put 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.600
 It would be better and good, well, nothing 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.670
 apart from that because you already know how the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.920
 nook etam not if you play hard for 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 team is worth you play something else 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.120
 ok but if you play a domain or a 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.040
 demolition are very static 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.860
 back then obviously 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.660
 happen what is happening here we are my 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 team that we have eaten the other 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.890
 team and we're here like piranhas 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.910

 I was about to put on the speaker 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.700

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.590

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.190
 of the double points that also what 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.170

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.000

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.600
 what happened I have an open mind and 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.090
 There is only one tie that you shit and it's 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.640
 Saturday once as I say then 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.280

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.040
 there to give them a little turn I do not say it with 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.020
 second or anything like that but fuck 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.210
 it's already arrived in the spring already a 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.010
 little bit of heat, at least not me 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.280
 I'm looking forward to finishing the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.350
 video this and I'm going to walk around 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.420
 there because we are going to see if I put a 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.310
 I opened a small terrace or 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.200
 one thing because the truth is that with 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.720
 this time you want to be among the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.069
 names at home so good kids 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.200
 what 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.049
 already returning to the game has seen that 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.780
 pull the ub everything in the living you know 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.900
 that as always I throw it and I pass it 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.870
 quickie is valid so that it is not like that either 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.449
 very heavy the gameplay and all that but 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.870
 so you can see everything, even though 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.169
 you will know but how can you get involved in this 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.660
 map not if you're with some friends or with 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.880
 playing with people who are good at all 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.000
 the story is that look and we are moving forward 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.160
 we all lock them up and it's that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.789
 they can do something else or simply 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.570
 die die and keep dying so 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.580
 good kids 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.699
 encourage you this weekend is worth 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.190
 there are also double points you have to have 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.080
 a give and take and now a game is a little 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.599
 huguet although you are going to upload that you want 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.300
 pass prestige is going to swell worth 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.360
 like a pigeon and good because nothing there 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.130
 you have 63/7 right now so little 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.400
 times and the truth that I swell 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.780
 I 'm slightly swollen, so it's good 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.560
 I hope you liked the part of 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.600
 she 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.550
 for the people that I see who asks a lot 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.950
 from the back to pig I'm going to upload it 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.300
 next week and that gives a clue is worth 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.639
 and also asks us for a favor that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.410
 you will say a map if with long step and already 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.150
