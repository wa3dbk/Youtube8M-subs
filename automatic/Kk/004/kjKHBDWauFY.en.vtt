off<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.660> guess<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:36.220> won't<00:02:36.910> say

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
off I guess with like a I won't say

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.730 
off I guess with like a I won't say
alcohol<00:02:37.270> or<00:02:37.630> something<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.170> think<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:38.709> just

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
alcohol or something I think it's just

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320 
alcohol or something I think it's just
to<00:02:38.920> make<00:02:39.100> sure<00:02:39.130> that<00:02:39.520> they're<00:02:39.700> fully<00:02:40.000> baked

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
to make sure that they're fully baked

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.830 
to make sure that they're fully baked
fully<00:02:40.720> dry<00:02:40.990> because<00:02:41.590> each<00:02:41.860> layer<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> baked

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
fully dry because each layer is baked

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.780 
fully dry because each layer is baked
and<00:02:43.840> that's<00:02:44.170> pretty<00:02:44.350> much<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.520> go

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
and that's pretty much it you can go

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.250 
and that's pretty much it you can go
outside<00:02:46.020> immediately<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:48.370> go<00:02:48.580> in<00:02:48.700> your<00:02:48.820> purse

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
outside immediately you go in your purse

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.990 
outside immediately you go in your purse
put<00:02:50.260> your<00:02:50.440> hands<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:50.860> your<00:02:51.160> purse<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.850> get

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
put your hands in your purse and get

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.820 
put your hands in your purse and get
your<00:02:52.150> keys<00:02:52.360> out<00:02:52.600> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.260> probably<00:02:53.440> change

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
your keys out you can probably change

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.650 
your keys out you can probably change
the<00:02:53.890> tire<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.489> you<00:02:54.640> would<00:02:54.760> not<00:02:54.910> see<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.180> dent

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
the tire and you would not see a dent

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.210 
the tire and you would not see a dent
that<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.320> great<00:02:56.500> thing<00:02:56.560> about<00:02:56.770> these

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
that is the great thing about these

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.010 
that is the great thing about these
because<00:02:57.700> your<00:02:57.850> nails<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.239> dry<00:02:58.510> from<00:02:58.780> that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
because your nails are dry from that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.170 
because your nails are dry from that
point<00:02:59.350> on<00:02:59.560> when<00:02:59.890> they<00:02:59.980> come<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.640> UV<00:03:00.940> lamp

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
point on when they come out the UV lamp

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.870 
point on when they come out the UV lamp
so<00:03:01.480> that<00:03:02.050> right<00:03:02.200> there<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.590> plus<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:03.160> me<00:03:03.310> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
so that right there is a plus to me the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.060 
so that right there is a plus to me the
fact<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.239> it<00:03:04.420> lasts<00:03:04.720> for<00:03:04.870> three<00:03:05.110> weeks<00:03:05.350> yes

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
fact that it lasts for three weeks yes

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.270 
fact that it lasts for three weeks yes
is<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.310> little<00:03:06.580> pricier<00:03:07.120> but<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.799> think<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.130> get

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
is a little pricier but I think you get

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.210 
is a little pricier but I think you get
your<00:03:09.459> money's<00:03:09.730> worth<00:03:10.620> what<00:03:11.620> else<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:11.950> said<00:03:12.100> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
your money's worth what else I said is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.880 
your money's worth what else I said is
not<00:03:12.250> damaging<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:14.290> think<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.739> pretty

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
not damaging and I think it's pretty

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.890 
not damaging and I think it's pretty
cool<00:03:15.220> they<00:03:15.400> have<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.640> lot<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.940> colors<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.690> choose

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
cool they have a lot of colors to choose

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.410 
cool they have a lot of colors to choose

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
nails don't really produce oil but

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.010 
nails don't really produce oil but
whatever<00:04:49.340> they<00:04:49.520> produce<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.150> causes<00:04:50.690> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
means not to stick it's a similar

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.040 
means not to stick it's a similar
process<00:04:53.270> in<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.750> sense<00:04:54.050> of<00:04:54.280> with<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:56.050> gel

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
process in the sense of with the gel

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.029 
process in the sense of with the gel
nails<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:57.710> your<00:04:58.039> nails<00:04:59.560> secrete<00:05:00.560> oil<00:05:00.770> or

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 
nails if your nails secrete oil or

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
whatever they do that make it not stick

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.219 
whatever they do that make it not stick
then<00:05:03.830> it's<00:05:04.310> not<00:05:04.490> going<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.699> last<00:05:04.820> as<00:05:05.060> long<00:05:05.229> so

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
then it's not going to last as long so

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.170 
then it's not going to last as long so
that's<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.560> one<00:05:06.830> thing<00:05:07.039> but<00:05:07.340> again<00:05:07.820> if<00:05:08.030> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
that's the one thing but again if the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.510 
that's the one thing but again if the
last<00:05:08.419> over<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.900> week<00:05:09.199> then<00:05:09.830> that's<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.310> good

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
last over a week then that's a good
