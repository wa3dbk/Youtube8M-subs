00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.030

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.690
 It will deliver a little good implied today from in 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.300
 One time I told you that I got news from a friend 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.420
 It is the cover that such a question is written 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.600
 I thought it was good but it is- 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.900

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.500

 Thank you It is Kaiserslautern wrote such a thing 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.090
 I say the opposite language is natural 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.630
 I've done it in Ijima 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:31.260
 If you say what 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:34.250
 There is no feeling of appreciation if you think that it is natural 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.050
 Though the pad and Iuwake 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.240
 Fingers move 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.760
 A simpler thing that you can not appreciate for your finger movement if you think it is natural 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.620
 Eat breakfast 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.480
 I'm sorry 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.320
 I do not say I thank you grateful manner and I think that it is natural to think that can eat breakfast 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.000
 but 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.270
 Thank you if your mother makes it if you make it Thank you if your wife makes it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.680
 I feel grateful that I do not think it is natural 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.090
 So you can eat by saying thank you 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.250
 That time is it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.710
 Eyes caught in the coverage article of singer Hideki Nishijo 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.330
 30 Mogi, you are 68th in 2003 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.760
 When I was playing in Korea 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.980
 It is what seems to have ended up with cerebral infarction 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.990
 so 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.170

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.200
 so 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.319
 I say that the sense of balance is also changing 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.910
 I have been hospitalized for return home equipment 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.700
 I had to stand all day round Nde stood Marchisio 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:49.489
 It took 6 hours for rehabilitation 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.750
 I'm going to do some hard work like this in a run like this . 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.940
 Hard to get over 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.110
 It's right but this kind of thing, which I thought at that time 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.400
 Said a little guilty and read to this earth anything Rai' 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.489
 Normal is wonderful 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.630
 I can be grateful to everything around me 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.000
 My way of life has also changed 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:14.090
 Aware of the fact that it is common that for the first time granted become but I was so sick 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.330
 It is Iuwake standing 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.110
 My mother said at best this 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.970
 It's not a big deal 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:30.890
 Only'm great Kotonan it Tsu what is good ordinary in I was the name care of it at that time and my young child 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 If you do not work hard more than one, it will be boring with one person 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:40.069
 I had to say My God cheeky want to live a different and more and more people 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 But that's what holds on daily gratitude 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.350
 It's a trick, but I can not succeed 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.520
 Let's repeat it again 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:51.560
 What is the opposite language of the thank you 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.990
 that is 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.340
 Obvious 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.340
 Thank you for being able to appreciate that you can usually do a few things 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.940
 It is natural 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:08.480

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.480
