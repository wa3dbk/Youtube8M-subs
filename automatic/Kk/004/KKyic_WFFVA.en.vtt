things all three phones are essentially

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:28.210 
things all three phones are essentially
the<00:03:20.520> same<00:03:20.760> design<00:03:24.740> they're<00:03:25.740> all<00:03:25.920> very<00:03:26.190> similar

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220

the<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.270> guess<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:31.590> planer<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.760> two

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the the I guess the the planer the two

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.310 
the the I guess the the planer the two
is<00:03:33.210> the<00:03:33.540> valet<00:03:34.790> this<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:36.150> has<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.250> dull<00:03:38.250> black

dedicated camera button whereas the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
dedicated camera button whereas the
other<00:03:54.090> two<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.720> not<00:03:56.750> but<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.840> back<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.320> course

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
other two do not but the back of course

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.699 
other two do not but the back of course
it<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.990> a<00:04:01.500> rubberized<00:04:02.040> material<00:04:03.709> but

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
it is of a rubberized material but

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.010 
it is of a rubberized material but
everything<00:04:05.100> else<00:04:05.310> is<00:04:05.580> fairly<00:04:06.060> basic<00:04:06.390> on<00:04:06.840> this

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
everything else is fairly basic on this

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.660 
everything else is fairly basic on this
phone<00:04:08.480> now<00:04:09.480> on<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.720> savvy<00:04:10.020> we<00:04:10.350> have

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
phone now on the savvy we have

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.610 
phone now on the savvy we have
essentially<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:12.000> same<00:04:12.209> design<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.470> only

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
essentially the same design but the only

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.080 
essentially the same design but the only
difference<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.490> is<00:04:14.610> that<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.910> don't

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
difference is here is that you don't

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.960 
difference is here is that you don't
have<00:04:15.270> that<00:04:15.540> middle<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.260> middle<00:04:17.239> gloss<00:04:18.239> piece

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
have that middle the middle gloss piece

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.160 
have that middle the middle gloss piece
instead<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.180> have<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.390> gloss<00:04:24.080> bezel<00:04:25.080> around

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
instead you have a gloss bezel around

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.219 
instead you have a gloss bezel around
the<00:04:25.500> screen<00:04:26.360> this<00:04:27.360> one<00:04:27.570> does<00:04:27.750> not<00:04:27.900> have<00:04:27.960> a

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
the screen this one does not have a

the back and of course you get the large
screen<00:05:28.410> but<00:05:29.410> everything<00:05:29.770> else<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.370> pretty

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
much the same there's a volume same

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.260 
much the same there's a volume same
place<00:05:32.889> as<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.130> other<00:05:33.400> two<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:36.669> one's<00:05:36.970> very

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
place as the other two this one's very

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.420 
place as the other two this one's very
slightly<00:05:38.169> and<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:38.620> you<00:05:38.740> don't<00:05:38.919> have<00:05:39.099> the

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
slightly and that you don't have the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.000 
slightly and that you don't have the
power<00:05:39.729> /<00:05:40.450> lock<00:05:40.840> button<00:05:41.200> at<00:05:41.349> the<00:05:41.380> top<00:05:41.650> but<00:05:41.860> you

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
power / lock button at the top but you

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.680 
power / lock button at the top but you
do<00:05:42.160> have<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:43.320> headphone<00:05:44.320> jack<00:05:44.349> there<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:45.700> the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
do have the headphone jack there the the

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.659 
do have the headphone jack there the the
power<00:05:46.960> button<00:05:47.289> on<00:05:47.500> this<00:05:47.680> one<00:05:47.919> is<00:05:48.070> on<00:05:48.250> the<00:05:48.280> right

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
power button on this one is on the right

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.820 
power button on this one is on the right
and<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.300> one<00:05:49.570> does<00:05:49.780> not<00:05:50.050> have<00:05:50.349> a<00:05:50.380> debted

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
and this one does not have a debted

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.500 
and this one does not have a debted
dedicated<00:05:51.789> camera<00:05:51.940> button<00:05:52.470> either<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:55.479> I

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
dedicated camera button either so I

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.430 
dedicated camera button either so I
think<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.320> about<00:05:56.349> wraps<00:05:56.710> it<00:05:57.310> up<00:05:58.229> pretty<00:05:59.229> much

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
think that about wraps it up pretty much

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.770 
think that about wraps it up pretty much
everything<00:05:59.950> else<00:06:00.160> in<00:06:00.460> terms<00:06:00.700> of<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.180> Android

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
everything else in terms of the Android

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.800 
everything else in terms of the Android
side<00:06:02.710> of<00:06:02.889> things<00:06:03.039> is<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.490> same<00:06:03.760> on<00:06:04.270> all<00:06:04.479> three

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
side of things is the same on all three

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.810 
side of things is the same on all three
of<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:04.990> phones<00:06:05.260> all<00:06:06.220> of<00:06:06.550> them<00:06:06.699> have<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.930> same

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
of the phones all of them have the same

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.659 
of the phones all of them have the same
Android<00:06:09.820> version<00:06:10.300> all<00:06:10.720> three<00:06:11.590> of<00:06:11.620> them<00:06:11.889> have<00:06:12.130> a
