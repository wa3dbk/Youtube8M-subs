so that's a 3d s of course the most
important<00:04:09.120> part<00:04:09.360> but<00:04:09.570> there's<00:04:09.840> also<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.560> lot<00:04:11.519> of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
don't show you the download code so I

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.920 
don't show you the download code so I
had<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.250> perform<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.760> hard<00:04:18.000> cut<00:04:18.269> there<00:04:18.510> because

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
had to perform a hard cut there because

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.800 
had to perform a hard cut there because
the<00:04:19.140> codes<00:04:19.410> were<00:04:19.560> immediately<00:04:20.010> visible<00:04:20.400> and

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
the codes were immediately visible and

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.760 
the codes were immediately visible and
I'm<00:04:21.810> kind<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.049> try<00:04:22.229> this<00:04:22.289> again<00:04:22.590> we're

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770

my codes these are the AR
if<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.580> have<00:04:27.759> a<00:04:27.789> 3ds<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.449> know<00:04:28.569> what<00:04:28.750> these<00:04:28.900> do

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
if you have a 3ds you know what these do

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.450 
if you have a 3ds you know what these do
and<00:04:30.930> yeah<00:04:31.930> basically<00:04:32.080> it's<00:04:32.530> it's<00:04:32.830> minigames

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
and yeah basically it's it's minigames

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.210 
and yeah basically it's it's minigames
and<00:04:34.050> has<00:04:35.050> some<00:04:35.259> it<00:04:35.500> has<00:04:35.680> some<00:04:35.860> really<00:04:35.979> cool

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
and has some it has some really cool

it's<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.870> code<00:04:47.110> not<00:04:47.379> sure<00:04:47.710> which<00:04:47.949> one<00:04:48.220> that<00:04:48.250> is

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
it's a code not sure which one that is

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.689 
it's a code not sure which one that is
have<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.210> check<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.539> is<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:50.710> warning<00:04:51.580> that

some things on the DSR not good for
children<00:04:54.520> couldn't<00:04:55.479> think<00:04:55.659> of<00:04:55.840> which<00:04:56.020> ones

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
children couldn't think of which ones

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.559 
children couldn't think of which ones
but<00:04:56.530> then<00:04:57.400> we<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.639> Quick<00:04:57.879> Start<00:04:57.909> Guide<00:04:58.180> in

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
but then we have a Quick Start Guide in

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.409 
but then we have a Quick Start Guide in
a<00:04:58.629> lot<00:04:59.199> of<00:04:59.470> different<00:04:59.860> languages<00:05:00.330> here<00:05:01.330> you

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
a lot of different languages here you

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.779 
a lot of different languages here you
have<00:05:01.569> to<00:05:01.690> touch<00:05:01.870> one<00:05:02.169> that<00:05:02.889> looks<00:05:03.190> Russian

have to touch one that looks Russian
here's<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.690> English<00:05:04.990> one<00:05:05.169> let<00:05:05.349> me<00:05:05.470> show<00:05:05.830> you

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
here's the English one let me show you

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.950 
here's the English one let me show you
quickly<00:05:06.280> what's<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.789> there<00:05:07.060> nothing

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
quickly what's in there nothing

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.100 
quickly what's in there nothing
spectacular<00:05:08.669> if<00:05:09.669> most<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.270> are<00:05:10.569> smart

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
spectacular if most of you are smart

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.300 
spectacular if most of you are smart
enough<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.349> figure<00:05:11.470> out<00:05:11.830> how<00:05:11.949> one<00:05:12.130> of<00:05:12.220> these

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
enough to figure out how one of these

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.820 
enough to figure out how one of these
things<00:05:12.370> works<00:05:12.849> so<00:05:13.840> you<00:05:13.930> plug<00:05:14.349> it<00:05:14.500> in<00:05:14.590> if<00:05:14.740> you

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
things works so you plug it in if you

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.800 
things works so you plug it in if you
want<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.039> charge<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.520> with<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.240> memory<00:05:16.569> card

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
want to charge it with the memory card

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.540 
want to charge it with the memory card
in<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.020> memory<00:05:17.289> card<00:05:17.530> slot<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.009> game<00:05:18.159> card<00:05:18.460> in

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
in the memory card slot the game card in

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.390 
in the memory card slot the game card in
the<00:05:18.639> game<00:05:18.669> card<00:05:19.090> slot<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.560> far<00:05:20.800> no<00:05:21.039> rocket

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
the game card slot so far no rocket

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.529 
the game card slot so far no rocket
science<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:23.069> here's<00:05:24.069> how<00:05:24.219> you<00:05:24.250> set<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.669> up<00:05:24.849> but

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
science and here's how you set it up but

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.950 
science and here's how you set it up but
yeah<00:05:26.159> basically<00:05:27.159> the<00:05:27.849> DES<00:05:28.270> doesn't<00:05:28.780> really

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
yeah basically the DES doesn't really

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.129 
yeah basically the DES doesn't really
require<00:05:29.949> a<00:05:30.490> lot<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.330> knowledge<00:05:31.509> to<00:05:31.900> get

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
require a lot of knowledge to get

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:32.760 
require a lot of knowledge to get
started

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770

started
this<00:05:33.520> is<00:05:33.669> operations<00:05:34.330> manual<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.930> actual

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
this is operations manual so the actual

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:37.589 
this is operations manual so the actual
manual<00:05:35.620> let's<00:05:36.610> take<00:05:36.759> a<00:05:36.789> quick<00:05:37.030> browse<00:05:37.300> through

pretty intuitive and if you get stuck
you<00:05:52.270> just<00:05:52.569> google<00:05:52.870> your<00:05:53.020> problem<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:54.250> get

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
you just google your problem and you get

you just google your problem and you get
a<00:05:54.490> solution<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:55.180> wonder<00:05:55.750> if<00:05:55.870> anyone<00:05:56.229> still<00:05:56.349> read

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
a solution I wonder if anyone still read

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.800 
a solution I wonder if anyone still read
these<00:05:56.830> manuals<00:05:57.279> so<00:05:58.120> that<00:05:58.360> was<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.630> that<00:05:58.779> was

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
these manuals so that was it that was

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.680 
these manuals so that was it that was
the<00:05:59.050> Zelda<00:05:59.349> 3ds<00:05:59.710> XL<00:06:00.009> limited<00:06:01.000> edition<00:06:01.479> and

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
the Zelda 3ds XL limited edition and

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.330 
the Zelda 3ds XL limited edition and
basically<00:06:02.349> the<00:06:02.529> only<00:06:02.560> special<00:06:03.130> thing<00:06:03.279> about

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
basically the only special thing about

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.570 
basically the only special thing about
it<00:06:03.759> is<00:06:03.909> the<00:06:04.449> artwork<00:06:04.810> on<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.380> 3ds<00:06:05.680> itself

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
it is the artwork on the 3ds itself

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.450 
it is the artwork on the 3ds itself
because<00:06:06.940> there's<00:06:07.180> no<00:06:07.360> physical<00:06:07.659> game<00:06:08.460> and

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
because there's no physical game and

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.390 
because there's no physical game and
there's<00:06:10.210> no<00:06:10.389> other<00:06:10.630> extras<00:06:11.139> so<00:06:11.770> that's<00:06:11.979> it<00:06:12.159> I

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
there's no other extras so that's it I

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.890 
there's no other extras so that's it I
