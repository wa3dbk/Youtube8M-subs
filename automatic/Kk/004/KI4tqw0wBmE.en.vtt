game<00:00:49.559> quite<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.340> you'll<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.640> able

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
game quite a lot because you'll be able

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
game quite a lot because you'll be able
to<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.420> completely<00:00:51.930> different<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.649> know

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
to have completely different you know

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
to have completely different you know
themed<00:00:53.039> worlds<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.149> text<00:00:54.420> pack<00:00:54.629> which

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
themed worlds for your text pack which

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
themed worlds for your text pack which
honestly<00:00:55.920> theming<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.879> while<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> text

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
honestly theming a while to the text

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
honestly theming a while to the text
pack<00:00:57.660> makes<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> sense<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.710> if

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pack makes a lot of sense because if

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
pack makes a lot of sense because if
you're<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.399> realistic<00:00:59.550> text<00:01:00.059> pack<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.449> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
you're a very realistic text pack like I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.180 
you're a very realistic text pack like I
think<00:01:01.230> John<00:01:01.410> Smith's<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> looks

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
think John Smith's the one that looks

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
think John Smith's the one that looks
super<00:01:02.489> realistic<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> might<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.420> some

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
super realistic then you might want some

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.750 
super realistic then you might want some
music<00:01:03.870> that's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.350> bit<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.710> or<00:01:04.830> less<00:01:05.010> 8-bit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
music that's a bit more or less 8-bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
music that's a bit more or less 8-bit
and<00:01:05.909> retro<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.510> minecraft<00:01:07.110> whereas<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and retro than minecraft whereas if you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
and retro than minecraft whereas if you
get<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> 4-bit<00:01:08.909> texture<00:01:09.180> pack<00:01:09.330> ieave<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
get a 4-bit texture pack ieave on the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
get a 4-bit texture pack ieave on the
super<00:01:10.320> super<00:01:10.560> blocky<00:01:10.890> ones<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.670> might<00:01:11.820> want

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
super super blocky ones you might want

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
super super blocky ones you might want
even<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.390> 8-bit<00:01:13.170> music<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
even more 8-bit music it's I think the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
even more 8-bit music it's I think the
music<00:01:15.060> changing<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
music changing to the thing and also the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
music changing to the thing and also the
world<00:01:16.799> changes<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> thing<00:01:17.340> makes<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
world changes the thing makes a lot of

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.460 
world changes the thing makes a lot of
sense<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.390> there's<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.930> it's<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
sense and there's just it's it's a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
sense and there's just it's it's a
really<00:01:19.619> cool<00:01:19.799> idea<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:21.150> user<00:01:21.299> interface<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
really cool idea the user interface I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.330 
really cool idea the user interface I
think<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.020> comes<00:01:22.140> text<00:01:22.409> max<00:01:22.530> anyway<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:22.979> it's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
think that comes text max anyway so it's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
think that comes text max anyway so it's
sort<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.759> done<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.030> point<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
sort of done in point but it's still a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
sort of done in point but it's still a
really<00:01:24.840> really<00:01:25.229> cool<00:01:25.320> possibility<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.909> let's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
really really cool possibility so let's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
really really cool possibility so let's

their<00:01:28.920> two<00:01:29.130> big<00:01:29.460> things<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> everyone's<00:01:30.119> mind

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
their two big things in everyone's mind

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
their two big things in everyone's mind
sir<00:01:30.960> pricing<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.890> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.220> expensive<00:01:32.430> I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
sir pricing it's going to be expensive I

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
sir pricing it's going to be expensive I
think<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.509> guarantee<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> now<00:01:34.079> they

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
think we can guarantee that now they

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.410 
think we can guarantee that now they
charge<00:01:34.500> 160<00:01:35.009> for<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> skin<00:01:35.700> pack<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.180> think

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
charge 160 for a skin pack which I think

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710 
charge 160 for a skin pack which I think
solo<00:01:36.860> no<00:01:37.860> extortion<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.060> lil<00:01:39.270> out

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
solo no extortion up it's a lil out

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.590 
solo no extortion up it's a lil out
there<00:01:39.990> considering<00:01:40.409> they're<00:01:40.740> free<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.130> PC<00:01:41.600> so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
there considering they're free on PC so

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.330 
there considering they're free on PC so
for<00:01:43.170> something<00:01:43.470> that's<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.860> big<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.280> this

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
for something that's this big and this

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.679 
for something that's this big and this
many<00:01:44.610> things<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> cost

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
many things I think it's going to cost

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.350 
many things I think it's going to cost
at<00:01:46.110> least<00:01:46.170> 400<00:01:46.920> maybe<00:01:47.460> even<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.729> hundred<00:01:47.909> maybe
