00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
to pin these two together to make our

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.859 
to pin these two together to make our
small<00:00:16.650> pillow<00:00:17.090> what<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.240> wanted<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> show

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
small pillow what I also wanted to show

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.200 
small pillow what I also wanted to show
you<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.590> thread<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.279> thread<00:00:20.789> has<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> way

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
you is the thread here thread has a way

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.269 
you is the thread here thread has a way
to<00:00:21.270> hold<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> doesn't<00:00:22.320> unravel<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:23.100> has

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to hold it so it doesn't unravel it has

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.630 
to hold it so it doesn't unravel it has
a<00:00:23.310> channel<00:00:23.910> right<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.490> what<00:00:26.490> you're

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
a channel right here and what you're

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.089 
a channel right here and what you're
going<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.269> pick<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.960> finger<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:28.800> to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
going to do is pick your finger there to

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
going to do is pick your finger there to
brace<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.789> slide<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> channel

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
brace it and slide this into the channel

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.810 
brace it and slide this into the channel
so<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> holds<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.640> doesn't

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so it holds it there and it doesn't

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.150 
so it holds it there and it doesn't
unravel<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:34.320> are<00:00:34.469> some<00:00:34.950> other

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
unravel on you there are some other

unravel on you there are some other
schools<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> little<00:00:36.300> notch<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
schools that have a little notch and

schools that have a little notch and
that<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.559> notch<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.489> put

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that little notch is what you would put

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
that little notch is what you would put
this<00:00:38.940> thread<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.629> hold<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> keep<00:00:40.320> it

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this thread in to hold it to keep it

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
this thread in to hold it to keep it
from<00:00:40.590> unraveling<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.610> time<00:00:42.800> okay<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.460> we

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210

side<00:02:10.989> you<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.530> to<00:02:11.590> sew<00:02:11.739> half<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.340> fourth

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
side you want to sew half the fourth

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
side you want to sew half the fourth
side<00:02:12.880> up<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.300> you're<00:02:13.989> going<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> stop<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
side up and you're going to stop the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.400 
side up and you're going to stop the
reason<00:02:15.519> why<00:02:15.640> you<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.209> is<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.140> you

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
reason why you do that is so that you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.229 
reason why you do that is so that you
can<00:02:17.560> leave<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.769> little<00:02:18.010> piece<00:02:18.130> open<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.030> can

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
can leave a little piece open you can

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.150 
can leave a little piece open you can
turn<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> right-side<00:02:19.750> up<00:02:20.230> okay

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
turn it right-side up okay

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.380 
turn it right-side up okay
so<00:02:22.120> we'll<00:02:22.780> start<00:02:23.049> off<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.940> start<00:02:25.209> off<00:02:25.360> in

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
so we'll start off and we start off in

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
so we'll start off and we start off in
this<00:02:25.630> bottom<00:02:26.079> corner<00:02:26.110> where<00:02:26.739> these<00:02:26.920> two<00:02:27.190> lines

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
this bottom corner where these two lines

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.080 
this bottom corner where these two lines
meet<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.890> why<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.190> did<00:02:30.370> our<00:02:30.519> square

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
meet this is why we did our square

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.910 
meet this is why we did our square
template<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.840> would<00:02:32.079> have<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> sewing<00:02:32.709> line

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
template so you would have a sewing line

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.360 
template so you would have a sewing line
follow<00:02:33.340> come<00:02:34.299> up<00:02:34.480> through<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.840> bottom<00:02:35.019> and<00:02:35.440> we

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
follow come up through the bottom and we

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.740 
follow come up through the bottom and we
make<00:02:36.519> sure<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.820> doesn't<00:02:36.970> go<00:02:37.209> through<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.660> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
make sure it doesn't go through and it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.120 
make sure it doesn't go through and it
doesn't<00:02:38.019> because<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.260> knot<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> really<00:02:38.890> good

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
doesn't because the knot is really good

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.220 
doesn't because the knot is really good
and<00:02:39.370> you're<00:02:40.120> going<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.269> go<00:02:40.450> back<00:02:40.690> down<00:02:41.049> to<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
and you're going to go back down to the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.120 
and you're going to go back down to the
bottom<00:02:44.470> pull<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.400> through<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:47.709> come<00:02:47.950> back

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
the same stitch length up here that's

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.309 
the same stitch length up here that's
the<00:02:59.720> skips<00:03:00.080> up<00:03:00.350> on<00:03:00.680> stitch<00:03:01.490> length<00:03:02.120> as<00:03:02.330> well<00:03:02.540> if

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
the skips up on stitch length as well if

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.540
