00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
background alpha for the folders as well

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
background alpha for the folders as well
as<00:01:06.900> down<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.830> contin<00:01:08.250> spacing

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
as down here we have I contin spacing

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.630 
as down here we have I contin spacing
and<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> little<00:01:09.510> bit<00:01:10.010> not<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.340> great

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
and this is a little bit not so great

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
and this is a little bit not so great
just<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.630> hard<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> tell

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
just because it's really hard to tell

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.080 
just because it's really hard to tell
the<00:01:13.200> difference<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.920> mean<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:14.820> no

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the difference of I mean there's no

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.359 
the difference of I mean there's no
reference<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> no<00:01:16.200> reference<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
reference we have no reference what the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.539 
reference we have no reference what the
actual<00:01:17.700> icon<00:01:18.119> spacing<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.810> mean<00:01:19.310> 3.87<00:01:20.310> what

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
actual icon spacing is I mean 3.87 what

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.700 
actual icon spacing is I mean 3.87 what
so<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> annoying<00:01:22.170> because<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so that's kind of annoying because you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.870 
so that's kind of annoying because you
have<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.920> respring<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.400> order<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.759> to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
have to respring in order for it to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.600 
have to respring in order for it to
actually<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:25.110> an<00:01:25.200> idea<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> what<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> spacing

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
actually get an idea of what the spacing

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
actually get an idea of what the spacing
is<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.450> than<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.960> not<00:01:28.080> really

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is but other than that it's not really

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
is but other than that it's not really
that<00:01:28.409> bad<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.040> let's<00:01:29.490> change<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> layout

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that bad so let's change up the layout

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230 
that bad so let's change up the layout
right<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.960> we're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:32.180> by<00:01:33.180> two

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
right here we're going to do two by two

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109 
right here we're going to do two by two
and<00:01:34.130> we're<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> leave<00:01:35.700> we're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and we're going to leave we're going to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.370 
and we're going to leave we're going to
change<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> background<00:01:36.570> alpha<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> way

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
change the background alpha all the way

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
change the background alpha all the way
down<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> we're<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> change<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.640> size

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
down and we're going to change the size

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
down and we're going to change the size
of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> icons<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.079> little<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.409> down<00:01:40.619> to

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
of the icons just a little bit down to

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.510 
of the icons just a little bit down to
20<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> spacing<00:01:42.270> will<00:01:42.570> leave<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.990> around<00:01:43.520> 3.87

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
20 and spacing will leave it around 3.87

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.560 
20 and spacing will leave it around 3.87
we'll<00:01:44.640> see<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.030> does<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.420> we'll

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
we'll see what that does so we'll

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.780 
we'll see what that does so we'll
respring<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.140> check<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.860> all<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.640> so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
respring and check that out all right so

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.399 
respring and check that out all right so
now<00:01:47.939> we're<00:01:48.090> restrung<00:01:48.540> let's<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.200> ahead<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
now we're restrung let's go ahead and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.219 
now we're restrung let's go ahead and
unlock<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.119> all<00:01:51.930> right<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
unlock and see what it did all right so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.010 
unlock and see what it did all right so
we<00:01:52.350> don't<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.799> any<00:01:53.009> type<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> background<00:01:54.329> for

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
we don't have any type of background for

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840 
we don't have any type of background for
our<00:01:55.049> folders<00:01:55.560> because<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.950> turned<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> Alpha

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
our folders because we turned the Alpha

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.179 
our folders because we turned the Alpha
all<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.930> completely

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
all the way down so it's completely

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.950 
all the way down so it's completely
transparent<00:01:59.189> now<00:02:00.030> you'll<00:02:00.210> notice<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> icon

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
transparent now you'll notice the icon

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.620 
transparent now you'll notice the icon
size<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.619> not<00:02:01.770> too<00:02:02.009> bad<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
size is actually not too bad and the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
size is actually not too bad and the
spacing<00:02:03.899> isn't<00:02:04.290> bad<00:02:04.409> either<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.369> will<00:02:05.579> notice

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
spacing isn't bad either you will notice

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.270 
spacing isn't bad either you will notice
that<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.149> don't<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.630> four<00:02:07.020> icons<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.740> these

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that I don't have four icons in these

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.770 
that I don't have four icons in these
folders<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.209> more<00:02:09.450> than<00:02:09.539> four

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
folders but there are more than four

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.720 
folders but there are more than four
icons<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.530> folder<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.520> see<00:02:11.700> how

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
icons in this folder so you can see how

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.850 
icons in this folder so you can see how
that<00:02:11.900> works<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.200> there

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that works right there

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.740 
that works right there
so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.460> doesn't<00:02:14.640> look<00:02:14.850> too<00:02:15.030> bad<00:02:15.060> i<00:02:15.270> would<00:02:15.570> add

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
so this doesn't look too bad i would add

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.050 
so this doesn't look too bad i would add
a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.620> background<00:02:17.490> for<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
a little bit of a background for the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
a little bit of a background for the
folder<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:18.930> other<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.560> actually

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
folder but other than that it actually

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.560 
folder but other than that it actually
looks<00:02:20.040> pretty<00:02:20.160> good<00:02:20.460> now<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.210> thing<00:02:21.240> i<00:02:21.510> will

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
looks pretty good now one thing i will

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.380 
looks pretty good now one thing i will
mention<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.320> everything<00:02:23.280> looks<00:02:23.520> great<00:02:23.760> when

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
mention is everything looks great when

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.750 
mention is everything looks great when
you<00:02:24.510> do<00:02:24.690> something<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.590> less<00:02:26.070> than<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you do something that is less than the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.120 
you do something that is less than the
actual<00:02:26.940> default<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:27.990> anything<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:28.710> less

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
actual default so anything that's less

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.540 
actual default so anything that's less
than<00:02:29.160> 3<00:02:29.670> by<00:02:29.820> 3<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.360> 2<00:02:30.390> by<00:02:30.720> 2<00:02:30.780> 1<00:02:31.320> by<00:02:31.470> 1<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.280> looks

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
than 3 by 3 so 2 by 2 1 by 1 that looks

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.790 
than 3 by 3 so 2 by 2 1 by 1 that looks
great<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.020> get<00:02:34.200> into<00:02:34.350> something<00:02:34.440> a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
great but if you get into something a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.170 
great but if you get into something a
little<00:02:34.950> bit<00:02:35.130> bigger<00:02:35.430> you're<00:02:35.790> going<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:35.970> notice

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
little bit bigger you're going to notice

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
little bit bigger you're going to notice
that<00:02:36.540> you're<00:02:36.780> not<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.110> be<00:02:37.200> able<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.710> have

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that you're not going to be able to have

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.060 
that you're not going to be able to have
all<00:02:38.460> these<00:02:38.610> icons<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.330> your<00:02:39.780> folder<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.620> it's

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
all these icons in your folder so it's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.860 
all these icons in your folder so it's
not<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.550> fill<00:02:41.730> up<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.970> preview<00:02:42.390> now<00:02:42.840> I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
not going to fill up the preview now I

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.210 
not going to fill up the preview now I
know<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.110> sounds<00:02:43.440> probably<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> little<00:02:44.040> bit

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
know that sounds probably a little bit

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.170 
know that sounds probably a little bit
confusing<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:44.790> i'm<00:02:44.880> going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.030> show<00:02:45.150> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
confusing so i'm going to show you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.820 
confusing so i'm going to show you
exactly<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.810> mean<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:46.530> we're<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
exactly what I mean so we're going to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.590 
exactly what I mean so we're going to
scroll<00:02:47.040> down<00:02:47.100> here<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.790> tiny<00:02:48.240> grid<00:02:48.510> again

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
scroll down here to tiny grid again

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.930 
scroll down here to tiny grid again
we're<00:02:49.290> going<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> tap<00:02:49.740> on<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.190> we're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
we're going to tap on that and we're

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.340 
we're going to tap on that and we're
going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> change<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.840> four<00:02:52.290> by<00:02:52.470> four

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
going to change this to four by four

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.930 
going to change this to four by four
alright<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> means<00:02:55.860> there<00:02:56.010> should<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.370> 16

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
alright so that means there should be 16

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.260 
alright so that means there should be 16
icons<00:02:57.480> but<00:02:57.840> we<00:02:58.500> can't<00:02:58.860> actually<00:02:59.040> fit<00:02:59.489> 16<00:02:59.910> icons

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
icons but we can't actually fit 16 icons

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.790 
icons but we can't actually fit 16 icons
if<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.540> don't<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.870> another<00:03:01.140> compatible

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
if you don't have another compatible

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.729 
if you don't have another compatible
tweak<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.700> put<00:03:02.940> 16<00:03:03.330> icons<00:03:03.720> per<00:03:04.110> page<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
tweak to put 16 icons per page in the

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.560 
tweak to put 16 icons per page in the
folder<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:05.760> actually<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.270> some

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
folder so it's actually going to be some

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.360 
folder so it's actually going to be some
empty<00:03:06.870> space<00:03:07.200> there<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:08.040> we're<00:03:08.190> going<00:03:08.310> to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
empty space there so we're going to

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.979 
empty space there so we're going to
change<00:03:08.580> this<00:03:08.820> background<00:03:09.090> alpha<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:09.900> we

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
change this background alpha up so we

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.479 
change this background alpha up so we
can<00:03:10.110> see<00:03:10.320> that<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.770> bit<00:03:10.920> we're<00:03:11.400> also

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
can see that a little bit we're also

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.010 
can see that a little bit we're also
going<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> make<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> icon<00:03:12.360> size<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> little<00:03:12.900> bit

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
going to make the icon size a little bit

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.600 
going to make the icon size a little bit
smaller<00:03:13.290> just<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.739> make<00:03:13.890> sure<00:03:13.920> that<00:03:14.280> all<00:03:14.310> those

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
smaller just to make sure that all those

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.990 
smaller just to make sure that all those
icons<00:03:15.030> fit<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.770> then<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.920> icon<00:03:17.280> spacing<00:03:17.820> is

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
icons fit and then the icon spacing is

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.509 
icons fit and then the icon spacing is
going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.140> little<00:03:19.170> bit<00:03:19.410> tighter<00:03:19.799> so

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
going to be just a little bit tighter so

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.400 
going to be just a little bit tighter so
we'll<00:03:20.940> save<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.660> respring<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.350> i'll

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
we'll save this in respring and i'll

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.920 
we'll save this in respring and i'll
show<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.620> exactly<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.880> does<00:03:24.150> alright

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
show you exactly what that does alright

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.120 
show you exactly what that does alright

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
unlock and you can see exactly what I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.930 
unlock and you can see exactly what I
mean<00:03:29.640> right<00:03:29.820> here<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.299> we<00:03:30.450> have<00:03:30.660> nine<00:03:31.290> icons<00:03:31.940> so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
mean right here so we have nine icons so

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.350 
mean right here so we have nine icons so
we<00:03:33.299> can<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.810> all<00:03:34.080> 9<00:03:34.470> icons<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.820> can't<00:03:36.030> fit

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
we can see all 9 icons but we can't fit

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.720 
we can see all 9 icons but we can't fit
any<00:03:36.570> more<00:03:36.660> icons<00:03:37.230> on<00:03:37.440> this<00:03:37.769> page<00:03:38.070> unless<00:03:38.549> we

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
any more icons on this page unless we

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.449 
any more icons on this page unless we
have<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> compatible<00:03:39.450> tweak<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.190> see

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
have a compatible tweak so you can see

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.430 
have a compatible tweak so you can see
right<00:03:41.730> there<00:03:42.180> that's<00:03:42.600> not<00:03:42.810> going<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.080> look<00:03:43.260> too

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
right there that's not going to look too

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.470 
right there that's not going to look too
great<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.890> my<00:03:44.310> opinion<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:45.120> if<00:03:45.239> that's<00:03:45.390> not

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
great in my opinion but if that's not

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.060 
great in my opinion but if that's not
something<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.959> really<00:03:46.110> bothers<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.650> then

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
something that really bothers you then

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.770 
something that really bothers you then
this<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.489> all<00:03:47.640> right<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.090> there<00:03:48.420> really<00:03:48.450> are

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
this is all right and there really are

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.229 
this is all right and there really are
no<00:03:48.810> boundaries<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:50.070> tweak<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:51.090> can

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
no boundaries to this tweak so you can

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.479 
no boundaries to this tweak so you can
actually<00:03:51.269> make<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.870> look<00:03:51.900> pretty<00:03:52.080> bad<00:03:52.739> but<00:03:53.340> you

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
actually make it look pretty bad but you

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.130 
actually make it look pretty bad but you
can<00:03:53.700> make<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.030> look<00:03:54.180> good<00:03:54.390> like<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> was<00:03:54.900> saying

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
can make it look good like I was saying

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.110 
can make it look good like I was saying
the<00:03:55.560> first<00:03:55.799> two<00:03:55.980> options<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.519> had<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> one

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the first two options that I had the one

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.150 
the first two options that I had the one
by<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.750> two<00:03:57.900> by<00:03:58.049> two<00:03:58.110> actually<00:03:58.950> looked

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
by one in the two by two actually looked

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.560 
by one in the two by two actually looked
good<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.489> three<00:03:59.700> by<00:03:59.820> three<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.180> obviously

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
good the three by three is obviously

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.440 
good the three by three is obviously
going<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.930> be<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:02.070> default<00:04:02.400> but<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:02.850> can<00:04:02.940> mess

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
going to be the default but you can mess

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.729 
going to be the default but you can mess
around<00:04:03.480> with<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.870> background<00:04:04.260> alpha<00:04:04.590> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
around with the background alpha the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.009 
around with the background alpha the
icon<00:04:05.070> size<00:04:05.280> as<00:04:05.549> well<00:04:05.730> as<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> spacing<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.570> make

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
icon size as well as the spacing to make

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.780 
icon size as well as the spacing to make
it<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> little<00:04:07.650> bit<00:04:07.890> different<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.430> however

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
it a little bit different and however

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.449 
it a little bit different and however
you<00:04:08.850> like<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.600> can<00:04:09.840> still<00:04:10.310> make<00:04:11.310> this

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
you like it but you can still make this

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.520 
you like it but you can still make this
not<00:04:11.670> look<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.000> great<00:04:12.329> so<00:04:12.660> if<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.870> do<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.079> five

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
not look that great so if we do a five

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.500 
not look that great so if we do a five
by<00:04:13.769> five<00:04:14.070> which<00:04:14.670> you<00:04:14.820> can<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.000> here<00:04:15.180> we're

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
by five which you can see here we're

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.699 
by five which you can see here we're
going<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.690> turn<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> background<00:04:16.320> alpha<00:04:16.590> all

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
going to turn the background alpha all

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.900 
going to turn the background alpha all
the<00:04:16.829> way<00:04:16.919> back<00:04:17.100> up<00:04:17.160> we're<00:04:17.489> also<00:04:17.609> going<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the way back up we're also going to

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.240 
the way back up we're also going to
change<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.359> size<00:04:18.630> quite<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.410> bit<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.100> we're

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
change the size quite a bit and we're

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.250 
change the size quite a bit and we're
going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> take<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.910> icon<00:04:21.299> spacing<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.989> up<00:04:22.140> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
going to take the icon spacing just up a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.839 
going to take the icon spacing just up a
bit<00:04:22.500> as<00:04:22.650> well<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.430> you're<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> see

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
bit as well so you're going to see

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.820 
bit as well so you're going to see
exactly<00:04:24.150> what<00:04:24.479> this<00:04:24.599> looks<00:04:24.870> like<00:04:24.960> alright<00:04:25.710> so

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
exactly what this looks like alright so

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.230 
exactly what this looks like alright so
now<00:04:25.979> we're<00:04:26.160> restrung<00:04:26.610> let's

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
now we're restrung let's

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.180 
now we're restrung let's
go<00:04:27.300> ahead<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.449> unlock<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.960> device<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.500> you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
go ahead and unlock the device and you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.980 
go ahead and unlock the device and you
can<00:04:29.340> see<00:04:29.490> exactly<00:04:29.759> what<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:30.090> mean<00:04:30.180> there<00:04:30.660> are<00:04:30.810> no

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
can see exactly what I mean there are no

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.839 
can see exactly what I mean there are no
boundaries<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:31.770> you<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.039> actually<00:04:32.370> make<00:04:32.699> it

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
boundaries so you can actually make it

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.140 
boundaries so you can actually make it
look<00:04:33.650> basically<00:04:34.650> unusable<00:04:35.099> you<00:04:35.699> don't<00:04:35.880> want

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
look basically unusable you don't want
