00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bite it but you know like I say I'm a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.240 
bite it but you know like I say I'm a
half<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.689> mile<00:01:33.869> away<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.170> can't<00:01:34.650> even<00:01:34.890> see<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.240 
half a mile away I can't even see the
cattle<00:01:35.840> so<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> can't<00:01:37.290> get<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.650> him<00:01:37.799> too<00:01:37.950> bad<00:01:38.220> I

cattle so I can't get on him too bad I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.429 
cattle so I can't get on him too bad I

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
probably wouldn't get on him even if I

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.800 
probably wouldn't get on him even if I
woulda<00:01:40.650> saw<00:01:41.640> him<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> might<00:01:42.450> stop<00:01:42.780> him

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
woulda saw him do that I might stop him

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
woulda saw him do that I might stop him
lying<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.860> let<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.189> cow<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.670> back

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
lying down just let that cow going back

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.380 
lying down just let that cow going back
into<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> herd<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:47.369> these<00:01:47.520> two<00:01:47.759> dogs<00:01:48.000> worked

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
into the herd but these two dogs worked

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.850 
into the herd but these two dogs worked
pretty<00:01:48.600> good<00:01:48.720> together<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> Kate

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
pretty good together you see Kate

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.999 
pretty good together you see Kate
working<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.579> side<00:01:51.409> Jets<00:01:52.409> over<00:01:52.710> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
working the right side Jets over here

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.050 
working the right side Jets over here
working<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.850> left<00:01:54.180> side<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:55.610> think<00:01:56.610> he<00:01:56.700> puts<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
working this left side I think he puts a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
working this left side I think he puts a
little<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.479> pressure<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.020> him<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.290> here

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
little much pressure on him right here

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.709 
little much pressure on him right here
so<00:01:58.829> he<00:01:58.979> switches<00:01:59.310> back<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> where<00:02:00.240> both<00:02:00.479> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
so he switches back to where both of
