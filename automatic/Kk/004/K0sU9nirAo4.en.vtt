00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.210
 hello very good to all welcome a 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.000
 more time to my channel here that is a new 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.370
 a new guide to fair nights at fredys 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.379
 4 this time I'm going to make a guide 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.669
 of which is one of the most 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:17.320
 difficult of the whole game the night 5 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.240
 tonight is completely different to 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.580
 previous 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.830
 that's why a guide is necessary for 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.270
 pass it to her because if we do not know what is 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.430
 what is there to do 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.430
 we find it extremely difficult 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.870
 the problem is that scott decided to do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.030
 for the last night 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.829
 a completely different mechanism than 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.600
 that we are used to so far 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.250
 we were used to using a 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.920
 Lantern 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.020
 but now we have the lantern 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.180
 to save we should not use the flashlight 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.880
 in the corridors because if we light up 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.550
 fred see that it is the new animatronic or 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.250
 that comes out in this last section of the game 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.770
 at night 5 if it lights up let's go with the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 light kills us then the only thing we're going 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.280
 to do in the corridors is to close the 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.100
 door and listen 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.170
 we see how he moves his steps and 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.640
 we have to go to the other door 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 fred see what he's going to do is go for a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.259
 door to another giving us laps and we have 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
 to close the door where he is 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.270
 so that the other one goes when he laughs 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.220
 as he just did is that he is inside 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.649
 of the room we have to look at or in the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.300
 bed or in the closet there is what 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.850
 let's see we close the closet as 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.320
 we did with foxy and we see that it is not and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.369
 now he is again at the doors 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.369
 we look for the doors 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.950
 we listen and if it is not I am they are 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.510
 synonyms happened is that they are the other 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.510
 this gate door steals 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.819
 there we saw him go and we have to go what 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.499
 we just go back we have to be 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.499
 very attentive to the sounds because 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.110
 sometimes it goes and comes back 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 we hear 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.450
 and it's gone to the other side it's like 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.179
 a game of trileros we have to 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.679
 guess by the sound 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.780
 I recommend playing with dolby helmets 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.410
 Sorround to know when it's going to 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.740
 left and when it goes to the right 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.890
 now it's just going and we have to have 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.770
 be careful because it is not as easy as 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.900
 it seems as the night progresses 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.910
 it starts going from one place to another and 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.590
 ends up going crazy and for not 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.600
 know exactly in which door it 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.110
 find why we have to be very 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.110
 attentive 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.540
 there are some times that it takes a little longer 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.010
 what others just happened to that 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.050
 we have to give him the opportunity with the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 behind closed doors sometimes you have to wait 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.190
 a little more and others a little less 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.739
 we have to trust our instinct 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 if we want it to be in a door there 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.150
 to stay in that door until 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.250
 go away if a long time goes by and he does not leave 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.230
 it means that it is in the other 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.960
 but you have to be very careful with the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.910
 sound and especially with memory if 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.030
 for example, he leaves here every time 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.920
 we hear the steps have a time 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.340
 let's say the steps have about 3 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.410
 seconds and now they end if we return it to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.470
 to go is to come back you can hear perfectly 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.100
 when it goes and when it comes back sometimes 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.770
 it even goes back goes and goes back up to 4 and 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.080
 5 times I have come to count the times 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.020
 that moves and makes us a little crazy 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.540
 but that this is the final night 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.840
 night 5 we are going by 3 of the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.840
 early morning 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.290
 and for now it only comes in once 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.480
 arrives to enter the room as 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.970
 I said before or it 's in the closet 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.740
 as we saw before or sometimes it is on top of 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.840
 the bed if it is on top of the bed 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.540
 we have to shine we are dazzled 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.420
 with the flashlight as if it were the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.849
 small freddys 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.069
 and disappears then when it disappears 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.959
 go back to the corridors 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.060
 but the advisable thing is that it does not enter 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.060
 never inside the room since yes 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.220
 you come in and we do not scare you in time 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.230
 kill 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.140
 the same happens when the doors are 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.630
 If you spend too much time doors 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.640
 Sometimes he laughs and between us we have the 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.040
 second chance but other times 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.510
 go directly and kill us 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.170
 we can go around and we can not find it 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.850
 no site 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.210
 and suddenly when we turn around 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.300
 it kills us 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.789
 then the way to spend it 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.849
 listen at closed doors 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.729
 we close and listen 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:38.559
 now it is gone and so all the time until 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.169
 arrived at 7 in the morning if anything is 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:43.270
 puts what what the 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.619
 wardrobe or the bed if it is in either 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.839
 of the two sites already know how 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:48.759
 scare them if you're in bed what 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:51.639
 we light up with the light if it is in the 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:54.129
 locker locked closet until 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.849
 let him go and then start again and 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.849
 it's 4 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.449
 you have to be very careful because a 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:03.979
 failure here can be deadly if we 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.959
 wrong door we think is 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.110
 in one and it turns out that it is in the other 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.849
 he may get inside and sometimes 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.969
 we have the second chance and other 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.199
 sometimes it kills us and there we are lost 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.699
 we have to do this pretty fast 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.069
 not like the previous nights there 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.529
 to think about it well here we have to 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.669
 look for a door that is correct and 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.669
 and continue from there 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.279
 it's already 5 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.689
 here we see how I get dizzy from one side to 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.759
 another in a lot of times 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:38.069
 even sometimes it does not always do the same 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.179
 sometimes it goes well and wait a few seconds and 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:41.980
 then he goes 

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:43.690
 other times it comes and goes all followed 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.190
 It has a pretty behavior 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.490
 random which makes it quite 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.490
 hard 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.930
 now he just laughs he means that 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:55.340
 is inside the room we have to 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.100
 look inside the closet since it is not 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.500
 in bed and there we see it we close 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.540
 got inside because I was wrong to the 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.490
 time to hear the door is just 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.490
 go and is again at the door 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.860
 he just came back and now he has to go 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.860
 again 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.190
 just come back here is already getting 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.190
 the hard thing is easy to get wrong 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.560
 there is a bit left 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.600
 and six in the morning that was all 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.200
 I hope it has been useful and 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.200
 until next time
