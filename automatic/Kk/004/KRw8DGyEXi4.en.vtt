a top speed of 55 miles an hour
now<00:01:01.239> what<00:01:01.390> makes<00:01:01.570> this<00:01:01.720> built<00:01:01.989> really

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
now what makes this built really

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.039 
now what makes this built really
incredible<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:04.420> know<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.600> could<00:01:04.780> plane

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
incredible is you know you could plane

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.280 
incredible is you know you could plane
off<00:01:05.260> at<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.159> very<00:01:06.580> slow<00:01:07.000> speed<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.600> know<00:01:07.720> in<00:01:08.049> the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
off at a very slow speed you know in the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.520 
off at a very slow speed you know in the
high<00:01:09.040> teens<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.720> never<00:01:10.900> really<00:01:11.080> seems<00:01:11.409> to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
high teens but it never really seems to

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.260 
high teens but it never really seems to
fall<00:01:11.830> off<00:01:12.010> plane<00:01:12.280> when<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.549> have<00:01:12.670> a<00:01:12.700> trim<00:01:13.030> down

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
fall off plane when you have a trim down

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.330 
fall off plane when you have a trim down
which<00:01:13.600> should<00:01:13.630> be<00:01:13.900> nice<00:01:14.080> when<00:01:14.979> it's<00:01:15.130> really

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
which should be nice when it's really

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.950 
which should be nice when it's really
rough<00:01:15.670> out<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.119> can<00:01:16.299> kind<00:01:16.510> of<00:01:16.600> control<00:01:16.930> your

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
rough out you can kind of control your

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.530 
rough out you can kind of control your
speed<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:17.860> it<00:01:18.549> handles<00:01:18.940> beautifully<00:01:19.119> at

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
speed and it handles beautifully at

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.179 
speed and it handles beautifully at
wakeboarding<00:01:20.080> speeds<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.619> we<00:01:20.799> got<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:20.950> nice

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
wakeboarding speeds and we got a nice

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.670 
wakeboarding speeds and we got a nice
wakeboarding<00:01:22.119> wake<00:01:22.360> when<00:01:22.990> we<00:01:23.140> trimmed<00:01:23.439> it<00:01:23.560> up

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
wakeboarding wake when we trimmed it up

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.580 
wakeboarding wake when we trimmed it up
about<00:01:23.920> 20<00:01:24.340> 21<00:01:24.760> miles<00:01:25.000> an<00:01:25.180> hour<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.689> it<00:01:26.320> gave<00:01:26.560> us

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
about 20 21 miles an hour and it gave us

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
about 20 21 miles an hour and it gave us
a<00:01:26.770> nice<00:01:26.950> pretty<00:01:27.610> crisp<00:01:27.940> lip<00:01:28.680> plenty<00:01:29.680> for

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a nice pretty crisp lip plenty for

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.510 
a nice pretty crisp lip plenty for
people<00:01:31.060> do<00:01:31.420> some<00:01:31.600> launch<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.140> but<00:01:32.800> what's

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
people do some launch and but what's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.400 
people do some launch and but what's
really<00:01:33.910> blew<00:01:34.240> my<00:01:34.390> mind<00:01:34.420> was<00:01:34.840> how<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.170> thing

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
really blew my mind was how this thing

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.620 
really blew my mind was how this thing
turns<00:01:35.460> let's<00:01:36.460> I<00:01:36.610> get<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:36.910> plane<00:01:37.210> and<00:01:37.390> I'll<00:01:37.450> show

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
turns let's I get on plane and I'll show

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.390 
turns let's I get on plane and I'll show
you<00:01:37.720> what<00:01:37.840> I'm<00:01:37.930> talking<00:01:37.960> about<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.590> Julie<00:01:39.250> I'll

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
you what I'm talking about if Julie I'll

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.820 
you what I'm talking about if Julie I'll
hang<00:01:39.580> on<00:01:39.790> there

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
hang on there

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.620 
hang on there
now<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.640> did<00:01:41.790> notice<00:01:42.000> those<00:01:42.330> when

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
now one thing I did notice those when

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.390 
now one thing I did notice those when
you<00:01:42.720> crank<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.380> hard<00:01:43.590> over<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.160> first

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
you crank it really hard over the first

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.940 
you crank it really hard over the first
time<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.900> hooks<00:01:46.110> up<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.740> bit

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
time it kind of hooks up a little bit

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.670 
time it kind of hooks up a little bit
and<00:01:47.310> turns<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.480> little<00:01:48.720> faster<00:01:49.170> than<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and turns a little faster than you think

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890 
and turns a little faster than you think
it<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.030> got<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.480> watch<00:01:51.540> out

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
it would so you got to kind of watch out

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.690 
it would so you got to kind of watch out
for<00:01:52.080> that<00:01:52.230> but<00:01:52.860> once<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.400> what<00:01:53.550> to

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
for that but once you know what to

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.000 
for that but once you know what to
expect<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.620> turn<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.950> thing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
expect you can just turn this thing

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.990 
expect you can just turn this thing
around<00:01:56.190> in<00:01:56.640> an<00:01:56.790> unbelievably<00:01:57.450> short<00:01:57.750> distance

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.140 

never<00:02:06.000> said<00:02:06.270> learn<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.750> talked<00:02:07.020> about

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.150 
never said learn I talked about

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.410 
never said learn I talked about
unbelievable

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
