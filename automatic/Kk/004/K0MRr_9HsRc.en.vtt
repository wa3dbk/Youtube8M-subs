00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.340
 Do you start soon race to Mr. Hagi while drinking one day liquor development was also settled down of Accord 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.680
 Maybe I'll do Mase talk cod I 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.720
 I just want to step up with love without being anxious but rather normal 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 not 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.340
 I thought it would be better to do it with six cylinders than the mainstream four cylinders at the time. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.600
 78 became the base of f 2 engine basic research to the year-end is 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.989
 Kawamoto- san wrote it at home 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.780
 It was a private team of 3 people when I started 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.780
 Increasingly the number of friends and stuffed the design once 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.090
 Eeeeee Eeeeee 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.910
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.910
 Had 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.910
 ai 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 May 16, 1980 at Silverstone in the UK 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:21.220
 I resolutely products f 2 did the first best 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:26.760
 After all engine sound because the six-cylinder is fast much better new straight than those of the four-cylinder 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.760
 It will not be understood that the person who was happy at that time was not the one who did 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.070
 Web war is June 8 three weeks after the test 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.480
 It was Round 6 of the European Championship held at Silverstone 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.970
 Driver is Nigelmanse 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.930
 Nowadays Mansell there is a boss of the head et al., And languor in the red hand 's head I'm the top drivers 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 Thane 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:53.710
 5 is something Tteyuu it would be no also be required if a trapezoidal double role guts of now hungry 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.400
 Chose Munsell just finished in Navi has been injured in ace from 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.980
 That is qualifying 14 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 Final's but was finished the race in 11th place 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:08.590
 I do not see the race trouble in the fuel system has been put forth the power's sound out 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.880
 The trouble is not out of the previous ace in the repair 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:18.490
 It is a situation that is very late for the start of the layout 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.220
 However, since the race organizer is such a race that has returned, it is necessary to start until the repair is over 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.090
 I've been waiting for you 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.090
 It was a deep feeling 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.310
 Hmm 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:59.300
 When the engine is've finished with all calculations will no longer work in our design 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.610
 It has been studied in various ways, but the form of a perfect engine is 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.010
 I do not know anyone 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.160
 If you understand that 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.720
 I will be ready for everyone 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:13.050
 That's why various engines with various features come out 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.250
 We always design for the ideal 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:21.340
 Just say what can not be reached in the future English ideal of engine 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.780
 Different be able to reach in the near future maybe 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.780
 It does not know
