00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.330
 look here there is life running again 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.760
 all the way through that to sand in 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.840
 the living room but also in the bathroom and 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.580
 in the hallway 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.049
 according to louis creators the misery started 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.029
 with the arrival of the chinook helicopter 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.410
 to the air base 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.350
 that are a stone's throw away 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.490
 house is yes there is little against it 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.590
 do as long as those big boys 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.940
 remain freaky we have cracks and 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.620
 we will keep tearing 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.420
 according to louis scheepers his house is standing 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.280
 literally vibrate like theirs 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.449
 transport helicopter flies over 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.449
 beautiful these mirrors would vibrate 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.770
 you can see what that for the rest of 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.570
 the house means here they come from 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 come back through it 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.980
 back and forth yes I have them continuously as 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.210
 what your stationed states adds to 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.010
 me about mauve 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.710
 the slope for the residents started in 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.809
 2008 then the major transport helicopters 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.430
 were stationed in guild rows 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.410
 if after that it appears that it is not one of them 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.540
 what they do though is all helicopters 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.890
 Netherlands from all over come here 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.020
 it gets a bit much of it 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.540
 good the residents of the row of houses 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.490
 the nerhoven think they are the victims 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.859
 have become because they are in the least 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.450
 urban area attend the basis for 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:13.039
 we are 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.649
 yes only a few houses and that one 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:19.909
 street and as the reeshof force 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.560
 yes then it is a bit more 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.659
 defense has promised to investigate 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.329
 whether the damage is with the residents 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.920
 caused by helicopters like that 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.240
 that's how the damage turns out to be 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.249
 reimbursed 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.630
 louis scheepers says that is no longer 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:34.880
 then a cloth for bleeding 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.259
 I have built a nice house with everything 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.729
 on and off 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.920
 and I don't blame it on the paving stones 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.259
 more lost I can surrender later 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.969
 would rather see skippers on a scrap yard 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.279
 that the helicopters just use 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.049
 of the runways and runways 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:50.060
 instead of going over the houses low 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.829
 flying starts and landing runways are 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.380
 not for nothing 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.090
 you can also use it 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.979
 you get sleepless nights of what 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.969
 Wake up in the middle of the night and then you think 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.969
 that you that I bring an agreement
