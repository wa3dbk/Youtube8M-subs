pressure<00:01:56.970> on<00:01:57.150> ourselves<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.930> feels<00:01:58.140> odd<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.680> be

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
pressure on ourselves it feels odd to be

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.040

kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.700> different<00:01:59.940> from<00:02:00.360> everybody<00:02:00.840> else

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
kind of different from everybody else

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.530 
kind of different from everybody else
and<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:01.830> always<00:02:02.100> work<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.180> our<00:02:03.270> favor

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and it doesn't always work in our favor

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.150 
and it doesn't always work in our favor
but<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.050> keep<00:02:04.260> pushing<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.100> then

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
but we just keep pushing and then

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.890 
but we just keep pushing and then
sometimes<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.730> absolutely<00:02:06.150> does<00:02:06.420> work<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.780> our

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
sometimes it absolutely does work in our

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.810 
sometimes it absolutely does work in our
favor<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.470> are<00:02:07.650> just<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.700> bit
