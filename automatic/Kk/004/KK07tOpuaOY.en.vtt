00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.510 
slows it all the way down to a thousand
frames<00:00:52.570> per<00:00:52.870> second<00:00:53.230> which<00:00:53.800> is<00:00:54.040> very<00:00:54.370> good

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520

slow motion for the cell phone so as you

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.810 
slow motion for the cell phone so as you
this<00:00:56.649> as<00:00:56.890> you<00:00:57.010> guys<00:00:57.160> saw<00:00:57.310> with<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.520> beginning

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
this as you guys saw with the beginning

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.660 
this as you guys saw with the beginning
of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.940> video<00:00:58.030> that<00:00:58.570> was<00:00:58.810> on<00:00:59.020> my<00:00:59.470> video<00:00:59.860> of<00:01:00.160> me

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and I slowed it down i believe by 50%

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.749 
and I slowed it down i believe by 50%
using<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.689> application<00:01:04.899> and<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.490> the

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
using this application and here is the

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.120 
using this application and here is the
raw<00:01:06.909> video<00:01:07.210> right<00:01:07.479> there<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:07.869> i<00:01:07.930> took<00:01:08.130> using

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
raw video right there that i took using

raw video right there that i took using
this<00:01:09.219> application<00:01:09.429> but<00:01:10.329> before<00:01:10.600> we<00:01:10.780> get

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
this application but before we get

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.179 
this application but before we get
started<00:01:11.049> looking<00:01:11.530> at<00:01:11.649> what<00:01:11.859> I've<00:01:11.979> already

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
what the user interface the interface

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.090 
what the user interface the interface
looks<00:01:16.179> like<00:01:16.329> of<00:01:16.689> this<00:01:16.840> app<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.710> here<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.009> is

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
looks like of this app so here it is

looks like of this app so here it is
we'll<00:01:18.999> see<00:01:19.179> that<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.600> looks<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:20.020> bit<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.229> the

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
we'll see that it looks a bit like the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.830 
we'll see that it looks a bit like the

take a look at one of these videos i
already<00:01:57.880> recorded<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:59.560> i<00:01:59.770> just<00:01:59.920> go

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
already recorded this and i just go

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.810 
already recorded this and i just go
ahead<00:02:00.099> and<00:02:00.219> click<00:02:00.399> play

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.270 

and<00:02:06.820> there<00:02:07.390> was<00:02:07.540> in<00:02:07.690> slow<00:02:07.810> motion<00:02:08.080> now<00:02:08.380> this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and there was in slow motion now this

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
and there was in slow motion now this
app<00:02:09.580> does<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:10.090> an<00:02:10.210> in-app<00:02:10.479> purchase

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
app does have an in-app purchase

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.380 
app does have an in-app purchase
available<00:02:11.470> i<00:02:11.920> believe<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.790> was<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.150> right

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
available i believe it was like right

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.260 
available i believe it was like right
down<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.350> was<00:02:14.470> 399<00:02:15.040> i<00:02:15.460> did<00:02:15.700> buy<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
down here it was 399 i did buy it and

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.090 
down here it was 399 i did buy it and
basically<00:02:16.750> what<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.050> does<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.470> remove<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
basically what it does is remove the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.010 
basically what it does is remove the
watermark<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.090> going<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.360> be<00:02:19.540> on<00:02:19.840> your

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
watermark that is going to be on your

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.110 
watermark that is going to be on your
video<00:02:20.290> after<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.710> record<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.970> can

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
video after you record it and you can

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.390 
video after you record it and you can
also<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:23.260> also<00:02:23.410> allows<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.070> slow<00:02:24.250> your

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
also it also allows you to slow your

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.040 
also it also allows you to slow your
video<00:02:24.640> down<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> thousand<00:02:25.570> frames<00:02:25.750> per

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
video down to a thousand frames per

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.170 
video down to a thousand frames per
second<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.430> we're<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.820> video

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
second so now that we're in the video

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
motion so yeah here we've got slower

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.820 
motion so yeah here we've got slower
forty<00:02:42.520> percent<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.030> i<00:02:44.020> can<00:02:44.230> change<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.650> even

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
forty percent and i can change it even

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.010 
forty percent and i can change it even
more<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.610> i<00:02:45.700> can<00:02:45.850> also<00:02:46.030> make<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.450> go<00:02:46.540> faster

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
more and i can also make it go faster

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.710 
more and i can also make it go faster
and<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.100> is<00:02:48.190> super<00:02:48.580> slow<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.570> the
