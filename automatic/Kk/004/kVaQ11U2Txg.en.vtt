00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.170
 Sasha kiss taganka good evening dear 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.260
 friends today we have very interesting 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.450
 accessories company belkin pro belkin we 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.199
 We will try to shoot more often because 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.840
 there are some awesome things but I will start 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.080
 the story of a small digression like this 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.310
 here 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.500
 smart plug rather smart socket bought 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.220
 my friend has squirrels living at his dacha 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.990
 only the mixture and he needs to 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.469
 accordingly somehow remotely turn on 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 white feeder since he has there 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.670
 everything is organized like a smart home that is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.489
 she has cameras there he has 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.649
 router he has a lot of things there he 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 bought here a few of these belkin sockets 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.680
 they allow using 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.559
 cellular on or off 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.149
 Sasha will now show various techniques 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.050
 will not connect anything naturally 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.090
 just show you what it looks like on 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.719
 tactics our group is that actively skeleton 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.820
 I can still find very useful not all 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.210
 says not for home it is not enough until 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.200
 sockets up because it works very 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 just remotely it connects to your 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 wi-fi network router through the application on 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.710
 smartphone you are connecting here and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.770
 then you can give it away 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.720
 teams why for example do you have somewhere 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.430
 outside the city banya and kvan for your arrival 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.409
 on there turn on the heater sasha 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 a little sick but we all get a little sick 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.329
 either heat the kettle or something else 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.030
 here it is inserted into a regular plug 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.009
 Looks like this is worth 5000 well now 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 everything went up earlier cost cheaper on 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.390
 what to do is configured at two times 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.860
 three and you accordingly with the help of this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.399
 sockets can include your home 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.710
 technique before such a decision in general 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.119
 enthusiasts collected from China ordered 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.380
 any bullshit car 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.600
 different were 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.240
 Well all the options it was some 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.149
 stupid here now here is this thing 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.890
 called past switch she i just 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:12.599
 Many friends and see many 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 so here I will say so 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.360
 dark matter and you need not forget 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.769
 pull out the power outlet and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.760
 left such a few houses to connect 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.040
 up all sorts of appliances 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.870
 computers tvs and if you tagged 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.050
 Still, problems can at work 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.030
 teachers 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.140
 yes this way solves the problem 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.239
 iron off 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.220
 that is, if it's included in your 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.360
 it is included there let's say tees 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.370
 tee iron then leaving anywhere you 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.860
 you can turn it off from anywhere in the world 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.569
 your iron and just don't sweat anymore about 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.650
 the fact that there you have something off on and 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.299
 so it is necessary here to give a very 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.329
 often buy because it is real 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.220
 it just works it is efficient and not 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.200
 no difficulty in setting 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.760
 plus now here sasha will show one more 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.170
 kit here is a motion sensor and this here 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.359
 generally straight to give find I want 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.720
 tell the same story in another 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:16.700
 My parents were in the summer at the cottage 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.819
 and there at home close to all at night 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.670
 in the evening when the neighbors arrived it turned out 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.500
 that their house was robbed all day and mine 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 parents didn't see anything because 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000
 Vary there somehow neatly sneaked 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.530
 all neatly collected almost on 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.350
 everyone's eyes we only them nobody 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.819
 noticed everyone pulled out 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:40.470
 accordingly this set of belkin 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:45.660
 vimos hiv + plast that there + plasma class 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.440
 Ears this kit before the socket is the same 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.510
 socket him switch and motion sensor 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.780
 when you have it connected in the room and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.239
 there odd begin to happen 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.769
 unhealthy here you get a signal and you 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.609
 comes a notice that something 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.160
 that 's all happening 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.290
 alarms complex about which 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.760
 Thieves know no such things 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.310
 that is, you can connect 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.200
 some kind of bed and hid 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.000
 put generally prominently next to 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.360
 a lamp there are examples 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.850
 even a but this switch rule and in its 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:24.940
 the app keeps track of what's going on 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:27.470
 all ingenious is not just you at home 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.420
 overpay what you know yes about such 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.750
 things don't even have to write any reviews 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.970
 because it is well, yes it is all 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.380
 tested all this checked all this 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.920
 reliably that is you will be able to 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.640
 use these two things as part 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:48.200
 smart home one for iron and goods up 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.390
 from thieves for once both things 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.490
 there really are my friends 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.910
 I haven't gotten to me yet 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:59.180
 now troit any but on occasion 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.760
 be sure to buy lose that add 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.870
 Sasha report no 2 is a good thing 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.600
 The patronite of Leningrad is one hour before 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.090
 approaching and approaching here are friends 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.660
 fucking too burned trying to dressed like 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.580
 battery heater apparently yes 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.550
 with heaters in general many 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.800
 There are therefore problems such sockets they 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.590
 or putting for doing something already boske 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.330
 were they decide they decide of course mass 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.530
 of questions 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.419
 massage, thanks to Belkin 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.020
 continue to thank you friends 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.020
 until
