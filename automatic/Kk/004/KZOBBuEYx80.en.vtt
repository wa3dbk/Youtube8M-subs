00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.319
 henrique pinto 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.999
 the game was in the house of corinthians the advantage was of corinthians that could 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.989
 lose by up to two difference goals that will be champion 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.949
 therefore the saints were silver with 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.639
 the fish needed goals from kléber pereira showed that he was alive 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.259
 at 26 minutes 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.310

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 kleber pereira 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.109

 in the year of 2002 and his assistant of the farm to 0 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050

 vi would happen if the game had help 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.640
 only one goal from jorge henrique 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 but teixeira 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.770
 the most points look 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 and how much more a goal by coverage 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 the Corinthian crowd sang olé during 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.330
 and at 37 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
 the team does not get that feat since 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.620
 no one was unbeaten Paulista champion since the palm of 72 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.980

 I was going to captain the team in the middle 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.900
 today you see new things 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.330
 we carry on to such a point that 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.190
 a small more serious accident 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.780
 ronaldo crowned his return to football with an incredible trajectory 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.539
