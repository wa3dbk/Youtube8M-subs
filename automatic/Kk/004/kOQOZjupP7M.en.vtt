beech<00:00:38.010> has<00:00:38.399> come<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.090> observe

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.620 

there<00:01:56.640> would<00:01:56.730> have<00:01:56.760> been<00:01:56.880> no<00:01:57.360> survivors

two<00:03:11.739> cars<00:03:12.010> collided<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:13.420> engine<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.959> front

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
two cars collided the engine the front

two cars collided the engine the front
structural<00:03:14.620> engineer<00:03:15.070> really<00:03:15.160> affect<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.519> lot

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
structural engineer really affect a lot

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.789 
structural engineer really affect a lot
of<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> energy<00:03:16.019> only<00:03:17.019> when<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.560> car's

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
of the energy only when the car's

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.910 
of the energy only when the car's
impacted<00:03:18.400> in<00:03:18.519> this<00:03:18.640> area<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.380> actual

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
impacted in this area that the actual

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.310 
impacted in this area that the actual
work<00:03:21.280> started<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.850> be<00:03:22.090> done<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.720> most<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.230> the

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
work started to be done and most of the

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.110 
work started to be done and most of the
energy<00:03:23.650> has<00:03:23.829> been<00:03:23.950> absorbed<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.850> see

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
energy has been absorbed and you see

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.090 
energy has been absorbed and you see
result<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:27.299> sanyo<00:03:28.299> in<00:03:28.450> these<00:03:28.930> 10<00:03:29.530> years<00:03:29.739> old<00:03:29.980> I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
result of sanyo in these 10 years old I

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.860 
result of sanyo in these 10 years old I
mean<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.310> modern<00:03:30.730> designs<00:03:31.120> any<00:03:31.390> better<00:03:31.690> at

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
mean the modern designs any better at

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.110 
mean the modern designs any better at
surviving<00:03:32.200> these<00:03:32.470> sort<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.739> it<00:03:32.860> yes<00:03:33.700> modern

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
surviving these sort of it yes modern

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.509 
surviving these sort of it yes modern
cars<00:03:34.360> are<00:03:34.570> designed<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.500> undergo<00:03:36.340> what's

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
cars are designed to undergo what's

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.740 
cars are designed to undergo what's
called<00:03:36.579> an<00:03:36.790> offset<00:03:36.940> test<00:03:37.450> we're<00:03:37.600> actually

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
called an offset test we're actually

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.780 
called an offset test we're actually
deliberately<00:03:38.320> on<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> impact<00:03:39.100> part<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.730> the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
deliberately on the impact part of the

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.270 
deliberately on the impact part of the
vehicle<00:03:40.150> width<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.709> sort<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:41.980> dumb<00:03:42.160> is

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
vehicle width so the sort of dumb is

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.580 
vehicle width so the sort of dumb is
that<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.519> see<00:03:42.760> here<00:03:43.000> would<00:03:43.540> be<00:03:43.810> less<00:03:44.290> on<00:03:44.560> a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
that you see here would be less on a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.400 
that you see here would be less on a
modern<00:03:44.950> car<00:03:45.190> but<00:03:45.820> I<00:03:45.850> have<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.150> say<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.720> 69<00:03:47.290> on

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
modern car but I have to say is 69 on

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.130 
modern car but I have to say is 69 on
our<00:03:47.560> test<00:03:48.269> compared<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.420> two<00:03:49.570> we<00:03:49.720> test<00:03:49.989> at<00:03:50.110> 40

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
our test compared to two we test at 40

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.460 
our test compared to two we test at 40
or<00:03:50.739> legally<00:03:51.370> 35<00:03:51.820> miles<00:03:52.090> an<00:03:52.209> hour<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:52.930> still<00:03:53.140> way

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
or legally 35 miles an hour is still way

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.800 
or legally 35 miles an hour is still way
of<00:03:53.650> what<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.340> modern<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.880> would<00:03:55.060> be

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.179 

so<00:04:01.810> what<00:04:01.959> can<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.139> do<00:04:02.260> what<00:04:02.409> is<00:04:02.650> really<00:04:02.859> great

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:03.189 
so what can we do what is really great

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.649 
so what can we do what is really great
ideas<00:04:03.639> for<00:04:03.849> the<00:04:03.939> future

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
ideas for the future

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.569 
ideas for the future
well<00:04:05.049> you<00:04:05.349> fighting<00:04:05.859> sort<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.099> conflicting

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
well you fighting sort of conflicting

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.670 
well you fighting sort of conflicting
requirements<00:04:06.730> here<00:04:07.329> you've<00:04:07.989> got<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.349> reform

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
requirements here you've got the reform

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.349 
requirements here you've got the reform
to<00:04:08.829> keeping<00:04:09.159> the<00:04:09.280> passenger<00:04:09.819> department

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
to keeping the passenger department

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.030 
to keeping the passenger department
rigid<00:04:10.749> so<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.469> officers<00:04:11.680> guns<00:04:11.829> don't

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
rigid so that the officers guns don't

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.740 
rigid so that the officers guns don't
get<00:04:12.219> crushed<00:04:12.549> but<00:04:13.209> then<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:13.389> also<00:04:13.540> want<00:04:13.659> to

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
get crushed but then you also want to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.629 
get crushed but then you also want to
make<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.959> front<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.349> the<00:04:14.469> car<00:04:14.859> nice<00:04:15.129> and<00:04:15.370> soft

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
make the front of the car nice and soft

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.759 
make the front of the car nice and soft
so<00:04:15.909> the<00:04:16.329> resorbs<00:04:16.840> as<00:04:17.019> much<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.410> energy<00:04:17.680> as

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
so the resorbs as much of the energy as

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.740 
so the resorbs as much of the energy as
possible<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.459> guess<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.209> one<00:04:19.299> thing<00:04:19.479> we<00:04:19.570> could

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
possible I guess the one thing we could

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.320 
possible I guess the one thing we could
do<00:04:19.959> is<00:04:20.380> make<00:04:20.620> our<00:04:20.829> 330<00:04:21.220> foot<00:04:21.400> bonus<00:04:21.789> but<00:04:22.300> I

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
do is make our 330 foot bonus but I

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.730 
do is make our 330 foot bonus but I
really<00:04:22.720> wouldn't<00:04:22.930> be<00:04:23.020> practical<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.560> drive

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
really wouldn't be practical to drive

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.740 
really wouldn't be practical to drive
around<00:04:23.949> on<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.190> roads<00:04:24.400> but<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.389> mean<00:04:25.539> it<00:04:25.660> what

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
around on the roads but I mean it what

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.120 
around on the roads but I mean it what
I've<00:04:25.810> seen<00:04:25.990> that<00:04:26.349> lots<00:04:26.530> to<00:04:26.650> cut<00:04:26.800> us<00:04:26.889> up<00:04:26.979> the

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
I've seen that lots to cut us up the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.730 
I've seen that lots to cut us up the
racing<00:04:27.520> accidents<00:04:28.000> but<00:04:28.590> nothing<00:04:29.590> quite

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
racing accidents but nothing quite

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.659 
racing accidents but nothing quite
prepares<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:30.370> for<00:04:30.630> like<00:04:31.630> this<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:33.310> makes<00:04:33.460> you

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
prepares you for like this it makes you

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.629 
prepares you for like this it makes you
think<00:04:33.849> I'll<00:04:34.479> tell<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:34.780> that

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
think I'll tell you that

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.760 
think I'll tell you that
so<00:04:36.639> next<00:04:36.849> time<00:04:37.120> you're<00:04:37.539> on<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.690> country<00:04:38.139> road<00:04:38.349> a

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
so next time you're on a country road a

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.460 
so next time you're on a country road a
contraflow<00:04:39.460> are<00:04:39.639> about<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.090> overtake<00:04:40.470> just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
contraflow are about to overtake just

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.460 
contraflow are about to overtake just
