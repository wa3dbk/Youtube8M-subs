 over water 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.869
 under water and of course 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 no region for a change 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 it was a dream bond 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.000
 For a week we want to disappear here the Vikings region 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.450
 We choose Prius Müller in the southeast of Sweden for her 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.710
 has a total area of ​​32 hectares and is located in the middle of the forest 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.210
 Of course there are Wolber as well as different Fried fish species 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 on the way and also the Cottbus apart 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.210
 very beautiful and at the same time the exciting thing is that we do not have any 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.700
 Information Solberg hair structure that is, there is now 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.470
 you can first ran ans scouting as a small help on us the location 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.960
 with the mobile phone via Google Maps unique from the very loaded on phone 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.060
 so we have the thing even without internet connection and have 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.330
 at least already know a rough survey where the bays see 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.430
 can orient us something 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.150
 and around at the beginning when with that we turn our little round over the lake 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.369
 have body Lot with it and will look like the structure of the lake 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.620
 It is about how deep the lake is in the middle area in the shore area 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.249
 and around 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.249
 then Wismar is a little bit more off 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:36.040
 Of course, the first flyers into the water are also right first 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.559
