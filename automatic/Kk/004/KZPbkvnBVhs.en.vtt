00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
let's let's do some goblin engineering

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.430 
let's let's do some goblin engineering
which<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:27.299> typical<00:02:27.660> for<00:02:28.019> goblin

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
which as is typical for goblin

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350 
which as is typical for goblin
engineering<00:02:28.860> involves<00:02:29.580> blowing<00:02:29.819> things<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
engineering involves blowing things the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.080 
engineering involves blowing things the
hell<00:02:30.510> off

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.979 

the<00:02:35.660> quest<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.170> ample<00:02:36.590> inspiration<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
the quest is ample inspiration and the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.280 
the quest is ample inspiration and the
situation<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.730> league<00:02:41.000> opens<00:02:41.390> at<00:02:41.540> k3<00:02:42.019> have

such thing and they need some food

such thing and they need some food
pretty<00:02:48.319> quickly<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.030> there's<00:02:50.030> mammoths<00:02:50.420> and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
to to get to the meat so they've sent me

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.410 
to to get to the meat so they've sent me
to<00:03:02.920> well<00:03:03.920> get<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> meat<00:03:04.849> that's<00:03:05.060> inside

to well get the meat that's inside

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.009 
to well get the meat that's inside
outside<00:03:06.019> so<00:03:06.500> they<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.830> eat<00:03:06.920> it<00:03:08.019> naturally

outside so they can eat it naturally

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.809 
outside so they can eat it naturally
this<00:03:09.170> involves<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.650> application<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:10.280> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
this involves the application of the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.960 
this involves the application of the
large<00:03:11.090> amount<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:11.599> explosives<00:03:12.760> I've<00:03:13.760> actually

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
large amount of explosives I've actually

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.610 
large amount of explosives I've actually
pretty<00:03:14.299> much<00:03:14.390> finished<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.170> went<00:03:15.380> through<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
pretty much finished that went through a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.199 
pretty much finished that went through a
North<00:03:16.040> room<00:03:16.250> now<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.400> should<00:03:16.790> be<00:03:16.940> on<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.150> the

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
North room now I should be on to the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.850 
North room now I should be on to the
caliber<00:03:17.510> subside<00:03:17.870> until<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.140> can't<00:03:18.560> head<00:03:18.739> of

caliber subside until I can't head of
the<00:03:18.980> Cataclysm<00:03:19.459> without<00:03:19.700> doing<00:03:19.970> this

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.790 

so<00:03:23.510> we're<00:03:24.230> over<00:03:24.440> here<00:03:24.650> with<00:03:24.980> tor<00:03:25.700> rumble<00:03:26.510> range

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
so we're over here with tor rumble range

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.660 
so we're over here with tor rumble range

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:52.390 

let's<00:03:44.300> find<00:03:44.690> some<00:03:44.930> mammoths

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.690 

this<00:03:52.760> blows<00:03:53.030> up<00:03:53.209> doesn't<00:03:53.860> this<00:03:54.860> explodes<00:03:55.400> if<00:03:55.579> I

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
this blows up doesn't this explodes if I

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.500 
this blows up doesn't this explodes if I
don't<00:03:55.879> know<00:04:00.790> okay<00:04:01.790> so<00:04:01.849> let's<00:04:02.090> find<00:04:02.329> some

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
don't know okay so let's find some

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.270 
don't know okay so let's find some
mammoth<00:04:04.989> right<00:04:05.989> within<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.439> next<00:04:06.590> let's<00:04:07.129> say

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
mammoth right within the next let's say

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.750 
mammoth right within the next let's say
16<00:04:07.670> seconds<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.360> have<00:04:08.659> no<00:04:08.930> idea<00:04:09.109> what<00:04:09.470> now

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.850 

mammoth

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:34.129 

and<00:04:24.860> boom

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.550 

well<00:04:35.139> done<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:37.020> should<00:04:38.020> hope<00:04:38.139> so

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.869 

actually<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.650> is<00:04:41.800> quite<00:04:41.949> ingenious<00:04:42.400> it's

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
actually this is quite ingenious it's

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.550 
actually this is quite ingenious it's
not<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:43.270> goblins<00:04:43.659> blowing<00:04:43.960> stuff<00:04:44.199> up<00:04:44.349> for

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
not just goblins blowing stuff up for

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.350 
not just goblins blowing stuff up for
the<00:04:44.650> sake<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.129> it<00:04:45.669> actually<00:04:45.849> cooks<00:04:46.210> the

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the sake of it it actually cooks the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.409 
the sake of it it actually cooks the
meat<00:04:46.509> as<00:04:46.659> well<00:04:47.789> that's<00:04:48.789> more<00:04:49.090> thought<00:04:49.389> than

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
meat as well that's more thought than

00:04:49.419 --> 00:05:01.020 
meat as well that's more thought than
I'd<00:04:49.719> expect<00:04:50.650> from<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.830> goblin<00:04:59.400> right<00:05:00.400> well<00:05:00.610> just

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
I'd expect from a goblin right well just

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.399 
I'd expect from a goblin right well just
because<00:05:01.330> I've<00:05:01.449> got<00:05:01.629> enough<00:05:01.840> meat<00:05:02.080> now<00:05:02.289> it

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
because I've got enough meat now it

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.600 
because I've got enough meat now it
doesn't<00:05:02.650> mean<00:05:02.800> we<00:05:02.979> should<00:05:03.129> stop<00:05:03.310> playing

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
doesn't mean we should stop playing

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.159 
doesn't mean we should stop playing
stuff<00:05:03.819> our<00:05:03.969> son

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.570 

I<00:05:14.449> guess<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.599> whole<00:05:15.719> fizzing<00:05:16.229> and<00:05:16.580> holding

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
I guess the whole fizzing and holding

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.680 
I guess the whole fizzing and holding
the<00:05:17.639> bomb<00:05:17.819> in<00:05:17.939> your<00:05:17.969> hands<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.629> should

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.180 

bad<00:05:23.690> things<00:05:24.020> will<00:05:24.140> happen<00:05:24.260> quite<00:05:24.740> amplify<00:05:25.130> the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
bad things will happen quite amplify the

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.519 
bad things will happen quite amplify the
