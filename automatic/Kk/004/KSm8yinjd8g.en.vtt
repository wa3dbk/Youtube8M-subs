00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
another video today I had my part come

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:07.940 
another video today I had my part come
in<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.170> afternoon

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
in this afternoon

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.850 
in this afternoon
I<00:00:07.980> ordered<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.090> hand<00:00:09.960> grip<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
I ordered this hand grip it's the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.490 
I ordered this hand grip it's the
straight<00:00:11.370> handle<00:00:12.090> grip<00:00:12.300> assembly<00:00:12.840> made<00:00:13.080> by<00:00:13.259> my

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
straight handle grip assembly made by my

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.060 
straight handle grip assembly made by my
lab<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.099> genuine<00:00:14.639> mine<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.299> part<00:00:16.070> it's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
lab it is a genuine mine that part it's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.310 
lab it is a genuine mine that part it's
actually<00:00:17.400> made<00:00:17.640> not<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> Excalibur<00:00:19.080> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
actually made not for the Excalibur but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.609 
actually made not for the Excalibur but
for<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> different<00:00:20.189> metal<00:00:20.640> detector<00:00:21.619> don't

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
for a different metal detector don't

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.679 
for a different metal detector don't
know<00:00:22.769> which<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.939> does<00:00:24.150> work<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.539> this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
know which one but it does work for this

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.130 
know which one but it does work for this
application<00:00:25.939> some<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> folks<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.840> use

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
application some of you folks I know use

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140 
application some of you folks I know use
the<00:00:28.380> bicycle<00:00:28.560> hand<00:00:29.130> grips<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.820> make<00:00:29.970> your

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the bicycle hand grips if you make your

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.359 
the bicycle hand grips if you make your
own<00:00:30.179> shafts<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.529> that's<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.769> great<00:00:31.890> idea

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
own shafts I think that's a great idea

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.790 
own shafts I think that's a great idea
but<00:00:32.579> as<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> know<00:00:33.329> they're<00:00:33.510> metal<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
but as you know they're metal this one

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.729 
but as you know they're metal this one
is<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.960> composite<00:00:36.960> plastic

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
is not this one is a composite plastic

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.030 
is not this one is a composite plastic
and<00:00:38.450> if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> buy<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.930> size<00:00:40.040> composite

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and if you buy the right size composite

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.420 
and if you buy the right size composite
shaft<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.640> fits<00:00:41.850> perfectly<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.540> earth<00:00:43.430> however

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
shaft it fits perfectly on earth however

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
shaft it fits perfectly on earth however
it<00:00:44.730> does<00:00:44.879> come<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.539> couple<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.050> steel

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it does come with a couple of steel

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.690 
it does come with a couple of steel
screws<00:00:46.920> bolts<00:00:47.460> nuts<00:00:48.350> which<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.559> don't<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
screws bolts nuts which I don't like so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
screws bolts nuts which I don't like so
I<00:00:51.030> swapped<00:00:51.510> enough<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> stainless<00:00:52.530> ones

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I swapped enough for the stainless ones

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
I swapped enough for the stainless ones
and<00:00:55.219> basically<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.579> slide<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.570> thing<00:00:57.780> over

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and basically just slide the thing over

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.220 
and basically just slide the thing over
the<00:00:58.260> shaft<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.600> install<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> bolts<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the shaft and install the bolts and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
the shaft and install the bolts and
tighten<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> down<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> really<00:01:02.489> tight

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
tighten it down and it's a really tight

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.520 
tighten it down and it's a really tight
fit<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.359> not<00:01:03.570> move<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
fit it will not move you don't have to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.149 
fit it will not move you don't have to
add<00:01:04.769> any<00:01:04.949> tape<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.790> anything<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.740> help<00:01:07.740> take<00:01:07.979> up

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
add any tape or anything to help take up

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
add any tape or anything to help take up
the<00:01:08.310> slack<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:10.200> anyway<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:12.000> I'm<00:01:12.090> gonna<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the slack but anyway what I'm gonna be

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
the slack but anyway what I'm gonna be
doing<00:01:12.360> here<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.290> 10<00:01:13.530> inch

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
doing here is I have my 10 inch

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.190 
doing here is I have my 10 inch
Excalibur<00:01:14.490> coil<00:01:14.869> actually<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.080> whole

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
Excalibur coil actually it's a whole

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.130 
Excalibur coil actually it's a whole
machine<00:01:16.500> obviously<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> one

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
machine obviously but that's not the one

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.390 
machine obviously but that's not the one
that<00:01:19.290> I've<00:01:19.409> been<00:01:19.530> using<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.890> diving

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
that I've been using for diving

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.289 
that I've been using for diving
but<00:01:20.729> um<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.960> ahead<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.909> swapping<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.150> out

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
but um going ahead and swapping it out

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
but um going ahead and swapping it out
and<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> use<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.530> diving<00:01:26.040> try<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and going to use it for diving try it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.420 
and going to use it for diving try it
out<00:01:26.659> I<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> 10<00:01:28.860> inch<00:01:29.070> covers

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
out I want to see if the 10 inch covers

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.640 
out I want to see if the 10 inch covers
any<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.790> area<00:01:30.119> than<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> 8<00:01:30.509> inch<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:31.350> how<00:01:31.470> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
any more area than the 8 inch see how it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
any more area than the 8 inch see how it
does<00:01:31.829> I've<00:01:32.100> tried<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> before<00:01:32.549> with<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
does I've tried this before with the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.660 
does I've tried this before with the
short<00:01:33.570> shaft<00:01:33.920> didn't<00:01:34.920> work<00:01:35.100> very<00:01:35.130> well

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
short shaft didn't work very well

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.840 
short shaft didn't work very well
I<00:01:36.770> think<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> coral<00:01:38.130> should<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.400> kept<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
I think the coral should be kept a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
I think the coral should be kept a
little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> distance<00:01:39.720> from<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> pod<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
little bit of distance from the pod and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
little bit of distance from the pod and
so<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.490> gonna<00:01:41.640> have<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> determine<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.479> exact

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
so I'm gonna have to determine the exact

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.289 
so I'm gonna have to determine the exact
distance<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.860> coil<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
distance that I want the coil from the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.170 
distance that I want the coil from the
pod<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> move<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.430> animal

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
pod and they have to move this animal

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.600 
pod and they have to move this animal
back<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:48.810> forward<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
back or forward a little bit right now I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.780 
back or forward a little bit right now I
have<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:50.970> 26<00:01:51.659> inches<00:01:51.810> from<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.500> end<00:01:52.890> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
have it about 26 inches from the end of

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.359 
have it about 26 inches from the end of
the<00:01:54.030> ISO<00:01:54.600> rod<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.950> it's<00:01:56.100> called

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the ISO rod and that is what it's called

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
the ISO rod and that is what it's called
