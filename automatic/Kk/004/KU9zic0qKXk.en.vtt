too expensive to do long distance calls

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.170 
too expensive to do long distance calls
so<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.570> wrote<00:01:45.750> letters<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:47.520> still<00:01:48.030> have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
so we wrote letters and I still have

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.510 
so we wrote letters and I still have
full<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> letters<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.560> even<00:01:49.860> though<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.130> sister

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
full of letters so even though my sister

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
full of letters so even though my sister
and<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.670> were<00:01:50.820> very<00:01:50.939> far<00:01:51.240> apart<00:01:51.530> geographically

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and I were very far apart geographically

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.340 
and I were very far apart geographically
at<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.770> time<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:54.180> letters<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.899> brought

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
at that time the letters really brought

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.380 
at that time the letters really brought
us<00:01:55.380> closer<00:01:55.799> together<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.579> we<00:01:56.759> were<00:01:56.790> very<00:01:56.880> very

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
us closer together and we were very very

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.450 
us closer together and we were very very
very<00:01:57.600> close<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:58.200> time<00:01:58.409> remembering<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
very close at that time remembering that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.779 
very close at that time remembering that
I<00:01:59.729> think<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:00.659> rights

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
I think my rights

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.749 
I think my rights
I'm<00:02:02.789> actually<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> oldest<00:02:03.749> of<00:02:03.960> four<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.759> I

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
I'm actually the oldest of four and I

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
I'm actually the oldest of four and I
guess<00:02:06.090> growing<00:02:06.719> up<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.319> probably<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.859> little

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
guess growing up I was probably a little

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.249 
guess growing up I was probably a little
bit<00:02:08.369> meaner<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> Bossier<00:02:09.720> than<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:10.019> should

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
bit meaner and Bossier than I should

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
bit meaner and Bossier than I should
have<00:02:10.289> been<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.799> lot<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> older<00:02:11.340> siblings

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
have been like a lot of older siblings

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.759 
have been like a lot of older siblings
even<00:02:12.269> when<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.660> five<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.230> my<00:02:13.290> little

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
even when I was five and my little

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.860 
even when I was five and my little
sister<00:02:14.099> was<00:02:14.280> about<00:02:14.489> two<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.879> half<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.420> would

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
sister was about two and a half I would

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.539 
sister was about two and a half I would
make<00:02:16.019> her<00:02:16.200> color<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.620> my<00:02:16.739> coloring<00:02:17.099> books<00:02:17.310> for

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
make her color in my coloring books for

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.550 
make her color in my coloring books for
me<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.299> told<00:02:18.540> her<00:02:18.629> if<00:02:18.750> she<00:02:18.900> ever<00:02:19.019> colored

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
me and I told her if she ever colored

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.440 
me and I told her if she ever colored
out<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.830> lines<00:02:20.040> she'd<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.489> dead<00:02:20.760> meat<00:02:20.790> so

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
out of the lines she'd be dead meat so

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.030 
out of the lines she'd be dead meat so
she<00:02:21.599> would<00:02:21.959> slave<00:02:22.170> away<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.530> hours<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.890> my

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
she would slave away for hours on my

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820 
she would slave away for hours on my
coloring<00:02:23.459> books<00:02:24.200> but<00:02:25.200> now<00:02:25.530> we're<00:02:25.739> really

on top of each other had shared windows

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.190 
on top of each other had shared windows
and<00:02:54.269> he<00:02:55.230> built<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.970> switch<00:02:57.810> thing

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
and he built this little switch thing

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.619 
and he built this little switch thing
and<00:02:58.470> light<00:02:58.739> bulb<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.790> would<00:02:59.940> go<00:03:00.060> between<00:03:00.420> his

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
and light bulb that would go between his

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.240 
and light bulb that would go between his
room<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.900> my<00:03:01.079> room<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.470> when<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.620> flipped<00:03:02.010> my

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
room in my room so when I flipped my

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.949 
room in my room so when I flipped my
switch<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.970> turned<00:03:03.180> on<00:03:03.269> his<00:03:03.420> light<00:03:03.599> bulb<00:03:03.840> when

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
switch it turned on his light bulb when

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.180 
switch it turned on his light bulb when
he<00:03:04.079> flipped<00:03:04.260> his<00:03:04.379> switch<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.859> would<00:03:04.980> turn<00:03:05.129> on

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
he flipped his switch it would turn on

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.220 
he flipped his switch it would turn on
mine<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.579> any<00:03:06.180> time<00:03:06.450> those<00:03:06.630> switches<00:03:06.930> got

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
mine and any time those switches got

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.589 
mine and any time those switches got
flipped<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.829> met<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.280> laundry<00:03:08.639> and<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
flipped we met in the laundry and then I

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.360 
flipped we met in the laundry and then I
would<00:03:09.750> go<00:03:09.780> down<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.380> laundry<00:03:10.590> chute<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.160> then

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
would go down the laundry chute and then

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.819 
would go down the laundry chute and then
he<00:03:11.549> would<00:03:11.670> take<00:03:11.849> me<00:03:12.109> back<00:03:13.109> to<00:03:13.260> his<00:03:13.380> room<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.680> we

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
he would take me back to his room and we

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.620 
he would take me back to his room and we
would<00:03:13.980> plot<00:03:14.250> against<00:03:14.579> our<00:03:14.670> parents<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.389> I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
would plot against our parents and I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.690 
would plot against our parents and I
think<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.079> that's<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.310> good<00:03:17.459> picture

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
think that that's a really good picture

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.210 
think that that's a really good picture
of<00:03:17.849> kind<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.720> who<00:03:18.870> we<00:03:19.019> are<00:03:19.049> like<00:03:19.530> yeah<00:03:19.739> we<00:03:20.040> fight

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
of kind of who we are like yeah we fight

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.550 
of kind of who we are like yeah we fight
