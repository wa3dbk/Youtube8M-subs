then did bantu knots I just want to try

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.710 
then did bantu knots I just want to try
the<00:02:08.420> product<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:09.050> honestly<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.950> see<00:02:10.340> how<00:02:11.300> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the product out honestly to see how it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:33.800 
the product out honestly to see how it
was<00:02:11.870> going<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.980> come<00:02:13.910> out<00:02:14.230> so

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.300 

and<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.550> far<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.810> definition

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and so this is so far the definition

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.040 
and so this is so far the definition
of<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.849> one

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.290 

I<00:02:43.140> think<00:02:43.710> this<00:02:43.860> one<00:02:44.070> kind<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.370> came<00:02:44.580> out<00:02:44.610> so

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
I think this one kind of came out so

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.260 
I think this one kind of came out so
that's<00:02:45.570> why<00:02:45.750> it's<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:46.260> as<00:02:46.700> defined<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
that's why it's not as defined as the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.170 
that's why it's not as defined as the
others

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630 

and<00:02:53.689> my<00:02:53.900> hair<00:02:54.140> feels<00:02:54.409> very<00:02:54.620> moisturized<00:02:55.280> right

and my hair feels very moisturized right
now<00:02:55.819> very<00:02:56.090> soft<00:02:56.859> so<00:02:57.859> it<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.370> so<00:02:58.909> far<00:02:59.209> it's<00:02:59.629> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
now very soft so it is so far it's the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.020 
now very soft so it is so far it's the
