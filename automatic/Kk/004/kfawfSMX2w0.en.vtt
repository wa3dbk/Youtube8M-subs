00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
seven eight nine is old 1 billion so you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.809 
seven eight nine is old 1 billion so you
see<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.239> avocado<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:10.619> represent<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.340> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
see that avocado can represent two can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.550 
see that avocado can represent two can
be<00:02:11.970> used<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.420> represent<00:02:12.599> number

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that are large so that means it needs to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.690 
that are large so that means it needs to
evolve<00:02:17.840> addition<00:02:19.489> subtraction<00:02:20.489> or

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
evolve addition subtraction or

examples in kg or Nasri school we

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.050 
examples in kg or Nasri school we
normally<00:02:34.170> start<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.739> addition<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.340> one

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
normally start with addition of one

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.140 
normally start with addition of one
digit<00:02:36.540> numbers<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:38.760> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.030> be

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
difficulty in addition or subtraction or

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.759 
difficulty in addition or subtraction or

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.009 
number one we have 23 plus 45 now just
Vidia<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:59.040> we've<00:02:59.459> learned<00:02:59.730> enough<00:03:00.209> basic

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
Vidia as we've learned enough basic

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.020 
Vidia as we've learned enough basic
arithmetic<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:03.060> digit<00:03:04.130> arranged<00:03:05.130> from<00:03:05.819> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
arithmetic the digit arranged from the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.280 
arithmetic the digit arranged from the
right<00:03:06.299> hand<00:03:06.630> side<00:03:08.000> is<00:03:09.000> usually<00:03:09.810> in<00:03:10.260> units<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:10.799> 1

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
right hand side is usually in units of 1

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.330 
right hand side is usually in units of 1
and<00:03:13.640> efficient<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> left<00:03:15.930> hand<00:03:16.080> side

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
and efficient to the left hand side

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.229 
and efficient to the left hand side
obtained<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.600> taste<00:03:19.049> unit<00:03:20.239> while

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
obtained so this is taste unit while

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
what you have it that is simply not so

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.129 
what you have it that is simply not so

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139 
inform to learn we have a cost now we'll

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:41.090 
inform to learn we have a cost now we'll
go<00:06:40.229> to<00:06:40.260> the<00:06:40.409> power

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
go to the power

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.730 
go to the power

be visit be a bit faster now that water
the<00:06:47.750> basics<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:48.900> the<00:06:49.020> foundation<00:06:49.590> now<00:06:50.370> we're

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
the basics of the foundation now we're

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.550 
the basics of the foundation now we're
going<00:06:50.790> to<00:06:50.850> break<00:06:51.090> down<00:06:51.150> through<00:06:51.630> bring<00:06:52.380> down

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
going to break down through bring down

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.810 
going to break down through bring down
sitting<00:06:53.810> bring<00:06:54.810> down<00:06:54.960> to<00:06:55.350> bring<00:06:55.980> down<00:06:56.130> full<00:06:56.580> at

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
sitting bring down to bring down full at

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:02.300 
sitting bring down to bring down full at
its<00:06:57.000> 42<00:06:57.390> and<00:06:58.380> bring<00:06:58.710> down<00:06:58.860> stable<00:07:00.950> then<00:07:01.950> bring

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
its 42 and bring down stable then bring

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.550 
its 42 and bring down stable then bring
down<00:07:02.340> one<00:07:03.620> look<00:07:04.620> at<00:07:04.770> it<00:07:04.980> that<00:07:05.250> leaves<00:07:05.550> you<00:07:06.020> 59<00:07:07.020> 5

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
down one look at it that leaves you 59 5

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.860 
down one look at it that leaves you 59 5
bit<00:07:07.890> and<00:07:08.210> so<00:07:09.210> that<00:07:09.390> is<00:07:09.540> the<00:07:09.570> 59<00:07:10.250> that<00:07:11.250> we<00:07:11.520> have

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:11.870 
bit and so that is the 59 that we have

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.340 
bit and so that is the 59 that we have
there<00:07:12.870> add<00:07:13.680> various<00:07:14.490> people<00:07:15.090> so<00:07:15.840> to<00:07:15.900> build

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
there add various people so to build

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.160 
there add various people so to build
your<00:07:16.560> confidence<00:07:16.910> you<00:07:17.910> can<00:07:17.940> form<00:07:18.810> all<00:07:19.050> the

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
your confidence you can form all the

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.820 
your confidence you can form all the
numbers<00:07:19.830> to<00:07:20.760> these<00:07:20.970> numbers<00:07:21.360> that<00:07:22.170> let<00:07:22.500> them

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
numbers to these numbers that let them

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.930 
numbers to these numbers that let them
hang<00:07:23.490> into<00:07:24.270> the<00:07:24.630> addition<00:07:25.170> see<00:07:26.040> that<00:07:26.250> a<00:07:26.430> becaus

hang into the addition see that a becaus

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.400 
hang into the addition see that a becaus
mix<00:07:27.390> learning<00:07:28.380> of<00:07:28.500> arithmetic<00:07:28.740> easier<00:07:29.400> and

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.410 
mix learning of arithmetic easier and

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.180 
mix learning of arithmetic easier and
for<00:07:31.820> go<00:07:32.820> to<00:07:32.880> the<00:07:33.120> next<00:07:33.390> just<00:07:34.260> to<00:07:34.350> do<00:07:34.590> with<00:07:34.770> the
