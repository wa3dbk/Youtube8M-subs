easy way for me to explain the
transition<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.690> next<00:02:08.929> chord<00:02:09.170> would<00:02:09.289> be

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
transition and the next chord would be

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.080 
transition and the next chord would be
if<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.129> have<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> look<00:02:10.429> at<00:02:10.580> what<00:02:10.789> we<00:02:10.910> got<00:02:11.030> here

if you have a look at what we got here

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.059 
if you have a look at what we got here
right<00:02:11.299> your<00:02:12.110> foe<00:02:12.290> fingers<00:02:12.680> in<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> eighth

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
right your foe fingers in the eighth

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.400 
right your foe fingers in the eighth
fret<00:02:13.370> if<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.299> kept<00:02:14.629> it<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.900> same<00:02:15.140> string

call<00:02:29.690> extreme<00:02:30.140> numbers<00:02:30.560> what<00:02:31.099> you'd<00:02:31.250> be

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
call extreme numbers what you'd be

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.630 
call extreme numbers what you'd be
playing<00:02:31.549> in<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.269> 4th<00:02:32.510> fret<00:02:32.720> would<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:32.989> six<00:02:33.640> for

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
playing in the 4th fret would be six for

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.960 
playing in the 4th fret would be six for
free<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.590> now<00:02:36.739> move<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.579> second

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
free and now move that to the second

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.880 
free and now move that to the second
fret<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.569> hold<00:02:38.810> in<00:02:38.989> second<00:02:39.290> fret<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.590> numbers

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.520 
fret so hold in second fret the numbers
would<00:02:39.980> be<00:02:40.010> six<00:02:40.340> for<00:02:40.519> free<00:02:40.730> again

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
would be six for free again

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.130 
would be six for free again

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.729 
string first fret and your second think
will<00:02:49.489> be<00:02:49.609> 15<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.299> second<00:02:50.599> fret<00:02:50.780> that's

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
will be 15 in the second fret that's

will be 15 in the second fret that's
going<00:02:51.889> to<00:02:51.950> be

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.670 

those<00:02:55.570> are<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> chords<00:02:56.290> those<00:02:56.500> are<00:02:56.620> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
those are the chords those are the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.260 
those are the chords those are the
transitions<00:02:59.100> so<00:03:00.100> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.310> first<00:03:00.490> part<00:03:00.670> he

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
transitions so for the first part he

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.150 
transitions so for the first part he
goes<00:03:01.770> B<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:03.130> G<00:03:03.160> shall<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.580> turn<00:03:03.640> back<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.150> D<00:03:05.160> do

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
goes B to G shall I turn back to D do

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.600 
goes B to G shall I turn back to D do
you<00:03:06.250> shot<00:03:06.460> my<00:03:06.610> leg<00:03:06.760> in<00:03:06.940> F<00:03:07.360> sharp<00:03:07.630> minor

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.650 

so<00:03:12.610> I'll<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:14.500> into<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.800> little<00:03:15.660> cracking

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
so I'll go into this little cracking

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.480 
so I'll go into this little cracking
pattern<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.110> I'm<00:03:17.170> doing<00:03:17.380> here<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.830> you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
pattern now I'm doing here this is you

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.070 
pattern now I'm doing here this is you
know<00:03:18.580> roughly<00:03:18.880> what<00:03:19.090> he's<00:03:19.420> doing<00:03:19.840> on<00:03:19.990> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
know roughly what he's doing on the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.650 
know roughly what he's doing on the
track<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.670> just<00:03:21.670> listened<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.300> song<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
track I just listened to the song and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.380 
track I just listened to the song and
kind<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:22.959> worked<00:03:23.140> out<00:03:23.320> what<00:03:23.530> sounded<00:03:24.390> sounded

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
kind of worked out what sounded sounded

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.180 
kind of worked out what sounded sounded
good<00:03:25.540> it's<00:03:26.260> probably<00:03:26.500> not<00:03:26.590> exactly<00:03:26.830> what<00:03:27.100> he's

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
good it's probably not exactly what he's

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.310 
good it's probably not exactly what he's
playing<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.740> it<00:03:29.740> kind<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.100> matches<00:03:31.230> what<00:03:32.230> I'm

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
playing but it kind of matches what I'm

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.170 
playing but it kind of matches what I'm
going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.500> do<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.680> crush<00:03:32.890> some<00:03:33.370> numbers<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.000> for

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
going to do is crush some numbers so for

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.780 
going to do is crush some numbers so for
each<00:03:34.300> chord<00:03:34.630> so<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.190> be<00:03:36.340> especially<00:03:36.580> it

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
picking patterns and first thing I'll

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.020 
picking patterns and first thing I'll
say<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.900> you<00:04:05.140> know<00:04:05.230> don't<00:04:06.160> stress<00:04:06.580> about<00:04:06.610> don't

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
worry about it too much the most

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.190 
worry about it too much the most
important<00:04:10.450> thing<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.630> beginning<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.080> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
important thing the beginning is the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720 
important thing the beginning is the
chords<00:04:11.620> obviously<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.160> then<00:04:12.640> the

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
chords obviously and then the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.310 
chords obviously and then the
transitions<00:04:13.330> between<00:04:13.450> those<00:04:13.810> chords<00:04:14.170> once

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
transitions between those chords once

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.229 
transitions between those chords once
you've<00:04:14.470> got<00:04:14.590> that<00:04:14.709> down<00:04:14.890> then<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.760> work<00:04:16.030> on

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
you've got that down then you work on

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.630 
you've got that down then you work on
you<00:04:16.810> know<00:04:16.979> strumming<00:04:17.979> pattern<00:04:18.250> or<00:04:18.370> picking

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
bicone starlings and then from there I

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.880 
bicone starlings and then from there I
got<00:04:36.250> more<00:04:36.370> comfortable<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.910> was<00:04:37.090> like<00:04:37.270> um
