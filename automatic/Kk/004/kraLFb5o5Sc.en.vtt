00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.000
 I'm not gonna fuck you there 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.070
 this is two joints in Italian 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.870
 I am not out of the package with the strategy 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:13.359
 I have bought 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.699
 sow to write 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.150
 that said round writing 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.839
 are the five ing 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.230
 there is the seed 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.449
 also in 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.630
 You can see 7 zoom in dam 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.939
 that the very neat at a distance of just over an inch 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.100
 santi for signal 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 has been put in by the manufacturer 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.600
 and they don't write out march missions 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.570
 exactly possible in such a pot 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.650
 so there I am going to be that peeters cd v in peking 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.770
 I need my side writing 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.800
 we also have their 2 3 4 5 against plants, I feel no pressure 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.540
 game with his own country 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.280
 surface but the nicest box 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.120
 So the traffic is far from it that writes them to anxiety 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 and how much co2 but 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 both super easy 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 that write the route running away 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.500
 just call it again 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.650
 and what kind of trick for me it is a fairy tale there 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.970
 a bit of coarse sand 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 Two say that sometimes it takes a long time to choose 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.330
 and then you get those green algae 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.550
 the upper reaches 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 Coarse sand prevents you from hurting you 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.130
 shot on pull out because water cannons took an hour before it 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 water and oboe vs 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.480
 the blood pressure then 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.420
 And then you can make things very important 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 Peter the child 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.909
 if it is hot so not in the cupboard not on the windowsill 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 hope for a cool place 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.310
 for example in the garden bacchus that team 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.120
 12 degrees 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.980
 mother reading sweetly 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.620
 in the shade not in the sun 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.160
 and that can be a fire for a few weeks before the parsley 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.139
 above the ground 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.889
 patience 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.529
 this is a 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.979
 typical example of a cell failure 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:19.279
 it's with the CD 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:20.779
 he was put away 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:25.260
 in the jar because it is so long for the child to cover it with the saucer 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.019
 to forget 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.349
 stupid yes 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.349
 So Syria didn't grow for a very long time 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.519
 we're going to try anyway 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 to make it something out of it 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.189
 dice beginner's mistake get lost a lot 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.009
 he grinned, trying to catch 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
 because people are from the neighborhood 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.819
 you just want work 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.929
 what they do do it carefully 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:03.929
 I just get a nice be 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.819
 newspaper I think 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.879
 problem solved 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.719
 I will find you there 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.909
 let enough water run on them 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.629
 and then you have to come in for a while 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.569
 grow in the greenhouse or on the windowsill until a big boy belongs 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.969
 they have become big fairs with real Italians 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.199
 that is all apparent from hungary 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.049
 think of
