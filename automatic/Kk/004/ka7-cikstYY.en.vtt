the<00:01:52.390> same<00:01:52.420> throttle<00:01:53.110> body<00:01:53.289> as<00:01:53.530> earlier

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
the same throttle body as earlier

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.300 
the same throttle body as earlier
Shelby's<00:01:54.489> but<00:01:55.209> if<00:01:55.329> things<00:01:55.539> really<00:01:55.659> don't<00:01:56.310> have

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
Shelby's but if things really don't have

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.889 
Shelby's but if things really don't have
the<00:01:57.459> flow<00:01:57.640> capacity<00:01:57.849> this<00:01:58.329> blower<00:01:58.569> really

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
the flow capacity this blower really

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.240 
the flow capacity this blower really
wants<00:01:59.259> so<00:01:59.409> what<00:01:59.530> we're<00:01:59.649> gonna<00:01:59.739> do<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.130> our

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
wants so what we're gonna do is our

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.899 
wants so what we're gonna do is our
serious<00:02:00.640> street<00:02:00.970> drama<00:02:01.450> body<00:02:02.729> when<00:02:03.729> that's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
serious street drama body when that's

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.429 
serious street drama body when that's
done<00:02:04.149> we'll<00:02:04.599> show<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.810> some<00:02:04.899> pictures<00:02:05.140> of

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
done we'll show you some pictures of

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.109 
done we'll show you some pictures of
that<00:02:05.560> when<00:02:05.799> we're<00:02:05.950> into<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.759> lacks<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
that when we're into it that lacks a

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.309 
that when we're into it that lacks a
full<00:02:07.440> 1443<00:02:08.459> CFM<00:02:09.780> compared<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:10.959> like<00:02:11.140> aa

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
full 1443 CFM compared to be like aa

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.349 
full 1443 CFM compared to be like aa
little<00:02:11.950> monoplane<00:02:12.519> with<00:02:12.639> 1403<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:15.329> it'll<00:02:16.329> work

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
little monoplane with 1403 so it'll work

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:20.879 
little monoplane with 1403 so it'll work
very<00:02:16.720> good<00:02:19.079> we're<00:02:20.079> gonna<00:02:20.200> do<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.319> small<00:02:20.590> coil

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:20.889 
very good we're gonna do a small coil

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
Turnpike I mean the suspension is

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.149 
Turnpike I mean the suspension is
unbelievable<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.819> can<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.209> grab<00:03:21.359> that<00:03:21.659> road

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
unbelievable you can just grab that road

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.399 
unbelievable you can just grab that road
it's<00:03:23.159> just<00:03:23.689> unbelievable<00:03:24.689> much<00:03:24.900> better<00:03:25.169> than

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
it's just unbelievable much better than

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.270 
it's just unbelievable much better than
those<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.949> the<00:03:26.010> building<00:03:27.919> another<00:03:28.919> thing<00:03:29.159> I

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
those in the building another thing I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.670 
those in the building another thing I
noticed<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:30.209> know<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.599> does<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.229> red

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
noticed you know it does have the red

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.869 
noticed you know it does have the red
coolant<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.359> system<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.560> I<00:03:37.729> guess<00:03:38.729> the

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
coolant in this system and I guess the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.849 
coolant in this system and I guess the
part<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.419> most<00:03:39.569> about<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.139> car<00:03:40.379> is

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
part I like the most about the car is

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.110 
part I like the most about the car is
the<00:03:41.069> front-end<00:03:41.519> itself

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.089 

get<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> shot<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:44.989> but<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.680> actually<00:03:45.800> has

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
get a shot of this but it actually has

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.210 
get a shot of this but it actually has
no<00:03:46.280> drill<00:03:46.580> in<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.849> it's<00:03:47.569> wide<00:03:47.840> open<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.650> would

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
no drill in it it's wide open I I would

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.000 
no drill in it it's wide open I I would
probably<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:50.239> felt<00:03:50.870> when<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.200> screen<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.769> there

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
probably I felt when it screen in there

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.270 
probably I felt when it screen in there
but<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.519> think<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.330> pretty<00:03:53.800> cold<00:03:54.800> air<00:03:54.950> intake

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
but I think it's pretty cold air intake

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.979 
but I think it's pretty cold air intake
does<00:03:55.489> have<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> way<00:03:55.940> of<00:03:55.970> air<00:03:56.239> scoop<00:03:56.599> on<00:03:56.810> this

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
does have a way of air scoop on this

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:05.289 
does have a way of air scoop on this
side<00:04:02.200> about<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:03.730> but<00:04:04.730> anyway<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:05.000> just<00:04:05.060> wanna

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
side about it but anyway I just wanna
