00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.690
 so why this 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.339
 this Sunday afternoon rainy 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.999
 we will make flour 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.629
 200 grams of durum wheat flour is not enough for holes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.909
 he took this year 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.480
 the program 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.029
 after race 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 a little bit of salt 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 do not know if it's like that Sunday 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.769

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.249

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.200
 coming out of the 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.100
 in parallel with this period in the about 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.340
 we could make the trunk a trip that happened today 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.870
 from there to know how to read and write in English the video can do everything 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.250
 and all 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.160
 it will stay positive it turns on I would say two tablespoons for dark 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.490
 from Paris 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.050
 we will appreciate 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.430
 toulouse 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 put it on pause on a group 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.190
 edison position 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.240
 since that average 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.970
 the department of var 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.630
 because if we start fast 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
 these are the departments apa 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.890
 she expects to see him arrive 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 the tendency to get worse 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.250
 later m 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.250
 lemonde 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.719
 why prove themselves in other classes 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:30.750
 reportage 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.080
 for paul nahon remind a little 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 share 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.940
 a life element 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.620
 I finished in the red 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.340
 again like this 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.370
 she was there - sandblasted 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370
 but we will be able to form a ball with you 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.060
 in fact the request 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.740
 a euro finished in the bottom the ball 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
 for the form at the right time we are in good faith 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.290
 pleasant 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.780
 we're going to take him down now we're going to do with an enlarged version are not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.270
 the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.830
 on a pass 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.790
 I used in France or below base 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.830
 but she's still pretty thick to have the medal is very very 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.830
 strong 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.649
 finally the existing servers 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.679
 salary of 170 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:29.379
 yet we do not speak very well 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.860
 so there we will have the temporary decline more and more lenient 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:36.079
 rabary of the value decline interesting regular convoy 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.699
 keep 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 in burst no 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.559
 and after that on that basis 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.439
 jean-paul alduy is better 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.659
 so now we can do a lot of things with this money we can by 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:57.250
 example 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.710
 discover the decline seems to make small boxes ravioli ravioli 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.269
 and then we can also rest in the bathtub attali call 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.419
 paid in the reactors 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.419
 a house 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.789
 match the mark 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.799
 who proposes to make individual 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 other words world 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.549
 we find everything on the market this question 

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:25.889
 invest en 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.889
 mother 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:33.109
 and since we can think it's because I was not told what we can 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.559
 flavor them we can customize them 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:39.489
 we do not have to stay on the goal of 25% for places 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.789
 given the number of midwives 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.589
 10:30 am the convoy 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:45.609
 first 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:46.769
 you were born 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.989
 there are plenty of possibilities 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.579
 I will work according to the seasons 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.709
 and customize them
