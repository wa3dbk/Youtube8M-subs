00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.040
 We collect the laptop's motherboard I 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:16.109
 I put in the case now I will wear 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.410
 cover the top here it should be 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.590
 and 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:24.340
 buttons but since we 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.769
 the south bridge was very hot 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.849
 the previous one can see that here in this place 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.329
 Already melted body that is in this 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.739
 laptop models are poorly designed 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.070
 ventilation of the south bridge which we 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.220
 soldered 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.220
 today in order to improve 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:53.120
 heat sink from south bridge 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:59.289
 i made such an improvement here in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:05.259
 this place soldered the copper plate to 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:07.990
 metal case 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.470
 superbly plate and when this cover 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.600
 will close the laptop something copper 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.149
 the plate will be cast under that ordered 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.539
 copper plate here it will touch 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.159
 south on 100 and heat will come out in 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.890
 metal in this keyboard and will and 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.540
 heat sink will be much better but for 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.570
 this we need a heat-conducting rubber 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.810
 so I specifically ordered here she tires 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.759
 I will cut out such heat from the heat sink 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.369
 I'll put a piece here 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.659
 and through this rubber I will be warm 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.979
 go to the laptop case 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:51.439
 because if you don't do that 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:55.909
 the south bridge will again overheat will melt 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.490
 the corpus is further and to such 5 fall then 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:06.859
 there is definitely necessary in this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:09.200
 acer aspire 5101 models need like this 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.540
 here is to improve the heat sink of the south 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.730
 I will assemble the bridge now 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.430
 not turned to look at us or something 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 or not about the soldering of the south bridge 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.549
 here did not apply 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.340
 Thermo conduct rubber south bridge 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:32.450
 I will now continue to assemble a laptop 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 will try to include 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:41.690
 this moment of truth almost gathered left 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.379
 put to the plant protective 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.379
 so we put it 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:24.239
 sort of snapped all to 2 gathered mod 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.099
 connect power and try to turn on 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.099
 so food upbringing upbringing 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:44.640
 Here is something lit up, that is, charging 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.640
 it went already well yes we open 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.880
 tried to include 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.170
 fan earned 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.900
 What was the purpose of our repair? 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.410
 replace south bridge 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.340
 south bridge for what noted between muaza 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.770
 in charge of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.290
 Yusb ports that is, we did not work not 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.470
 or ports not keyboard not touch 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.470
 panel 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.880
 Ie now 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.120
 after that the center should work on 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.560
 panel if will not work now 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:58.300
 then nothing helped that sensory 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.139
 panel work again try to load 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.139
 further system 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.229
 the computer came alive look 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:23.030
 whether all drivers he pulls that is all 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.030
 whether the device will leave alive after
