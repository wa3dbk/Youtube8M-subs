different<00:00:13.799> types<00:00:13.980> of<00:00:14.160> fuses<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.670> there<00:00:14.910> for

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
different types of fuses out there for

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.910 
different types of fuses out there for
instance<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:15.750> car<00:00:16.049> fuse<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
instance I have this car fuse here and

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.849 
instance I have this car fuse here and
the<00:00:17.460> way<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.699> know<00:00:17.910> if<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.180> bad<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.810> if<00:00:19.230> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
the way you know if it's bad is if that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.310 
the way you know if it's bad is if that
little<00:00:20.130> wire<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.330> there<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.720> burned<00:00:21.990> through

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
little wire in there is burned through

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170 
little wire in there is burned through
typically<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> top<00:00:23.369> you'll<00:00:23.670> see<00:00:23.760> little

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
typically on the top you'll see little

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
typically on the top you'll see little
black<00:00:24.300> spot<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.560> wires<00:00:25.830> no<00:00:26.070> longer

it still has another copper jacket
underneath<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.150> don't<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> if<00:01:18.390> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
underneath it and you don't know if this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
underneath it and you don't know if this
uses<00:01:18.930> bad<00:01:19.170> unless<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> meter<00:01:20.299> um<00:01:21.299> you

uses bad unless you have a meter um you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
uses bad unless you have a meter um you
will<00:01:21.630> need<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> meter<00:01:22.110> such<00:01:22.530> as<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.130> here

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

is this little line that has a triangle
in<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.960> another<00:01:43.229> line<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:45.140> like

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
in it with another line so just like

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.429 
in it with another line so just like

the<00:01:57.210> sitting<00:01:57.600> right<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> Sun<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the sitting right here with the Sun and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.760 
the sitting right here with the Sun and
the<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.640> lines<00:01:59.909> means<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.659> has<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.960> audio<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the two lines means it has an audio so

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.280 
the two lines means it has an audio so
whenever<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:03.119> there<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.810> continuity

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
whenever that there is continuity

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.380 
whenever that there is continuity
through<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.009> you're<00:02:05.219> checking<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
through what you're checking or the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.559 
through what you're checking or the
circuit<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.810> closed<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.439> would<00:02:07.560> make<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.920> beep

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
circuit is closed they would make a beep

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:18.530 
circuit is closed they would make a beep
such<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.750> this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.789 

okay<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:19.930> you<00:02:20.049> can<00:02:20.140> tell<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.530> has<00:02:20.680> that

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
okay and as you can tell it has that

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.699 
okay and as you can tell it has that
same<00:02:21.069> symbol<00:02:21.870> right<00:02:22.870> there<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.260> line<00:02:23.500> with

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
same symbol right there the line with

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.619 
same symbol right there the line with
the<00:02:23.769> triangle<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.640> another<00:02:25.420> line

of the leads under your fuse if it beeps

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.550 
of the leads under your fuse if it beeps
it's<00:02:42.400> okay<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.629> can<00:02:43.750> tell<00:02:43.780> the<00:02:44.200> meter<00:02:44.409> is

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
it's okay you can tell the meter is

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.830 
it's okay you can tell the meter is
reading<00:02:44.760> zero<00:02:45.760> zero<00:02:46.090> zero<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.599> means

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
reading zero zero zero that means

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.259 
reading zero zero zero that means
there's<00:02:46.989> no<00:02:47.170> resistance<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:48.099> this<00:02:48.819> fuse<00:02:49.090> is

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
there's no resistance and this fuse is

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.640 
there's no resistance and this fuse is
good<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:55.299> other<00:02:55.480> meter<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.169> we<00:02:56.319> can<00:02:56.470> show

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
good the other meter that we can show

doesn't have an audio Bowl

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.059 
doesn't have an audio Bowl
it<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.669> has<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:01.019> 1:1<00:03:02.019> meaning<00:03:02.409> it's<00:03:02.530> infinite

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
it just has a 1:1 meaning it's infinite

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.149 
it just has a 1:1 meaning it's infinite
and<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.060> close<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.989> two<00:03:05.290> or<00:03:05.709> when<00:03:05.919> you<00:03:05.980> touch

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
and you close the two or when you touch

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.149 
and you close the two or when you touch
the<00:03:06.280> two<00:03:06.430> leads<00:03:06.639> together<00:03:07.379> you<00:03:08.379> get<00:03:08.650> 0<00:03:09.480> 0<00:03:10.480> 1<00:03:11.290> or

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
the two leads together you get 0 0 1 or

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.970 
the two leads together you get 0 0 1 or
0<00:03:12.579> 0<00:03:12.639> 0<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:14.200> means<00:03:14.230> there's<00:03:14.469> no<00:03:14.620> resistance

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
0 0 0 that means there's no resistance

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.789 
0 0 0 that means there's no resistance
in<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.489> waters<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.060> these<00:03:16.870> wires<00:03:17.200> here<00:03:17.500> these

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
in the waters and these wires here these

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.640 
in the waters and these wires here these
cables<00:03:18.189> are<00:03:18.280> probably<00:03:18.579> pretty<00:03:18.760> good<00:03:19.650> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
cables are probably pretty good and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.479 
cables are probably pretty good and
they're<00:03:21.010> ready<00:03:21.219> to<00:03:21.310> be<00:03:21.430> tested<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:24.040> if<00:03:24.129> we<00:03:24.220> grab

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
they're ready to be tested so if we grab

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.309 
they're ready to be tested so if we grab
our<00:03:24.669> fuse<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.449> can<00:03:25.569> go<00:03:25.659> ahead<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:25.930> do<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.109> same

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
our fuse we can go ahead and do the same

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.520 
our fuse we can go ahead and do the same
test<00:03:27.060> we'll<00:03:28.060> try<00:03:28.269> doing<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.599> in<00:03:28.840> shot<00:03:29.169> here

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
test we'll try doing this in shot here

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.080 
test we'll try doing this in shot here
so<00:03:29.919> everybody<00:03:30.159> can<00:03:30.280> see<00:03:30.609> what's<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:30.849> on<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
so everybody can see what's going on and

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.990 
so everybody can see what's going on and
there<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.629> go<00:03:34.810> zero<00:03:35.650> zero<00:03:36.040> zero<00:03:36.129> again<00:03:36.909> I'm

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
there you go zero zero zero again I'm

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.369 
there you go zero zero zero again I'm
just<00:03:37.120> touching<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.650> fuse<00:03:39.280> here<00:03:40.109> one<00:03:41.109> on<00:03:41.229> each

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
just touching the fuse here one on each

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.599

end pressing it on there firmly as you

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.099 
end pressing it on there firmly as you
can<00:03:45.729> tell<00:03:45.849> the<00:03:45.970> meter<00:03:46.209> is<00:03:46.359> fluctuating<00:03:46.840> back

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
can tell the meter is fluctuating back

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.999 
can tell the meter is fluctuating back
and<00:03:47.319> forth<00:03:48.120> tells<00:03:49.120> you<00:03:49.299> zero<00:03:49.509> zero<00:03:49.840> zero<00:03:50.009> and

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:51.009 
and forth tells you zero zero zero and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.629 
and forth tells you zero zero zero and
everything<00:03:51.250> is<00:03:51.579> OK<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.750> fuse<00:03:53.049> is<00:03:53.259> good<00:03:53.639> in

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
everything is OK this fuse is good in

you how the breakers should work and
stuff<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:19.060> have<00:04:19.239> different<00:04:19.690> ones<00:04:19.840> now<00:04:20.109> you

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
stuff you have different ones now you

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.350 
stuff you have different ones now you
have<00:04:20.409> a<00:04:20.440> two<00:04:20.949> pole<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.789> single<00:04:22.150> pole

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
have a two pole and a single pole

have a two pole and a single pole
breaker<00:04:23.580> if<00:04:24.580> these<00:04:25.120> would<00:04:25.360> be<00:04:25.479> tripped

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
breaker if these would be tripped

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.050 
breaker if these would be tripped
sometimes<00:04:26.529> you<00:04:26.770> really<00:04:27.340> can't<00:04:27.460> tell<00:04:27.940> if

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
sometimes you really can't tell if

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.810 
sometimes you really can't tell if
they're<00:04:28.210> trip

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
they're trip

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.310 
they're trip
this<00:04:29.420> one<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.660> instance<00:04:29.690> could<00:04:30.050> be<00:04:30.110> trip

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
this one for instance could be trip

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.580 
this one for instance could be trip
right<00:04:30.530> now<00:04:31.480> but<00:04:32.480> we<00:04:32.600> don't<00:04:32.720> know<00:04:33.020> because<00:04:33.410> you

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
right now but we don't know because you

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.190 
right now but we don't know because you
can't<00:04:33.890> push<00:04:34.160> them<00:04:34.280> over<00:04:34.610> anymore<00:04:34.910> they<00:04:35.840> trip

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
can't push them over anymore they trip

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.930 
can't push them over anymore they trip
sometimes<00:04:36.740> without<00:04:37.160> showing<00:04:37.670> that<00:04:37.760> their

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
sometimes without showing that their

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.000 
sometimes without showing that their
trip<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.600> best<00:04:38.750> way<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> reset<00:04:39.410> them<00:04:39.560> if

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
trip so the best way to reset them if

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.950 
trip so the best way to reset them if
you're<00:04:40.130> not<00:04:40.190> sure<00:04:40.550> is<00:04:40.670> to<00:04:40.880> turn<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.780> model

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
you're not sure is to turn the model

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.150 
you're not sure is to turn the model
completely<00:04:42.850> turn<00:04:43.850> them<00:04:43.940> back<00:04:44.150> on<00:04:45.160> typically

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
completely turn them back on typically

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.910 
completely turn them back on typically
if<00:04:46.370> they<00:04:46.730> are<00:04:46.880> blown<00:04:47.210> they<00:04:47.420> should<00:04:47.750> be<00:04:48.320> back<00:04:48.620> to

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
if they are blown they should be back to

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.340 
if they are blown they should be back to
the<00:04:49.220> left<00:04:49.460> side<00:04:49.790> just<00:04:50.480> maybe<00:04:50.750> something<00:04:51.170> like

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
the left side just maybe something like

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.130 
the left side just maybe something like
that<00:04:51.940> but<00:04:52.940> sometimes<00:04:53.180> like<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.840> said<00:04:53.870> they

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
that but sometimes like I said they

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.550 
that but sometimes like I said they
don't<00:04:54.170> they<00:04:54.500> don't<00:04:54.650> go<00:04:54.830> that<00:04:55.040> far<00:04:55.340> so<00:04:56.560> anyway

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
don't they don't go that far so anyway

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.390 
don't they don't go that far so anyway
that's<00:04:58.250> how<00:04:58.430> you<00:04:58.520> check<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.880> circuit
