we<00:02:44.930> said<00:02:45.170> do<00:02:45.349> I<00:02:45.379> think<00:02:45.829> there's<00:02:46.040> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.280> be<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
we said do I think there's going to be a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.630 
we said do I think there's going to be a
lockout<00:02:46.849> no<00:02:47.299> there's<00:02:47.989> too<00:02:48.349> much<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.769> lose<00:02:48.980> too

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
lockout no there's too much to lose too

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520 
lockout no there's too much to lose too
much<00:02:49.790> money<00:02:50.000> on<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.239> table<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.599> NFL<00:02:51.019> had<00:02:51.230> its

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
much money on the table the NFL had its

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.920 
much money on the table the NFL had its
highest<00:02:52.310> ratings<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.970> its<00:02:53.060> history<00:02:53.450> last<00:02:53.750> year

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
highest ratings in its history last year

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.349 
highest ratings in its history last year
the<00:02:54.829> players<00:02:55.099> benefit<00:02:55.670> from<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.239> don't

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
the players benefit from that I don't

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.089 
the players benefit from that I don't
think<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.930> players<00:02:57.170> want<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.560> give<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:58.069> up

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
think the players want to give that up

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.710 
think the players want to give that up
and<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.430> know<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.700> NFL<00:02:58.849> owners<00:02:59.269> don't<00:02:59.450> want<00:02:59.659> to

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
and I know the NFL owners don't want to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.299 
and I know the NFL owners don't want to
give<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.019> up<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:01.060> stay<00:03:02.060> tuned
