here<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:17.490> I've<00:00:17.580> done<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> I've<00:00:18.060> made<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
here what I've done is I've made a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.279 
here what I've done is I've made a
cowbell<00:00:20.730> trigger<00:00:21.090> kind<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> looks<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
cowbell trigger kind of looks like a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.689 
cowbell trigger kind of looks like a
cowbell<00:00:22.680> mine<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> green<00:00:23.279> tape<00:00:23.490> which

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
cowbell mine is the green tape which

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
cowbell mine is the green tape which
I'll<00:00:23.820> take<00:00:24.000> care<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.480> mousepad

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I'll take care of with the mousepad

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.130 
I'll take care of with the mousepad
I<00:00:27.080> used<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.670> piezo<00:00:29.670> trigger<00:00:30.000> which<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.960> just

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
I used a piezo trigger which I just

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.799 
I used a piezo trigger which I just
triggered<00:00:31.560> there<00:00:31.740> underneath<00:00:32.630> connected<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
triggered there underneath connected to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.290 
triggered there underneath connected to
a<00:00:34.730> stereo<00:00:35.730> correction<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> mono<00:00:36.600> Jack<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.200> out

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
a stereo correction of mono Jack and out

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.240 
a stereo correction of mono Jack and out
the<00:00:39.300> actual<00:00:39.660> body<00:00:39.960> fort<00:00:40.379> was<00:00:40.559> made<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
the actual body fort was made from a

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.569 
the actual body fort was made from a
mount<00:00:44.250> for<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> hose<00:00:45.300> reel<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:47.399> old

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
mount for a hose reel off of my old

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
mount for a hose reel off of my old
pressure<00:00:48.030> washer<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
pressure washer and have to look like a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060 
pressure washer and have to look like a
cowbell<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.910> decided<00:00:51.270> I'd<00:00:51.420> use<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
cowbell so I decided I'd use that the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.500 
cowbell so I decided I'd use that the
mounting<00:00:53.489> arm<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:55.770> pulled<00:00:56.280> off<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.460> old<00:00:56.789> single

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
mounting arm I pulled off my old single

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.819 
mounting arm I pulled off my old single
drum<00:00:57.719> pedal<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.399> used<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.640> couple<00:00:59.820> foam

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
drum pedal and used a couple foam

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.460 
drum pedal and used a couple foam
washers<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:04.850> simple<00:01:05.850> stand<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
washers from a simple stand that I

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.250 
washers from a simple stand that I
didn't<00:01:07.680> require<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> washers<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.640> when<00:01:08.790> I

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
didn't require the washers for when I

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.399 
didn't require the washers for when I
mounted<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.400> heart<00:01:11.400> dynamic<00:01:11.790> symbol<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
mounted the heart dynamic symbol so a

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.649 
mounted the heart dynamic symbol so a
pretty<00:01:14.369> simple<00:01:14.640> setup<00:01:14.880> stick<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> piezo

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
pretty simple setup stick the piezo

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.850 
pretty simple setup stick the piezo
underneath<00:01:16.020> solder<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> your<00:01:17.490> Jack<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
underneath solder on to your Jack and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.670 
underneath solder on to your Jack and
you're<00:01:19.860> pretty<00:01:20.040> much<00:01:20.159> done<00:01:20.659> as<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.500> see

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you're pretty much done as you can see

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.340 
you're pretty much done as you can see
it<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:23.070> sort<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.729> cowbell<00:01:24.360> shape<00:01:24.689> sorry

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it has sort of a cowbell shape sorry

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
it has sort of a cowbell shape sorry
about<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.650> really<00:01:25.860> big<00:01:26.009> cable<00:01:26.369> hanging<00:01:26.640> off

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
about the really big cable hanging off

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.420 
about the really big cable hanging off
it<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.450> didn't<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> 90<00:01:28.829> degree<00:01:29.100> bend<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it but I didn't have a 90 degree bend in

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.960 
it but I didn't have a 90 degree bend in
that<00:01:29.490> cable<00:01:30.680> so<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.189> cowbell<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.670> running

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that cable so the cowbell is running

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.230 
that cable so the cowbell is running
through<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.990> alesis<00:01:34.860> everything<00:01:35.820> else<00:01:35.939> runs

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
through the alesis everything else runs

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:45.490 
through the alesis everything else runs
through<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:38.040> td6<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.600> cowbell<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.170 

because<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> haven't<00:01:47.009> mounted<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.850> hard

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
because the way I haven't mounted a hard

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.889 
because the way I haven't mounted a hard
arm<00:01:48.360> directly<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> rack<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.750> had<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
arm directly down to the rack I had to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:58.760 
arm directly down to the rack I had to
turn<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:54.049> crash<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.500> Tom<00:01:56.040> one<00:01:57.229> crosstalk<00:01:58.229> up

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
turn the crash and Tom one crosstalk up

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
turn the crash and Tom one crosstalk up
I<00:01:58.799> believe<00:01:59.399> crash<00:01:59.670> had<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.119> all<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> way<00:02:00.329> up

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I believe crash had to go all the way up

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.190 
I believe crash had to go all the way up
to<00:02:00.600> 80<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.310> Tom<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.850> somewhere<00:02:03.240> around<00:02:03.420> 70

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to 80 and Tom one is somewhere around 70

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
to 80 and Tom one is somewhere around 70
and<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> alesis<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:07.640> cowbells<00:02:08.720> crosstalk

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and in the alesis the cowbells crosstalk

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.520 
and in the alesis the cowbells crosstalk
I<00:02:10.020> believe<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:10.979> all<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:12.050> 99

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
I believe it's all the way up to 99

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
I believe it's all the way up to 99
I'll<00:02:15.530> just<00:02:15.950> check<00:02:16.100> how<00:02:16.280> high<00:02:16.490> goes<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.910> don't

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
I'll just check how high goes I don't

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.170 
I'll just check how high goes I don't
think<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:17.300> she<00:02:17.480> goes<00:02:17.630> yeah<00:02:18.260> 99<00:02:21.940> that's<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
think I she goes yeah 99 that's all I

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.070 
think I she goes yeah 99 that's all I
have<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.600> update<00:02:23.810> thanks<00:02:24.650> bye
