first bunch of streams whatever it is

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.789 
first bunch of streams whatever it is
you're<00:02:07.940> doing<00:02:07.970> don't<00:02:08.810> expect<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.349> be<00:02:09.469> getting

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
you're doing don't expect to be getting

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.510 
you're doing don't expect to be getting
thousands<00:02:10.429> or<00:02:10.670> hundreds<00:02:11.299> or<00:02:11.420> even<00:02:11.450> tens<00:02:12.109> of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
thousands or hundreds or even tens of

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.490 
thousands or hundreds or even tens of
I<00:02:12.940> mean<00:02:13.270> you're<00:02:13.480> gonna<00:02:13.570> be<00:02:13.780> get<00:02:13.960> started

I mean you're gonna be get started

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.710 
I mean you're gonna be get started
starts<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.280> little<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.820> grows<00:02:16.450> pretty

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
starts really little and grows pretty

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.570 
starts really little and grows pretty
much<00:02:16.960> exponentially<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:17.890> you'll<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.310> there

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
much exponentially so you'll get there

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.550 
much exponentially so you'll get there
if<00:02:18.820> you<00:02:19.240> just<00:02:19.270> keep<00:02:19.630> trying<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.320> really

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
if you just keep trying but it's really

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
easy to see those starting numbers and

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.960 
easy to see those starting numbers and
just<00:02:22.450> be<00:02:22.570> like<00:02:22.740> why<00:02:23.740> am<00:02:23.890> i<00:02:24.010> bothering<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.730> why

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
just be like why am i bothering like why

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.240 
just be like why am i bothering like why
do<00:02:25.030> i<00:02:25.180> why<00:02:25.600> do<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.810> waste<00:02:26.020> my<00:02:26.200> time<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:27.040> keep
