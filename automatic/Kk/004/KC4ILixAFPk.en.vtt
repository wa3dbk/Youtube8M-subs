00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 chapter 58 the voice nothing in the neck do not you 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.150
 Hold up your voice like a trumpet and 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 announces to my people their rebellion and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 home of Jacob his sin that seek me 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.199
 every day and they want to know my ways 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 as people who had done justice and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 that he had not left the law of his god 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.670
 They ask me for fair trials and they want 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.130
 approaching God because they say we fast 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 If you did not listen, we humiliate our 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.840
 souls and you did not know what I understood 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.210
 here that on the day of your fast 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.739
 you look for your own taste and optimize 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 all your workers 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.510
 behold, for contentions and debates 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.390
 there are unis and to hurt with the fist 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.090
 unjustly there is not a is like today to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.340
 that your voice be heard on high is 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.620
 such the fast that I chose that I should 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.690
 fix the man his soul that tilt his 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.449
 head like reeds and make bed 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.239
 silicon and ash you will call this fasting 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.550
 and a pleasant day to jehovah is not rather 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 the fast that I chose to unleash the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.110
 ungodly bonds release the charges 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.020
 of oppression and leave them free to 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
 broken and that you break all yoke 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.460
 it is not that he breaks his bread with the hungry 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.009
 and the poor wandering hostels in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.920
 home that when you see the naked what you're going 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.020
 and do not hide from your brother then 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 your light will rise like the dawn and you 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.939
 salvation will be left soon and go to 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.700
 your righteousness before you and the glory of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.490
 Jehovah will be your rearguard then 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.579
 invoke ace and the great jehovah to cry out 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.649
 will say the digital n here in the middle of 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.869
 you yoke the threatening finger and the 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.420
 speak vanity and if you want your bread to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.520
 hungry and social to the frigid soul in 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.310
 the darkness is born your light and your 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.439
 darkness will be like noon jehovah 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.630
 I will shepherd you always and in droughts 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.539
 towards your soul and will give vigor to your 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.549
 bones and you will be like a watering garden and 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.459
 as a spring of waters whose waters 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.770
 never fail and yours will build 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.140
 ancient ruins the foundations of 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.259
 generation and generation you will raise and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.420
 will be called repairman of portillos 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.270
 restorer of roads to inhabit 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.459
 He withdrew from the Sabbath your foot of 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.680
 flame them glorious holy delight of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.110
 jehovah and venerate him is not walking in your 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.810
 own roads or looking for your will 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.300
 Not even speaking your own words 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.830
 then you will delight in jehovah and I will 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.080
 I will make climb on the heights of the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.750
 land and I will give you to eat the inheritance of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.260
