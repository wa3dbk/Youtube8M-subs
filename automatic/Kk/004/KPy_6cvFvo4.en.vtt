00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.140
 what do you think there was the conference of 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.480
 sinisa mihajlovic 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.910
 guys I said this rags 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.090
 it is mine this year so we know that 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.450
 there is, but straight from you I say it goes 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.310
 well when ever according to the now 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.590
 you give the word fuck and straight you can 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.720
 say I understood in the sense that he knows 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.180
 exactly that this is the opportunity 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.190
 of his life and he can't be wrong 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.980
 will often appear in the morning a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.170
 work 7 awakens off the bed with 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.409
 the trumpets and that ice water of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.449
 manna spits blood in the league this 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.690
 he is also capable of waking up the night 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.920
 ball type about it he did not see the field 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.100
 under test, they make me light but masses of things 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.129
 because it has to but this is crazy is this 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.979
 concealed things like that all sites under that 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.699
 dona does what he says and therefore therefore 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.940
 I have Romanists or bad guys 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.940
 omens 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.509
 I don't know what you think these are 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.180
 come back under trembles and let us understand how much 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.250
 you think they wanted they were no no for charity 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.960
 but you know when you change a lot anyway 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.100
 a new change coach anyway of the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.720
 players 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.189
 for example this morning we did a 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.540
 video where we wondered but how 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.380
 they do all the attackers 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.520
 he already given a solution here in a 4 3 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.430
 1 2 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.140
 hera said she would try I read 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.880
 textual el sharaawy 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.820
 in midfield as a midfielder already has 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.780
 talked to the guy is the guy you are 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.659
 proved our place available well 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.640
 however, let's have a talk or so 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.600
 it's called a speech that had udine 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.330
 ride as a national 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.000
 and in any case the national boasts of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.700
 rosetum midfielders and role changes a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.319
 it's easy that it counts and then it doesn't see me 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.780
 plus that role he had given me before 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.250
 that of external attacker some way it is 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.720
 become midfielder then maybe 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.270
 sick go to play with 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.729
 midfielders there is a bit more mangy 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:16.280
 how situation would they look with 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.260
 the cocks his game however is interesting 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.490
 the gand with which as a situation why 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.650
 however let's talk about a 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:27.900
 possibly of the sticky midfielder 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:31.320
 that up until now he had already seen it when too much 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.400
 forward then other said spoken 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.070
 pure berlusconi 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.520
 rightly the usual controversy that who 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.450
 is training is padania yes 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.200
 will always play worse is too two 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 points 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.910
 if like need one color for the sum 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.510
 pass this defense to three you have broken i 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.550
 balls to damn things but real 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.130
 water to rinses the par 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.200
 affection and half but you don't have but who is there 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.790
 says more dearly at European level why 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.280
 but then nothing interests what 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.770
 interested in new is good in short it is so 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.140
 to the portrait some inspiration from the 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.740
 sinisa conference that finds the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.630
 sticking out this is one decided one who 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.220
 he wants to do a good championship that he would do 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.470
 everything happened with still gen 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.820
 Berlusconi said one thing if ibra 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.300
 we take it gladly 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.490
 no if it is the opposite city ​​if you 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.160
 take ibra ago he comes willingly for 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.260
 take ibra ce then the mammone 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.340
 presented the bari they play comes in 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.570
 problem is that if he passes that works 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.940
 so our data with the mammone is fine 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.470
 we see silvio that she also follows us 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.540
 for silvio we know that in any case they 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.820
 they draw a lot of inspiration from us to do the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.780
 schedule of mediaset 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.280
 among other things, among other things, we are rare 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.960
 in the sense of how they are doing the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.490
 schedule in mind the tuscia da days 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.150
 pam is no 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.860

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.710
 just without problems and will love 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.420

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.530
 see you at the rap 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 write your mind that that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.100
 impressions you have taken from 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.890
 cd samir handanovic conference e 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 write in iraq act will go all broken 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.630
 here it is, here is the Milan can 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.930
 be an outsider 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.000
 the scudetto of milan 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.320
 paride, however, looks at the recent past 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.690

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:33.660
