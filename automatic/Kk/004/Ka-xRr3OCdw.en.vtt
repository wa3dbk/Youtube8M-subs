on both sides so now I'm gonna show you
the<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:27.600> piece<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.020> clips<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:30.000> kind

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the little piece that clips on it kind

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.080 
the little piece that clips on it kind
of<00:02:30.270> looks<00:02:30.480> like<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.660> brick<00:02:30.930> arms<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.650> not

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
of looks like a brick arms but it's not

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.440 
of looks like a brick arms but it's not
it's<00:02:33.090> different<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:35.760> got<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.210> little

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it's different it's got these little

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's different it's got these little
clips<00:02:36.810> which<00:02:37.050> fit<00:02:37.350> nicely<00:02:37.620> into<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.550> little

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
clips which fit nicely into the little

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
clips which fit nicely into the little
round<00:02:39.210> cylinder<00:02:39.750> which<00:02:39.960> I'll<00:02:40.110> show<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.320> next

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
round cylinder which I'll show you next

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.610 
round cylinder which I'll show you next
it<00:02:41.190> also<00:02:41.310> fits<00:02:41.700> into<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.150> gun<00:02:42.330> nicely<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
it also fits into the gun nicely and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.830 
it also fits into the gun nicely and
it's<00:02:43.860> not<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.850> gonna<00:02:45.360> break<00:02:46.460> it<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:48.390> really

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
it's not like gonna break it is really

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.980 
it's not like gonna break it is really
nice<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:49.050> it's<00:02:49.500> strong<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.810> can

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
nice and it's strong and then you can

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.090 
nice and it's strong and then you can
just<00:02:52.500> slide<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.670> there<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:55.100> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
just slide that on in there and the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.590 
just slide that on in there and the
little<00:02:56.190> cylinder<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.000> only<00:02:57.090> fit<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.450> one

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
little cylinder it can only fit in one

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.880 
little cylinder it can only fit in one
way<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.820> can't<00:03:00.060> put<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.600> any<00:03:01.470> other<00:03:01.650> way

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
way so you can't put it in any other way

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.140 
way so you can't put it in any other way
but<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.670> fits<00:03:02.850> really<00:03:03.060> nicely<00:03:03.330> into<00:03:04.110> there<00:03:04.320> and

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
but it fits really nicely into there and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.930 
but it fits really nicely into there and
it<00:03:06.150> moves<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.960> and<00:03:07.140> down<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.680> then<00:03:08.280> we<00:03:08.700> have

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
it moves up and down and then we have

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.560 
it moves up and down and then we have
the<00:03:09.240> ammo<00:03:10.020> box<00:03:10.670> now<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.700> just<00:03:11.880> slides<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.450> you

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
the ammo box now it just slides in you

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.360 
the ammo box now it just slides in you
can<00:03:12.750> set<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.140> either<00:03:13.380> side<00:03:13.740> I'm<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:14.190> going

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
can set it on either side I'm just going

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.610 
can set it on either side I'm just going
to<00:03:14.400> set<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.360> side<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.959> as<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.380> can

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
to set it on this side and as you can

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.040 
to set it on this side and as you can
see<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.010> fits<00:03:17.430> nice<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.510> could<00:03:18.690> kind<00:03:18.930> of

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
see it fits nice and it could kind of

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.820 
see it fits nice and it could kind of
clips<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.260> then<00:03:22.260> we<00:03:22.380> have<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
clips in there and then we have the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.930 
clips in there and then we have the
little<00:03:23.810> handle<00:03:24.810> part<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.220> mini<00:03:26.459> fit<00:03:26.760> can

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
little handle part that the mini fit can

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330 
little handle part that the mini fit can
hold<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.630> just<00:03:27.840> slide<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.380> on<00:03:28.530> there<00:03:28.740> it

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
hold and you just slide it on there it

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.260 
hold and you just slide it on there it
also<00:03:29.520> is<00:03:30.350> snug<00:03:31.350> so<00:03:32.010> it's<00:03:32.160> not<00:03:32.400> going<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.910> move

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
also is snug so it's not going to move

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.370 
also is snug so it's not going to move
as<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.810> could<00:03:33.990> see<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:35.250> doesn't<00:03:35.490> really<00:03:35.850> move

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
as you could see it doesn't really move

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.290 
as you could see it doesn't really move
but<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.680> easy<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.220> take<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.610> off<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:39.060> put<00:03:39.120> it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
but it is easy to take it off and put it

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.720 
but it is easy to take it off and put it
on<00:03:39.510> so<00:03:40.260> then<00:03:41.160> we<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.580> these<00:03:42.209> little<00:03:42.510> clip<00:03:42.900> and

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
on so then we have these little clip and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.870 
on so then we have these little clip and
also<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:45.320> piece<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.350> looks<00:03:46.590> like<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.310> u<00:03:47.580> clip

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
also a piece that looks like a u clip

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.680 
also a piece that looks like a u clip
but<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.530> made<00:03:49.709> specifically<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:51.330> m2

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
but this is made specifically for the m2

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.910 
but this is made specifically for the m2
and<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.920> Burke<00:03:53.130> arms<00:03:53.840> its<00:03:54.840> fits<00:03:55.500> nicely

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
and it's not Burke arms its fits nicely

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.490 
and it's not Burke arms its fits nicely
onto<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.670> gun<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.120> clips<00:03:57.450> on<00:03:57.660> right<00:03:57.900> there<00:03:58.140> and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
onto the gun it clips on right there and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.130 
onto the gun it clips on right there and
then<00:03:59.190> we<00:03:59.370> have<00:03:59.580> this<00:03:59.850> piece<00:04:00.360> right<00:04:00.630> here<00:04:00.690> and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
then we have this piece right here and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.670 
then we have this piece right here and
you<00:04:01.740> clip<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.130> on<00:04:02.280> right<00:04:02.490> there<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.500> that's

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
you clip it on right there so that's

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.290 
you clip it on right there so that's
pretty<00:04:04.860> much<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.250> pieces<00:04:05.610> guys<00:04:05.790> hope<00:04:06.120> you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
pretty much the pieces guys hope you

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.930 
pretty much the pieces guys hope you
