00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.319
 the bill that strengthens the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.149
 best-known public order safeguard 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.340
 as hinzpeter law that was presented 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.530
 during the year 2011 during the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.639
 student mobilizations has like 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.110
 object create new crimes ie 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.970
 typifying facts that are not really 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.640
 constitutive of crimes nor can they be 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.950
 in any democratic country all this with 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.530
 the purpose of criminalizing the protest 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.910
 social policy in Chile- the typification of 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.740
 behaviors and facts of which the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.900
 social movements are valid from 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 history revolutions mean 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 a huge social and political regression 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 human makes us return to being subjects in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.429
 instead of citizens is to return to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.909
 17th century at least the 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:47.370
 fines laid down in article 262 of the 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.409
 penal code to apply deprivation 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 of freedom to the attacks against the 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.690
 authority 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.149
 what are the attacks against 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.399
 authority against carabineros styles 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 mainly 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 they are currently sanctioned 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.089
 with this new law will be sanctioned with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.020
 minor presidio in its middle grade is 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.200
 say 341 days 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.399
 to 3 years in prison is to say that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.730
 people who attack police officers 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.520
 during the mobilizations 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.750
 will be sanctioned with this penalty of 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.670
 prison to which I referred 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.229
 previously 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 we all know that carabiner in a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.140
 attack with chemical weapons 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.390
 mainly with almost the image and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.480
 many times they have done it already 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.790
 with balines dogs 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.210
 etc 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.909
 but nevertheless attacking a carabinero 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.850
 even if it is with a trick will be 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.409
 penalized with jail that sanctions 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 all who participate insist 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.640
 encourage or promote any type of 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.800
 disorder or act of violence paralyze or 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 interrupt some public service 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.720
 invade or loot homes or any 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 place either private or municipal public 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.950
 prevent 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.590
 free movement of vehicles or 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.409
 people on the streets bridges roads 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.560
 or any other good for public use 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.440
 who incite encourage promote or 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 Participate participate is to attend a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.120
 mobilization 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.940
 to promote or encourage is to convene 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.890
 the mobilizations can not be done the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.750
 group on facebook or create events in 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.280
 facebook all that be penalized with 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.800
 jail as the law does not say 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.770
 specifically that what it comes down to 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.030
 what does it mean that incite 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.739
 promo to comment or participate could 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.170
 eventually do all this what is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.720
 has penalized as it has happened in 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.960
 other countries 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.760
 besides trying to apply the greater penalty 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:51.650
 with all the cases of attacks on the 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.319
 authority or that the person the accused 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.530
 there is no state face discovered or there 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.349
 used any any element 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.790
 that retards even the identification of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.410
 your identity what does this mean 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.210
 what 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.620
 are penalizing the use of any 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.110
 element to deal with the identification of 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.090
 the identity that makes this difficult may 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.010
 be costumes wigs like people 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.810
 often drawn the lens protests 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.700
 dark or a handkerchief to cover the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.410
 tear gas bombs because put 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.720
 breathe i 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.130
 all this will be penalized this seems 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.610
 much more the law of detention by 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.610
 suspicion 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.620
 that was repealed but clearly now 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.840
 seeks to be corrected and expanded 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.250
 In addition, the project aims to 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.990
 amendments to the criminal procedure code 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.360
 with the most important modification and 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 pretend to do in this case is in 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.459
 relationship 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.880
 when it is declared when the court 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.170
 declares the detention illegal or refuses or 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.150
 revokes preventive detention 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.110
 this resource allows the prosecutor 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.860
 interpose a relationship resource 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.390
 currently the legal procedure 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.940
 prevents interposing resources to relation in 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.590
 these cases when the incidence that 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.220
 this project is in this article 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.910
 example if a person is arrested in 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.910
 a manifestation 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.709
 in arbitrary form 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.169
 he was detained all day 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.169
 in the comisary 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.760
 it is formalized and at the time of 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.500
 formalization the prosecutor requests that the 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.090
 court applies preventive detention in 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.280
 against that person but the court 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.930
 he denies it because he considers that 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.120
 because a person who was arrested in 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.900
 a protest 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.490
 what for 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.490
 and unseating for example 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:52.009
 it was not a danger to society 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.009
 but what is happening 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.090
 the prosecutor appeals with the sole fact of 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.320
 appeal the accused will be stopped 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.750
 until the appeal is resolved 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.430
 appeal to a higher court and that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.230
 It may take several days 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.880
 besides that this bill 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.860
 I wanted to make other modifications 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.060
 in the criminal procedural code that the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.640
 President of the Republic indicated 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.110
 suppress but even so although it has 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.180
 made this indication in a project 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.530
 of law it is important to note that it is 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.510
 what you wanted to do because it's very serious 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.420
 that a project of 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.670
 law that you have to live this 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.080
 there are certain actions that perform the 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:31.740
 pd and carabineros de chile 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.659
 that do not need authorization or the 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.789
 fiscal or the judge is to say that they can 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:37.889
 do on your own are the are 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.750
 the actions performed by the PDA and 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.810
 Carabineros without authorization 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:47.389
 previous within these actions the 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.240
 project proposed that it could be 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.190
 seize 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.529
 everything that was filming 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.499
 Photographs 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.100
 audios and even sounds of facts that 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:02.380
 were constituting a crime ' 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.820
 as for example what does this mean 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.160
 if people are filming by 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.470
 example with cell in the protests if 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.090
 is certain situations that are happening 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.840
 he has goes in everything and get carabineros 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.600
 From Chile 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.220
 and remove the camera or cell phone at 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.479
 people who are signing this is 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:22.490
 extremely serious because it attempts against 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.380
 the right of press freedom that 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.990
 is to apply censorship in addition in our 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.720
 country have turned around the world 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.210
 through social networks our images 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.260
 of police abuse that have occurred in 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.690
 chile during the student movement 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.960
 and also during the protests in them 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.720
 in aysén finally this bill 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.980
 included the state of faults that allows 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:48.340
 the arrest against every person 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.010
 that disobeys the orders that are 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.020
 giving the authority to enforce and 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.630
 be able to maintain public order ie 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.600
 that equals anything that's very 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.430
 broad lends itself to whatever it is so 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.140
 so many arrests that currently 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.940
 they are illegal that currently the law 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.110
 considered as arbitrary they are no longer going to 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.110
 be considered as arbitrary 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.190
 that the police and the apparatus 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.010
 jurisdictional 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.690
 to be formally prepared for 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.340
 condemn in addition to people do not be 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.280
 not only that abuse is allowed 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.260
 police that is already allowed but that 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.810
 even legally allows even 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.040
 large scale but this will allow 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.950
 also that the jurisdictional apparatus 

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.410
 be used to condemn the 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.330
 people for political events by 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.970
 political behaviors due to the fact 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:41.100
 defend our rights and fight to 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.390
 this this is something very serious that we 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.390
 as citizens we can not afford
