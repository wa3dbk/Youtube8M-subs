originally<00:01:42.490> from<00:01:42.760> American<00:01:43.360> Eagle<00:01:43.540> so<00:01:44.470> you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
originally from American Eagle so you

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.810

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.420 
think that pick you know this day are
actually<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.330> pair<00:01:46.660> of<00:01:46.840> leggings<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.560> yes
