00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
so we're going to be working on painting

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.690 
so we're going to be working on painting
our<00:00:24.900> brake<00:00:25.110> drums<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.680> our<00:00:25.770> calipers<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
our brake drums and our calipers for the

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.190 
our brake drums and our calipers for the
back<00:00:26.850> part<00:00:27.120> here<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.360> our<00:00:27.480> brake<00:00:27.660> drums<00:00:27.930> it's

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
back part here and our brake drums it's

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.300 
back part here and our brake drums it's
really<00:00:28.410> easy<00:00:28.530> just<00:00:28.620> to<00:00:28.800> take<00:00:28.950> these<00:00:29.130> off

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
really easy just to take these off

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.980 
really easy just to take these off
completely<00:00:29.700> so<00:00:29.970> we'll<00:00:30.450> go<00:00:30.540> ahead<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.780> take

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
completely so we'll go ahead and take

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.370 
completely so we'll go ahead and take
this<00:00:31.170> off<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:32.790> put<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.060> one<00:00:33.240> in<00:00:33.360> place<00:00:33.480> but

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
this off and put this one in place but

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.960 
this off and put this one in place but
for<00:00:34.560> the<00:00:34.620> caliper<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
for the caliper we're going to do a

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.690 
for the caliper we're going to do a
little<00:00:36.180> differently<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> instead<00:00:41.640> of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
little differently so instead of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.979 
little differently so instead of
bleeding<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> brake<00:00:42.270> lines<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.870> we're

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
bleeding the brake lines what we're

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.120 
bleeding the brake lines what we're
going<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.410> leave<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.590> caliper<00:00:44.010> in

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
going to do is leave the caliper in

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.910 
going to do is leave the caliper in
place<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> paint<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.720> rotor<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.260> now

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
place and paint it on the rotor here now

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.170 
place and paint it on the rotor here now
to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.250> we're<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> use<00:00:48.059> our

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to do that we're going to use our

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000 
to do that we're going to use our
caliper<00:00:48.420> cleaner<00:00:48.720> and<00:00:49.620> we're<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> get

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
caliper cleaner and we're going to get

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.140 
caliper cleaner and we're going to get
it<00:00:50.070> nice<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.190> clean<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.520> ready<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.000> fresh

with it
a<00:01:30.060> calculator<00:01:31.150> it<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.260> helped<00:01:32.500> take<00:01:32.650> off

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
a calculator it really helped take off

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.410 
a calculator it really helped take off
some<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.040> that<00:01:33.160> paint<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:33.820> was<00:01:34.000> previously

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
some of that paint that was previously

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.850 
some of that paint that was previously
on<00:01:34.600> there<00:01:34.750> you<00:01:35.140> can<00:01:35.290> see<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.470> dripping<00:01:35.590> down

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
on there you can see it dripping down

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.680 
on there you can see it dripping down
right<00:01:36.130> now

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.300 

we<00:01:42.690> got<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> cleaned<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.260> when<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.160> taping

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
we got it cleaned up when you're taping

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.380 
we got it cleaned up when you're taping
this<00:01:44.520> off<00:01:44.730> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.150> sure<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.330> don't

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this off you want to make sure you don't

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
this off you want to make sure you don't
want<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.050> don't<00:01:46.260> get<00:01:46.350> any<00:01:46.530> paint<00:01:46.770> on

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
want to get you don't get any paint on

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.860 
want to get you don't get any paint on
the<00:01:47.130> brake<00:01:47.280> pad<00:01:47.520> or<00:01:47.730> the<00:01:47.820> rotors<00:01:48.120> so<00:01:48.750> it's

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
the brake pad or the rotors so it's

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.210 
the brake pad or the rotors so it's
important<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.230> tape<00:01:49.440> all<00:01:49.620> those<00:01:49.770> areas<00:01:50.070> off

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
important to tape all those areas off

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:00.620 
important to tape all those areas off
before<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.610> put<00:01:50.670> any<00:01:50.910> paint<00:01:51.090> down<00:01:59.630> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
before you put any paint down so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.760 
before you put any paint down so
everything's<00:02:00.960> taped<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.410> and<00:02:01.590> ready<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
everything's taped off and ready to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.560 
everything's taped off and ready to
begin<00:02:01.860> laying<00:02:02.160> down<00:02:02.370> our<00:02:02.400> paint<00:02:02.760> one<00:02:03.330> thing<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
begin laying down our paint one thing to

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.090 
begin laying down our paint one thing to
note<00:02:03.690> about<00:02:03.720> vh<00:02:04.110> cheese<00:02:04.320> caliper<00:02:04.650> paint<00:02:04.800> is<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
note about vh cheese caliper paint is it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.460 
note about vh cheese caliper paint is it
works<00:02:05.250> great<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.760> high<00:02:05.970> heat<00:02:06.240> conditions<00:02:06.840> this

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
works great on high heat conditions this

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.990 
works great on high heat conditions this
is<00:02:07.530> rated<00:02:08.130> up<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> 900<00:02:08.759> degrees<00:02:08.970> Fahrenheit

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
is rated up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.850 
is rated up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit
which<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.899> calipers<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.350> get<00:02:10.470> pretty<00:02:10.619> hot

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
which your calipers can get pretty hot

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.010 
which your calipers can get pretty hot
but<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.820> will<00:02:12.000> work<00:02:12.120> very<00:02:12.150> well<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
but this will work very well for that so

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.449

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
our wire brush and then we can use the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.560 
our wire brush and then we can use the
VHD<00:02:56.190> caliper<00:02:56.520> cleaner<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.910> also<00:02:57.090> help<00:02:57.390> break
