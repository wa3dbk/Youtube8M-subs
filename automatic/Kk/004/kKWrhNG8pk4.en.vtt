the<00:01:06.159> same<00:01:06.369> as<00:01:06.610> their<00:01:06.850> 44<00:01:07.690> where<00:01:07.960> we<00:01:08.110> have<00:01:08.259> a

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
the same as their 44 where we have a

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.310 
the same as their 44 where we have a
full<00:01:08.890> cabin<00:01:09.429> cuddy<00:01:09.940> cabin<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.570> also<00:01:10.869> an<00:01:10.990> open

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
full cabin cuddy cabin and also an open

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.710 
full cabin cuddy cabin and also an open
version<00:01:11.530> something<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.399> little<00:01:12.759> smaller<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
version something a little smaller the

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.660 
version something a little smaller the
44<00:01:14.259> is<00:01:14.409> actually<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.069> biggest<00:01:15.280> center

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
44 is actually the biggest center

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.340 
44 is actually the biggest center
console<00:01:16.149> here<00:01:16.330> in<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.539> show<00:01:16.720> he's<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> monster

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
console here in the show he's a monster

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.219 
console here in the show he's a monster
and<00:01:17.800> so<00:01:18.490> we<00:01:19.090> don't<00:01:19.659> have<00:01:19.750> anything<00:01:20.050> between

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
and so we don't have anything between

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.029 
and so we don't have anything between
that<00:01:20.530> 36<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.280> 40<00:01:21.580> for<00:01:21.700> another<00:01:22.259> view<00:01:23.259> 39<00:01:23.800> is

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
that 36 and 40 for another view 39 is

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.590 
that 36 and 40 for another view 39 is
that<00:01:24.130> going<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.340> be<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.429> twin<00:01:24.670> engine<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:25.060> triple

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
that going to be a twin engine a triple

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.950 
that going to be a twin engine a triple
engine<00:01:25.720> it's<00:01:26.050> all<00:01:27.270> we're<00:01:28.270> building<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.720> first

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
engine it's all we're building it first

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.430 
engine it's all we're building it first
with<00:01:29.229> triples<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.550> we<00:01:31.210> had<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.780> offer<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.319> with

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
with triples and we had to offer it with

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.190 
with triples and we had to offer it with
twins<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:32.979> think<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.340> shield<00:01:34.270> she<00:01:34.899> should<00:01:35.140> be

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
twins we think that shield she should be

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.920 
twins we think that shield she should be
able<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.500> plane<00:01:35.740> beautifully<00:01:36.250> with

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
able to plane beautifully with

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.820 
able to plane beautifully with
I<00:01:38.930> think<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> triples<00:01:40.350> would<00:01:40.440> be<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.620> more

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
I think the triples would be the more

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.400 
I think the triples would be the more
logical<00:01:41.840> application<00:01:42.840> though<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.230> voter

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
logical application though for the voter

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.850 
logical application though for the voter
