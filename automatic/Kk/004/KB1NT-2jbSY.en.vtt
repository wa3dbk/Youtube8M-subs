00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:09.600
 well we are here at cdp 1 of belém 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
 to be precise in the city of são 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.900
 Paulo 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.490
 You must be wondering who? 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.159
 have you seen in this video who these 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 people where they are 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.960
 Why are they hiding the face? 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.999
 We're hiding the face that we 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.699
 we are afraid of reprisals by the 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:29.009
 system because the video that we 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.050
 Let's show it now it's going to give a 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.989
 reality for those who see 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 see how many people are in this cell 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.510
 we've been in about here 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 Write a review 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.969
 a cell of that capacity has 12 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.920
 people ie is 12 beds will 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 behave 12 people however we 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.699
 we are 52 see how many people are 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.659
 within that cell 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 imagine only one prisoner with illness here with 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:07.080
 tuberculosis breathing one air from another 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.670
 the possibility of the person passing disease 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.670
 one for the other is very large 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.870
 only the number of networks that have these 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.870
 she shows 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:27.259
 who knows anyone here? 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 Let's go and confirm here 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:42.959
 Look how many people inside a cell 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:44.969
 already difficult to get around 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.390
 inside a small cell with 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:02:15.120
 so many people show you around now 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:18.120
 What is it like to come out on top and look at yourself? 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.700
 how many people in this cell here and see the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.019
 size of the government's neglect or 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.239
 there is a violation of human rights 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:32.790
 So many people within 1 were not so 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:35.549
 I'm not going to show 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.010
 A little bit here from the bathroom of that place. 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.819
 You have an understanding like life. 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.370
 it's difficult here 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.299
 the precariousness of the system 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.299
 Prison of São Paulo 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.299
 watch
