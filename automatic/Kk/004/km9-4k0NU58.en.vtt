00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
how are you going to make the world a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.030 
how are you going to make the world a
better<00:00:11.190> place<00:00:11.400> by<00:00:11.849> 2020<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> started

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
better place by 2020 and so I started

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.770 
better place by 2020 and so I started
pondering<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> question<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.450> ended<00:00:15.690> up

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
pondering on the question I ended up

pondering on the question I ended up
with<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> crazy<00:00:16.800> idea<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.520> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.820> know

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
with with a crazy idea and if you know

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.240 
with with a crazy idea and if you know
oil<00:00:18.300> fifty<00:00:19.170> percent<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.529> oil<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> world<00:00:20.100> is

done as humans because it takes hundreds

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.089 
done as humans because it takes hundreds
of<00:00:26.430> millions<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.970> years<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.510> make<00:00:27.960> oil<00:00:28.260> for

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
of millions of years to make oil for

those<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.699> oil<00:00:30.000> is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
those of you don't know oil is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080 
those of you don't know oil is
concentrated<00:00:31.050> sunlight<00:00:31.700> when<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> figure

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
concentrated sunlight when you figure

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
concentrated sunlight when you figure
out<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.430> oil<00:00:35.640> driven

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
out that all well all the oil driven

out that all well all the oil driven
things<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.780> got<00:00:36.960> fifty<00:00:37.290> percent<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> them

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
things that we got fifty percent of them

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
things that we got fifty percent of them
are<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.040> transportation<00:00:38.399> twenty<00:00:39.270> percent<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
are for transportation twenty percent is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
are for transportation twenty percent is
actually<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.379> making<00:00:41.100> plastic<00:00:41.550> bags<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
actually for making plastic bags and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
actually for making plastic bags and
other<00:00:42.120> things<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> need<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.290> our

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
other things that we need to put on our

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.410 
other things that we need to put on our
faces<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> other<00:00:44.789> thirty<00:00:45.090> percent

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
faces and then the other thirty percent

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.880 
faces and then the other thirty percent
is<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.780> left<00:00:45.989> over<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is just left over we don't know what to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.380 
is just left over we don't know what to
do<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.399> use<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.059> kinds<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
do it so we use for all kinds of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
do it so we use for all kinds of
industrial<00:00:48.899> purposes<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:50.039> much<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.760> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
industrial purposes so much so that we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
industrial purposes so much so that we
run<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> most<00:00:51.600> interesting<00:00:52.440> economic

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
run the most interesting economic

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.770 
run the most interesting economic
experiment<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.550> raised<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.000> gas<00:00:54.149> prices<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
experiment we raised the gas prices in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
experiment we raised the gas prices in
the<00:00:54.809> US<00:00:54.899> from<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.559> dollar<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.860> gallon<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.399> three

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the US from one dollar a gallon to three

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
the US from one dollar a gallon to three
and<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> half<00:00:56.910> dollars<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> gallon<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.930> guess

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and a half dollars a gallon and guess

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.799 
and a half dollars a gallon and guess
what<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.399> reduce<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.820> average<00:01:00.180> drive<00:01:00.719> by<00:01:01.020> 0.4%

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
what we reduce the average drive by 0.4%

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
what we reduce the average drive by 0.4%
so<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.960> know<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.830> up<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.189> eight

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so we know that we can go up to eight

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
so we know that we can go up to eight
dollars<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.000> nobody<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.659> stop<00:01:06.930> driving

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
dollars and nobody will stop driving

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
dollars and nobody will stop driving
what<00:01:07.650> they'll<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.040> they'll<00:01:08.340> stop<00:01:08.670> buying

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
what they'll do is they'll stop buying

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.230 
what they'll do is they'll stop buying
big<00:01:09.360> cars<00:01:10.250> which<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.460> kill<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.850> margin<00:01:12.210> for

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
big cars which will kill the margin for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
big cars which will kill the margin for
the<00:01:12.420> car<00:01:12.630> companies<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:14.280> they'll<00:01:14.430> keep

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the car companies but they'll keep

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
the car companies but they'll keep
driving<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.119> new<00:01:18.119> rule<00:01:18.500> 50<00:01:19.500> times<00:01:19.770> five
