but I'm assuming that eventually you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.820 
but I'm assuming that eventually you
will<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.840> able<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.199> according<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> this

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
sticker but I just got the one for the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.380 
sticker but I just got the one for the
fast<00:00:25.199> ballistic<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.640> feel<00:00:26.910> it'll<00:00:27.060> work<00:00:27.240> out

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
fast ballistic so feel it'll work out

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.650 
fast ballistic so feel it'll work out
fine

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:39.250 

pretty<00:00:30.660> standard<00:00:30.840> box<00:00:36.559> see<00:00:37.559> what's<00:00:37.770> inside

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
pretty standard box see what's inside

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.610 
pretty standard box see what's inside
this<00:00:40.260> took<00:00:40.500> about<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:41.010> month<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
this took about a month for me to get so

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
this took about a month for me to get so
kind<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.739> long<00:00:43.920> time<00:00:44.840> but<00:00:45.840> hopefully<00:00:46.410> it'll

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
kind of a long time but hopefully it'll

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.110 
kind of a long time but hopefully it'll
be<00:00:46.710> worth<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> wait<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
be worth the wait because the the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.930 
be worth the wait because the the
replica<00:00:49.010> fit<00:00:50.010> bands<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.700> aren't<00:00:50.850> very

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
replica fit bands really aren't very

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
replica fit bands really aren't very
comfortable<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> straps<00:00:52.170> are<00:00:52.350> usually

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
comfortable and the straps are usually

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
comfortable and the straps are usually
the<00:00:52.800> worst<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.280> about<00:00:53.460> them<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> that's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the worst thing about them and that's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.889 
the worst thing about them and that's
true<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.280> FMA<00:00:56.940> maritime<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> straps

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
true about the FMA maritime the straps

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.090 
true about the FMA maritime the straps
on<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> FMA<00:00:59.070> maritime<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.789> really<00:01:00.090> bad

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
on the FMA maritime is just really bad

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.310 
on the FMA maritime is just really bad
so<00:01:03.710> open<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.830> up

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.140 

see<00:01:09.070> you<00:01:09.280> got<00:01:09.460> some<00:01:09.490> installation

see you got some installation

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.150 
see you got some installation
instructions<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.810> all<00:01:13.870> fast<00:01:14.200> helmets<00:01:14.650> unless

instructions for all fast helmets unless
you<00:01:15.340> guys<00:01:15.520> know<00:01:15.700> how<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:15.970> put<00:01:16.360> these<00:01:16.480> in<00:01:16.660> if

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
you guys know how to put these in if

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.810 
you guys know how to put these in if
you've<00:01:16.960> ever<00:01:17.140> messed<00:01:17.440> with<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:18.220> helmets<00:01:18.610> at

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
you've ever messed with the helmets at

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.670 
you've ever messed with the helmets at
all<00:01:18.940> they're<00:01:19.690> pretty<00:01:19.930> simple<00:01:20.230> once<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.560> get

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
all they're pretty simple once you get

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.150 
all they're pretty simple once you get
it<00:01:20.800> all<00:01:21.390> figured<00:01:22.390> out

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
it all figured out

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.320 
it all figured out
and<00:01:24.160> this<00:01:24.550> is<00:01:24.670> what<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:24.910> get<00:01:25.000> when<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.240> order

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
and this is what you get when you order

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.930 
and this is what you get when you order
the<00:01:25.690> replacement<00:01:25.960> fit<00:01:26.440> band<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:27.670> get<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
the replacement fit band you get the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.570 
the replacement fit band you get the
front<00:01:28.180> pad<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.710> is<00:01:29.740> actually<00:01:30.130> a<00:01:30.190> lot<00:01:30.370> softer

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
front pad which is actually a lot softer

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.360 
front pad which is actually a lot softer
than<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.090> one<00:01:31.740> included<00:01:32.740> with<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.010> FMA

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
than the one included with the FMA

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.180 
than the one included with the FMA
maritime<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.120> then<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.110> front<00:01:35.830> padding

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
maritime and then the front padding

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.040 
maritime and then the front padding
which<00:01:36.640> is<00:01:36.820> really<00:01:37.120> thick<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.750> FM<00:01:37.960> a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
which is really thick on the FM a

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.750 
which is really thick on the FM a
maritime<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.800> makes<00:01:38.950> fitting<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.430> helmet

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
maritime so it makes fitting the helmet

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.450 
maritime so it makes fitting the helmet
pretty<00:01:40.150> hard<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.810> do<00:01:40.990> as<00:01:41.200> well<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:43.030> rear

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
pretty hard to do as well the rear

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.890 
pretty hard to do as well the rear
hardware<00:01:45.460> is<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.640> lot<00:01:45.910> better

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
hardware is a lot better

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.570 
hardware is a lot better
the<00:01:47.229> dials<00:01:47.560> actually<00:01:47.860> rubberized<00:01:48.540> versus<00:01:49.540> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
the dials actually rubberized versus the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.210 
the dials actually rubberized versus the
one<00:01:51.580> that's<00:01:51.820> on<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.420> FM<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.259> maritime<00:01:53.650> is<00:01:53.950> just

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
one that's on the FM a maritime is just

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.060 
one that's on the FM a maritime is just
plastic<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.140> not<00:01:56.140> really<00:01:56.440> as<00:01:56.740> good<00:01:57.700> quality

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
plastic and not really as good quality

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700 
plastic and not really as good quality
but<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.280> main<00:02:00.430> thing<00:02:01.050> that's<00:02:02.050> important<00:02:02.590> is

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
but the main thing that's important is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.570 
but the main thing that's important is
the<00:02:02.979> strap<00:02:03.220> material<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.660> lot<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.979> lot<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
the strap material and a lot of a lot of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.699 
the strap material and a lot of a lot of

that<00:02:22.510> comes<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.050> FMA<00:02:23.410> maritime<00:02:23.830> as<00:02:24.610> you

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
that comes with the FMA maritime as you

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.420 
that comes with the FMA maritime as you
can<00:02:24.820> see<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.330> like<00:02:26.010> flimsy<00:02:27.010> feeling

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
can see it's really like flimsy feeling

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.699 
can see it's really like flimsy feeling
the<00:02:28.060> stitching<00:02:28.450> isn't<00:02:28.810> really<00:02:28.989> great<00:02:29.230> on<00:02:29.470> that

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
the stitching isn't really great on that

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.630 
the stitching isn't really great on that

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
what-have-you

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.070 
what-have-you
so<00:02:38.850> definitely<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.970> worthy<00:02:40.239> upgrade<00:02:40.450> I'm<00:02:40.930> gonna

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
so definitely a worthy upgrade I'm gonna

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.710 
so definitely a worthy upgrade I'm gonna
put<00:02:41.320> this<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.760> helmet<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.120> then<00:02:43.360> maybe

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
put this on the helmet and then maybe

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.670 
put this on the helmet and then maybe
update<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> video<00:02:44.910> I'll<00:02:45.910> just<00:02:45.970> decide<00:02:46.680> but

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
update the video I'll just decide but

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.320 
update the video I'll just decide but
I'm<00:02:48.160> thinking<00:02:48.430> maybe<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.730> should<00:02:48.940> have<00:02:49.030> got<00:02:49.150> any

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
I'm thinking maybe I should have got any

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.470 
I'm thinking maybe I should have got any
medium<00:02:49.630> large<00:02:49.840> as<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.230> seems<00:02:50.440> rather<00:02:50.799> tiny<00:02:51.480> but

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
medium large as it seems rather tiny but

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.030 
medium large as it seems rather tiny but
hopefully<00:02:52.780> it'll<00:02:52.900> work<00:02:53.049> out<00:02:53.200> since<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> FMA

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
hopefully it'll work out since the FMA

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.670 
hopefully it'll work out since the FMA
maritime<00:02:54.430> is<00:02:54.580> pretty<00:02:54.820> tiny<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.360> itself<00:02:55.780> so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
maritime is pretty tiny in itself so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.289
