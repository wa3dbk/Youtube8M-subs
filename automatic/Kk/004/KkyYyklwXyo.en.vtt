00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
delay unit that I just got last week and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.370 
delay unit that I just got last week and
I've<00:00:12.030> been<00:00:12.150> using<00:00:12.330> it<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.540> lot<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.080> several

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
I've been using it a lot on the several

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.039 
I've been using it a lot on the several
shows<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.799> played<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> past<00:00:14.460> week<00:00:14.929> it's<00:00:15.929> a

shows I played in the past week it's a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
shows I played in the past week it's a
great<00:00:16.320> delay<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.890> great<00:00:17.190> sounding<00:00:17.609> delay<00:00:17.880> great

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
great delay a great sounding delay great

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
great delay a great sounding delay great
sounding<00:00:18.570> long<00:00:18.840> delay<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.949> most

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
sounding long delay but the most

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.580 
sounding long delay but the most
exciting<00:00:20.520> thing<00:00:20.910> about<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.270> me<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.869> that

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
exciting thing about it for me is that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.790 
exciting thing about it for me is that
peak<00:00:23.580> tronics<00:00:24.180> followed<00:00:24.570> some<00:00:24.810> suggestions<00:00:25.619> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
peak tronics followed some suggestions I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
peak tronics followed some suggestions I
made<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.279> couple<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.670> years<00:00:26.849> ago<00:00:27.029> Dave<00:00:27.330> Cole<00:00:27.599> Ty

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
delay and I said please please put in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
times and I said please please please

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.709 
times and I said please please please
make<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:39.030> you're<00:00:39.180> doing<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> long

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
make it so that when you're doing a long

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.979 
make it so that when you're doing a long
backwards<00:00:40.290> delay<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.420> bypasses<00:00:42.420> by<00:00:42.570> muting

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
backwards delay it bypasses by muting

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
backwards delay it bypasses by muting
the<00:00:43.020> return<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> delay<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> sin<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the return from the delay not the sin so

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.970 
the return from the delay not the sin so
when<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> step<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> pedal<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.500> kick<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> in

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
when you step on the pedal to kick it in

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
when you step on the pedal to kick it in
what<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.309> played<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> few<00:00:47.879> seconds<00:00:48.270> ago<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:49.020> be

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
what you played a few seconds ago can be

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.600 
what you played a few seconds ago can be
there<00:00:49.440> backwards<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.460> great

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
there backwards so you can do great

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.389 
there backwards so you can do great
backwards<00:00:51.180> solos<00:00:51.510> live<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.160> nobody<00:00:53.160> else<00:00:53.340> has

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
backwards solos live and nobody else has

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.490 
backwards solos live and nobody else has
ever<00:00:53.670> taken<00:00:53.910> those<00:00:54.180> suggestions<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.960> he<00:00:55.140> did

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
ever taken those suggestions and he did

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
ever taken those suggestions and he did
and<00:00:55.920> he<00:00:56.340> made<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> pedal<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.480> really

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
and he made a pedal that I can really

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.049 
and he made a pedal that I can really
use<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:57.930> what<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> already<00:00:58.770> do

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
use for what I already do

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
use for what I already do
which<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.629> could<00:01:00.809> show<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> I'll<00:01:01.500> do<00:01:01.590> in

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
which I could show you and I'll do in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189 
which I could show you and I'll do in
another<00:01:01.890> video<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.600> he<00:01:03.600> added<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.930> bunch<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
another video but he added a bunch of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
another video but he added a bunch of
other<00:01:04.350> things<00:01:04.439> there's<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> cool<00:01:05.220> shimmery

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
other things there's a cool shimmery

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
other things there's a cool shimmery
effect<00:01:05.880> called<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.570> halo<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.350> octave<00:01:07.710> up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
effect called a halo with an octave up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
effect called a halo with an octave up
and<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> longer

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and I really like that with a longer

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.520 
and I really like that with a longer
delay<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.010> I'll<00:01:11.549> show<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.320> something<00:01:13.320> I've

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
delay and I'll show you something I've

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.260 
delay and I'll show you something I've
been<00:01:13.560> playing<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> past<00:01:14.490> week<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> at

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
been playing in the past week with it at

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.219 
been playing in the past week with it at
gigs<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.360> cool<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.869> really

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
gigs and it's really cool it's really

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.960
