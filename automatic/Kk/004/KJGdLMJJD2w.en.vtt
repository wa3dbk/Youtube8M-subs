00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
shower so this is just an experiment and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.050 
shower so this is just an experiment and
I<00:00:18.570> decided<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.500> do<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.770> video<00:00:19.949> while<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> was

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I decided to do this video while I was

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
I decided to do this video while I was
doing<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.869> experiment<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.890> question<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
doing this experiment a question that I

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.720 
doing this experiment a question that I
get<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.689> time<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.289> why<00:00:26.070> did<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.340> cut<00:00:26.580> my

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
get all the time is why did I cut my

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050 
get all the time is why did I cut my
hair<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.800> happened<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.400> something<00:00:29.580> happened

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
hair what happened is something happened

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.290 
hair what happened is something happened
to<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.300> hair<00:00:30.630> or<00:00:31.109> anything<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.550> no

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to my hair or anything like that and no

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150 
to my hair or anything like that and no
nothing<00:00:33.750> happened<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.200> my<00:00:34.320> hair<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.800> don't

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
nothing happened to my hair I don't

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.979 
nothing happened to my hair I don't
think<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.969> an<00:00:36.239> offensive<00:00:36.780> question

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
think that that is an offensive question

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.799 
think that that is an offensive question
because<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> reality<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.120> have<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> hair

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
because the reality is I have a hair

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.590 
because the reality is I have a hair
channel<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.489> am<00:00:41.730> doing<00:00:42.000> something<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.480> my

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
channel so if I am doing something to my

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
channel so if I am doing something to my
hair<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.079> think<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.739> only<00:00:44.370> normal<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
hair I think it is only normal that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
hair I think it is only normal that
people<00:00:45.899> would<00:00:46.260> want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> know<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:47.430> there's

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
people would want to know if there's

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670 
people would want to know if there's
something<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.969> I'm<00:00:48.180> doing<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.170> took<00:00:49.559> my

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
something that I'm doing that took my

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.040 
something that I'm doing that took my
hair<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.730> I'm<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.149> gonna<00:00:51.239> use<00:00:51.539> some<00:00:51.570> gel

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
hair out and I'm just gonna use some gel

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.209 
hair out and I'm just gonna use some gel
that<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.320> made<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> don't<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.129> that's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that I made so I don't think that that's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.860 
that I made so I don't think that that's
a<00:00:56.370> bad<00:00:56.550> question<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.600> people

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a bad question I get a lot of people

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.529 
a bad question I get a lot of people
asking<00:00:58.260> me<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.530> question<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.760> feel

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
asking me that question and they feel

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.380 
asking me that question and they feel
almost<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.559> shouldn't<00:01:02.010> ask<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.730> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
almost as if they shouldn't ask and I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.640 
almost as if they shouldn't ask and I
don't<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:03.989> there's<00:01:04.140> anything<00:01:04.350> wrong<00:01:04.589> with

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
don't think there's anything wrong with

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.830 
don't think there's anything wrong with
it<00:01:04.860> at<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.369> mind<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.390> anyone

asking me that I cut my hair in April of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.770 
asking me that I cut my hair in April of
2014<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.280> got<00:01:15.000> pretty<00:01:15.150> bored<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:15.600> my

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
2014 because I got pretty bored with my

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.249 
2014 because I got pretty bored with my
hair<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.560> hair<00:01:16.590> routine<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> same

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hair my hair routine is just the same

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990 
hair my hair routine is just the same
all<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.560> time<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> wear<00:01:20.040> wash<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> gos<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
all the time I wear wash and gos all the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
all the time I wear wash and gos all the
time<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:22.140> hair<00:01:22.350> was<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.799> getting

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
time so my hair was kind of getting

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.640 
time so my hair was kind of getting
boring<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.939> me<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> stylist<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.470> don't

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
boring to me and as a stylist I don't

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
boring to me and as a stylist I don't
think<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.939> should<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.750> hair<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
think that you should just have hair but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.710 
think that you should just have hair but
it<00:01:28.740> should<00:01:28.950> actually<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.549> interesting<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it should actually be interesting and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.120 
it should actually be interesting and
that's<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> way<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> feel<00:01:31.650> it's<00:01:31.860> not<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's just the way I feel it's not to

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
that's just the way I feel it's not to
say<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.579> someone<00:01:32.880> has<00:01:33.060> longer<00:01:33.390> hair<00:01:33.540> that

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
say that if someone has longer hair that

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.230 
say that if someone has longer hair that
it's<00:01:34.590> not<00:01:34.740> interesting<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.790> wasn't<00:01:36.060> doing

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it's not interesting but I wasn't doing

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.109 
it's not interesting but I wasn't doing
anything<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.020> hair<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.829> my<00:01:38.670> hair

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
anything with my hair really so my hair

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
anything with my hair really so my hair
was<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.360> interesting<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.079> me<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
was not interesting to me and so I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670 
was not interesting to me and so I

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
questions being asked at all because

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.950 
questions being asked at all because
like<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> said<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:09.760> is<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:09.970> hair<00:03:10.240> channel<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:10.780> if

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
like I said this is a hair channel so if

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.550 
like I said this is a hair channel so if
something<00:03:11.290> happened<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:11.680> my<00:03:11.830> hair<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:13.560> like

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
something happened to my hair and like

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.110 
something happened to my hair and like
maybe<00:03:14.800> something<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.220> made<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.580> break<00:03:15.760> off<00:03:15.910> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
maybe something that made it break off I

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.940 
maybe something that made it break off I
think<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.510> would<00:03:16.840> definitely<00:03:17.620> owe<00:03:17.650> it<00:03:17.920> to
