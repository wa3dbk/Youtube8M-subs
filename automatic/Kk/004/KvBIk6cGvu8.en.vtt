00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.870 
not going to work all right let's see
what's<00:02:18.710> going<00:02:18.890> on<00:02:19.130> here<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.430> don't<00:02:19.550> think<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
what's going on here I don't think the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.340 
what's going on here I don't think the
wind<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> break<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:20.990> there<00:02:21.230> as

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
wind is going to break this one there as

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
wind is going to break this one there as
easy<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:21.890> did<00:02:22.010> together

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.100 

looks<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.270> we're<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.810> flashlight

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
looks like we're get that flashlight

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.600 
looks like we're get that flashlight
beam<00:02:27.530> out<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.860> there<00:02:28.010> looks<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.400> we're

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
beam out of there looks like we're

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.930 
beam out of there looks like we're
sitting<00:02:28.940> right<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.150> four<00:02:30.080> inches<00:02:30.290> there<00:02:30.940> let's

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
sitting right at four inches there let's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.500 
sitting right at four inches there let's
take<00:02:32.090> another<00:02:32.210> measurement<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:33.020> here<00:02:34.510> because

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
take another measurement on here because

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.210 
take another measurement on here because
I<00:02:35.600> know<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.900> elevation<00:02:36.500> changes<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.040> little

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
I know the elevation changes a little

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.330 
I know the elevation changes a little
bit<00:02:37.690> I'm<00:02:38.690> doing<00:02:38.930> what<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.080> can<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.590> protect<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
bit I'm doing what I can to protect the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.650 
bit I'm doing what I can to protect the
mic<00:02:40.520> on<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.760> camera<00:02:41.240> for<00:02:41.270> getting<00:02:43.480> but<00:02:44.480> that's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
mic on the camera for getting but that's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.170 
mic on the camera for getting but that's
not<00:02:44.840> really<00:02:45.110> working<00:02:45.700> all<00:02:46.700> right<00:02:46.760> let's<00:02:47.030> try

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
not really working all right let's try

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.849 
not really working all right let's try
this<00:02:47.240> see<00:02:47.990> out<00:02:48.170> here

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
this see out here

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.119 
this see out here
not<00:02:50.859> three<00:02:51.189> inches<00:02:51.579> there<00:02:52.409> so<00:02:53.409> between<00:02:53.829> three

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
not three inches there so between three

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.970 
not three inches there so between three
and<00:02:54.159> four<00:02:54.459> inches<00:02:54.819> so<00:02:55.030> far<00:02:55.060> which<00:02:55.540> means<00:02:55.980> that

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and four inches so far which means that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.559 
and four inches so far which means that
if<00:02:57.069> we're<00:02:57.219> somehow<00:02:57.670> going<00:02:57.969> to<00:02:58.090> get<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> foot<00:02:58.480> of

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
if we're somehow going to get a foot of

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.739 
if we're somehow going to get a foot of
snow<00:02:58.599> here<00:02:59.069> it's<00:03:00.069> got<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> lot<00:03:00.939> of<00:03:00.969> work<00:03:01.359> to<00:03:01.569> do

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:01.749 
snow here it's got a lot of work to do

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.759
