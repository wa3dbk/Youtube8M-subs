00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.290
 hello you love here in berlin and 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.180
 herbs's again what the 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.580
 Taste buds I want you today 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.439
 namely introduce the cornus and 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.570
 Cornus is like the name 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.029
 already says a church similar fruit 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 I think hardly any of you know 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.739
 but that is really delicious and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.989
 Right now where this tree is fruit season 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.550
 I also think very important 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.559
 that she just gets to know each other 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.230
 have tried and times also dekker now 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.820
 I show you first great awesome 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.859
 big tree in front of which I confess 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.420
 know do not win as big as also 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.039
 not then from filderstadt and also 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.449
 not from and friesland but here 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.789
 a really big tree changes and 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.269
 I'll show you this whole whole 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.379
 to build 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:56.879
 The red fruit is full of cherries 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.879
 pure cherries 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.770
 yes a giant tree all you from 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.770
 both really look like one 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.159
 I think you think if I'm like 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.850
 never against cherry tree that one 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.250
 fruits from picking from the tree 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.350
 But special about this tree is and 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.759
 this fruit that the fruits on the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.590
 tree grow can not meet 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.450
 because the fruits taste but you 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.250
 can eat the fruits that really 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.800
 the fall alone speaks of the tree 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.530
 harvest is serious you only need that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.180
 lies down or if you have the tree 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.330
 shake and some falls down and 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 but please lift it but you have to light 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.720
 fall down alone from the shake so 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.340
 as with Frau holland only from shaking 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.619
 You must not pick them down 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.360
 and then they are also pretty correct 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.890
 be soft and now I say now 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.399
 Look again for the bottom I stand here 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.170
 falls in the middle of corn cherries and then 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.030
 Lets ever lie down being the soft one 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.050
 have to like the difference and shows 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.319
 indeed that you can be wrong the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.640
 So ding also believes again 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:02.170
 Read these red spots up here 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.110
 Count down here over old and so on 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.280
 all the cherries they travel over 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.989
 a dear if I already have 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.920
 a little bit made up and 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.220
 really fast but one more 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.390
 So wm-travel so the tree moment so 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.870
 you could think now 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 This deep red fruit would be the one 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.560
 almost as good 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.459
 so almost immediately from this fruit of 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.379
 tree picked 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.579
 So they are really shiny 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.840
 but no relax that they are 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.329
 simply made by nature so 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.560
 but are still a bit hard and 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.750
 these are down here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.549
 they are really so white if so 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.659
 I am here now against that is right 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:46.219
 That's right , I was so right and so 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.980
 they are really sweet and they taste good 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:51.019
 also really delicious as we still from 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.870
 Baumann also looks colorful and it is 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.989
 not quite as dark red does not taste 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.340
 she is right and right 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.230
 unpleasant in taste you can tell 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.669
 of course to show that one this 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.200
 I just want to eat now 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.639
 eat so I am often asked 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.959
 I should show how to get the group 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:13.750
 So not every fruit so just in 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.750
 The mouth and chews around the core 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.930
 the heart of it 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 and is good and today as I said 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.660
 that is not possible at all 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.959
 because everything is down to eat 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.340
 who the kids really love them 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.489
 nutritious is really full of 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.040
 b vitamins cd chimneys and it easy 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.400
 really a very interesting wild 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.110
 growing closer with this video 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.910

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.840
