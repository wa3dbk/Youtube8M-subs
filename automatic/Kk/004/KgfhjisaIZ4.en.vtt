00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
half of that unit maybe I can get in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
half of that unit maybe I can get in
there<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.210> see<00:00:36.420> what's<00:00:36.570> going<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:42.079> make<00:00:43.079> sure

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
if it was hooked up the motor would do

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.440 
if it was hooked up the motor would do
the<00:01:39.510> job<00:01:39.540> now<00:01:40.580> just<00:01:41.580> tricky<00:01:41.880> parts<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.390> be

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
I mean the motor was no good was it well

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.670 
I mean the motor was no good was it well
I<00:03:41.400> had<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.700> file<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.330> there<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.600> one<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:43.170> don't

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
I had to file like there was one I don't

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.830 
I had to file like there was one I don't
know<00:03:43.770> what<00:03:43.920> part<00:03:44.220> contacts<00:03:44.910> those<00:03:45.569> little

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
know what part contacts those little

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.460 
know what part contacts those little
copper<00:03:46.680> space<00:03:46.920> things<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> contacts<00:03:47.880> hit

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
copper space things the contacts hit

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.900 
copper space things the contacts hit
like<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.560> was<00:03:49.650> one<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.920> them<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.160> was<00:03:50.250> black

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
like it was one of them it was black

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.199 
like it was one of them it was black
I<00:03:50.940> took<00:03:51.600> sandpaper<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.850> we<00:03:53.850> end<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.090> getting

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
I took sandpaper to it we end up getting

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.020 
I took sandpaper to it we end up getting
this<00:03:54.390> used<00:03:54.660> piece<00:03:54.959> but<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.590> can't<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.280> put<00:03:56.940> the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
this used piece but I can't just put the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.949 
this used piece but I can't just put the
whole<00:03:57.180> unity<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:57.870> because<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.700> firm<00:04:00.600> we<00:04:00.780> have

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
whole unity and because the firm we have

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.020 
whole unity and because the firm we have
is<00:04:01.140> she<00:04:01.260> sees<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.709> shaft<00:04:01.980> long<00:04:02.730> enough<00:04:02.940> to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
is she sees the shaft long enough to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
is she sees the shaft long enough to
take<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:04.820> motor<00:04:05.820> part<00:04:06.150> out<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.500> contacts

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
take the motor part out and the contacts

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.170 
take the motor part out and the contacts
just<00:04:08.880> switch<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.300> part<00:04:10.640> autumn<00:04:11.640> ass
