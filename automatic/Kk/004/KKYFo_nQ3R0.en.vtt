00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
first one but obviously this evasion has

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.730 
first one but obviously this evasion has
been<00:01:16.300> going<00:01:16.540> on<00:01:16.630> for<00:01:16.690> quite<00:01:16.840> some<00:01:17.350> time<00:01:17.380> and

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
been going on for quite some time and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.590 
been going on for quite some time and
earth<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.520> not<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.940> greatest<00:01:19.120> state<00:01:19.450> you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
earth is not in the greatest state you

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.330 
earth is not in the greatest state you
could<00:01:19.750> tell<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.080> by<00:01:20.590> looking<00:01:20.620> into<00:01:21.130> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
could tell that by looking into the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.710 
could tell that by looking into the
levels<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.700> you're<00:01:21.880> visiting<00:01:22.150> like

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720

visiting New York the forest areas and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.480 
visiting New York the forest areas and
so<00:01:25.300> much<00:01:25.510> more<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:26.290> level<00:01:26.560> design<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.920> great

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
so much more the level design is great

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.250 
so much more the level design is great

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.230 
and of course the animations are really
smooth<00:01:29.590> and<00:01:29.740> slick<00:01:30.100> or<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.700> don't<00:01:30.850> see<00:01:31.030> any

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
smooth and slick or you don't see any

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.970 
smooth and slick or you don't see any
animation<00:01:31.750> errors<00:01:32.050> or<00:01:32.170> anything<00:01:32.470> even<00:01:32.830> when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
animation errors or anything even when

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.110

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you're playing in the campaign the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.200 
you're playing in the campaign the
towers<00:02:56.710> are<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.430> new<00:02:57.670> towers<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.090> going

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
towers are you know new towers are going

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.880 
towers are you know new towers are going
to<00:02:58.270> be<00:02:58.390> repairing<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.170> strategy<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.800> terms

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
to be repairing so the strategy in terms

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.740 
to be repairing so the strategy in terms
of<00:03:00.100> what's<00:03:00.310> taking<00:03:00.460> place<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:01.090> always<00:03:01.570> going

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
of what's taking place is always going

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.120 
of what's taking place is always going
to<00:03:01.840> keep<00:03:02.020> changing<00:03:02.230> as<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.740> playing<00:03:02.860> in

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
to keep changing as you're playing in

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.620 
to keep changing as you're playing in
the<00:03:03.220> campaign<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.090> you're<00:03:04.240> always<00:03:04.360> going<00:03:04.570> to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the campaign so you're always going to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.300 
the campaign so you're always going to
be<00:03:04.660> maneuvering<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.410> units<00:03:05.740> rent<00:03:05.980> different

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
be maneuvering your units rent different

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.220 
be maneuvering your units rent different
pathway<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.210> if<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.390> like<00:03:07.600> for<00:03:07.780> example<00:03:07.870> if

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
pathway so if you like for example if

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.450 
pathway so if you like for example if
you<00:03:08.290> want<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> take<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.650> different<00:03:08.860> pathway<00:03:09.190> to

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
you want to take a different pathway to

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.100 
you want to take a different pathway to
where<00:03:09.880> you're<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.150> facing<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.660> many<00:03:10.720> towers

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
where you're not facing so many towers

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.140 
where you're not facing so many towers
so<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.500> don't<00:03:11.650> suffer<00:03:12.010> from<00:03:12.130> losing<00:03:12.610> units<00:03:12.970> or

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
so you don't suffer from losing units or

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.640 
so you don't suffer from losing units or
maybe<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:13.780> want<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:14.020> take<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> special

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
maybe you want to take the special

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.200 
maybe you want to take the special
pathway<00:03:14.830> which<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.490> be<00:03:15.550> risky<00:03:16.030> but

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
pathway which is going to be risky but

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.940 
pathway which is going to be risky but
at<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.510> end<00:03:16.540> you're<00:03:17.350> going<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.680> some<00:03:17.830> more

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
at the end you're going to get some more

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.620 
at the end you're going to get some more
currency<00:03:18.310> which<00:03:18.880> you<00:03:19.000> could<00:03:19.150> use<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.480> build

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
currency which you could use to build

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.890 
currency which you could use to build
more<00:03:19.930> units<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.500> so<00:03:20.770> forth<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> said

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
more units and so forth now like I said

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.480 
more units and so forth now like I said
the<00:03:23.170> main<00:03:23.320> unit<00:03:23.650> you're<00:03:23.770> controlling<00:03:24.160> around

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
the main unit you're controlling around

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.310 
the main unit you're controlling around
is<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.760> commander<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.690> commander<00:03:26.140> has

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
is the commander the commander has

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.630 
is the commander the commander has
different<00:03:26.800> abilities<00:03:26.890> so<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.550> example

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
different abilities so for example

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.760 
different abilities so for example
repair<00:03:28.360> what<00:03:28.720> repair<00:03:29.080> does<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.650> you're

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
repair what repair does is that you're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.190 
repair what repair does is that you're
able<00:03:29.890> to<00:03:30.130> repair<00:03:30.490> your<00:03:30.520> units<00:03:31.090> decoy<00:03:31.840> which<00:03:32.050> is

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
able to repair your units decoy which is

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.280 
able to repair your units decoy which is
one<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> my<00:03:32.560> personal<00:03:32.920> favorite<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.750> terms<00:03:34.990> of

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
one of my personal favorite in terms of

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.990 
one of my personal favorite in terms of
elements<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.130> you're<00:03:36.310> able<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.580> use<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
elements that you're able to use the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.180 
elements that you're able to use the
fact<00:03:37.240> now<00:03:37.450> for<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.780> decoy<00:03:38.200> what<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:38.860> do<00:03:39.070> is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
fact now for the decoy what you do is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.190 
fact now for the decoy what you do is
that<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.400> set<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> decoy<00:03:40.270> it<00:03:40.570> often<00:03:40.990> to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that you set the decoy it often to

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.320 
that you set the decoy it often to
pretty<00:03:41.680> much<00:03:41.800> in<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.160> distance<00:03:42.790> because<00:03:43.180> they

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
pretty much in a distance because they

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.970 
pretty much in a distance because they
have<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.480> really<00:03:43.870> good<00:03:43.990> radius<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.560> terms<00:03:44.770> of

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
have a really good radius in terms of

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.280 
have a really good radius in terms of
the<00:03:45.130> decoy<00:03:45.520> section<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.330> what<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.110> do<00:03:47.260> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
the decoy section and what you do is

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.990 
the decoy section and what you do is
that<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.560> place<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.040> there<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.460> the<00:03:48.640> enemy

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
that you place it there and the enemy

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.580 
that you place it there and the enemy
towers<00:03:49.180> are<00:03:49.480> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.720> focus<00:03:49.870> fire<00:03:50.260> on<00:03:50.290> that

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
towers are going to focus fire on that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.100 
towers are going to focus fire on that
decoy<00:03:51.070> until<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> decoys<00:03:52.240> destroyed<00:03:52.660> or<00:03:52.990> the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
decoy until the decoys destroyed or the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.810 
decoy until the decoys destroyed or the
time<00:03:53.320> fitting<00:03:53.560> runs<00:03:53.770> out<00:03:53.980> which<00:03:54.400> gives<00:03:54.670> you

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
time fitting runs out which gives you

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.940 
time fitting runs out which gives you
unique<00:03:55.210> advantage<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:56.110> your<00:03:56.230> units<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.770> take

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
unique advantage for your units to take

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.380 
unique advantage for your units to take
out<00:03:57.130> those<00:03:57.250> towers<00:03:57.670> before<00:03:58.090> they<00:03:58.180> come<00:03:58.360> back

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
out those towers before they come back

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
able that use an EMP ability which

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.430 
able that use an EMP ability which
disables<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.240> enemy<00:04:04.600> towers<00:04:04.810> for<00:04:05.140> short

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
disables the enemy towers for short

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.590 
disables the enemy towers for short
radius<00:04:05.740> giving<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> unique<00:04:06.670> advantage<00:04:07.150> to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
take up the towers before they come back

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.070 
take up the towers before they come back

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
of the best at this game now in terms of

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.860 
of the best at this game now in terms of
the<00:06:15.310> multipliers<00:06:15.880> I<00:06:16.090> didn't<00:06:16.270> really<00:06:16.390> cover<00:06:16.660> it

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
the multipliers I didn't really cover it

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.870 
the multipliers I didn't really cover it
yet<00:06:17.050> is<00:06:17.200> one<00:06:18.130> side<00:06:18.370> as<00:06:18.520> plain<00:06:18.700> as<00:06:18.730> the

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
yet is one side as plain as the

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.400 
yet is one side as plain as the
commander<00:06:19.330> unit<00:06:19.660> like<00:06:19.810> you've<00:06:19.960> played<00:06:20.170> in<00:06:20.200> the

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
commander unit like you've played in the

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.260 
commander unit like you've played in the
single-player<00:06:20.830> campaign<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.850> only<00:06:22.090> other

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
single-player campaign the only other

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.550 
single-player campaign the only other
difference<00:06:22.600> is<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:23.020> you're<00:06:23.230> going<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.410> be

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
difference is that you're going to be

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.220 
difference is that you're going to be
facing<00:06:23.740> off<00:06:24.040> against<00:06:24.550> another<00:06:24.870> online<00:06:25.870> player

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:26.230 
facing off against another online player

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.600 
facing off against another online player
and<00:06:26.500> that<00:06:26.530> player<00:06:26.650> is<00:06:26.890> going<00:06:27.160> to<00:06:27.250> be<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.460> one

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
and that player is going to be the one

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.850 
and that player is going to be the one
building<00:06:27.970> towers<00:06:28.390> or<00:06:28.600> vice<00:06:29.050> versa<00:06:29.410> you<00:06:29.710> could

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
building towers or vice versa you could

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.350 
building towers or vice versa you could
be<00:06:29.980> the<00:06:30.100> one<00:06:30.130> building<00:06:30.640> towers<00:06:31.030> just<00:06:31.240> like

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
be the one building towers just like

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.270 
be the one building towers just like
you've<00:06:31.510> seen<00:06:31.720> in<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:31.930> campaign<00:06:32.320> to<00:06:32.770> stop<00:06:32.830> the

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
you've seen in the campaign to stop the

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.430 
you've seen in the campaign to stop the
enemy<00:06:33.430> reinforcements<00:06:34.300> and<00:06:34.420> so<00:06:34.630> forth<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.320> it

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
enemy reinforcements and so forth so it

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.770 
enemy reinforcements and so forth so it
has<00:06:35.590> a<00:06:35.670> nice<00:06:36.670> competitive<00:06:37.300> side<00:06:37.510> of<00:06:37.630> things

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
has a nice competitive side of things

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.780 
has a nice competitive side of things
and<00:06:38.080> it's<00:06:38.410> really<00:06:38.680> cool<00:06:38.830> one<00:06:39.010> as<00:06:39.160> well<00:06:39.370> like<00:06:39.640> I

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
and it's really cool one as well like I

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.490 
and it's really cool one as well like I
said<00:06:39.850> the<00:06:40.120> main<00:06:40.300> reason<00:06:40.690> I<00:06:40.840> think<00:06:41.140> people<00:06:41.320> are

ahead and talk by the innovative did
they<00:06:51.640> bring<00:06:51.790> anything<00:06:52.120> new<00:06:52.300> to<00:06:52.480> the<00:06:52.720> table<00:06:52.900> or

they bring anything new to the table or

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.810 
they bring anything new to the table or
is<00:06:53.350> it<00:06:53.470> just<00:06:53.590> a<00:06:53.740> copy<00:06:54.010> and<00:06:54.280> paste<00:06:54.490> from<00:06:54.670> the

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
is it just a copy and paste from the

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.610 
is it just a copy and paste from the
original<00:06:55.240> like<00:06:55.450> I<00:06:55.600> said<00:06:55.660> I<00:06:55.840> never<00:06:55.990> played<00:06:56.470> the

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:56.620 
original like I said I never played the

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.500 
original like I said I never played the
original<00:06:56.710> so<00:06:57.220> I<00:06:57.250> can't<00:06:57.580> really<00:06:57.760> compare<00:06:58.300> in

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
original so I can't really compare in

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.450 
original so I can't really compare in
terms<00:06:58.570> of<00:06:59.230> the<00:06:59.410> the<00:06:59.440> first<00:06:59.920> one<00:07:00.220> but<00:07:00.400> the

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
terms of the the first one but the

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.820 
terms of the the first one but the
second<00:07:00.910> one<00:07:01.030> but<00:07:01.210> what<00:07:01.420> i<00:07:01.450> can<00:07:01.750> do<00:07:02.020> is<00:07:02.170> compare

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
second one but what i can do is compare

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.830 
second one but what i can do is compare
from<00:07:03.040> the<00:07:03.250> other<00:07:03.430> tower<00:07:03.910> defense<00:07:04.330> dog<00:07:04.540> games

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
from the other tower defense dog games

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.540 
from the other tower defense dog games
that<00:07:05.050> played<00:07:05.260> in<00:07:05.380> the<00:07:05.440> past<00:07:05.710> but<00:07:06.220> once<00:07:06.430> i

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
that played in the past but once i

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.100 
that played in the past but once i
played<00:07:06.790> in<00:07:06.940> the<00:07:07.030> past<00:07:07.270> never<00:07:07.570> really<00:07:07.930> had<00:07:08.080> a

played in the past never really had a

played in the past never really had a
story<00:07:08.470> all<00:07:08.710> you<00:07:08.830> did<00:07:09.010> was<00:07:09.040> build<00:07:09.460> towers<00:07:09.730> you

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:10.480 
story all you did was build towers you

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.660 
story all you did was build towers you
defend<00:07:10.900> against<00:07:11.410> enemy<00:07:11.710> units<00:07:12.160> and<00:07:12.340> didn't<00:07:12.580> he

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
defend against enemy units and didn't he

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.999 
defend against enemy units and didn't he
get

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.009 
get

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:14.679 
get
to<00:07:13.339> build<00:07:13.550> more<00:07:13.729> towers<00:07:13.999> and<00:07:14.360> I<00:07:14.419> was<00:07:14.539> pretty

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:14.689 
to build more towers and I was pretty

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:16.779 
to build more towers and I was pretty
much<00:07:14.749> the<00:07:14.869> basic<00:07:15.139> that<00:07:15.529> I<00:07:15.589> knew<00:07:15.979> of<00:07:16.009> x<00:07:16.610> in<00:07:16.669> terms

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
much the basic that I knew of x in terms

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.700 
much the basic that I knew of x in terms
of<00:07:16.999> this<00:07:17.180> one<00:07:17.389> having<00:07:17.719> a<00:07:17.779> whole<00:07:17.990> campaign<00:07:18.469> a

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
of this one having a whole campaign a

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.709 
of this one having a whole campaign a
whole<00:07:19.129> new<00:07:19.279> strategy<00:07:19.759> evolved<00:07:20.150> and<00:07:20.270> so<00:07:20.419> forth

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:20.719 
whole new strategy evolved and so forth

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:22.149 
whole new strategy evolved and so forth
I<00:07:20.839> thought<00:07:21.050> it<00:07:21.139> was<00:07:21.199> pretty<00:07:21.379> cool<00:07:21.649> a<00:07:21.710> unique

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:22.159 
I thought it was pretty cool a unique

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:24.129 
I thought it was pretty cool a unique
one<00:07:22.399> that<00:07:22.580> never<00:07:22.729> seen<00:07:23.059> before<00:07:23.210> and<00:07:23.659> to<00:07:24.020> be

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:24.139 
one that never seen before and to be

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:25.929 
one that never seen before and to be
honest<00:07:24.469> I<00:07:24.589> can't<00:07:24.800> really<00:07:24.949> name<00:07:25.279> any<00:07:25.580> tower

00:07:25.929 --> 00:07:25.939 
honest I can't really name any tower

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:28.089 
honest I can't really name any tower
defense<00:07:26.300> style<00:07:26.539> games<00:07:26.839> that<00:07:27.080> has<00:07:27.199> a<00:07:27.229> story<00:07:27.589> or

defense style games that has a story or
even<00:07:28.339> a<00:07:28.399> structure<00:07:28.789> similar<00:07:28.819> to<00:07:29.240> this<00:07:29.509> one<00:07:29.749> in

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
even a structure similar to this one in

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.109 
even a structure similar to this one in
my<00:07:30.139> opinion<00:07:30.319> so<00:07:30.770> I<00:07:30.800> think<00:07:30.949> this<00:07:31.219> is<00:07:31.339> a<00:07:31.369> first<00:07:31.699> /

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:32.119 
my opinion so I think this is a first /

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:34.119 
my opinion so I think this is a first /
sky<00:07:32.479> but<00:07:32.960> I<00:07:33.020> said<00:07:33.229> I<00:07:33.259> can't<00:07:33.499> really<00:07:33.619> name<00:07:33.919> many

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:34.129 
sky but I said I can't really name many

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:36.159 
sky but I said I can't really name many
but<00:07:34.520> for<00:07:34.789> what<00:07:35.089> this<00:07:35.300> game<00:07:35.479> is<00:07:35.509> supposed<00:07:35.719> to<00:07:35.990> be

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
but for what this game is supposed to be
