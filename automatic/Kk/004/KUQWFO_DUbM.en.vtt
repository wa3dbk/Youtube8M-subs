00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
so when we want the blue mold to grow it

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.969 
so when we want the blue mold to grow it
it's<00:01:52.280> got<00:01:52.459> an<00:01:52.759> area<00:01:53.209> to<00:01:53.390> grow<00:01:53.539> the<00:01:54.020> cheese<00:01:54.289> will

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
it's got an area to grow the cheese will

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.740 
it's got an area to grow the cheese will
sit<00:01:55.160> in<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.340> mold<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:55.819> about<00:01:56.000> 4<00:01:56.239> days<00:01:56.450> and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
sit in the mold for about 4 days and

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.990 
sit in the mold for about 4 days and
then<00:01:57.170> they're<00:01:57.619> ready<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:58.009> be<00:01:58.310> rubbed<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.789> and

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
then they're ready to be rubbed up and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.820 
then they're ready to be rubbed up and
rubbing<00:01:59.630> up<00:01:59.750> is<00:01:59.899> unique<00:02:00.229> again<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.739> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
rubbing up is unique again in the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.160 
rubbing up is unique again in the
Stilton<00:02:01.190> industry<00:02:01.700> we<00:02:01.970> smooth<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.330> coat<00:02:02.690> over

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
Stilton industry we smooth the coat over

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.339 
Stilton industry we smooth the coat over
it<00:02:03.380> stops<00:02:04.039> the<00:02:04.250> blue<00:02:04.429> growing<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.479> then<00:02:05.929> gives

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
it stops the blue growing and then gives

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.979 
it stops the blue growing and then gives
it<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.560> lovely<00:02:06.830> coat<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:08.390> cheese<00:02:08.660> will

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
it a lovely coat the cheese will

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.050 
it a lovely coat the cheese will
condition<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.770> mature<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.610> next<00:02:10.849> 5

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.990 

so<00:02:23.290> how<00:02:23.440> does<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.709> blue<00:02:23.920> mold<00:02:24.190> get<00:02:24.519> into<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
so how does the blue mold get into the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030 
so how does the blue mold get into the
cheese<00:02:25.269> at<00:02:25.900> five<00:02:26.200> weeks<00:02:26.470> old

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
cheese at five weeks old

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.070 
cheese at five weeks old
once<00:02:27.310> we<00:02:27.459> pierce<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.000> cheese<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:28.480> introduce

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
once we pierce the cheese we introduce

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
once we pierce the cheese we introduce
air<00:02:29.349> inside<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.190> cheese<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.360> blue<00:02:31.599> mold

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
air inside the cheese and that blue mold

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.110 
air inside the cheese and that blue mold
will<00:02:32.080> start<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.470> grow<00:02:32.650> slowly<00:02:33.250> over<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:33.849> next

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
will start to grow slowly over the next

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.630 
will start to grow slowly over the next
three<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.510> four<00:02:34.659> weeks<00:02:34.950> takes<00:02:35.950> five<00:02:36.250> or<00:02:36.430> six

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
three or four weeks takes five or six

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.399 
three or four weeks takes five or six
weeks<00:02:36.819> old<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.480> it<00:02:37.599> ready<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.900> eat<00:02:38.019> now

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
weeks old is it is it ready to eat now

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.440 
weeks old is it is it ready to eat now
not<00:02:38.769> ready<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.159> be<00:02:39.250> quite<00:02:39.549> yet<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.329> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
not ready to be quite yet but the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.050 
not ready to be quite yet but the
texture<00:02:40.840> at<00:02:40.930> this<00:02:41.079> point<00:02:41.379> it's<00:02:41.530> quite<00:02:41.709> grainy

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
texture at this point it's quite grainy

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.250 
texture at this point it's quite grainy
flavor<00:02:43.060> will<00:02:43.239> be<00:02:43.329> quite<00:02:43.510> sharp<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:43.989> bitter

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
flavor will be quite sharp and bitter

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.960 
flavor will be quite sharp and bitter
what<00:02:44.709> will<00:02:44.829> happen<00:02:45.099> over<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.370> next<00:02:45.549> couple<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
what will happen over the next couple of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.460 
what will happen over the next couple of
weeks<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.569> flavor<00:02:46.870> will<00:02:47.140> mellow<00:02:47.379> out

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
weeks is that the flavor will mellow out

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.319 
weeks is that the flavor will mellow out
and<00:02:47.950> then<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.459> cheese<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.879> ready<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.209> be

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
and then the cheese is ready to be

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.230 
and then the cheese is ready to be
graded

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.000 

so<00:02:54.240> what's<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.780> difference<00:02:54.900> between<00:02:55.200> eight

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
so what's the difference between eight

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
so what's the difference between eight
weeks<00:02:56.280> old<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.730> 12<00:02:57.120> weeks<00:02:57.360> old<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:58.260> cheese<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
weeks old and 12 weeks old the cheese is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.400 
weeks old and 12 weeks old the cheese is
kept<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.060> koala<00:03:00.270> low<00:03:00.420> temperature<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.320> will

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
kept a koala low temperature so it will

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620 
kept a koala low temperature so it will
stuff<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.830> will<00:03:02.010> mature<00:03:02.190> quite<00:03:02.700> slowly<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
stuff it will mature quite slowly so the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.080 
stuff it will mature quite slowly so the
flavor<00:03:03.960> will<00:03:04.890> develop<00:03:05.340> but<00:03:05.520> quite<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> slow

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
flavor will develop but quite a slow

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.700 
flavor will develop but quite a slow
rate<00:03:06.360> over<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.690> sort<00:03:07.020> of<00:03:07.050> four-week<00:03:07.470> period

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
rate over that sort of four-week period

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.800 
rate over that sort of four-week period
so<00:03:08.580> it'll<00:03:08.730> go<00:03:08.880> from<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> fairly<00:03:09.570> sort<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
so it'll go from that fairly sort of

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.200 
so it'll go from that fairly sort of
bitter<00:03:09.990> flavor<00:03:10.380> bit<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.220> grainy<00:03:11.460> texture<00:03:11.970> to

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
bitter flavor bit of a grainy texture to

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.130 
bitter flavor bit of a grainy texture to
a<00:03:12.300> much<00:03:12.570> more<00:03:12.780> mellow<00:03:13.820> smooth<00:03:14.820> sort<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:15.690> silky

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
a much more mellow smooth sort of silky

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.350 
a much more mellow smooth sort of silky
texture<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.860> mouth<00:03:17.180> Stilton<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
texture in the mouth Stilton is a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.090 
texture in the mouth Stilton is a
relatively<00:03:18.930> young<00:03:19.050> cheese<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.800> at<00:03:19.860> three

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
relatively young cheese and at three

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.870 
relatively young cheese and at three
months<00:03:20.430> old

months old

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.420 
months old
it's<00:03:21.270> about<00:03:21.510> perfect<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.170> be<00:03:22.290> eaten<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.220> that's
