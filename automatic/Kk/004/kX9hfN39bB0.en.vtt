left corner I'll actually fold it in

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.230 
left corner I'll actually fold it in
half<00:00:10.139> first<00:00:10.650> from<00:00:11.099> left<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.090> that

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
half first from left to right so that

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.570 
half first from left to right so that
way<00:00:12.420> you've<00:00:12.599> got<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:13.370> middle<00:00:14.370> line<00:00:14.809> to<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:15.960> on

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.660 

I'm<00:00:20.580> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> unfold<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.340> we<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.550> that

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
I'm going to unfold it and we want that

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.679 
I'm going to unfold it and we want that
line<00:00:24.410> vertical<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.830> down<00:00:26.269> now<00:00:27.269> take<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
line vertical up and down now take the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.849 
line vertical up and down now take the
left<00:00:28.140> hand<00:00:28.439> side<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:30.199> make<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.410> come<00:00:31.650> in

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
left hand side and make it come in

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.970 
left hand side and make it come in
towards<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.669> center<00:00:33.090> line<00:00:33.710> it's<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.920> to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
towards that center line it's going to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
towards that center line it's going to
look<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.370> kite<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.510> called<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
look like a kite this is called a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.450 
look like a kite this is called a
typeface<00:00:39.620> okay<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.920> we're<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.309> do

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
typeface okay and then we're going to do

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.139 
typeface okay and then we're going to do
symmetrically<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.450> same<00:00:42.660> thing<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:44.149> right

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
symmetrically the same thing over right

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.860 
symmetrically the same thing over right
corner<00:00:45.770> towards<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> center<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.940> that's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
corner towards the center and that's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
corner towards the center and that's
your<00:00:49.110> kite<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:50.280> now<00:00:50.610> we're<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> flip<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210

over and make sure that the really

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.819 
over and make sure that the really
pointy<00:00:56.280> end<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:57.149> towards<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> bottom

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
pointy end is going towards the bottom

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.099 
pointy end is going towards the bottom
okay<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.430> again<00:00:59.699> we've<00:01:00.149> got<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.600> the
