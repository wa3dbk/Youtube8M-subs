00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.500 
they should be doing that now I think
and<00:02:58.620> if<00:02:59.490> not<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.880> always<00:02:59.970> email<00:03:00.180> them<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and if not you can always email them and

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.330 
and if not you can always email them and
ask<00:03:00.660> about<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:01.800> they<00:03:01.980> ship<00:03:02.070> to

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
ask about it and see if they ship to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.190 
ask about it and see if they ship to
where<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:02.580> are<00:03:02.610> but<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.330> was<00:03:03.840> really<00:03:04.050> happy

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200

about<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.680> as<00:03:04.890> well<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.430> always<00:03:05.700> get

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
about that as well because I always get

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.420 
about that as well because I always get
really<00:03:05.970> bummed<00:03:06.450> when<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.920> show<00:03:07.920> something<00:03:08.160> in<00:03:08.370> a

want to try and you can't because they

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.400
