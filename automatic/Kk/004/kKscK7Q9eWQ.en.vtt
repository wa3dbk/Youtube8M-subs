00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.760
 hello i'm laurence germany 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.100
 expert in chocolate and I'm going to 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.379
 show today how to make 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.500
 dark chocolate and berry lollipops 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 goji with antioxidant properties 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 for that we need a mold to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.190
 ice cubes two pikes of skewers that go 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.160
 serve to make the stick of lollipops 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.239
 70% dark chocolate and berries 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.030
 goji preferably I use 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.510
 organic ingredients before melting the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.710
 chocolate 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.359
 we will fill the bottom of each 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:53.129
 box of ice cube with berries 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:55.139
 goji we'll say a dozen pretty much 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.100
 in the background what it takes 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:01.620
 give way to chocolate we 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.359
 let's first place the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.359
 cover chocolate in the pan 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.770
 and we will drop it in the bath 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.060
 married 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.189
 so we place a chocolate at 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.189
 bath 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:20.100
 until they are melted then 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.969
 gently stirring the chocolate to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.920
 help it melt completely must be 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.530
 smooth and bright 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 here is the chocolate is now melted 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.500
 and using a teaspoon 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.140
 I will drop this melted chocolate into 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.939
 the boxes of ice cube trays for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.109
 cover the goji berries but not 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.299
 quite completely because it will take 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.060
 give way to other bays of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:53.249
 goji that's it then it takes pretty much 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:58.939
 put a teaspoon of chocolate 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:02.009
 melted in each of the boxes 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.820
 here is the little thing to do for 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.929
 equalize 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:13.620
 the chocolate we will finish with a 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:15.360
 new layer of goji berries as 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.990
 they are relatively light she 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.990
 stay on the surface 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.799
 to be sure the sticks that we 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.280
 let's go in every box hold 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.920
 well 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 we will first place the tray at 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.269
 ice cubes in the refrigerator during a 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.019
 ten minutes 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.629
 then will place the spades this 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.709

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:49.920
 and it is now very easy to 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:55.120

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.090

 we are going to replace these lollipops 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.450
