00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:25.830
 it's not complicated it just goes away and already 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.960
 will be much smaller this I think there's 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.960
 to do the little horse there we are 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.500
 difficult 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:42.180
 you have to put in front and that's not going to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.239
 to be or not going to be easy to try 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.739
 God 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.480
 to try to jump from this angle 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.550
 because he will be the good and the right 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.680
 but still to see if the pair is removed 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 screams is in the middle when when 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980
 all are left because we tried 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.270
 practical because yes no 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.590
 now now it may be time then the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.559
 moment is the time the moment of that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.220
 jump and stop when it looks like the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.119
 cylinder is for nothing if you are going to see in 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.640
 the key is that followed all the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.640
 Half eye world getting up is easy 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.250
 well more power and we're here and that 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.420
 it's a complicated leap to say everything 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.930
 in this stand swings a bit the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.830
 true to have ok we jump to pay 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.110
 actions now if this gentleman also like this 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.990
 that please please aim for 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.790
 true is dear 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.210
 so this really dark man that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.130
 I do not understand what this man does 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.130
 for boy here really 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.940
 here and more over your career 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 little girl is already all as very simple 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.310
 but all very cool so that if jumping 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.390
 OK 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.390
 around here or beige 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.790
 I do not know why because they put a tire 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.240
 perfect 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.240
 catch over 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:43.049
 in color and it's not worth it 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.489
 we are here very well ahead that 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.909
 we are not paying almost anything and look 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.909
 what is hard 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.269
 here we can the point we climb well 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.469
 and what is said is that this is not the most 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.209
 complicated now we have to go up as 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.950
 species stairs something like that is more the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.510
 race is called calling you from the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.970
 stair climb is not something strange 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.349
 valley way does not happen to us this is 20 point 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.079
 of control we have 10 right now there 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.900
 it is so now we place address to 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.129
 the rise that of the ladder of things from 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.650
 wood or something like that is you have to upload a 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.750
 wooden thing that is made in shape 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.370
 of stairs and a very narrow sidewalk and 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.379
 I do not know exactly how we're going to raise that 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.379
 but good now we will see it calm 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:26.150
 but do not be afraid we go with the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.150
 tip of the nose 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 you have to use water 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 it's just a point we're missing 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.719
 just the point of what the hell this 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
 Uncle, it seems that we are lacking 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.720
 simply the point of the goal but 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.950
 clear or to catch the goal hey then 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.459
 not only of the ladder that I have seen 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.459
 textile 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:54.730
 is not or has been maintained or if it does not 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.739
 is that is in the second race 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.379
 stair you know in the thumbnail but but 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.580
 there is not the ladder of africa 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.970
 maybe it's what I just skipped 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.970
 unintentionally 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:12.390
 but to see it is high without wanting is that 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:18.330
 I do not know I did not jump anything that by 7-5 a 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.269
 see if someone shows up here 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.670
 then correct it completely from 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.890
 the trunks whatever they are in difficult medium 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.210
 of not sticking fabric with them active 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.500
 tranquility there will be no other place of 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.970
 sites frees me my house is no longer the 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.010
 race the huayra and his shot of the 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.380
 wooden staircase but good on top of 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.420
 they refuse to see dm of hate not good inside 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.210
 of parkour is difficult or is it 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.130
 pretty with apply to 20 things like 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.310
 are 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.900
 I had please a man in front 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:52.330
 perfect back 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:56.480
 so to push the doubles these 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.230
 I believe that the best option more 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.810
 recommended because if it is not possible 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.529
 moment follows nobody is perfect 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.059
 go nailed 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.650
 and now what we have to do is 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.300
 brake 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.820
 we jump on the site a little bit towards 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.449
 front on the site forward on the 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.250
 site forward in the perfect site 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:19.250
 we say around here 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.820
 Well, no 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.740
 everything is controlled so that you 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.740
 you scare 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:34.199
 it really seems like it has to start 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.300
 I believed that I came out the thumbnail 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.009
 race but it seems that in the end nothing 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.539
 can seen from letters the report if 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.830
 we talked and I left tristan with times 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.249
 of fiction we do not see the next video 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.249
 goodbye
