this<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.489> this<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:41.000> made<00:03:41.209> of<00:03:41.329> a<00:03:41.390> little<00:03:41.600> bit<00:03:41.690> of

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
this it this is made of a little bit of

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.720 
this it this is made of a little bit of
magic<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.290> basically<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.190> shares<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.489> lot<00:03:43.670> of

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
the same advantages of the basic fight

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.380 
the same advantages of the basic fight
stick<00:03:45.920> in<00:03:46.070> terms<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> button<00:03:46.670> layout<00:03:46.910> but

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
stick in terms of the button layout but

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.220 
stick in terms of the button layout but
what<00:03:47.480> we've<00:03:47.600> got<00:03:47.750> here<00:03:47.780> is<00:03:48.049> the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
what we've got here is the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.050 
what we've got here is the
top-of-the-line<00:03:48.440> sanwa<00:03:49.280> parts<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.940> is

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
top-of-the-line sanwa parts this is

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.430 
top-of-the-line sanwa parts this is
exactly<00:03:50.299> what<00:03:50.540> you'll<00:03:50.660> find<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.049> arcade

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
exactly what you'll find in the arcade

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.259 
exactly what you'll find in the arcade
machine<00:03:52.070> so<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.670> doesn't<00:03:52.910> get<00:03:52.970> any<00:03:53.030> better

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
machine so it doesn't get any better

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.729 
machine so it doesn't get any better
than<00:03:53.390> this<00:03:53.510> actually<00:03:54.320> this<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.500> better<00:03:54.680> than

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
than this actually this is better than

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:55.780 
than this actually this is better than
the<00:03:54.859> arcade<00:03:55.130> machine<00:03:55.370> because<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:55.579> got<00:03:55.700> any

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
the arcade machine because you got any

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.970 
the arcade machine because you got any
buttons<00:03:56.060> instead<00:03:56.299> of<00:03:56.510> six<00:03:56.720> as<00:03:57.620> well<00:03:57.829> as<00:03:57.950> of

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
buttons instead of six as well as of

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.410 
buttons instead of six as well as of
course<00:03:58.100> you've<00:03:58.370> got<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.579> full<00:03:58.970> turbo

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
course you've got the full turbo

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.030 
course you've got the full turbo
functionality<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.380> disabler<00:04:00.680> switch

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
functionality and the disabler switch

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.289 
functionality and the disabler switch
you've<00:04:01.250> got<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.459> start<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.730> select<00:04:01.850> off<00:04:02.150> the

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
you've got the start and select off the

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.599 
you've got the start and select off the
face<00:04:02.510> there's<00:04:03.170> cord<00:04:03.530> storage<00:04:03.829> here<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
face there's cord storage here in the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.470 
face there's cord storage here in the
back

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
back

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.119

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
and then that's built in there so really

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.630 
and then that's built in there so really
this<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:12.620> shape<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.040> case<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.580> the

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
this is the shape of the case and the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.110 
this is the shape of the case and the
bevel<00:04:13.909> is<00:04:13.970> all<00:04:14.209> recreates<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.260> arcade

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
bevel is all recreates the arcade

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.509 
bevel is all recreates the arcade
cabinet<00:04:17.120> again<00:04:17.329> exactly<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:18.310> it's<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.370> nice

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
cabinet again exactly and it's a nice

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.460 
cabinet again exactly and it's a nice
heavy<00:04:19.699> package<00:04:20.209> and<00:04:20.449> another<00:04:20.959> fun<00:04:21.199> feature

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
you can just pull the pin outs off swap

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.279 
you can just pull the pin outs off swap
the<00:05:16.400> button<00:05:16.639> out<00:05:16.820> replace<00:05:17.660> a<00:05:17.690> button<00:05:18.020> or<00:05:18.169> if

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
the button out replace a button or if

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.420 
the button out replace a button or if
you<00:05:18.349> just<00:05:18.380> want<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.710> change<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.099> button<00:05:19.250> or

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
you just want to change the button or

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.529 
you just want to change the button or
maybe<00:05:19.580> you<00:05:19.669> want<00:05:19.700> different<00:05:19.910> color<00:05:20.210> buttons

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
maybe you want different color buttons

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.540 
maybe you want different color buttons
really<00:05:21.139> easy<00:05:21.440> so<00:05:21.590> this<00:05:21.919> is<00:05:22.039> basically<00:05:22.160> the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
really easy so this is basically the

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.070 
really easy so this is basically the
most<00:05:22.639> modifiable<00:05:23.180> stick<00:05:23.539> that<00:05:23.750> you'll<00:05:23.930> ever

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
most modifiable stick that you'll ever

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.110 
most modifiable stick that you'll ever
see<00:05:24.380> so<00:05:24.979> everything<00:05:25.400> is<00:05:25.550> not<00:05:25.729> only<00:05:25.880> hot

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
see so everything is not only hot

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.719 
see so everything is not only hot
swappable<00:05:26.570> that's<00:05:26.840> what<00:05:26.960> we<00:05:27.020> call<00:05:27.200> it<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:28.610> can

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
swappable that's what we call it you can

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.969 
swappable that's what we call it you can
just<00:05:28.760> pull<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.150> in<00:05:29.240> plug<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.780> in<00:05:29.930> we've<00:05:30.770> also

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
just pull it in plug it in we've also

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.129 
just pull it in plug it in we've also
gone<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.639> extra<00:05:31.669> mile<00:05:32.060> by<00:05:32.270> actually<00:05:32.690> labeling

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
gone the extra mile by actually labeling

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.350 
gone the extra mile by actually labeling
the<00:05:33.229> pin<00:05:33.380> outs<00:05:33.560> here<00:05:33.860> so<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.760> X<00:05:34.940> button<00:05:35.060> is

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
the pin outs here so the X button is

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.570 
the pin outs here so the X button is
labeled<00:05:35.660> X<00:05:35.840> left<00:05:36.229> bumper<00:05:36.380> on<00:05:36.860> down<00:05:37.310> the<00:05:37.430> line

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
labeled X left bumper on down the line

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.460 
labeled X left bumper on down the line
so<00:05:37.849> you<00:05:37.880> can<00:05:38.120> really<00:05:38.780> even<00:05:39.200> if<00:05:39.289> you<00:05:39.349> know

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
so you can really even if you know

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.080 
so you can really even if you know
nothing<00:05:39.500> about<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:40.039> stick<00:05:40.340> or<00:05:40.370> never<00:05:40.760> modified

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
nothing about a stick or never modified

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.580 
nothing about a stick or never modified
to<00:05:41.330> stick<00:05:41.510> before<00:05:41.660> I've<00:05:42.050> been<00:05:42.139> doing<00:05:42.349> this<00:05:42.440> for

to stick before I've been doing this for

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.339 
to stick before I've been doing this for
