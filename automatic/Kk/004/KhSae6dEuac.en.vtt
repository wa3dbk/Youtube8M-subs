00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
for shallow water clocks fine it locked

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.659 
for shallow water clocks fine it locked
in<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.259> it<00:00:28.470> locks<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.829> in<00:00:28.919> place<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.099> 10<00:00:29.460> feet

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
in and it locks it in place so 10 feet

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.759 
in and it locks it in place so 10 feet
of<00:00:29.789> water<00:00:29.819> or<00:00:30.149> less<00:00:30.329> yeah<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.960> no<00:00:31.229> problem<00:00:31.619> but

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.110 
of water or less yeah so no problem but
again<00:00:32.009> that's<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> those<00:00:32.699> long<00:00:32.850> rods

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
again that's what I want those long rods

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.580 
again that's what I want those long rods
right<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:34.019> that<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.469> an

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
right so we got that kind of an

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
right so we got that kind of an
indicator<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.940> then<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> ones<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.510> have

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
indicator and then the ones that have

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.169 
indicator and then the ones that have
that<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.260> use<00:00:37.289> for<00:00:38.039> deeper<00:00:38.429> water<00:00:38.670> fill<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:39.179 
that we now use for deeper water fill of

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:41.299 
that we now use for deeper water fill of
them<00:00:39.359> are<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.600> other<00:00:40.019> quick<00:00:40.260> release<00:00:40.559> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
them are these other quick release so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
them are these other quick release so
your<00:00:41.609> line<00:00:42.000> goes<00:00:42.210> through<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.690> except<00:00:43.260> we

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
your line goes through there except we

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
your line goes through there except we
should<00:00:43.469> put<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> line<00:00:43.890> through<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.339> then

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
should put the line through and then

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
should put the line through and then
when<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> bite<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.079> releases<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
when you get a bite it releases and it

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.389 
when you get a bite it releases and it
slides<00:00:48.289> slides<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.679> we'll<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.859> some<00:00:50.010> wine<00:00:50.219> and

then<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> chase<00:01:50.219> to<00:01:50.369> take<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:51.020> cocktail

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
then you chase to take on a cocktail

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.770 
then you chase to take on a cocktail
toothpick<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> pin<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.390> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
toothpick and pin it so now it's it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.859 
toothpick and pin it so now it's it's
fixed<00:01:55.200> right<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.450> they're<00:01:57.450> great<00:01:57.630> for

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
fixed right and so they're great for

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.599 
fixed right and so they're great for
fishing<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> said<00:01:58.560> water<00:01:58.890> lesson<00:01:59.310> shallow

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.609 
fishing like I said water lesson shallow

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.649 
fishing like I said water lesson shallow
shallow<00:02:00.179> water<00:02:00.689> okay<00:02:00.990> yeah<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.659> for

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
shallow water okay yeah and then for

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.160 
shallow water okay yeah and then for
setting<00:02:03.929> up<00:02:04.049> an<00:02:04.530> indicator<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.310> quick<00:02:05.789> release

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
setting up an indicator a quick release

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
setting up an indicator a quick release
it's<00:02:07.170> two<00:02:07.409> parts<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.070> there's<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.400> peg<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's two parts to this there's a peg and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.220 
it's two parts to this there's a peg and
then<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.300> ball<00:02:09.480> I<00:02:09.510> always<00:02:09.870> make<00:02:10.050> sure<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.230 
then the ball I always make sure the

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.190 
then the ball I always make sure the
paint<00:02:10.530> goes<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:10.950> first<00:02:11.220> yeah<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.850> slide

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
paint goes on first yeah so you slide

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.930 
paint goes on first yeah so you slide
the<00:02:13.440> leader<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> peg<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:16.760> threw<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the leader to the peg and then threw the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.790 
the leader to the peg and then threw the
ball<00:02:18.120> yeah<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.560> now<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:20.100> our<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
ball yeah so now we have our so it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
ball yeah so now we have our so it's
sliding<00:02:23.100> yeah<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.819> then<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.480> peg<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.900> at<00:02:24.990> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
sliding yeah and then you peg it at the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
sliding yeah and then you peg it at the
depth<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.590> want<00:02:25.740> by<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.040> making<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.520> little

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
depth you want by just making a little

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.180 
depth you want by just making a little
loop<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:28.170> there<00:02:28.410> perfect<00:02:28.770> and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
loop a little right there perfect and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.730 
loop a little right there perfect and
you<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> snug<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:31.290> snug<00:02:31.500> don't

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you and you snug it in just snug don't

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.830 
you and you snug it in just snug don't
jam<00:02:32.010> cram<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.850> snug<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.510> then

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
jam cram it and just snug it and then

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.600 
jam cram it and just snug it and then
when<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.200> strike<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.920> releases<00:02:35.250> and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
when you get a strike it releases and

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.510 
when you get a strike it releases and

everything forecasting I mean I you just
want<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.580> wide<00:02:44.730> open<00:02:45.000> loop<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.270> use<00:02:45.420> them

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
want the wide open loop I use them

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.970 
want the wide open loop I use them
beyond<00:02:45.690> shallow<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.260> deep<00:02:46.440> water<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.770> just

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980

love yeah so simple to peg those find
water<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.590> fine<00:02:49.860> leader<00:02:50.130> they<00:02:50.580> don't

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
water you know fine leader they don't

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.340 
water you know fine leader they don't
peg<00:02:51.060> as<00:02:51.209> well<00:02:51.390> right<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.780> thicker<00:02:52.019> leader

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
peg as well right the thicker leader

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.830 
peg as well right the thicker leader
hires<00:02:53.130> more<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.880> grab<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.450> her<00:02:54.540> leaders

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
hires more to grab and her leaders

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.570 
hires more to grab and her leaders
tougher<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.380> now<00:02:55.500> it's<00:02:55.709> set<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.100> get<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.370> bite

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
tougher so now it's set you get the bite

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.229 
tougher so now it's set you get the bite
and<00:02:56.940> she<00:02:57.900> releases<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.620> then<00:02:58.769> she<00:02:58.920> releases

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and she releases and then she releases

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.660 
and she releases and then she releases
and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> last<00:03:00.890> thing<00:03:01.890> I'm<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.130> blob<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
they came out in the market so a couple

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440 
they came out in the market so a couple
years<00:03:08.190> ago<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.519> use<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:09.000> tippet<00:03:09.420> material

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
years ago so use your tippet material

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.580 
years ago so use your tippet material
your<00:03:10.170> leader<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.920> just<00:03:11.160> make<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> loop<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:12.000> it

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
your leader you just make a loop in it

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.380 
your leader you just make a loop in it
and<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.769> thread<00:03:14.190> out<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.709> loop<00:03:17.180> pinch<00:03:18.180> it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
and you thread out that loop pinch it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.759 
and you thread out that loop pinch it
and<00:03:18.600> get<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> through<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.760> thingamabob<00:03:21.420> ER

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
and get it through the thingamabob ER

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.250 
and get it through the thingamabob ER
and<00:03:22.769> then<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:23.600> go<00:03:24.600> around<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.110> Oh

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
and then you just go around it Oh

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.310 
and then you just go around it Oh
excellent<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.480> sits<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.170> let's

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
excellent and so it sits there so let's

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.690 
excellent and so it sits there so let's
sit<00:03:28.500> there<00:03:28.739> but<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.160> actually<00:03:29.489> move<00:03:29.640> it

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
sit there but you can actually move it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
sit there but you can actually move it
you<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.120> move<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.329> like<00:03:30.510> yeah<00:03:30.810> by<00:03:31.019> pulling

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
you can move it like yeah by pulling

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.289 
you can move it like yeah by pulling
your<00:03:31.530> loop<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.190> sliding<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.700> down<00:03:32.730> up<00:03:33.150> or

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
your loop out and sliding it down up or

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.380 
your loop out and sliding it down up or
down<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:34.200> these<00:03:34.320> are<00:03:34.500> ultra<00:03:34.860> sensitive<00:03:35.120> yeah

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
down and these are ultra sensitive yeah

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.690
