00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.450
 Welcome to a video for that did 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.010
 and why I have the new ones specifically 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.260
 for mutti cooks developed multi style 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.720
 depository tested and with a lot 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 high quality it alex aixtron lipus 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.300
 compared 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 because I do not feel like it has an eternal 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.840
 I have long to type big 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.790
 decided the whole in a simple 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 to make video 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.530
 I compared four to 4000 m a ha 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 and 5000 always harley poss from sls against 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.580
 the new 4s 5200 milliamps of multi 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.089
 I compared the lifeless to the store 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.870
 my pv corp a 1092 grams heavy 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.909
 fpv cruiser of the 450 mm class of the paddock 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.400
 will propeller with 11 inch dough carbon 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.680
 with 370 slopes flown at 4s 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.450
 additional gloves for the test 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.409
 in the case of the components are in the case 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.330
 700 kv tiger mn 31.10 stroked 17 engines 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.640
 the performance data while now first 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.460
 look at 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.130
 here we have the performance data of mr 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.649
 31:10 deleted 17 and see that we at 4s 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.530
 with the tiger 11 inch 3.10 o'clock propeller 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.990
 at 100 percent gas a maximum of ten amps 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.820
 per motor pull together take 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.859
 the engines so at full throttle about 40 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 ampere the remaining components fall 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.130
 because not so much 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.079
 philippus majority enough office to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.820
 to provide 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.609
 40 amps engines note us 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.049
 but for later 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.979
 before we go to the logan 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.869
 data come 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.509
 Let's look at the performance of the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.030
 trolleybus recently compare the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.539
 four thousand sls delivers us with his 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 40 c ie 160 ampere load more than 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.990
 enough reserve the weight of this loveless 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.479
 is 480 grams of 5000s sls with 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
 his 200 amp terror load is along 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.270
 full 5 173 grams by quite a few 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.550
 more 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 here comes the special thing about the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.300
 new turnkey multistar series 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.850
 here the lipo became completely different 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.490
 designed city ​​on a high rating 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.970
 so much ampere the focus became clear 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.950
 put on capacity the 5200 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.480
 Milliah lessons bring so only yes 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.220
 430 grams on the scales 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.530
 compared to the sls four-thousander 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.290
 we have less weight at 50 grams 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.890
 had 1200 milliamps more for 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.560
 disposal 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.319
 and as a permanent guest the lipo delivers us 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.180
 with 52 amps also significantly more than them 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.670
 needed about 40 ampere mine 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.110
 cocteau needs a maximum of which 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.129
 impact that has in practice 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.900
 Let's take a look at the unloving 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.280
 I have to compare with each other 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.769
 everyone loves four times different 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.549
 But days with exactly the same time 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.950
 flown 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.019
 Each day , each of the four became one 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.660
 Lipus flown so the data are very 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.849
 good comparable with each other 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.150
 the cop tor has come up with the 4000 dsl it 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.879
 In the cut 32 ampere pulled up and is on 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.599
 a pv flight time of 14 5 minutes in the 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.280
 come on medium 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.310
 this data relates 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.690
 of course, that 20% 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.489
 residual capacity should remain in the lipo 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.940
 to protect them permanently too 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.579
 treat here we are now seeing the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.549
 flew data of the sls 4s 5000 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.280
 millipastes lipus the means 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.200
 drawn 13.6 ampere are slightly 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.489
 higher than in the higher four thousands 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.829
 weight makes you fly though 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.090
 already clearly noticeable 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.459
 although I'm here on average 17 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.230
 6 minutes flying time is the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.870
 Just tie up here on the way 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.250
 much more fun makes it clear 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.040
 the lower weight of the four-thousand 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:56.919
 lipus now we come to 4s 5200 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.780
 milliampere multi store with once again 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.049
 50 grams less weight than that 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.000
 four-thousanders sls and 143 grams less 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.160
 weight than the sms 5000 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.480
 mah makes love the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.260
 fly alone from the weight already on 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.139
 most fun 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.410
 but it is the higher capacity 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.090
 I mean her 18.7 minutes in the air 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.820
 average 13.4 ampere 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.049
 lie between the two sls look 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.590
 we now again in the direct 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.419
 compare to the loveless ones specifically 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.820
 developed for this job multi copter 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.740
 multi star series shows in direct 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.760
 compare with the sls lipus her whole 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.800
 clearly your strengths 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.750
 besides a very low weight 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.490
 high capacity and sufficient 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.320
 available ampere 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.719
 since the lipo here clearly as 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.860
 she gave in direct comparison that 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:44.889
 four-thousander sl 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.199
 with the 5200 multistar we have at 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.150
 another 50 grams less weight 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.270
 then as a result a good four minutes more 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.319
 flight time 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.259
 fair enough you have to but here 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.330
 say it from the sls aixtron series 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.789
 also still lipus with a c rating of 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.930
 20 gives the data I have here yet 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.530
 once in a table opposite 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.919
 posed 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.610
 but even the sls aixtron 4000 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.639
 always come with 20 rating to 430 grams 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.219
 and thus weigh exactly the same as the 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.599
 5200 mhh multi star, the sls can now 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.819
 was equal to the weight 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.469
 but then there are still 1200 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:22.110
 milliamps more capacity 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:24.430
 opposite 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.319
 Now we come for a short time 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.090
 per contra of the two types of lipo for 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.479
 use on a comparable 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.279
 the sls aixtron are excellent 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.050
 brand depots located in the 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.590
 Processing no weaknesses at all 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.960
 Afford 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.090
 the lupus and even under load extreme 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.889
 voltage stable and hold until the 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.259
 end a comparatively high voltage 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.909
 bot cell that stands by mine 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.889
 use only contrary 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.810
 that the sls are actually way too much 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.650
 amps can supply and therefore too 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.620
 are very heavy 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.639
 even the 20 c sls can barely here 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.099
 Make up ground 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.990
 also the high price comparison with the 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:03.099
 Multi star is for the performance data 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.469
 my head uses too high the new one 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.839
 featured multistar series comes up 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:09.310
 my head here fully valid 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:11.319
 lies exactly in the target group of 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.629
 top turner wants to reach you with it 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.460
 The moms are easy to offer 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.469
 compare significantly more capacity and 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.199
 so that also flight time and supplies 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:22.060
 just more than enough ampere 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.919
 the design on capacity but has to 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.469
 follow that voltage under load 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.669
 strong breaks in as the sls and im 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.759
 multi store also towards the end of 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.289
 Capacity continues to slump than it does 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.060
 Due to the significantly higher capacity 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.550
 the multistar but also more 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.289
 Unfortunately, the multi styles are out there 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.240
 just about the international 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:41.650
 warehouse from hobby king available 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.439
 that should be hopefully in 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.050
 change shortly besides 4s are also some 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.930
 three variants available 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.759
 will be further expanded 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.500
 It is well worth it if the 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.009
 needed ampera of the head to the 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.990
 fit multi star 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:59.300
 give new lipo series a chance 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.219
 the significant increase in flight time 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.639
 without real weaknesses in practice 

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:06.229
 At least I was absolutely convinced 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:09.860
 when asking for video link to 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.550
 patron - forum.com I post here 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.839
 the video 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.839
 thanks for listening
