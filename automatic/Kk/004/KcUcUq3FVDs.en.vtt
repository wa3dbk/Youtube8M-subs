00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.999
 table 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.539
 in the middle of the key area for a matter pays nothing to do 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 this action is wrong 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.780
 now there is a line of custom products entities that 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
 it will simply highlight your generation 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.830
 the competition intends to keep this 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.300
 So we have to present in the week that I signed the 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 my finest Basque 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.910
 now you will give wings to the imagination of hairdressers as is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.690
 that they can finalize a politician 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.290
 Let's get out of the rut. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.770
 the show is a form of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.799
 finished without having the need to wear what they ask is 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.759
 that in it the entities 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.759
 since 1912 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.090
 Dear Mr 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.430
 serious problem because he works through the unit of serious patients 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.539
 it's samuel's half 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:30.539
 paula small and select 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 and then whistle 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.840
 in the hair 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.050
 in this movement of the most appear since last Sunday 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.020
 we work gets to raise more has ahead of the actions is close 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.100
 I want to finish working on one of these themes, promising to fight after 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.980
 three matches but to gain experience 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.980
 too much mistakes and practice giving 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.610
 riva still shines 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 19 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.700
 is making a bride a godmother she was already half created by the station 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.200
 that hair has to last all night 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.429
 beatriz gets there on her honeymoon 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:15.160
 that you recommend that families 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.849
 the session 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.980
 different against repression against strong 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.009
 I know she'll come in. 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.009
 silas 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.410
 it was not that hair 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.659
 and talking is a worker 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.449
 the offender in the original international programming in this case will be 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:34.919
 was also in the key b has a hair 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
 was always 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.079
 among the names that want higher high of the day 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.169
 that established but when you have one more that in a short time 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.669
 only it seems 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.619
 which is meanwhile texture 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.499
 We play paula 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.989
 but it is still good, but naturally it is still 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.089
 more natural because it is a mixture of axÃ© al as a trainer 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.089
 where you have to be made of paula 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.650
 so suddenly I can do this with much criticized super-emptiness 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.150
 completely different 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.200
 more than one who is pleasant to pass the hand to himself can pass 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.709
 Ill if you want to be scared of staying inside 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.519
 the early soy Sunday 4 the control and another out of itself 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.789
 in the works of this the cinema glue 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.939
 Do you work 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.599
 Do you guys do with 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.049
 a small image for products throughout the state - even professionally 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.879
 when I fall 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.819
 However 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.159
 with a less delicate packaging 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.000
 1011 moderately months and little, right? 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.479
 I pretend the Brazilian reality. 

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:59.199
 people, for example, were born in the chamber after we spoke in 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.199
 time she weighed her 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.989
 also recommends that they have said no 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.679
 recently caring 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:10.339
 so the third stage of treatment is very small 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.539
 now it's coming 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.539
 I'll apply as needed 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.090
 the work past these products said worried about the name that yes besides her 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.860
 allows this mixture between the products 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.500
 ended up scared 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.300
 launched school products 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.199
 February is the trend to grow 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.819
 but these tools to hire professionals infection the gesture with the 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.749
 subject matter 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:40.929
 today closure happens
