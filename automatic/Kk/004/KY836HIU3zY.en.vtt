00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
weather cracked and I mean their weather

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.229 
weather cracked and I mean their weather
cracked<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:37.170> really<00:02:37.680> bad<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.940> other<00:02:39.150> than

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
cracked really really bad so other than

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.720 
cracked really really bad so other than
that<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.569> machine<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.980> starts<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.489> for<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that the machine it starts up for a

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.890 
that the machine it starts up for a
second<00:02:42.090> kick<00:02:42.209> every<00:02:42.450> time<00:02:42.599> when<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
second kick every time when it's

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.870 
second kick every time when it's
ice-cold<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.650> I<00:02:43.950> am<00:02:44.489> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.849> a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
ice-cold so I am going to do a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.300 
ice-cold so I am going to do a
compression<00:02:45.209> test<00:02:45.359> on<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.799> running

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
compression test on it it's running

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.009 
compression test on it it's running
pretty<00:02:47.880> shitty<00:02:48.329> but<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.600> seems<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.870> have

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
pretty shitty but it seems to have

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.449 
pretty shitty but it seems to have
pretty<00:02:49.140> good<00:02:49.319> compression<00:02:49.709> kicking<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
pretty good compression kicking it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.920 
pretty good compression kicking it
so<00:02:50.910> I'm<00:02:51.000> actually<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> wondering<00:02:51.569> if

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
so I'm actually kind of wondering if

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.000 
so I'm actually kind of wondering if
it's<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.230> flooding<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.829> out<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
it's just flooding the out of
