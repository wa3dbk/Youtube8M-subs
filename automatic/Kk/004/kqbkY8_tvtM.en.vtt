Casey's<00:01:38.400> Ron<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:38.610> thought<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.300> took<00:01:39.480> a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
Casey's Ron I thought they really took a

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
Casey's Ron I thought they really took a
lot<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.870> basic<00:01:40.230> ideas<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> ran<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
lot of the basic ideas and ran with it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.940 
lot of the basic ideas and ran with it
and<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.270> that's<00:01:42.450> uh<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:42.920> kind<00:01:43.920> of

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and and I think that's uh that's kind of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.220 
and and I think that's uh that's kind of
the<00:01:44.040> fun<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:45.860> characters<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.040> are

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
the fun of of characters that are

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.390 
the fun of of characters that are
company-owned<00:01:49.230> or<00:01:49.440> whatever<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.860> they're

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
company-owned or whatever that they're

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.190 
company-owned or whatever that they're
going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.580> be<00:01:50.700> around<00:01:50.880> forever<00:01:51.120> hopefully<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
going to be around forever hopefully and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
going to be around forever hopefully and
you<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.980> different<00:01:53.190> creators<00:01:53.520> come<00:01:53.730> on<00:01:53.850> and

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:51.440 

you<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.700> what<00:02:44.970> order

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.290 

flash<00:02:52.450> or<00:02:53.050> any<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> other<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:54.250> there

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.480 

cotton<00:02:58.300> future<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:59.020> put<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.440> suggestion<00:03:02.190> yeah<00:03:03.190> I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
cotton future to put a suggestion yeah I

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.730 
cotton future to put a suggestion yeah I
think<00:03:03.850> they're<00:03:04.090> DC<00:03:04.870> could<00:03:05.050> be<00:03:05.170> better<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:05.710> that

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
think they're DC could be better on that

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.170 
think they're DC could be better on that
in<00:03:06.040> general<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.520> mean<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:06.820> one<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.030> things

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
in general I mean it's one of things

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.850 
in general I mean it's one of things
we've<00:03:07.330> already<00:03:07.540> kind<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.840> addressed<00:03:08.650> and

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
we've already kind of addressed and

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.290 
we've already kind of addressed and
starting<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.460> change<00:03:09.640> some<00:03:09.880> of<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> Green

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
starting to change some of the Green

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.940 
starting to change some of the Green
Lantern<00:03:10.420> trades<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.170> don't<00:03:11.530> know<00:03:11.590> what<00:03:11.710> order

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
Lantern trades I don't know what order

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.620 
Lantern trades I don't know what order
to<00:03:12.070> read<00:03:12.310> those<00:03:12.460> in<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.820> mean<00:03:12.970> they<00:03:13.120> aren't

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
to read those in I mean they aren't

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.440 
to read those in I mean they aren't
numbered<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.180> something<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.270> that

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
numbered and something like that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.480 
numbered and something like that
probably<00:03:17.320> useful<00:03:17.590> have<00:03:17.920> an<00:03:18.040> ad<00:03:18.190> where<00:03:18.400> it

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
probably useful have an ad where it

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.400 
probably useful have an ad where it
shows<00:03:18.730> all<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.060> books<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:19.990> shows<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
shows all the books and that shows you a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.460 
shows all the books and that shows you a
tree<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:21.040> wear<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.030> use<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.750> actual<00:03:22.930> covers

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
tree of wear and use the actual covers

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.350 
tree of wear and use the actual covers
and<00:03:23.710> kind<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:23.980> organize<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.670> for<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.090> rather

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
and kind of organize it for you rather

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.790 
and kind of organize it for you rather
than<00:03:25.480> put<00:03:25.750> numbers<00:03:26.140> on<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> covers<00:03:26.650> because

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
than put numbers on the covers because

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.080 
than put numbers on the covers because
that<00:03:26.920> I<00:03:26.950> find<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.310> even<00:03:27.460> more<00:03:27.670> confusing

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that I find that even more confusing

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.910 
that I find that even more confusing
when<00:03:28.240> there's<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.720> weird<00:03:28.920> triangular

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
when there's like this weird triangular

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.010 
when there's like this weird triangular
thing<00:03:30.130> has<00:03:30.310> 37<00:03:30.970> I'm<00:03:31.060> like<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:31.360> is<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.660> and

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
thing has 37 I'm like what is this and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.960 
thing has 37 I'm like what is this and
you<00:03:32.410> know<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.530> have<00:03:32.890> no<00:03:32.920> idea<00:03:33.340> what<00:03:33.460> that<00:03:33.490> it's

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
you know I have no idea what that it's

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.020 
you know I have no idea what that it's
confusing<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:36.550> have<00:03:36.670> some<00:03:36.790> sort<00:03:36.910> of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
confusing so you have some sort of

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.440 
confusing so you have some sort of
retail<00:03:37.330> poster<00:03:37.810> or<00:03:37.960> in<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.710> book<00:03:39.640> add<00:03:39.850> that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
retail poster or in in book add that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.570 
retail poster or in in book add that
shows<00:03:40.840> how<00:03:41.170> these<00:03:41.380> books<00:03:41.650> should<00:03:42.250> be<00:03:42.400> read

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
shows how these books should be read

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.340 
shows how these books should be read
would<00:03:42.910> probably<00:03:43.300> be<00:03:43.680> useful<00:03:44.680> like<00:03:45.580> core

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
would probably be useful like core

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.750 
would probably be useful like core
secondary<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:47.800> tertiary<00:03:48.310> please<00:03:48.610> buy
