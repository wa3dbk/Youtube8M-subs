more easy to visualize what's happening
and<00:01:51.770> easy<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.369> control<00:01:52.610> we<00:01:53.149> use<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.300> grid<00:01:53.509> system

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
and easy to control we use a grid system

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.499 
and easy to control we use a grid system
for<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> for<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.590> units<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.270> we<00:01:56.270> pause

aggression<00:02:06.140> levels<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:06.710> tweak<00:02:06.890> it<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.220> I

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
aggression levels I can tweak it so I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.620 
aggression levels I can tweak it so I
can<00:02:07.460> set<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> aggression<00:02:07.970> level<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.269> my<00:02:08.360> units

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
can set the aggression level of my units

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.880 
can set the aggression level of my units
higher<00:02:08.810> at<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.320> moment<00:02:09.649> they're<00:02:09.769> on<00:02:09.860> a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
higher at the moment they're on a

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.440 
higher at the moment they're on a
neutral<00:02:10.310> setting<00:02:10.519> so<00:02:10.789> they<00:02:10.910> will<00:02:11.060> react<00:02:11.269> if

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
neutral setting so they will react if

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.390 
neutral setting so they will react if
attacked<00:02:11.750> if<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.709> set<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.950> aggression<00:02:13.190> level

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
attacked if I set the aggression level

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.160 
attacked if I set the aggression level
high<00:02:13.519> when<00:02:14.000> anyone<00:02:14.269> gets<00:02:14.450> close<00:02:14.690> to<00:02:14.810> them<00:02:15.050> they

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
high when anyone gets close to them they

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.540 
high when anyone gets close to them they
will<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.500> jump<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.830> there<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.400> you<00:02:16.459> have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
will just jump in there so you have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.520 
will just jump in there so you have
controls<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.720> units<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.200> can<00:02:18.230> use

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
controls on the units that you can use

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.170 
controls on the units that you can use
the<00:02:19.250> other<00:02:19.370> thing<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.910> take<00:02:20.030> into

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
the other thing you have to take into

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.340 
the other thing you have to take into
account<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.660> different<00:02:20.930> units<00:02:21.140> behave

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
account is that different units behave

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.289 
account is that different units behave
differently<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.310> your<00:02:22.519> archers<00:02:22.940> will<00:02:23.120> never

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
differently so your archers will never

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.699 
differently so your archers will never
be<00:02:23.450> aggressive<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:23.989> will<00:02:24.170> never<00:02:24.320> charge<00:02:24.530> in

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
be aggressive they will never charge in

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.960 
be aggressive they will never charge in
there<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.160> your<00:02:25.280> cavalry<00:02:25.610> are<00:02:25.730> always

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
there and your cavalry are always

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.600 
there and your cavalry are always
aggressive<00:02:26.209> in<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.930> period<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.260> history

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
aggressive in this period of history

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.920 
aggressive in this period of history
they<00:02:28.610> had<00:02:28.730> real<00:02:28.910> trouble<00:02:29.060> controlling<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
they had real trouble controlling the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.420 
they had real trouble controlling the
the<00:02:29.959> Knights<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.739> getting<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.100> do<00:02:31.190> what<00:02:31.340> they

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
the Knights and getting to do what they

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.890 
the Knights and getting to do what they
wanted<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> do<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.480> English<00:02:32.720> actually

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
wanted to do and the English actually

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.660 
wanted to do and the English actually
tended<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.560> tell<00:02:33.739> them<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.100> get<00:02:34.370> off<00:02:34.430> their

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
tended to tell them to get off their

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.330 
tended to tell them to get off their
horses<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.930> they<00:02:36.049> couldn't<00:02:36.230> charge<00:02:36.470> off<00:02:36.680> how

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
horses so they couldn't charge off how

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.170 
horses so they couldn't charge off how
does<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.519> only<00:02:37.700> way<00:02:37.790> they<00:02:37.880> could<00:02:37.970> deal<00:02:38.150> with

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
does the only way they could deal with

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.360 
does the only way they could deal with
them

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.399 

I<00:02:41.430> said<00:02:42.060> there's<00:02:42.180> rewards<00:02:42.540> for<00:02:42.720> outflanking

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
I said there's rewards for outflanking

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.710 
I said there's rewards for outflanking
charging<00:02:43.890> someone<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> back<00:02:44.599> can't<00:02:45.599> we

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
charging someone in the back can't we

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.089 
charging someone in the back can't we
have<00:02:45.840> trample<00:02:46.200> attacks<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.650> first<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:47.010> they

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
have trample attacks the first time they

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.070 
have trample attacks the first time they
hit<00:02:47.190> infantry<00:02:47.730> weapons<00:02:48.599> have<00:02:48.750> different

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
hit infantry weapons have different

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.479 
hit infantry weapons have different
strengths<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.379> weaknesses<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.799> spears<00:02:50.340> are

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
strengths and weaknesses so spears are

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.059 
strengths and weaknesses so spears are
good<00:02:50.640> against<00:02:51.379> against<00:02:52.379> cavalry<00:02:52.709> while

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
good against against cavalry while

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.440 
good against against cavalry while
swords<00:02:53.640> are<00:02:53.760> better<00:02:53.879> against<00:02:54.180> infantry<00:02:56.450> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
swords are better against infantry the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.910 
swords are better against infantry the

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
destroyed the charge of the cavalry and

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.140 
destroyed the charge of the cavalry and
so<00:03:35.920> there<00:03:36.040> are<00:03:36.099> all<00:03:36.190> kinds<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.580> special

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
so there are all kinds of special

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.460 
so there are all kinds of special
effects<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.599> play<00:03:37.750> on<00:03:37.870> your<00:03:37.900> troops<00:03:38.260> I

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
effects you can play on your troops I

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.710 
effects you can play on your troops I
can<00:03:39.099> cast<00:03:39.310> rain<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:39.940> enemy<00:03:40.239> if<00:03:40.420> he's<00:03:40.569> got

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
can cast rain on the enemy if he's got

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.930 
can cast rain on the enemy if he's got
lots<00:03:40.870> of<00:03:40.930> archers

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.570 

we're<00:03:46.510> actually<00:03:46.660> making<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:47.500> rain<00:03:47.680> effect<00:03:48.490> of

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
we're actually making it rain effect of

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.920 
we're actually making it rain effect of
the<00:03:48.670> yen<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.090> it's<00:03:49.210> kind<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:49.420> like<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.570> magic

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the yen so it's kind of like a magic

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.200 
the yen so it's kind of like a magic
system<00:03:50.020> it's<00:03:50.380> but<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.310> with<00:03:51.640> everything's

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
system it's but it with everything's

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.920 
system it's but it with everything's
within<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.510> historic<00:03:52.960> framework

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.720 

as<00:03:59.930> cloud<00:04:00.290> seeding<00:04:00.560> technology<00:04:01.220> at<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.550> time

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
as cloud seeding technology at this time

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.860 
as cloud seeding technology at this time
seems<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.150> little<00:04:02.239> advanced

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.380 

but<00:04:06.440> again<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:07.069> are<00:04:07.099> surveying<00:04:07.760> everything

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
but again you are surveying everything

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.869 
but again you are surveying everything
any<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.530> keep<00:04:09.739> moving<00:04:10.099> back<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.640> forth

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
any is you keep moving back and forth

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.640 
any is you keep moving back and forth
through<00:04:11.060> your<00:04:11.599> focus<00:04:11.989> on<00:04:12.110> what<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.440> yeah

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
through your focus on what you do yeah

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.259 
through your focus on what you do yeah
I'm<00:04:12.950> controlling<00:04:13.340> everybody<00:04:13.819> in<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.000> battle

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
I'm controlling everybody in the battle

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
unit's I can tell them where to move

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.449 
unit's I can tell them where to move
what<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.269> do<00:04:17.419> although<00:04:18.019> their<00:04:18.979> morale<00:04:19.250> will

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
what to do although their morale will

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.740 
what to do although their morale will
dictate<00:04:19.729> whether<00:04:19.880> they<00:04:20.030> obey<00:04:20.209> me<00:04:20.359> or<00:04:20.449> not<00:04:20.540> if

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
dictate whether they obey me or not if

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.180 
dictate whether they obey me or not if
their<00:04:20.930> morale<00:04:21.139> is<00:04:21.169> broken<00:04:21.620> they<00:04:21.739> won't<00:04:21.919> debate

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
their morale is broken they won't debate

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.530 
their morale is broken they won't debate
and<00:04:22.400> they'll<00:04:22.520> just<00:04:22.699> they'll<00:04:23.120> run<00:04:23.330> from<00:04:23.449> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
and they'll just they'll run from the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.240 
and they'll just they'll run from the
battlefield<00:04:23.930> so<00:04:24.350> again<00:04:24.590> the<00:04:24.710> objective<00:04:25.130> of

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
battlefield so again the objective of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.400 
battlefield so again the objective of
each<00:04:25.520> individual<00:04:26.090> battle<00:04:26.389> is<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.990> route<00:04:27.229> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
each individual battle is to route the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.750 
each individual battle is to route the
enemy<00:04:27.650> army<00:04:27.949> you<00:04:28.220> don't<00:04:28.340> have<00:04:28.430> to<00:04:28.490> kill<00:04:28.669> them

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
enemy army you don't have to kill them

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.990 
enemy army you don't have to kill them
all

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
all

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.270 
all
you<00:04:29.060> just<00:04:29.180> have<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.300> rout<00:04:29.510> them<00:04:29.690> and<00:04:30.160> there<00:04:31.160> are

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
you just have to rout them and there are

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.939 
you just have to rout them and there are
ways<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.460> can<00:04:31.699> break<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.060> enemy<00:04:32.270> morale

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
ways you can break the enemy morale

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.810 
ways you can break the enemy morale
without<00:04:33.949> killing<00:04:34.190> them<00:04:34.310> for<00:04:34.490> example

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
without killing them for example

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.920 
without killing them for example
charging<00:04:35.120> them<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.360> flank<00:04:35.540> and<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.750> rear

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
charging them in the flank and the rear

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.990 
charging them in the flank and the rear
that<00:04:36.590> gives<00:04:36.800> um<00:04:36.860> big<00:04:37.010> morale<00:04:37.190> deductions<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that gives um big morale deductions and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.300 
that gives um big morale deductions and
makes<00:04:38.180> them<00:04:38.270> much<00:04:38.419> more<00:04:38.449> likely<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.870> run<00:04:39.050> away

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
makes them much more likely to run away

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.010 
makes them much more likely to run away
we'll<00:04:40.310> just<00:04:40.460> jump<00:04:40.610> back<00:04:40.820> to<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.780> quest

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
we'll just jump back to the the quest

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.230 
we'll just jump back to the the quest
map<00:04:42.229> now

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.469 

so<00:04:49.810> there<00:04:49.930> are<00:04:49.960> two<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:50.979> what<00:04:51.160> there's<00:04:51.370> one

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
so there are two so is what there's one

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.820 
so there are two so is what there's one
campaign<00:04:52.479> in<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.690> base<00:04:52.840> game<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.590> English

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
campaign in the base game the English

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.360 
campaign in the base game the English
campaign<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.620> there'll<00:04:56.770> be<00:04:56.800> an<00:04:56.919> additional

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
campaign and there'll be an additional

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:05.070 
campaign and there'll be an additional
French<00:04:57.849> campaign<00:04:58.210> available

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.240 

in<00:05:05.260> the<00:05:05.380> quest<00:05:05.590> map<00:05:05.770> this<00:05:05.890> is<00:05:06.040> where<00:05:06.160> you

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
in the quest map this is where you

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.230 
in the quest map this is where you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
only have one mission but before each of

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.820 
only have one mission but before each of
the<00:05:12.580> historic<00:05:13.060> missions<00:05:13.420> there'll<00:05:14.410> be<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.590> bit

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
the historic missions there'll be a bit

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.700 
the historic missions there'll be a bit
of<00:05:14.920> a<00:05:15.070> movie<00:05:15.960> telling<00:05:16.960> you<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.170> scene<00:05:17.380> you

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
of a movie telling you the scene you

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.780 
of a movie telling you the scene you
can't<00:05:17.920> hear<00:05:18.100> it<00:05:18.130> but<00:05:18.280> there's<00:05:18.430> a<00:05:18.460> voiceover

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
can't hear it but there's a voiceover

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.130 
can't hear it but there's a voiceover
telling<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.390> story<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.810> what's<00:05:19.930> going

telling you the story and what's going
on

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
on

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.050 

and<00:05:22.390> there<00:05:22.930> are<00:05:23.080> I<00:05:23.560> think<00:05:24.340> there's<00:05:24.460> about<00:05:24.580> 24

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
and there are I think there's about 24

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.420 
and there are I think there's about 24
of<00:05:25.090> these<00:05:25.360> historic<00:05:26.050> battles<00:05:26.380> plus<00:05:26.680> around<00:05:27.010> 50

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
of these historic battles plus around 50

other part that is quite unique is the

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.210 
other part that is quite unique is the
customization<00:05:38.139> so<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:38.889> is<00:05:39.009> where<00:05:39.129> I'm

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
campaign is not a lot of options

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.520

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
kind of weapons they've got I can change

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.460 
kind of weapons they've got I can change
their<00:05:51.630> uniforms

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:03.949 
and so you can make the units of quite
identifiers<00:06:02.129> on<00:06:02.279> the<00:06:02.749> identifiable<00:06:03.749> on<00:06:03.869> the
