00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
had never left the corner so there's a

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.330 
had never left the corner so there's a
lot<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.560> controversy<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.650> there<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.009> it'd

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
lot of controversy in there and it'd

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.159 
lot of controversy in there and it'd
look<00:05:15.520> like<00:05:15.550> right<00:05:16.030> got<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.360> the<00:05:16.449> way<00:05:16.629> a<00:05:16.659> couple

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
look like right got in the way a couple

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.189 
look like right got in the way a couple
times<00:05:17.440> there<00:05:17.800> when<00:05:18.039> liberato<00:05:19.000> was<00:05:19.330> applying

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
times there when liberato was applying

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.629 
times there when liberato was applying
the<00:05:20.379> pressure<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.860> about<00:05:21.069> to<00:05:21.219> knock<00:05:21.370> him<00:05:21.520> out

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
the pressure and about to knock him out

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.580 
the pressure and about to knock him out
because<00:05:21.909> he<00:05:22.120> was<00:05:22.240> done<00:05:23.789> if<00:05:24.789> Andre<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:26.319> know<00:05:26.409> he

there's gonna be problems and both of

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.390 
there's gonna be problems and both of
those<00:05:56.139> all<00:05:56.440> three<00:05:56.740> of<00:05:56.770> those<00:05:56.889> guys<00:05:57.099> actually

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
those all three of those guys actually

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.490 
those all three of those guys actually
went<00:05:57.699> on<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:57.880> lose<00:05:58.029> to<00:05:58.090> the<00:05:58.479> guys<00:05:58.779> they<00:05:58.960> lost<00:05:59.199> to

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
went on to lose to the guys they lost to

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.309 
went on to lose to the guys they lost to
or<00:06:00.069> be<00:06:00.310> you<00:06:01.300> know<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.509> next<00:06:01.690> time<00:06:01.900> they<00:06:02.080> fall

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 
or be you know the next time they fall

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.459 
or be you know the next time they fall
and<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:04.330> think<00:06:04.630> that's<00:06:04.810> going<00:06:05.020> to<00:06:05.080> be<00:06:05.199> the<00:06:05.319> case

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
and I think that's going to be the case

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:10.800 
and I think that's going to be the case
here<00:06:05.529> I<00:06:06.009> think<00:06:07.110> liberto<00:06:08.110> is<00:06:08.699> going<00:06:09.699> to<00:06:09.880> push

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
here I think liberto is going to push

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.409 
here I think liberto is going to push
the<00:06:10.990> pace<00:06:11.199> and<00:06:11.590> he's<00:06:12.580> going<00:06:12.729> to<00:06:12.789> force<00:06:13.180> this

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
the pace and he's going to force this

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.930 
the pace and he's going to force this
man<00:06:13.690> fight<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.110> little<00:06:14.319> bit<00:06:14.560> more<00:06:14.740> not<00:06:15.699> going<00:06:15.849> to

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
man fight a little bit more not going to

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.939 
man fight a little bit more not going to
give<00:06:16.060> him<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.360> ability<00:06:16.569> to<00:06:16.870> run<00:06:17.050> because<00:06:17.770> he's

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
give him the ability to run because he's

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:20.279 
give him the ability to run because he's
not<00:06:18.130> really<00:06:18.340> an<00:06:18.490> athlete<00:06:18.880> so<00:06:19.150> he's<00:06:19.330> not<00:06:19.539> that

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:20.289 
not really an athlete so he's not that

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.260 
not really an athlete so he's not that
fast<00:06:20.940> and<00:06:21.940> I<00:06:22.870> think<00:06:23.139> he's<00:06:23.319> going<00:06:23.469> to<00:06:23.529> spark<00:06:23.949> out

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
fast and I think he's going to spark out

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.540 
fast and I think he's going to spark out
Butte<00:06:25.270> a<00:06:25.419> in<00:06:25.659> the<00:06:25.779> tenth<00:06:26.020> round<00:06:26.259> I<00:06:26.589> think<00:06:27.430> he

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
Butte a in the tenth round I think he

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.760 
Butte a in the tenth round I think he
closes<00:06:27.940> that<00:06:28.120> gap<00:06:28.360> he's<00:06:29.139> not<00:06:29.380> going<00:06:29.560> to<00:06:29.649> leave

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
closes that gap he's not going to leave

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.530 
closes that gap he's not going to leave
it<00:06:29.919> up<00:06:30.039> to<00:06:30.219> the

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
it up to the

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.400 
it up to the
he's<00:06:31.140> not<00:06:31.410> going<00:06:31.650> to<00:06:31.740> let<00:06:31.920> it<00:06:32.010> go<00:06:32.160> the<00:06:32.280> distance

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
he's not going to let it go the distance

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.690 
he's not going to let it go the distance
God<00:06:34.410> is<00:06:34.620> this<00:06:34.770> fight<00:06:34.980> back<00:06:35.220> in<00:06:35.400> his<00:06:35.490> hometown
