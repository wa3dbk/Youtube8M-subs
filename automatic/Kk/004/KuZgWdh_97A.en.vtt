00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
construction got really good features

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.910 
construction got really good features
and<00:00:39.000> finish<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:40.140> you'll<00:00:40.290> see<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> hooks

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and finish and then you'll see the hooks

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
and finish and then you'll see the hooks
are<00:00:41.790> tucked<00:00:42.120> away<00:00:42.300> under<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> under<00:00:43.410> the

edges of the plastic so what that means
is<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.539> passing<00:00:45.899> through<00:00:46.110> those<00:00:46.230> weeds

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
is when it's passing through those weeds

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.889

going to get hung up or if you make a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.619 
going to get hung up or if you make a
cast<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.489> lands<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.850> its<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.510> not

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
cast and it lands on its back it's not

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
cast and it lands on its back it's not

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
going to get snagged before it gets a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.000 
going to get snagged before it gets a
chance<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.820> write<00:00:54.000> itself<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.829> really

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
chance to write itself but what really

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
chance to write itself but what really
sets<00:00:56.340> these<00:00:56.489> lunker<00:00:56.850> frogs<00:00:57.149> apart<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
sets these lunker frogs apart is the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
sets these lunker frogs apart is the
anatomically<00:00:59.399> correct<00:00:59.609> legs<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
anatomically correct legs and the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
anatomically correct legs and the
swimming<00:01:00.750> action<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.160> retrieve

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
swimming action so on the retrieve

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.210 
swimming action so on the retrieve
they'll<00:01:03.210> extend<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.019> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> pause<00:01:04.769> they'll

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
they'll extend and on the pause they'll

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
they'll extend and on the pause they'll
retract<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:07.080> else<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:08.040> else

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
retract but the what else is what else

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
retract but the what else is what else
is<00:01:08.310> really<00:01:08.520> cool<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> Frog<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.330> actually

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is really cool is the Frog will actually

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
is really cool is the Frog will actually
on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> pause<00:01:10.320> drop<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> little<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.430> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
on the pause drop down a little bit just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
on the pause drop down a little bit just
like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.790> frog<00:01:12.360> would<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.810> water

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
like a frog would in the water

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.149 
like a frog would in the water
so<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> frogs<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.850> available<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
so and then the frogs are available in

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.120 
so and then the frogs are available in
three<00:01:17.159> type<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> patterns<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.420> got

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
three type of patterns so you got

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.810 
three type of patterns so you got
natural<00:01:20.630> reaction<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.070> like<00:01:23.070> muddy<00:01:23.580> water

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
natural reaction and like muddy water

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
natural reaction and like muddy water
stain<00:01:24.180> water<00:01:24.450> type<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> patterns<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
stain water type of patterns the the the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520 
stain water type of patterns the the the
natural<00:01:29.130> finish<00:01:30.000> has<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> white<00:01:31.049> belly

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
natural finish has like a white belly

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.789 
natural finish has like a white belly
belly<00:01:32.280> function<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> undertone<00:01:33.799> there's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
belly function and undertone there's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
belly function and undertone there's
four<00:01:35.130> natural<00:01:35.460> colors<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.270> leopard<00:01:36.869> frog

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
four natural colors there's leopard frog

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.170 
four natural colors there's leopard frog
green<00:01:38.040> tea<00:01:38.369> rocky<00:01:39.060> toad<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.400> bullfrog<00:01:41.970> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
green tea rocky toad and bullfrog and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
green tea rocky toad and bullfrog and
then<00:01:42.450> there's<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.899> reaction<00:01:43.530> which<00:01:43.649> is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
then there's some reaction which is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
then there's some reaction which is
fire-bellied<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> poison<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.450> really

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
fire-bellied and poison which is really

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.240 
fire-bellied and poison which is really
unique<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> Cajun<00:01:46.710> color<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

unique because like a Cajun color that
you<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.490> normally<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.619> poison<00:01:49.619> dart

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
you don't normally see and poison dart

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.530 
you don't normally see and poison dart
frog<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.189> call<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.939> black<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.360> lots
