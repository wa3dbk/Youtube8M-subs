Duquette rods and this is a seven-foot

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
Duquette rods and this is a seven-foot
medium<00:01:33.450> power<00:01:33.600> rod<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.530> gives<00:01:34.740> me<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> little

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
medium power rod it gives me a little

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.980 
medium power rod it gives me a little
bit<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.400> backbone<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> gives<00:01:36.509> me<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
bit of backbone but it gives me a lot of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
bit of backbone but it gives me a lot of
tip<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.770> finesse<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.400> bait<00:01:38.759> into

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
tip to really finesse that bait into

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
tip to really finesse that bait into
there<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> i<00:01:39.960> kneaded<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.250> see

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
there is i kneaded into and you can see

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
there is i kneaded into and you can see
that<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.579> pen<00:01:41.850> test<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> rod<00:01:43.409> right

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that a pen test and this this rod right

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170 
that a pen test and this this rod right
here<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> been<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
here has got a lot of been to it so I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
here has got a lot of been to it so I
have<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> ability<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:45.990> get<00:01:46.200> these<00:01:46.409> these<00:01:46.740> fish

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
have the ability to get these these fish

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.740 
have the ability to get these these fish
out<00:01:47.250> without<00:01:47.490> breaking<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.909> line<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.600> then

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
out without breaking that line and then

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.460 
out without breaking that line and then
I'm<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.140> use<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.560> 2000<00:01:50.450> 3000
