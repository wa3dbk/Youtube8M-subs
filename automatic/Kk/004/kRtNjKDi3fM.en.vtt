Klein studios art lesson 11 in this
lesson<00:00:15.290> we're<00:00:15.440> going<00:00:15.559> to<00:00:15.650> begin<00:00:15.770> shading

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
lesson we're going to begin shading

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.790 
lesson we're going to begin shading
before<00:00:16.940> we<00:00:17.119> were<00:00:17.300> changing<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.410> weight<00:00:18.590> of

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
before we were changing the weight of

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.070 
before we were changing the weight of
lines<00:00:19.130> and<00:00:19.730> doing<00:00:19.939> analytical<00:00:20.540> line<00:00:20.750> drawing

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
lines and doing analytical line drawing

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.600 
lines and doing analytical line drawing
when<00:00:21.800> now<00:00:21.920> we're<00:00:22.099> actually<00:00:22.220> gonna<00:00:22.490> use

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
when now we're actually gonna use

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.940 
when now we're actually gonna use
greyscale<00:00:23.330> shading<00:00:23.930> with<00:00:24.230> graphite<00:00:24.740> or

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
greyscale shading with graphite or

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.260 
greyscale shading with graphite or
pencil<00:00:25.400> to<00:00:26.210> show<00:00:26.900> three<00:00:27.230> dimension<00:00:28.180> what<00:00:29.180> I'm

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
pencil to show three dimension what I'm

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.049 
pencil to show three dimension what I'm
gonna<00:00:29.390> do<00:00:29.660> is<00:00:30.039> explain<00:00:31.039> something<00:00:31.789> what<00:00:31.910> we're

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
gonna do is explain something what we're

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.270 
gonna do is explain something what we're
gonna<00:00:32.150> do<00:00:32.330> and<00:00:32.720> then<00:00:33.559> I'm<00:00:33.680> gonna<00:00:33.800> use<00:00:33.890> time

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
gonna do and then I'm gonna use time

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.939 
gonna do and then I'm gonna use time
lapse<00:00:34.580> to<00:00:35.330> speed<00:00:35.600> it<00:00:35.690> up<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.930> little<00:00:36.080> as<00:00:36.320> I<00:00:36.530> do<00:00:36.590> it

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
lapse to speed it up a little as I do it

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.570 
lapse to speed it up a little as I do it
and<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.059> return<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:38.690> normal<00:00:39.110> okay<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.250> things

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
and then return to normal okay so things

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.860 
and then return to normal okay so things
look<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.790> little<00:00:40.850> weird<00:00:41.150> it's<00:00:41.629> a<00:00:41.690> little

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
look a little weird it's a little

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.139 
look a little weird it's a little
experiment<00:00:42.379> here<00:00:42.440> okay<00:00:42.920> well<00:00:43.699> we're<00:00:43.820> gonna<00:00:43.880> do

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
experiment here okay well we're gonna do

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.420 
experiment here okay well we're gonna do
first<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.870> we're<00:00:45.020> gonna<00:00:45.110> start<00:00:45.530> with<00:00:45.800> creating

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
first is we're gonna start with creating

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.200 
first is we're gonna start with creating
a<00:00:46.760> grayscale<00:00:47.450> all<00:00:48.079> right<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.160> really<00:00:49.850> quickly

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
a grayscale all right so really quickly

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.959 
a grayscale all right so really quickly
here<00:00:50.570> we're<00:00:50.930> just<00:00:50.960> gonna<00:00:51.200> make<00:00:51.760> new<00:00:52.760> lines

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
here we're just gonna make new lines

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.920 
here we're just gonna make new lines
across<00:00:53.300> like<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.079> rectangle<00:00:55.539> across<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:56.750> top

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
across like a rectangle across the top

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.650 
across like a rectangle across the top
of<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.140> page<00:00:57.610> we're<00:00:58.610> gonna<00:00:58.700> draw<00:00:58.969> an<00:00:59.149> object

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
of the page we're gonna draw an object

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.990 
of the page we're gonna draw an object
and<00:01:00.020> shade<00:01:00.289> it<00:01:00.469> underneath<00:01:00.829> we're<00:01:01.670> gonna<00:01:01.760> use

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
and shade it underneath we're gonna use

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.320 
and shade it underneath we're gonna use
this<00:01:02.180> grayscale<00:01:02.750> as<00:01:02.930> a<00:01:02.960> reference<00:01:05.080> angle

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
this grayscale as a reference angle

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.240 
this grayscale as a reference angle
obviously<00:01:08.330> this<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.960> not<00:01:08.990> time-lapse<00:01:09.830> right

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
obviously this is not time-lapse right

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.029 
obviously this is not time-lapse right
now<00:01:10.690> okay<00:01:11.690> and<00:01:11.930> then<00:01:12.470> we're<00:01:12.590> going<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:12.740> divide

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:13.039 
now okay and then we're going to divide

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.410 
now okay and then we're going to divide
that<00:01:13.280> rectangle<00:01:14.090> up<00:01:14.240> into<00:01:14.869> boxes<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.880> line

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
that rectangle up into boxes so line

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.149 
that rectangle up into boxes so line
through<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.750> middle<00:01:19.659> line<00:01:20.659> in<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.799> center

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
through the middle line in the center

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:33.300 
through the middle line in the center
these<00:01:22.610> two<00:01:22.850> lines<00:01:24.159> now<00:01:25.159> we<00:01:25.220> have<00:01:25.369> four<00:01:25.640> squares

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.940 

those<00:01:34.310> squares<00:01:35.060> right<00:01:35.689> one<00:01:35.990> two<00:01:36.259> three<00:01:36.619> four

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
those squares right one two three four

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.539 
those squares right one two three four
five<00:01:37.280> six<00:01:37.610> seven<00:01:37.939> eight<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.590> first<00:01:39.890> square<00:01:40.189> is

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
five six seven eight the first square is

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.550 
five six seven eight the first square is
the<00:01:40.729> lightest<00:01:41.150> it<00:01:41.329> represents<00:01:41.960> white<00:01:42.229> so

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
the lightest it represents white so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.280 
the lightest it represents white so
we're<00:01:42.650> gonna<00:01:42.740> shade<00:01:43.460> it<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:44.299> very<00:01:44.659> light

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
we're gonna shade it it's very light

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.370 
we're gonna shade it it's very light
again<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.250> represents<00:01:46.729> white<00:01:46.939> and<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:48.110> last

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
again it represents white and the last

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.130 
again it represents white and the last
box<00:01:48.770> here<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.240> be<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.509> darkest<00:01:50.960> or

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
box here is going to be the darkest or

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.200 
box here is going to be the darkest or
representing<00:01:51.770> black<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.759> then<00:01:52.939> we're<00:01:53.060> going

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
representing black and then we're going

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.560 
representing black and then we're going
to<00:01:53.240> fill<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.540> everything<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.409> between<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.850> now

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
to fill in everything in between so now

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.590 
to fill in everything in between so now
for<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.020> time-lapse

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.710 

you

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.350 

okay<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:12.200> we<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.440> our<00:02:12.680> grayscale<00:02:13.550> news<00:02:13.970> OC

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
okay now we have our grayscale news OC

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.870 
okay now we have our grayscale news OC
each<00:02:15.020> block<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.590> gradually<00:02:16.070> going<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
each block is gradually going to the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.080 
each block is gradually going to the
darkest<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.650> it's<00:02:18.830> kind<00:02:19.070> of<00:02:19.130> creates<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.820> fade

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
darkest so it's kind of creates a fade

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.940 
darkest so it's kind of creates a fade
because<00:02:20.360> there's<00:02:20.660> only<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.960> slight<00:02:21.200> variation

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
because there's only a slight variation

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.440 
because there's only a slight variation
between<00:02:22.130> each<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.700> as<00:02:22.880> it<00:02:23.000> goes<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
between each one as it goes from the

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.260 
between each one as it goes from the
lightest<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.960> darkest<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.550> now<00:02:25.730> I'm<00:02:26.000> going

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
lightest to the darkest so now I'm going

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.800 
lightest to the darkest so now I'm going
to<00:02:26.390> show<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.080> how<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.320> shade<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:28.090> cylinder<00:02:29.090> okay

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
to show you how to shade a cylinder okay

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.720 
to show you how to shade a cylinder okay
like<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.260> did<00:02:30.410> before<00:02:30.530> with<00:02:31.010> analytical<00:02:31.550> line

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
like we did before with analytical line

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.220 
like we did before with analytical line
drawing<00:02:32.060> but<00:02:32.300> this<00:02:32.420> time<00:02:32.600> we're<00:02:32.780> shading<00:02:33.020> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
drawing but this time we're shading it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.170 
drawing but this time we're shading it
the<00:02:33.950> cylinder<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.490> gonna<00:02:34.670> have<00:02:34.850> one

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the cylinder is gonna have one

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.240 
the cylinder is gonna have one
directional<00:02:35.830> undetermined<00:02:36.830> light<00:02:36.950> source

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
directional undetermined light source

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.050 
directional undetermined light source
which<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.150> gonna<00:02:38.300> be<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.720> left<00:02:38.959> up<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.560> I

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
which is gonna be to the left up here I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.949 
which is gonna be to the left up here I
will<00:02:41.060> draw<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.270> light<00:02:41.600> bulb<00:02:41.810> here<00:02:45.459> okay<00:02:46.959> he's

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
will draw a light bulb here okay he's

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.729 
will draw a light bulb here okay he's
coming<00:02:48.170> from<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:49.489> upper<00:02:49.820> left<00:02:50.180> side<00:02:50.570> here<00:02:50.930> to

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
coming from the upper left side here to

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.640 
coming from the upper left side here to
the<00:02:51.890> front<00:02:52.130> toward<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> front<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.480> object

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the front toward the front of the object

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.430 
the front toward the front of the object
so<00:02:54.650> what<00:02:55.100> I'm<00:02:55.190> gonna<00:02:55.310> do<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.850> first<00:02:56.840> draw<00:02:57.140> an

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
so what I'm gonna do is first draw an

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.060 
so what I'm gonna do is first draw an
oval<00:02:57.620> or<00:02:58.040> a<00:02:58.070> can<00:02:59.320> lately<00:03:00.320> like<00:03:00.709> we<00:03:00.830> did<00:03:00.980> with

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
oval or a can lately like we did with

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.860 
oval or a can lately like we did with
that<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.370> local<00:03:01.610> line<00:03:01.760> drawing<00:03:02.120> not<00:03:02.360> dark<00:03:02.690> in

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
that and local line drawing not dark in

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.449 
that and local line drawing not dark in
any<00:03:03.080> other<00:03:03.290> lines<00:03:04.330> so<00:03:05.330> oval<00:03:05.780> at<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.020> top<00:03:09.459> two

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
any other lines so oval at the top two

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.700 
any other lines so oval at the top two
straight<00:03:10.850> sides

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:22.960 

and<00:03:16.710> again<00:03:17.600> when<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.720> shows<00:03:18.990> up

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.380 

I'm<00:03:23.480> gonna<00:03:23.630> stop<00:03:24.550> so<00:03:25.550> there's<00:03:25.760> no<00:03:25.970> evil

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
I'm gonna stop so there's no evil

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.100 
I'm gonna stop so there's no evil
I'm<00:03:26.720> gonna<00:03:26.930> make<00:03:27.170> mine<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.680> little<00:03:28.130> darker<00:03:29.110> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
I'm gonna make mine a little darker so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.740 
I'm gonna make mine a little darker so
that<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.440> can<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:30.920> in<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> video<00:03:31.750> before

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
that you can see it in the video before

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.250 
that you can see it in the video before
I<00:03:32.780> start<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:33.260> shading<00:03:35.920> okay<00:03:38.020> and<00:03:39.020> then<00:03:39.140> what

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
I start the shading okay and then what

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.930 
I start the shading okay and then what
I'm<00:03:39.350> gonna<00:03:39.500> do<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:39.860> erase<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.400> top<00:03:40.610> with<00:03:40.850> the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
I'm gonna do is erase the top with the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.330 
I'm gonna do is erase the top with the
bottom<00:03:41.330> oval<00:03:41.690> because<00:03:42.410> it's<00:03:42.590> no<00:03:42.740> longer<00:03:42.770> glass

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
bottom oval because it's no longer glass

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.320 
bottom oval because it's no longer glass
we're<00:03:43.730> shading<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.240> solid<00:03:44.710> cylinder<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:47.270> I

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
we're shading a solid cylinder but I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.570 
we're shading a solid cylinder but I
draw<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.780> whole<00:03:48.050> oval<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.130> I<00:03:49.160> can<00:03:49.460> get

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
draw the whole oval so that I can get

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.790 
draw the whole oval so that I can get
the<00:03:49.730> curve<00:03:49.910> at<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.180> bottom<00:03:50.300> correct<00:03:50.810> so<00:03:51.650> now

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
the curve at the bottom correct so now

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.820 
the curve at the bottom correct so now
we<00:03:51.860> have<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.370> can<00:03:53.020> the<00:03:54.020> lights<00:03:54.290> gonna<00:03:54.590> hit

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
we have a can the lights gonna hit

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.920 
we have a can the lights gonna hit
toward<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.400> top<00:03:55.610> in<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.850> front<00:03:56.120> so<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.660> top

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
toward the top in the front so the top

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.070 
toward the top in the front so the top
plane<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.950> simply<00:03:58.490> going<00:03:58.700> to<00:03:58.820> be<00:03:59.000> a<00:03:59.360> very<00:03:59.840> light

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
plane is simply going to be a very light

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.110 
plane is simply going to be a very light
shade<00:04:00.410> because<00:04:00.800> it's<00:04:01.070> a<00:04:01.160> flat<00:04:01.459> plane<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.030> is

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
shade because it's a flat plane and is

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.600 
shade because it's a flat plane and is
getting<00:04:02.300> a<00:04:02.510> lot<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.690> light<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.890> then<00:04:04.220> here

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
getting a lot of light and then here

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.900 
getting a lot of light and then here
from<00:04:04.970> left<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:05.870> right<00:04:06.230> it's<00:04:07.040> gonna<00:04:07.250> go<00:04:07.550> around

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
from left to right it's gonna go around

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.000 
from left to right it's gonna go around
the<00:04:08.090> object<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.600> lights<00:04:08.840> hitting<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.320> so<00:04:09.860> it's

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
the object the lights hitting it so it's

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.340 
the object the lights hitting it so it's
going<00:04:10.280> from<00:04:10.430> light<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.270> dark<00:04:11.570> just<00:04:11.990> like<00:04:12.170> up

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
going from light to dark just like up

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.120 
going from light to dark just like up
here<00:04:12.740> across<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:14.240> front<00:04:14.770> what's<00:04:15.770> gonna<00:04:15.920> be

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
here across the front what's gonna be

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.650 
here across the front what's gonna be
different<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.820> there's<00:04:17.090> something<00:04:17.330> called<00:04:17.570> a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
different is there's something called a

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.960 
different is there's something called a
reflective<00:04:18.200> edge<00:04:18.380> when<00:04:19.220> light<00:04:19.430> hits<00:04:19.640> the

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
reflective edge when light hits the

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.880 
reflective edge when light hits the
table<00:04:20.450> or<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.630> surface<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.350> bounces<00:04:21.859> around

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
table or the surface it bounces around

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.000 
table or the surface it bounces around
off<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.460> wall<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.690> reflects<00:04:24.080> back<00:04:24.380> onto<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
off the wall and reflects back onto the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.030 
off the wall and reflects back onto the
object<00:04:25.190> so<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.870> gonna<00:04:26.990> go<00:04:27.200> from<00:04:27.500> light<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
object so this is gonna go from light to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.640 
object so this is gonna go from light to
dark<00:04:28.400> but<00:04:28.850> then<00:04:29.060> just<00:04:29.360> toward<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.780> edge<00:04:29.960> it's

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
dark but then just toward the edge it's

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.800 
dark but then just toward the edge it's
gonna<00:04:30.830> be<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.040> little<00:04:31.490> lighter<00:04:31.790> than<00:04:32.419> the<00:04:32.540> dark

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
gonna be a little lighter than the dark

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.140 
gonna be a little lighter than the dark
so<00:04:33.530> it's<00:04:33.680> gonna<00:04:33.800> go<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.130> this<00:04:34.430> dark<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:35.000> then

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
so it's gonna go to this dark and then

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.680 
so it's gonna go to this dark and then
back<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.450> this<00:04:35.930> where<00:04:36.860> it's<00:04:36.980> a<00:04:37.070> little<00:04:37.190> lighter

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
back to this where it's a little lighter

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.810 
back to this where it's a little lighter
right<00:04:38.690> at<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.960> edge<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:40.190> opposite<00:04:40.700> is

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
right at the edge the opposite is

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.700 
right at the edge the opposite is
happening<00:04:40.850> on<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.570> side<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.169> light<00:04:42.380> side

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
happening on this side the light side

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.000 
happening on this side the light side
there's<00:04:43.550> gonna<00:04:43.700> be<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.000> slight<00:04:44.770> darker<00:04:45.770> shade

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
there's gonna be a slight darker shade

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.390 
there's gonna be a slight darker shade
like<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:46.729> one<00:04:47.260> edge<00:04:48.260> down<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:49.040> front<00:04:49.250> here

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
like this one edge down the front here

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.210 
like this one edge down the front here
because<00:04:50.030> it's<00:04:50.180> starting<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.690> roll<00:04:50.960> around<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
because it's starting to roll around the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.520 
because it's starting to roll around the
back<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:53.330> it's<00:04:53.479> not<00:04:53.600> gonna<00:04:53.810> be<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.200> lightest

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
back so it's not gonna be the lightest

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.490 
back so it's not gonna be the lightest
because<00:04:54.680> again<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.040> light<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.400> hitting<00:04:55.580> here

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
because again the light is hitting here

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.700 
because again the light is hitting here
okay

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
okay

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.250 
okay
no<00:04:58.490> we're<00:04:58.820> gonna<00:04:58.940> do<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.360> I'm<00:04:59.900> gonna<00:05:00.050> do<00:05:00.169> the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
no we're gonna do the I'm gonna do the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:09.430 
no we're gonna do the I'm gonna do the
time-lapse<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:01.070> show<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:01.610> how<00:05:01.790> it's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:18.120 

you

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.520 

okay<00:05:19.130> now<00:05:19.670> you'll<00:05:19.880> notice<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.480> there's<00:05:21.320> the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
okay now you'll notice that there's the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.230 
okay now you'll notice that there's the
reflective<00:05:22.100> edge<00:05:22.250> is<00:05:22.490> slightly<00:05:22.940> later<00:05:23.150> than

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
reflective edge is slightly later than

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.700 
reflective edge is slightly later than
the<00:05:23.480> dark<00:05:23.690> side<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.200> this<00:05:24.290> is<00:05:24.350> slightly

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
the dark side and this is slightly

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.310 
the dark side and this is slightly
darker<00:05:25.250> than<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.550> light<00:05:25.730> side<00:05:26.000> here<00:05:26.330> now<00:05:27.260> we

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
darker than the light side here now we

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.470 
darker than the light side here now we
want<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.680> sit<00:05:27.890> this<00:05:28.130> cylinder<00:05:28.670> on<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:28.880> surface

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
want to sit this cylinder on the surface

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.180 
want to sit this cylinder on the surface
and<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.350> way<00:05:30.440> we're<00:05:30.560> going<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.740> sit<00:05:30.890> it<00:05:30.980> on<00:05:31.040> the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
and the way we're going to sit it on the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.710 
and the way we're going to sit it on the
surface<00:05:31.400> and<00:05:31.610> I<00:05:31.790> don't<00:05:31.850> need<00:05:32.030> time<00:05:32.240> ups<00:05:32.510> with

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
surface and I don't need time ups with

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.570 
surface and I don't need time ups with
this<00:05:32.870> is<00:05:33.500> we're<00:05:33.650> gonna<00:05:33.770> make<00:05:33.980> it<00:05:34.130> nice<00:05:34.280> and

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
this is we're gonna make it nice and

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.920 
this is we're gonna make it nice and
dark<00:05:34.820> here<00:05:35.540> at<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.870> bottom<00:05:36.290> back<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:37.010> forth

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
dark here at the bottom back and forth

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.490 
dark here at the bottom back and forth
where<00:05:38.930> it's<00:05:39.050> sitting<00:05:39.290> on<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.650> surface<00:05:41.500> just

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
where it's sitting on the surface just

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.090 
where it's sitting on the surface just
again<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.800> line<00:05:43.280> drawing<00:05:43.640> back<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:44.180> forth<00:05:45.100> till

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
again a line drawing back and forth till

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.580 
again a line drawing back and forth till
shows<00:05:46.460> up<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:50.300> next<00:05:50.330> part<00:05:50.750> is<00:05:50.960> going<00:05:51.170> to<00:05:51.290> be<00:05:51.440> a

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
shows up the next part is going to be a

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.590 
shows up the next part is going to be a
shadow<00:05:51.980> so<00:05:52.700> what<00:05:52.790> I'm<00:05:52.910> gonna<00:05:53.000> do<00:05:53.270> is<00:05:53.390> I'm<00:05:53.510> gonna

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
shadow so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.860 
shadow so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
draw<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:54.770> shadow<00:05:55.040> shape<00:05:55.430> first<00:05:55.850> and<00:05:56.300> then

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
draw the shadow shape first and then

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.470 
draw the shadow shape first and then
I'll<00:05:56.960> do<00:05:57.110> time<00:05:57.350> lapse<00:05:57.380> for<00:05:58.240> shading<00:05:59.240> it<00:05:59.330> in

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
I'll do time lapse for shading it in

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.140 
I'll do time lapse for shading it in
okay<00:06:00.350> there's<00:06:00.920> light<00:06:01.130> again<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.730> going<00:06:01.970> this

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
okay there's light again is going this

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.980 
okay there's light again is going this
direction<00:06:02.440> so<00:06:03.440> off<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.950> bottom<00:06:04.310> oval<00:06:04.990> now

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
direction so off the bottom oval now

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.840 
direction so off the bottom oval now
we're<00:06:06.200> just<00:06:06.290> gonna<00:06:06.410> pretend<00:06:06.590> it's<00:06:07.010> on<00:06:07.160> a<00:06:07.190> table

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
we're just gonna pretend it's on a table

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.520 
we're just gonna pretend it's on a table
that<00:06:08.180> there's<00:06:08.420> no<00:06:08.570> wall<00:06:08.840> we're<00:06:09.110> not<00:06:09.230> doing<00:06:09.470> a

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
that there's no wall we're not doing a

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.130 
that there's no wall we're not doing a
table<00:06:09.740> line<00:06:10.040> so<00:06:10.970> we'll<00:06:11.150> just<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.480> a<00:06:11.750> shadow

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
table line so we'll just have a shadow

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.050 
table line so we'll just have a shadow
run<00:06:12.440> out<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.650> bit<00:06:12.980> because<00:06:13.580> again<00:06:13.670> it's

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
run out a bit because again it's

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.000 
run out a bit because again it's
slightly<00:06:14.300> about<00:06:14.720> and<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:15.740> what's<00:06:15.860> gonna

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
slightly about and that what's gonna

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.530 
slightly about and that what's gonna
happen<00:06:16.370> it's<00:06:16.520> gonna<00:06:16.580> take<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.000> shape<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:17.450> this

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
happen it's gonna take the shape of this

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.110 
happen it's gonna take the shape of this
curve<00:06:17.870> or<00:06:18.260> it's<00:06:18.740> shining<00:06:19.010> down<00:06:19.190> on<00:06:19.370> it<00:06:19.670> it's

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
curve or it's shining down on it it's

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.680 
curve or it's shining down on it it's
just<00:06:20.180> gonna<00:06:20.390> start<00:06:20.750> out<00:06:20.930> straight<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:22.690> then

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
just gonna start out straight and then

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.240 
just gonna start out straight and then
it's<00:06:23.900> going<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.260> curve

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.680 

behind<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.180> object<00:06:31.100> so<00:06:32.100> I'm<00:06:32.190> just<00:06:32.400> drawing

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
behind the object so I'm just drawing

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.830 
behind the object so I'm just drawing
lightly<00:06:33.690> shape<00:06:34.650> of<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:34.980> shadow<00:06:35.360> now<00:06:36.360> shading

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
lightly shape of the shadow now shading

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.410 
lightly shape of the shadow now shading
the<00:06:36.930> shadow<00:06:37.250> can<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:38.340> see<00:06:38.520> my<00:06:38.700> hand<00:06:38.970> here<00:06:39.240> and

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
the shadow can you see my hand here and

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.990 
the shadow can you see my hand here and
the<00:06:39.540> shadow<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.930> my<00:06:40.140> hand<00:06:40.410> as<00:06:40.620> it<00:06:41.550> gets<00:06:41.700> closer

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
the shadow of my hand as it gets closer

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.480 
the shadow of my hand as it gets closer
to<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.330> paper<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:43.440> shadow<00:06:43.710> of<00:06:43.890> my<00:06:44.070> hand<00:06:44.280> gets

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
to the paper the shadow of my hand gets

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.980 
to the paper the shadow of my hand gets
sharper<00:06:45.030> and<00:06:45.240> more<00:06:45.300> clear<00:06:46.230> as<00:06:46.530> I<00:06:47.220> go<00:06:47.430> away<00:06:47.990> it

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
sharper and more clear as I go away it

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.020 
sharper and more clear as I go away it
starts<00:06:49.380> to<00:06:49.590> get<00:06:49.800> I<00:06:50.040> have<00:06:50.310> to<00:06:50.400> go<00:06:50.520> up<00:06:50.610> higher<00:06:50.850> so

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
starts to get I have to go up higher so

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.570 
starts to get I have to go up higher so
you<00:06:51.150> can<00:06:51.270> see<00:06:51.540> it<00:06:52.410> starts<00:06:52.710> to<00:06:52.830> get<00:06:52.980> fuzzy<00:06:53.370> err

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
you can see it starts to get fuzzy err

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.450 
you can see it starts to get fuzzy err
see<00:06:53.910> that<00:06:54.060> the<00:06:54.240> edges<00:06:54.510> start<00:06:54.870> to<00:06:54.900> fuzz<00:06:55.200> out

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
see that the edges start to fuzz out

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.740 
see that the edges start to fuzz out
same<00:06:56.460> thing<00:06:56.490> that<00:06:56.880> happens<00:06:57.240> with<00:06:57.390> my<00:06:57.510> shadow

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
same thing that happens with my shadow

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.620 
same thing that happens with my shadow
here<00:06:58.170> the<00:06:58.650> closer<00:06:59.010> it<00:06:59.310> is<00:06:59.340> to<00:06:59.490> the<00:06:59.640> object<00:07:00.210> the

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
here the closer it is to the object the

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.810 
here the closer it is to the object the
sharper<00:07:01.200> the<00:07:01.560> edges<00:07:01.920> are<00:07:02.070> and<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.280> darker<00:07:02.700> it

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
sharper the edges are and the darker it

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.970 
sharper the edges are and the darker it
is<00:07:02.850> and<00:07:03.420> as<00:07:03.570> it<00:07:03.720> goes<00:07:03.900> away<00:07:04.110> it'll<00:07:04.620> start<00:07:04.860> to

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
is and as it goes away it'll start to

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.520 
is and as it goes away it'll start to
blur<00:07:05.220> around<00:07:05.310> and<00:07:05.760> become<00:07:06.240> lighter<00:07:06.510> and<00:07:06.660> it'll

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
blur around and become lighter and it'll

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.500 
blur around and become lighter and it'll
do<00:07:07.650> it<00:07:07.770> in<00:07:07.860> a<00:07:07.950> fashion<00:07:08.220> a<00:07:08.550> curved<00:07:08.880> fashion

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
do it in a fashion a curved fashion
