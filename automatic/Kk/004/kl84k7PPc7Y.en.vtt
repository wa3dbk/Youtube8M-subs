00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.869

 of two new objects from back field 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:24.310
 this is worth two new recipes 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:28.270
 that one is the light of the iguana in English 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.310
 light of the iguana or the huayna I do not know 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.220
 how we pronounce it another gives equal to 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.970
 what 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.030

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.350
 cute the truth that if you have a 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.250
 angelical style character and others 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.360
 they are on their backs 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.130
 well without being too abul they hide 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.620
 too much demands so discretito in 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.520
 conditions I like much more 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.510
 Come on, it has slats for infusion, I do not know 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.180
 exactly that this one has because good 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.760
 the chats of the chat codes already 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.900
 you know that they work a little like 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 they want ok there's another one we have one of the 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.310
 guaira and another one of greens 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.619
 this was very very cool also the 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.780
 two are very cool designs and good 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.780
 news is that both have recipes 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.929
 of mystic forge is worth the recipes not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.789
 I'm going to put it down, it does not happen that what 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:38.159
 If you want to see what it is, take the 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.049
 name in English and you put it inside the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.740
 searcher of the English wiki that comes 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.100
 very well 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.310
 explained and others in the recipe rather 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.229
 it comes to be stone-like stones 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 loaded and all those of those that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.009
 several golds cost a new object that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 is done now with fabric things a 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.509
 ascended object of the fabrics a crystal 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.390
 of vision and then I think they are 50 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.330
 stones of these frosts that are bought 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.759
 who is where he grabs 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.920
 for one gold each I know that this recipe 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.280
 at least 50 hours are all 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.120
 materials the same thing you're going to see doing 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.180
 such a calculation has to come out by 70 75 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 hours buying everything the calculation very 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 approximate because I do not know the 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 exact quantities of the materials that 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 it's needed as I say if you want 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.470
 exactly the recipe as it is 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.210
 the wiki that looking for the name in English 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.740
 English water comes perfect and 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.810
 to explain within each 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.640
 materials and you will see the 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.080
 materials that make it up much more 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
 best of anything that I can 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.590
 put here in text is worth then that's 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.860
 everything as always to say that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.530
 the chats these we go the codes of 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.560
 chat I found them through red it 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.260
 and I will leave them in the description of the video 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.610
 so you can see them and try them on 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.590
 your character to see how you 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.930
 it remains before doing it I hope that you 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.270

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.450
