and natural powder yeah what did you

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.190 
and natural powder yeah what did you
think<00:01:06.220> well<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.360> use<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.720> I've<00:01:07.960> never

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
think well I have to use this I've never

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.650 
think well I have to use this I've never
I<00:01:08.260> don't<00:01:08.470> Germany's<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.160> rule<00:01:09.520> use<00:01:09.970> translucent

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
I don't Germany's a rule use translucent

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.600 
I don't Germany's a rule use translucent
powders<00:01:11.200> just<00:01:11.380> because<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:11.650> have<00:01:11.950> my<00:01:12.160> dry<00:01:12.340> skin

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
powders just because I have my dry skin

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.750 
powders just because I have my dry skin
so<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:12.850> tend<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.300> avoid<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:14.200> bar<00:01:14.610> because<00:01:15.610> I'm

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
so I tend to avoid the bar because I'm

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.310 
so I tend to avoid the bar because I'm
getting<00:01:16.000> a<00:01:16.180> bit<00:01:16.390> old<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:19.030> recommend<00:01:19.660> you<00:01:19.930> use

it when you are putting eyeshadow on do

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.330
