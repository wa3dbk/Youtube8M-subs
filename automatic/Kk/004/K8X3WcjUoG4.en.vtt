00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
and start creating that shape that I

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.190 
and start creating that shape that I
want<00:03:54.769> and<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:56.239> doesn't<00:03:56.359> matter<00:03:56.660> if<00:03:56.840> we<00:03:56.989> lose

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
want and it doesn't matter if we lose

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.050 
want and it doesn't matter if we lose
that<00:03:57.230> intensity<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.310> green<00:03:58.579> because<00:03:58.760> we

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
that intensity of the green because we

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.080 
that intensity of the green because we
will<00:03:59.299> go<00:03:59.450> back<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.989> apply<00:04:00.319> a<00:04:00.349> little<00:04:00.530> bit<00:04:00.859> more

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
will go back and apply a little bit more

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.500 
will go back and apply a little bit more
just<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.269> intensify<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:02.930> you<00:04:03.109> guys<00:04:03.260> can<00:04:03.530> see

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
just to intensify it as you guys can see

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.059 
just to intensify it as you guys can see
this<00:04:05.510> is<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.810> easiest<00:04:06.139> way<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:06.319> can<00:04:06.410> find<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.950> do

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
this is the easiest way I can find to do

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.909 
this is the easiest way I can find to do
a<00:04:07.099> cut<00:04:07.459> crease<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.120> used<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.930> be<00:04:09.079> pro<00:04:09.440> at<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.769> and

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
a cut crease I used to be pro at it and

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.800 
a cut crease I used to be pro at it and
now<00:04:09.980> it's<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.730> hard<00:04:10.940> for<00:04:11.120> me<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.389> do<00:04:11.599> one
