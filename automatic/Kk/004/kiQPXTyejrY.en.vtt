00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.159 
my little hungry knees the sauce
thickened<00:05:32.580> up<00:05:32.700> too<00:05:32.940> much<00:05:33.210> so<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:33.540> warmed<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.050> up

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
thickened up too much so I warmed it up

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.890 
thickened up too much so I warmed it up
and<00:05:34.440> poured<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:34.950> over<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.580> top<00:05:35.610> I<00:05:36.120> really

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
and poured it all over the top I really

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.020 
and poured it all over the top I really
wish<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.320> would<00:05:37.560> have<00:05:37.590> had<00:05:37.860> some<00:05:38.100> scallions<00:05:38.760> for

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
wish I would have had some scallions for

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.510 
wish I would have had some scallions for
the<00:05:39.150> top<00:05:39.390> but<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.020> didn't<00:05:40.620> so<00:05:40.890> I<00:05:40.919> sprinkled<00:05:41.460> some

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
the top but I didn't so I sprinkled some

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.110 
the top but I didn't so I sprinkled some
cilantro<00:05:42.330> on<00:05:42.510> top<00:05:42.780> use<00:05:43.620> parsley<00:05:44.340> if<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:44.790> think

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
cilantro on top use parsley if you think

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.930 
cilantro on top use parsley if you think
cilantro<00:05:45.720> tastes<00:05:46.169> like<00:05:46.350> soap<00:05:46.800> how<00:05:47.370> did<00:05:47.640> that

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
cilantro tastes like soap how did that

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.270 
cilantro tastes like soap how did that
start<00:05:48.210> happening<00:05:48.510> by<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:48.960> way<00:05:49.230> how<00:05:49.560> can<00:05:49.620> so

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
start happening by the way how can so

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.490 
start happening by the way how can so
many<00:05:50.460> people<00:05:50.970> say<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.390> cilantro<00:05:51.750> tastes<00:05:52.320> like

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500

soap<00:05:52.860> I<00:05:53.130> think<00:05:53.940> some<00:05:54.180> people<00:05:54.419> probably<00:05:54.840> do

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
soap I think some people probably do

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.500 
soap I think some people probably do
feel<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.740> way<00:05:55.950> but<00:05:56.340> there<00:05:56.550> are<00:05:56.760> some<00:05:57.270> that

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
feel that way but there are some that

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.600 
feel that way but there are some that
