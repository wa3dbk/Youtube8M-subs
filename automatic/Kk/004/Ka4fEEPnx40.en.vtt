00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
really need the back screen for this

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.120 
really need the back screen for this
game<00:04:25.600> but<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.960> i'm<00:04:26.500> pretty<00:04:26.710> sure<00:04:26.860> they'll<00:04:27.040> have

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
game but I i'm pretty sure they'll have

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.740 
game but I i'm pretty sure they'll have
better<00:04:27.310> games<00:04:27.640> but<00:04:28.540> you<00:04:28.990> know<00:04:29.620> how<00:04:29.770> they<00:04:29.950> had

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
better games but you know how they had

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.780 
better games but you know how they had
the<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:32.080> Xbox<00:04:32.620> Kinect<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.250> they<00:04:33.520> didn't<00:04:33.760> know

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
the the Xbox Kinect and they didn't know

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.670 
the the Xbox Kinect and they didn't know
what<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.150> do<00:04:34.270> with<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.510> camera<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.140> I<00:04:35.500> don't

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
what to do with the camera and I don't

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.020

think they still know how to do with
what<00:04:37.570> they<00:04:37.780> do<00:04:37.840> with<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.230> but<00:04:38.260> it's<00:04:38.800> kind<00:04:38.980> of

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
what they do with it but it's kind of
