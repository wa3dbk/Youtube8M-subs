damage<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.600> blaziken<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.950> guess

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
damage from this blaziken now I guess

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.400 
damage from this blaziken now I guess
it's<00:00:47.309> fortunate<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.910> me<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.960> he

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's fortunate for me is that he

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.619 
it's fortunate for me is that he
actually<00:00:49.620> does<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.850> his<00:00:51.059> Meister<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually does not have his Meister on

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930 
actually does not have his Meister on
him<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.989> guess<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> was<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.280> he

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
him and I guess that was because like he

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.459 
him and I guess that was because like he
took<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> off<00:00:54.390> maybe<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> different<00:00:55.170> battle

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
took it off maybe for a different battle

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.170 
took it off maybe for a different battle
because<00:00:55.710> maybe<00:00:55.860> had<00:00:56.100> something<00:00:56.489> else<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> he

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
because maybe had something else that he

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.220 
because maybe had something else that he
want<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> make<00:00:57.510> evolve<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:57.989> something<00:00:58.170> like

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
want to make evolve or something like

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
want to make evolve or something like
that<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.820> too

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
