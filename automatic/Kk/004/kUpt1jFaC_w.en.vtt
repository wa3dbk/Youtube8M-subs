00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
that's my suggestion to God
and<00:01:52.909> trust<00:01:53.909> me<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.299> work<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.470> see

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
and trust me it will work as you can see

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.010 
and trust me it will work as you can see
here

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
here

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.450 
here
so<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> key<00:01:58.619> possession<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.340> us

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
so there's a key possession for us

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
so there's a key possession for us
because<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.030> need<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.570> hold<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> lead

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because we need this to hold the lead

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
because we need this to hold the lead
and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.729> down<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.180> time-outs<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:05.630> mean

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and then down the two time-outs I mean

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.749 
and then down the two time-outs I mean
this<00:02:06.750> burns<00:02:07.020> down<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.500> need<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> I'm

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this burns down here I need it and I'm

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.130 
this burns down here I need it and I'm
cut<00:02:09.030> short<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.599> hopefully<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.020> gonna

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
cut short so hopefully I'm gonna

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.680 
cut short so hopefully I'm gonna
simulate<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.649> hopefully<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.099> get<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> win<00:02:11.690> there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
simulate a hopefully I get to win there

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.330
