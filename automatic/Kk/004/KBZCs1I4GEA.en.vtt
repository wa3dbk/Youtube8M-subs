00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 it was a little bit of time again 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.400
 to present finger food and indeed 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.930
 I would like to give you the nuclear weapons 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.280
 seen heart show that we are for it 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.650
 ingredients are needed as well as the whole 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.650
 you'll see right now 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.890
 which we definitely need 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.180
 sensible pendulum 300 grams fresh 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.120
 rainer bruns i have mine now 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.930
 papa workshop with related and who have 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.550
 it really in itself 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 what else do we need for that, and indeed 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.840
 I have here now for three babies 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.000
 and salamis decided 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.070
 you can also mini caravan alternatively 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.660
 use ossis and then halve them 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.070
 the karla pendels are also filled 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.720
 they are filled with fresh cheese and 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.850
 Although 200 grams in number 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.320
 what you need best for that 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.450
 this cream cheese has the certain kick 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.600
 giving is a very good native 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.550
 olive oil and something off me 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.150
 now here for the accord barbecue 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.589
 decided 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.089
 Let's start with that first 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.820
 He has to finish fresh cheeses 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.500
 as I said this little tip 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.630
 just to the cream cheese with the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
 extend olive oil and the wheel and only 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.930
 set aside for now come now 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.640
 to the sausages the desert we have to 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.260
 halve and halve that again 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.909
 means that he dresses such a piece 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.860
 had those in the hallertau news then 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.479
 on top of it, no matter if mobile phones themselves 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.800
 then we have to halve once so that 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.659
 We then put the core in the middle 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.759
 just hold spoon hand 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.469
 Need to scratch out and that works 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.740
 quite simply here then starts back 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.450
 with the spoon on gambling to main 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
 push and then he just pulls that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.689
 all the way out and you already have 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.829
 the whole core case out if now 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.140
 could have taken out the little one 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.700
 her in there was my dream 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.750
 now just the cream cheese we 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 have mixed friends together 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.969
 fill in and then it goes in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.159
 principle for the little salamis on 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.780
 you have then the salami done to also 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.149
 I have a very important ingredient 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.890
 forget and you need a basin 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.479
 for the number of the 300 program haller 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.240
 I have pennies here now 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.149
 I'll say about twelve to fifteen 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.219
 slices basin and we develop that 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.020
 now just that that just means 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.579
 the happinger wrap around so that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.720
 we have a closed ceiling upstairs 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.120
 Then we come to the barbecue 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.930
 Grilling is indirectly 180 to 200 degrees 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 for me say 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.180
 so maximum could be so long 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.549
 let it turn 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.689
 the degree of the way for you optimally 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.849
 But I always leave them in between 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.500
 15 and 20 minutes in there at the 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.510
 temperature then they would actually be 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.299
 already done so that's it 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.459
 video to the atomic buffalo tools though 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.840
 please be careful the things are real 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.250
 in itself I hope the video has you 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.090
 please if yes gives me a thumb 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 for this video 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.659
 if you have not already done so carpet 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.459
 subscribe he finds exactly below me 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.750
