00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
overall yeah well kind of is but just

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.640 
overall yeah well kind of is but just
still<00:02:21.150> about<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> front<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:21.989> really

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
still about the front I just really

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
still about the front I just really
don't<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.400> front<00:02:23.670> design<00:02:23.849> anymore

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
don't want this front design anymore

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.000 
don't want this front design anymore
it's<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.690> making<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.290> truck<00:02:25.590> look<00:02:25.799> awkward

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
it's just making the truck look awkward

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
it's just making the truck look awkward
and<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.519> think<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:26.970> really<00:02:27.299> should<00:02:27.540> have<00:02:27.720> this

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
and I think it really should have this

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
and I think it really should have this
more<00:02:28.680> like<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> Chevy<00:02:29.190> Silverado<00:02:29.280> thing

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
more like the Chevy Silverado thing

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.839 
more like the Chevy Silverado thing
that's<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.080> thing<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.380> gets<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.640> nerves

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
that's the thing that gets on the nerves

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.309 
that's the thing that gets on the nerves
about<00:02:33.120> how<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.450> Worcester<00:02:33.750> gem<00:02:33.930> sometimes

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
about how it was Worcester gem sometimes

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.620 
about how it was Worcester gem sometimes
they<00:02:34.410> don't<00:02:34.590> give<00:02:34.739> out<00:02:34.769> realistic<00:02:35.640> designs<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
they don't give out realistic designs of

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
they don't give out realistic designs of
the<00:02:36.720> front<00:02:37.049> or<00:02:37.230> whatever<00:02:37.620> parts<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.130> body

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
the front or whatever parts of the body

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.199 
the front or whatever parts of the body
but<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.299> does<00:02:39.480> match<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.989> perfect<00:02:40.560> okay<00:02:41.340> we

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
but it does match it perfect okay we

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.900 
but it does match it perfect okay we
have<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> Eagle<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.769> top<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.400> flag<00:02:44.700> right
