 challenge of charly charly help or yesterday what 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.420
 I did it because it is quite convenient since 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.099
 Many people have told me that he plays 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.160
 the ouija and every time I say good 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.810
 send me money or buy me do not give me the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.380
 they send so this turned out pretty 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 time to do and I tried it here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.619

 let's try 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.620
 putting it like this 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:20.740
 we have possibilities to move 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.740
 charly charly you are here 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.010

 charly charly are you here 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.670
 you're here to Richard Lee 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.240
 charly charly pure pure pure 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.230
 pure salty nonsense there is your 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.629
 talk and talk 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.400
 the truth is that it is one of the many 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.930
 nonsense that have spread by 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.239
 internet and that many people 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.299
 Suggested perhaps with movements 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.510
 abrupt the vibrations of these same 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.640
 the air precisely the most place the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.950
 moment when he took to move by 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.349
 one or another reason that surely 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.840
 It has an explanation if it lives in the context 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:15.200
 of the videos but when you do it right 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.930
 and you're there waiting for some reason 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.889
 by which a spirit tells you or you 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.190
 move some good little handles let's go 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.190
 really 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.580
 they can not believe in this kind of thing 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.349
 well because I keep thinking or tempting to doubt 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.969
 that there really is some power 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.159
 supernatural that is dying and that 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.020
 be a spirit there in the game 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.599
 moving scared him half the world by 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.699
 please this charly charly and there is a 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.789
 turn you're here or whatever this is 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.680
 project is a farce is nonsense and 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.870
 It is something that became very same as 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.650
 of the dress so I'll see you in the 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.870
 next antihero video and please 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.180
 I usually do not wear it at the end of 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.310
 week my university to play a little 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.310
