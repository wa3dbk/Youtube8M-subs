00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
full up about 1/3 the way through just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.630 
full up about 1/3 the way through just
like<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> example<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.649> showed<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.860> then

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like that example that I showed you then

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
like that example that I showed you then
we're<00:01:44.729> gonna<00:01:44.820> spread<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
half inch thick the 1/2 inch of dough

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
half inch thick the 1/2 inch of dough
seems<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> best<00:01:50.759> example<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.540> your
