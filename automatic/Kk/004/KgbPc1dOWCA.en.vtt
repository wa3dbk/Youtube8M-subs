and<00:01:54.910> toothpicks<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:58.040> you'll<00:01:58.490> also<00:01:58.640> need<00:01:58.940> a

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
and toothpicks and you'll also need a

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500 
and toothpicks and you'll also need a
metal<00:01:59.600> ruler<00:02:00.190> just<00:02:01.190> pretend<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.240> this

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
metal ruler just pretend that this

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.050 
metal ruler just pretend that this
t-square<00:02:03.290> part<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:03.800> not<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.820> here<00:02:05.560> just<00:02:06.560> need<00:02:06.770> a

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
t-square part is not on here just need a

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.510 
t-square part is not on here just need a
heavy-duty<00:02:08.080> metal<00:02:09.080> ruler<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.649> we'll<00:02:10.429> be

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
heavy-duty metal ruler and we'll be

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.490 
heavy-duty metal ruler and we'll be
using<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.209> chip<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.600> some<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.080> edges

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
using that to chip off some of the edges

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.070 
using that to chip off some of the edges
that<00:02:13.300> actually<00:02:14.300> makes<00:02:14.480> some<00:02:14.600> really<00:02:14.900> nice

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that actually makes some really nice

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.440 
that actually makes some really nice
cuts<00:02:15.500> where<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.340> want<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.670> rip<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.030> foam<00:02:17.209> off

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
cuts where you want to rip the foam off

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.780 
cuts where you want to rip the foam off
instead<00:02:17.840> of<00:02:17.959> using<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.950> your<00:02:19.100> razor<00:02:19.310> blade<00:02:19.610> to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
instead of using so your razor blade to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.720 
instead of using so your razor blade to
get<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> really<00:02:20.600> sharp<00:02:20.870> cut<00:02:21.140> so<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.730> works

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
get a really sharp cut so that works

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.150 
get a really sharp cut so that works
well<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:25.400> will<00:02:25.489> also<00:02:25.700> need<00:02:26.150> some<00:02:27.760> foam

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
well and you will also need some foam

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.330 
well and you will also need some foam
I'm<00:02:31.160> going<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.760> be<00:02:31.880> using<00:02:32.709> one<00:02:33.709> piece<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
I'm going to be using one piece of the

you can use the 3/4 inch foam if you
would<00:02:42.860> rather<00:02:43.040> use<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:44.030> instead<00:02:44.799> doesn't

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
would rather use that instead doesn't

have to be the two-inch or you can mix
and<00:02:47.959> match<00:02:48.019> if<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.760> throw<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.150> some

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
three-quarter inch but I'm just going to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.979 
three-quarter inch but I'm just going to
be<00:02:56.660> using<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.110> four<00:02:58.330> 2-inch<00:02:59.330> pieces<00:02:59.540> for<00:02:59.870> this

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
be using the four 2-inch pieces for this

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.070 
be using the four 2-inch pieces for this
part

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
part

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.400 
part
so<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.800> first<00:03:02.980> thing<00:03:03.160> we<00:03:03.280> need<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.460> do<00:03:04.410> sitting

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
so the first thing we need to do sitting

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.770 
so the first thing we need to do sitting
leaves<00:03:05.590> aside<00:03:05.890> for<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.220> moment<00:03:06.310> is<00:03:07.090> decide<00:03:07.540> how

leaves aside for a moment is decide how

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.380 
leaves aside for a moment is decide how
big<00:03:07.960> we<00:03:08.140> want<00:03:08.320> our<00:03:08.440> base<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.860> be<00:03:09.060> I've<00:03:10.060> decided

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
big we want our base to be I've decided

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.500 
big we want our base to be I've decided
to<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:10.690> with<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.960> 3/4<00:03:11.500> inch<00:03:11.610> phone<00:03:12.610> base<00:03:12.910> you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
to go with the 3/4 inch phone base you

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.650 
to go with the 3/4 inch phone base you
can<00:03:13.690> use<00:03:13.720> MDF<00:03:14.500> if<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.980> prefer<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:16.330> reason

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
can use MDF if you prefer the reason

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.200 
can use MDF if you prefer the reason
that<00:03:16.810> I've<00:03:17.680> decided<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.190> go<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.370> this<00:03:18.640> over

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
that I've decided to go with this over

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.350 
that I've decided to go with this over
the<00:03:19.330> MDF<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:20.080> if<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.890> decide<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.250> cut<00:03:22.090> off<00:03:22.210> an

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
the MDF is if I decide to cut off an

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.240 
the MDF is if I decide to cut off an
edge<00:03:22.570> make<00:03:23.410> this<00:03:23.560> piece<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.800> little<00:03:24.010> bit

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
edge make this piece a little bit

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.700 
edge make this piece a little bit
smaller<00:03:24.580> it's<00:03:25.270> a<00:03:25.450> whole<00:03:25.690> lot<00:03:25.870> easier<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.440> do<00:03:26.590> it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
smaller it's a whole lot easier to do it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.520 
smaller it's a whole lot easier to do it
with<00:03:26.770> foam<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.880> sand<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.300> down<00:03:28.330> then<00:03:28.840> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
with foam and then sand it down then to

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.770 
with foam and then sand it down then to
you<00:03:30.520> know<00:03:30.610> get<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.880> project<00:03:31.300> on<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.690> then

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
you know get the project on and then

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.470 
you know get the project on and then
decide<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.130> want<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.400> cut<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.700> MDF<00:03:34.090> and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
decide that you want to cut the MDF and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.740 
decide that you want to cut the MDF and
it's<00:03:35.260> just<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.560> big<00:03:35.710> pain<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.070> butt<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
it's just a big pain in the butt the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.380 
it's just a big pain in the butt the
durability<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.350> fine<00:03:39.000> let<00:03:40.000> me<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.270> throw

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
durability is fine let me just throw

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.850 
durability is fine let me just throw
this<00:03:40.630> everywhere<00:03:41.460> this<00:03:42.460> is<00:03:42.520> very<00:03:43.510> sturdy<00:03:43.930> even

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
this everywhere this is very sturdy even

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.230 
this everywhere this is very sturdy even
though<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.100> looks<00:03:45.310> like<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.550> edge<00:03:45.880> may<00:03:46.180> be

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
though it looks like the edge may be

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.930 
though it looks like the edge may be
easy<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.660> chip<00:03:46.990> once<00:03:47.710> we<00:03:47.890> put<00:03:48.160> our<00:03:48.190> sealer<00:03:48.790> on

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
easy to chip once we put our sealer on

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.520 
easy to chip once we put our sealer on
top<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.300> this<00:03:49.450> that's<00:03:49.990> not<00:03:50.110> going<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.380> go

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
top of this that's not going to go

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.740 
top of this that's not going to go
anywhere<00:03:50.770> and<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.640> overall<00:03:52.090> piece<00:03:52.390> will<00:03:52.630> be

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
anywhere and the overall piece will be

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.930 
anywhere and the overall piece will be
lighter<00:03:53.020> also<00:03:53.590> using<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.130> as<00:03:54.400> opposed<00:03:54.850> to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
lighter also using this as opposed to

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.140 
lighter also using this as opposed to
the<00:03:55.060> MDF<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.310> what<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.340> did<00:03:57.490> was<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.820> take<00:03:57.970> an

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
the MDF so what I did was just take an

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.270 
the MDF so what I did was just take an
arbitrary<00:03:58.630> shape<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.230> drew<00:03:59.740> it<00:03:59.860> on<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.070> foam

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
arbitrary shape and drew it on the foam

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.130 
arbitrary shape and drew it on the foam
I<00:04:00.640> cut<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.210> out<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:02.220> used<00:04:03.220> my<00:04:03.750> sanding<00:04:04.750> pad

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
I cut it out and used my sanding pad

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.120 
I cut it out and used my sanding pad
slash<00:04:05.590> block<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.900> went<00:04:07.900> around<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.230> edges<00:04:08.680> to

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
slash block and went around the edges to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.229 
slash block and went around the edges to
give<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.380> rounded<00:04:11.380> surface<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.760> didn't<00:04:13.180> do

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
give it a rounded surface I didn't do

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.570 
give it a rounded surface I didn't do
that<00:04:13.360> on<00:04:13.420> camera<00:04:13.540> just<00:04:14.050> because<00:04:14.320> it's<00:04:14.560> such<00:04:15.550> a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
that on camera just because it's such a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.470 
that on camera just because it's such a
mess<00:04:16.109> sanding<00:04:17.109> all<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:17.320> crap<00:04:17.620> down<00:04:17.799> so

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
mess sanding all this crap down so

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.520 
mess sanding all this crap down so
that's<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.630> only<00:04:19.780> thing<00:04:19.900> you<00:04:20.140> need<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.320> do

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
that's the only thing you need to do

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.190 
that's the only thing you need to do
there<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.160> no<00:04:21.640> rhyme<00:04:22.270> or<00:04:22.300> reason<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:22.810> this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
there is no rhyme or reason to this

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.380 
there is no rhyme or reason to this
shape<00:04:23.710> or<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.340> size<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.180> just

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
shape or this size this is just

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.870 
shape or this size this is just
something<00:04:25.660> that<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.840> sketched<00:04:26.770> out<00:04:26.980> cut<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.640> and

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
something that I sketched out cut it and

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.720 
something that I sketched out cut it and
sand<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:29.740> was<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:30.010> first<00:04:30.250> step<00:04:30.460> and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
sand it so that was the first step and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.980 
sand it so that was the first step and
now<00:04:31.690> what<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:32.560> need<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.740> do<00:04:32.980> is<00:04:33.780> make<00:04:34.780> sure<00:04:34.810> that

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
now what we need to do is make sure that

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.850 
now what we need to do is make sure that
our<00:04:35.320> first<00:04:35.590> piece<00:04:36.030> will<00:04:37.030> fit<00:04:37.450> on<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:38.530> flat

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
our first piece will fit on the flat

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.170 
our first piece will fit on the flat
area<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.430> we've<00:04:39.550> sanded<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.150> to

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
area that we've sanded up to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.909 
area that we've sanded up to
doesn't<00:04:42.840> matter<00:04:42.990> if<00:04:43.169> it<00:04:43.290> goes<00:04:43.470> all<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.710> way<00:04:43.800> to

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
doesn't matter if it goes all the way to

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.909 
doesn't matter if it goes all the way to
here<00:04:44.340> here<00:04:44.910> like<00:04:45.600> this<00:04:46.110> size<00:04:46.350> doesn't<00:04:46.710> matter

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
here here like this size doesn't matter

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.340 
here here like this size doesn't matter
as<00:04:47.220> long<00:04:47.250> as<00:04:47.639> it<00:04:47.760> fits<00:04:48.030> on<00:04:48.360> the<00:04:48.630> flat<00:04:48.930> area

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
as long as it fits on the flat area

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.590 
as long as it fits on the flat area
we're<00:04:49.919> fine<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:51.470> looks<00:04:52.470> like<00:04:52.680> it<00:04:52.889> does<00:04:53.100> so

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
we're fine and looks like it does so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.500 
we're fine and looks like it does so
that's<00:04:54.600> it<00:04:54.930> for<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.060> other<00:04:57.240> three

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
that's it for this then the other three

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.170 
that's it for this then the other three
pieces<00:04:57.720> you<00:04:58.620> can<00:04:58.830> have<00:04:59.430> them<00:04:59.610> hang<00:04:59.820> off<00:04:59.970> the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
pieces you can have them hang off the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.430 
pieces you can have them hang off the
side<00:05:00.210> if<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.720> want<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.850> these<00:05:02.850> again

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
side if you want and these again

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.290 
side if you want and these again
arbitrary<00:05:04.440> old<00:05:05.070> pieces<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:05.940> just<00:05:06.120> had

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
arbitrary old pieces that I just had

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.710 
arbitrary old pieces that I just had
laying<00:05:06.510> around<00:05:08.150> we're<00:05:09.150> going<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.450> doing<00:05:09.570> a

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
laying around we're going to be doing a

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.830 
laying around we're going to be doing a
lot<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.900> carving<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.720> appearance<00:05:12.720> of

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
lot of carving so the appearance of

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.010 
lot of carving so the appearance of
these<00:05:13.020> really<00:05:13.740> makes<00:05:13.950> no<00:05:14.040> difference<00:05:14.250> at<00:05:14.520> all

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
these really makes no difference at all

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.150 
these really makes no difference at all
okay<00:05:16.020> we're<00:05:16.229> ready<00:05:16.350> to<00:05:16.560> start<00:05:16.740> gluing<00:05:16.889> our

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
okay we're ready to start gluing our

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.300 
okay we're ready to start gluing our
pieces<00:05:17.370> together<00:05:17.669> now<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:19.169> you<00:05:19.830> take<00:05:20.010> your<00:05:20.160> big

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
pieces together now so you take your big

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.280 
pieces together now so you take your big
piece<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.760> set<00:05:20.910> it<00:05:21.000> to<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.180> side<00:05:21.360> we<00:05:21.960> won't<00:05:22.200> be

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
piece and set it to the side we won't be

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.610 
piece and set it to the side we won't be
using<00:05:22.530> that<00:05:23.210> too<00:05:24.210> later<00:05:24.419> on<00:05:24.660> till<00:05:25.350> we<00:05:25.470> have

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
using that too later on till we have

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.159 
using that too later on till we have
everything<00:05:25.860> carved<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:27.060> I've<00:05:27.780> gone<00:05:27.930> ahead<00:05:27.990> and

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
everything carved so I've gone ahead and

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.340 
everything carved so I've gone ahead and
glued<00:05:28.470> this<00:05:28.680> first<00:05:28.950> piece<00:05:29.160> down<00:05:30.020> I'm<00:05:31.020> going<00:05:31.290> to

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
glued this first piece down I'm going to

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.600 
glued this first piece down I'm going to
take<00:05:31.470> the<00:05:31.560> second<00:05:31.860> piece<00:05:32.510> want<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.600> give<00:05:33.780> it<00:05:33.900> a

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
take the second piece want to give it a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.870 
take the second piece want to give it a
quick<00:05:35.610> run<00:05:36.229> with<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.350> sandpaper<00:05:37.740> to<00:05:38.610> break

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
quick run with the sandpaper to break

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.140 
quick run with the sandpaper to break
that<00:05:39.060> surface<00:05:39.479> tension<00:05:39.630> up<00:05:40.910> won't<00:05:41.910> do<00:05:42.090> the

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
that surface tension up won't do the

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:52.439 
that surface tension up won't do the
same<00:05:42.330> thing<00:05:42.570> on<00:05:42.720> here

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.670 

doesn't<00:05:53.449> have<00:05:53.569> to<00:05:53.599> be<00:05:53.840> a<00:05:53.870> lot<00:05:54.789> so<00:05:56.500> we<00:05:57.500> don't

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
doesn't have to be a lot so we don't

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.760 
doesn't have to be a lot so we don't
really<00:05:57.830> care<00:05:58.099> how<00:05:58.370> its<00:05:58.610> positioned<00:05:58.789> on<00:05:59.240> there

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
really care how its positioned on there

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:05.170 
really care how its positioned on there
so<00:06:00.770> we're<00:06:00.919> going<00:06:01.069> to<00:06:01.160> glue<00:06:01.430> this<00:06:01.639> side<00:06:03.940> now<00:06:04.940> as

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
so we're going to glue this side now as

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.050 
so we're going to glue this side now as
opposed<00:06:05.630> to<00:06:05.830> before<00:06:06.830> in<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.699> building<00:06:08.000> a

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
opposed to before in the building a

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.839 
opposed to before in the building a
train<00:06:08.270> table<00:06:08.509> series<00:06:09.039> told<00:06:10.039> you<00:06:10.160> to<00:06:10.280> leave<00:06:10.520> the

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
train table series told you to leave the

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.430 
train table series told you to leave the
spaces<00:06:11.360> in<00:06:11.539> between<00:06:11.569> to<00:06:12.349> let<00:06:12.530> this<00:06:12.650> dry<00:06:12.979> faster

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
spaces in between to let this dry faster

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.029 
spaces in between to let this dry faster
well<00:06:15.440> I'm<00:06:15.729> telling<00:06:16.729> you<00:06:16.910> to<00:06:17.120> not<00:06:17.330> do<00:06:17.570> that<00:06:18.039> for

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
well I'm telling you to not do that for

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.520 
well I'm telling you to not do that for
this<00:06:19.370> one<00:06:19.580> because<00:06:20.509> we're<00:06:20.990> going<00:06:21.259> to<00:06:21.380> be

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
this one because we're going to be

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.020 
this one because we're going to be
carving<00:06:21.889> each<00:06:22.340> of<00:06:23.210> these<00:06:23.330> pieces<00:06:25.030> it's

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
carving each of these pieces it's

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.800 
carving each of these pieces it's
possible<00:06:26.860> that<00:06:27.860> we<00:06:28.070> would<00:06:28.220> hit<00:06:28.599> one<00:06:29.599> of<00:06:29.690> those

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
possible that we would hit one of those

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:31.420 
possible that we would hit one of those
air<00:06:30.050> pockets<00:06:30.080> where<00:06:30.770> the<00:06:30.979> glue<00:06:31.160> would<00:06:31.280> be

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
air pockets where the glue would be

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.820 
air pockets where the glue would be
drawing<00:06:31.699> and<00:06:31.970> that<00:06:32.960> will<00:06:33.139> leave<00:06:33.320> a<00:06:33.560> pretty

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
drawing and that will leave a pretty

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.710 
drawing and that will leave a pretty
significant<00:06:34.490> movement<00:06:35.210> just<00:06:35.479> drop<00:06:35.690> that

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
significant movement just drop that

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.680 
significant movement just drop that
everywhere<00:06:36.370> that<00:06:37.370> may<00:06:37.520> leave<00:06:37.729> a<00:06:38.000> significant

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
everywhere that may leave a significant

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.580 
everywhere that may leave a significant
gap<00:06:38.900> and<00:06:40.210> it's<00:06:41.210> harder<00:06:41.630> to<00:06:41.780> fill<00:06:41.990> in<00:06:42.139> those<00:06:42.320> big

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:42.590 
gap and it's harder to fill in those big

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.320 
gap and it's harder to fill in those big
gaps<00:06:42.860> than<00:06:43.130> it<00:06:43.220> is<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.580> deal<00:06:43.759> with<00:06:43.789> the<00:06:44.060> glue

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330 
gaps than it is to deal with the glue

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.550 
gaps than it is to deal with the glue
that's<00:06:45.169> sticking<00:06:46.159> through<00:06:46.419> so<00:06:47.419> just<00:06:47.750> go<00:06:48.530> ahead

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
that's sticking through so just go ahead

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.050 
that's sticking through so just go ahead
and<00:06:48.770> cover<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.039> piece<00:06:49.250> entirely

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.530 

when<00:06:52.540> you<00:06:52.660> have<00:06:52.810> it<00:06:52.930> covered<00:06:54.210> don't<00:06:55.210> forget<00:06:55.480> to

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
when you have it covered don't forget to

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.440 
when you have it covered don't forget to
put<00:06:55.660> your<00:06:55.690> toothpicks<00:06:56.140> in<00:06:56.320> like<00:06:56.500> I<00:06:56.530> almost<00:06:56.800> did

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
put your toothpicks in like I almost did

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:03.269 
put your toothpicks in like I almost did
toothpicks<00:06:58.450> we<00:06:58.630> want<00:06:58.810> to<00:06:58.870> keep<00:06:59.020> in<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.320> center

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.230 

so<00:07:03.849> we<00:07:04.779> can<00:07:04.959> avoid

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
so we can avoid

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.700 
so we can avoid
hitting<00:07:07.930> the<00:07:08.020> toothpicks<00:07:08.440> when<00:07:08.590> we're

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
hitting the toothpicks when we're

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:15.299 
hitting the toothpicks when we're
carving<00:07:08.979> around<00:07:09.190> the<00:07:09.430> edges

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:15.309 

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:17.429 

and<00:07:15.789> if<00:07:15.909> you<00:07:16.029> see<00:07:16.179> the<00:07:16.329> glue<00:07:16.539> pulling<00:07:17.139> up<00:07:17.289> on

00:07:17.429 --> 00:07:17.439 
and if you see the glue pulling up on

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.079 
and if you see the glue pulling up on
the<00:07:17.529> outside<00:07:17.919> again<00:07:18.279> don't<00:07:18.459> worry<00:07:18.579> about<00:07:18.699> that

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:19.089 
the outside again don't worry about that

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.479 
the outside again don't worry about that
when<00:07:19.269> we<00:07:19.419> carve<00:07:19.719> it<00:07:19.889> we'll<00:07:20.889> get<00:07:21.069> rid<00:07:21.219> of<00:07:21.309> all

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:21.489 
when we carve it we'll get rid of all

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:26.009 
when we carve it we'll get rid of all
that<00:07:22.739> and<00:07:23.739> then<00:07:23.979> do<00:07:24.729> the<00:07:24.879> same<00:07:25.479> thing<00:07:25.539> on<00:07:25.899> this

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:26.019 
that and then do the same thing on this

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:28.049 
that and then do the same thing on this
final<00:07:26.409> piece<00:07:26.559> I'll<00:07:27.009> do<00:07:27.129> that<00:07:27.279> off<00:07:27.429> camera<00:07:27.459> and

00:07:28.049 --> 00:07:28.059 
final piece I'll do that off camera and

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:30.509 
final piece I'll do that off camera and
then<00:07:28.719> just<00:07:29.289> need<00:07:29.439> some<00:07:29.709> kind<00:07:29.949> of<00:07:30.039> big<00:07:30.279> weight

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:30.519 
then just need some kind of big weight

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.909 
then just need some kind of big weight
to<00:07:31.239> sit<00:07:31.569> on<00:07:31.599> the<00:07:31.779> top<00:07:31.989> and<00:07:32.229> then<00:07:32.559> we<00:07:32.739> need<00:07:32.889> to

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
to sit on the top and then we need to

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.599 
to sit on the top and then we need to
let<00:07:33.129> that<00:07:33.159> dry<00:07:33.549> for<00:07:33.579> about<00:07:34.439> 24<00:07:35.439> hours<00:07:35.609> just

00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:36.609 
let that dry for about 24 hours just

00:07:36.609 --> 00:07:38.399 
let that dry for about 24 hours just
because<00:07:36.789> there<00:07:37.119> are<00:07:37.149> no<00:07:37.389> air<00:07:37.689> pockets<00:07:38.109> inside

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:38.409 
because there are no air pockets inside

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:40.619 
because there are no air pockets inside
we<00:07:38.679> want<00:07:38.739> to<00:07:38.889> make<00:07:39.009> sure<00:07:39.189> that<00:07:39.309> this<00:07:39.489> is<00:07:39.729> good

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:40.629 
we want to make sure that this is good

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:43.829 
we want to make sure that this is good
and<00:07:40.779> firm<00:07:41.049> and<00:07:41.819> then<00:07:42.819> once<00:07:43.089> that's<00:07:43.329> dry<00:07:43.539> I'll

00:07:43.829 --> 00:07:43.839 
and firm and then once that's dry I'll

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.899 
and firm and then once that's dry I'll
be<00:07:43.959> back<00:07:44.139> in<00:07:44.379> will<00:07:44.649> start<00:07:45.459> the<00:07:45.579> carving

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:45.909 
be back in will start the carving

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:48.059 
be back in will start the carving
process
