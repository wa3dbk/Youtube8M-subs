00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.660
 Yup 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.339
 Perhaps 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.660
 ja elsewhere 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.019
 Takatsu-ku's 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.019
 I was doing the difference with straight line but 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.849
 I will try to put it on sound this time 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 The station clerk has performed the installation 26 If the original becomes open 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680
 Even if there is no land 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.360
 The thumb is not going to be unique like this 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 You will be able to kill people 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.690
 Exit from the plateau 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.580
 7th place 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.060
 Registration touch road 7 ward let-7 will give 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.050
 7th place 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.400
 k-1 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 Half 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 recent years 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.080
 It will be 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.670
 If you go this Takatsu Ward relay first 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.790
 It remains as it is 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 Takatsu Ward is expensive 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.850
 aaa 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.010
 Takatsu Ward Takatsu Ward 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 Countryside 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 Takatsu Ward acquisition 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 h 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 Takatsu Ward Takatsu Ward 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.720
 Even at night 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.010
 Metronome, if possible 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.630
 I took the rhythm while Narashino 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.640
 First of all mark 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.640
 First of all, don't think about a group or something 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.410
 The attack value of 4 places in this Takatsu Ward is constant 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.280
 Even with frozen soil, it can be accented 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:11.999
 like 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.949
 one more 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.959
 jta 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.049
 At first the surprise riddle high 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.049
 Yun Woon 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.759
 Maid Robo 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.319
 Let's do no store early 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.189
 Horseback and thus only the peak 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.679
 Do something like 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:49.389
 So let's do it next time 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.079
 Affirming that it is used for the left hand 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.309
 Revival 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:56.089
 Makori soot 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:57.480
 Fujiwara Manabu 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.229
 Old-fashioned 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.609
 Arrested man to return as soon as the day 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.089
 Nagasaka has changed, though 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.429
 The beach called cutting is doing this 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:09.359
 Cut 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.269
 It may be called to buy from kanji 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.219
 Then this time 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.790
 Holding down-local people 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.359
 About 1000 people 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.730
 I made a sound at the very beginning of the house 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.129
 If you play the pitch 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.739
 Takatsu Ward 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.889
 1. 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.939
 Takatsu Ward 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.729
 Blue chip survey 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.139
 I just spelled it 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.109
 Data continues 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.509
 1. 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.509
 Takamatsu 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.760
 I'm coming back from hearing that I've heard from the front officials of the dragon 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.859
 It is different though 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.089
 Get in 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.029
 Ed minutes favorite free 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:57.269
 It is amazing to go out in the cold 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.389
 So I'm passing 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.679
 I just did it 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:07.049
 Have won 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.079
 Even just being up 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.929
 Why flowering 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.699
 When I come to practice, I'll come this time 

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.759
 If the 4 patterns are done over and over again 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.729
 Gradually 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.310
 Even without thinking 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.900
 To music 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.050
 Cut bamboo check 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.050
 Modern decision 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.650
 It was revealed 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.199
 I did this time 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.669
 cafp 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:45.790
 That's right 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.150
 Sounds like it sounds 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.680
 I think it would be a surprise if I was absolutely going even now 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.360
 Repeated title 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.280
 Even if Kyoto draws or loses, it is on the rhythm 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.629
 I already have only the right hand 

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.709
 Chopped 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.009
 nhk beat 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.009
 It is said that 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.610
 I'm getting off the car 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.689
 I have to pu 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.029
 In it 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:23.229
 I have never left my left foot when I win the league 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.729
 The left end is in front of the high rhythm 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.210
 Another two minutes in Takatsu Ward and this time in Takatsu Ward 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.330
 Because it is okay to step on Tucker's work 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.990
 I'm not a travel writer, but it's 4 minutes 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.660
 While saying that Izumo Oki was absolutely with the left foot 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.389
 I will practice 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.610
 Even those who do not have a solaris and port 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.069
 In 12 years 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.830
 Oita is different 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.490
 People who are doing are better in our house 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.240
 The sense of rhythm is not good 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.110
 In 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.000
 Small height on the other hand 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.960
 Stop with my brother 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.830
 As you see 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.610
 After all, the right hand of the hand is endless and the judgment is infinite but it is empty already 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.860
 It is said that there is a moment you are shaking 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.059
 There is also an idea 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.930
 Dare 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.360
 If you explain the opponent just because there is a moment 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.539
 Yeah, if you're listening to dozens of songs or dozens of songs, 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.520
 I'm supposed to be able to 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.300
 Let's think about it with miso about once 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.869
 If you think about it 

00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:32.169
 In recent years I have rated it as left 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.289
 With cutting 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.680
 And it's time to brush 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.180
 With that 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.180
 Some people who are Super Aguri 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.389
 It is a combination of 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:45.430
 There 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.639
 It's also good to think about the first thing under the sky 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:52.599
 Don't think so much 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.270
 In the mood 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.659
 result 

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:59.069
 Further to 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:02.069
 One person 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:06.139
 Prefectural decision 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.139
 This time concern 

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.719
 Yeah 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:18.719
 fao discovery 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.939
 However, I pulled 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:26.300
 listener 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.840
 This last stand 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.230
 Church charlats tour is klse 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.629
 I have returned from one time 

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:37.879
 It was
