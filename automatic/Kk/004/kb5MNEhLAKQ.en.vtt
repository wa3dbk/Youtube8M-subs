00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.070

 at the time of posing some tricks that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.619
 go explaining good 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.450

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.200
 good we are with santiago that is going to us 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.510
 explain a little the final roll because 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.840
 Apart is that it is a hairdresser is better 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
 it's better 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:39.490
 today we have made a transformation 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 one to one fan and we've made a 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.380
 hairstyle to say with some waves to the water 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 quite marked and nothing very makeup 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.850
 simple with his found his line of 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.610
 water line 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.740
 and well-marked lips and little else 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.260
 As you can see first the molding was done 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.130
 of the hair with a lot of patience by the way 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.130
 by santiago 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.710
 and then he did the makeup that is very 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.710
 easy and simple 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.470
 if you want to see step by step how you 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.120
 did the hairstyle and makeup not 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.740
 stop watching the videos that we will post 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.740
 in next weeks 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.180
 very well 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.819
 It is also a shirt that has little 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.069
 I stopped and I did not arrive before and then 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:42.749
 a skirt rocksteady here 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:45.170
 she is tall but she always makes a 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.170
 little bit more 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.819
 so let's make the change in the 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.400
 posed it is very important to highlight the 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.020
 curves for it bending we will do the 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.510
 torso to remove the hip 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.730
 the feet is recommended that they are 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.520
 joints and limbs like 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 arms lend signatures and stretched or 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.300
 supported on the hip turned part 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.520
 move to relax the muscles of the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.130
 body from time to time I always put 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.000
 music to dance this posture is a 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.640
 classic but it's not easy trick 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.560
 stretch the tip of your feet well and if 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.950
 you can help with a cushion under 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.959
 the hips therefore better also count 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.300
 a lot of attitude for me is the most 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.720
 important in love of the camera and 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.640
 transmit your personality 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.460
 I have to find who is the president 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.870
 from my fan club and I knew that you 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.120
 he is very excited because his birthday 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.940
 So really I'm down here 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.700
 start good as we are then 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.890
 I loved it has been an experience 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.590
 very new there was never an action of 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.200
 footballer not big like today's and 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.560
 I liked it a lot, much more 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.560
 illusion that was also and the same 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.890
 in future videos we will be doing 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.830
 little by little little tricks and 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.050
 small final hairstyles so that a little 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.320
 to little we are seeing it for example 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.660
 normal that are the typical collected 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.730
 upwards in a circle 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.980
 exam mostly 7 in the section of 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.830
 retention of facts very well and the 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.490
 all the most collected plan to the part of 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.510
 down a bit more with the corkscrews 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.740
 peinaditos that we already saw seeing little to 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.370
 little bit 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.370
 but lose 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.680
 Let's see
