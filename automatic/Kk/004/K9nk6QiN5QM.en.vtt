testing today and we're going to do

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.529 
testing today and we're going to do
something<00:00:15.039> very<00:00:15.309> unique<00:00:15.400> that<00:00:16.000> most<00:00:16.209> people

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
something very unique that most people

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.750 
something very unique that most people
have<00:00:16.570> never<00:00:16.810> seen<00:00:17.230> as<00:00:17.830> far<00:00:17.890> as<00:00:18.279> ionizer

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:18.760

comparisons<00:00:19.570> our<00:00:20.170> goal<00:00:20.500> today<00:00:20.740> is<00:00:20.890> not<00:00:21.190> the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
comparisons our goal today is not the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.400 
comparisons our goal today is not the
show<00:00:21.610> which<00:00:21.910> ionizer<00:00:22.390> makes<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.930> strongest

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410

thank<00:01:38.170> you<00:01:38.319> go<00:01:38.469> mmm<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.249> if<00:01:39.459> that's<00:01:39.700> really<00:01:40.149> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
thank you go mmm so if that's really the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.550 
thank you go mmm so if that's really the
case<00:01:40.420> which<00:01:40.959> we're<00:01:41.170> going<00:01:41.319> to<00:01:41.380> demonstrate

case which we're going to demonstrate

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.669 
case which we're going to demonstrate
here<00:01:42.099> today<00:01:42.399> then<00:01:43.119> which<00:01:44.020> machine<00:01:44.439> which

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
here today then which machine which

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.249 
here today then which machine which
machine<00:01:45.099> do<00:01:45.279> you<00:01:45.429> choose<00:01:45.729> if<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.749> plate<00:01:46.990> size

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
machine do you choose if the plate size

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.129 
machine do you choose if the plate size
and<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.770> maximum<00:01:48.729> or<00:01:48.969> P<00:01:49.479> number<00:01:49.779> is<00:01:49.840> not<00:01:49.959> the

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
and the maximum or P number is not the

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.199 
and the maximum or P number is not the
most<00:01:50.289> important<00:01:50.799> thing<00:01:50.859> you<00:01:51.520> choose<00:01:51.789> the<00:01:52.029> one

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
most important thing you choose the one

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.679 
most important thing you choose the one
made<00:01:52.479> by<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.749> most<00:01:53.079> reputable<00:01:53.579> manufacturers

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
made by the most reputable manufacturers

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.529 
made by the most reputable manufacturers
that's<00:01:55.689> where<00:01:56.020> our<00:01:56.109> goal<00:01:56.289> is<00:01:56.469> today<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.539> good

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
that's where our goal is today so good

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.469 
that's where our goal is today so good
in<00:01:58.869> our<00:01:59.049> testing<00:01:59.590> what<00:02:00.189> we've<00:02:00.369> done<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.849> all

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
in our testing what we've done is all

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.019 
in our testing what we've done is all
machines<00:02:02.079> have<00:02:02.349> different<00:02:02.739> flow<00:02:02.979> rates<00:02:03.249> so<00:02:03.939> to

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
machines have different flow rates so to

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:06.449 
machines have different flow rates so to
make<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.450> testing<00:02:04.929> fair<00:02:05.229> we've<00:02:06.039> slipped

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
make the testing fair we've slipped

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.980 
make the testing fair we've slipped
we're<00:02:06.669> going<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.880> show<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.259> timer<00:02:09.160> that

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
we're going to show on a timer that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.440 
we're going to show on a timer that
we're<00:02:10.990> filling<00:02:11.350> an<00:02:11.440> 8<00:02:11.680> ounce<00:02:11.830> cup<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.550> between

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
we're filling an 8 ounce cup in between

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.520 
we're filling an 8 ounce cup in between
11<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.110> half

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
11 and a half

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.550 
11 and a half
12<00:02:14.860> seconds<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:16.510> every<00:02:16.990> machine<00:02:17.350> we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
12 seconds so that way every machine we

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.770 
12 seconds so that way every machine we
test<00:02:17.920> will<00:02:18.280> have<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> similar<00:02:18.819> flow<00:02:19.270> rate<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
test will have a similar flow rate and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.130 
test will have a similar flow rate and
that<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:21.190> makes<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> testing<00:02:22.209> fair<00:02:22.540> and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
that really makes the testing fair and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.780 
that really makes the testing fair and
each<00:02:23.380> machine<00:02:23.560> will<00:02:23.860> be<00:02:23.950> set<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.190> its<00:02:24.430> highest

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
each machine will be set on its highest

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:33.600 
each machine will be set on its highest
setting<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.390> well

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.670
