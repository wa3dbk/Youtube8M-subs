00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.109
 radio 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.849
 familiar picture stops your 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.880
 car inspectors dps and says 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.190
 open the trunk we will inspect 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.980
 and maybe a friend check and what 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 the difference between inspection and inspection is that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 you must know that or not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.880
 turned into a problem for you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.730
 Under the law, I will underline inspection of my friends 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
 Examination is a survey 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 vehicle with a view 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.309
 detecting objects or tools in it 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 offense examination without 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.899
 violations of its structural integrity 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.030
 that is, DPS inspector inspect your 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.710
 the car has no right to open the covers 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.410
 disassemble wheels or disassemble 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.440
 engine without violation means only 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.930
 hands and visually what you need to know 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
 in this case the driver is not a driver 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 the driver takes part in the inspection 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 only stands and looks like spends 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.590
 inspection authorized to talk 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 official and driver not required 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.049
 range of DPS help conduct the screening he 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.400
 only an indifferent observer to whom 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.799
 laid only one single 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.900
 duty to make sure the law 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.850
 during the inspection something was observed and 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.100
 to be law law first requires 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 the presence of two understood by friends 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.600
 I remind you can not be DPS employees 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 as witnesses can be attracted when 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.659
 inspection only independent risk not 2 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 DPS employee is not a trainee and not even 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 your drivers can only be understood 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.369
 completely independent outsiders 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.820
 which the DPS inspector should find on 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.350
 the street 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.570
 remember my friends that you are not entitled 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 prevent screening easier 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.710
 saying you have no right to rush on 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.579
 inspector and don't let them open 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 trunk or 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.409
 to under one word if the inspector dps not 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.450
 drew up a protocol inspection and not 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.180
 invited two witnesses to become not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.820
 may be conducting a search but here 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 what is the inspection and how is it different from 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.939
 screening that much easier 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.780
 inspection is a survey of cargo and 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.810
 vehicle is easier 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.509
 saying when the inspector is visual without hands 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.220
 look at the car no one and nothing 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.539
 touch but true really 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.970
 Friends Inspector DPS 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.810
 still must make exactly the same 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.849
 document which 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.370
 though it not called the inspection protocol and 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.830
 just an inspection report in which too 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.470
 should indicate what he saw in your 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.420
 the car that he found your russia for 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.500
 what the legislator came up with such a complicated 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.140
 procedure and 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.580
 act and protocol and witnesses and to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.440
 so that once upon inspection 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 or when viewed in your trunk 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.190
 car or bags or booths suddenly 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.870
 there were no substances or objects 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.489
 forbidden to transport best 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.290
 similar procedures and shoot of course 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.239
 on a video camera at least on a video camera 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.880
 mobile phone realizing that being 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.160
 under the supervision of a DPS officer may not 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.380
 take a step side believe he him and not 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.420
 will do if there is any doubt that the same 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.080
 DPS inspector conducts inspection 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.060
 ask him what is being screened 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.030
 or inspection if the inspector tells me 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.340
 just to look so obviously 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.830
 oversight because inspection is conducted 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.299
 cheese detection items breach eat 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.400
 he says i spend to reveal 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.900
 some violation items mean 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.450
 dear spectrum is already uniquely 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.489
 views be kind to two witnesses 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.140
 so friends and mean what 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.579
 more procedure will be followed 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.410
 screening 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.930
 or inspection topics in more security 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.930
 with this procedure you will find yourself
