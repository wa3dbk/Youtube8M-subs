 one dollar for each 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.180

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.620
 you can use what you like not 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 It has to be exactly me 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.440
 using the products that I have here 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.440
 in my house 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.230
 I bought this container also in 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.200
 dollar tree here the only thing that I have 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.180
 post is paper to draw from putting 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.970
 the products that are not melted for 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.190
 down here so that the only thing that I put 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.750
 nothing else was paper you can 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.750
 put the amount of tdt 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.550
 here I already have all the products already 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.310
 placed to me I like it to go very 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.849
 well tight that go well equipped 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.810
 here I put this sponge also this 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.599
 sanitizer little boat 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.709
 here nothing else is ready to put it 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.709
 in the bag 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.620
 with this bag they will have a little 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.960
 of care because it is very fragile to the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 time to put the basket to me has already 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.640
 last I had broke the sachet 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.400
 and I recommend that someone help them 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.450
 to put the basket inside the bag 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.459
 This glitter is optional, this helps 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.800
 so you can see more products 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.030
 elegant 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.130
 and here the basket is already bitter 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.110
 this little ear make sure they are left 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.150
 down because if they want to go up 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.570
 look a little weird that I have one left 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.910
 up this piece left over here 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.680
 we are going to put it like this in this way 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.680
 let's put a little face 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.799
 now comes the most fun for me that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.629
 is drying the plastic I like a lot 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.180
 do this because I like how it goes 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.579
 accommodating the products so I'm going 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.000
 to learn my dryer at temperature 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.000
 half 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.990
 Here the little basket is ready, I know 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.449
 that all the plastic is not going to put 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.699
 very hot the dryer because this 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.570
 plastic breaks easily with the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.570
 temperature 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.789
 in the bag where the plastic comes for 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.639
 the basket brings this monkey 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.069
 this little monkey brings these two bandages what 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.490
 only thing we need to do is wing no 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:04.490
 backward 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.030
 so I'm going to tie this monkey 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:33.570
 I'm going to cut this piece to this bag 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.570
 from up here 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:45.129
 I have these three different monkeys 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.440
 but I like it better this is that 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.530
 I'm going to put this 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:58.130
 what I'm going to do this doll comes from 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:01.630
 I will tie this form and I will 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.630
 tie to the conga 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.800
 Now I'm going to try to tie it in the 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.800
 center 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.210
 Here I already have the ready basket 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:33.360
 so I'm going to put these two 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.340
 bells this is optional also if 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.200
 you want to put more also what 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.790
 they can do they do not have to do it like that 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.790
 exactly as I am doing it 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:47.420
 so these two baskets were left at the end 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.870
 I recommend that you try to do it 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.810
 very easy and very economical so if 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:58.750
 they liked the video of the in like thank you 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.750
 by looking at coupons for food bye
