difference really in the makeup of it is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.120

that platinum blue tip there same color
light<00:02:49.580> so<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:51.170> look<00:02:52.170> very<00:02:52.200> similar<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
light so I look very similar and the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.540 
light so I look very similar and the
Joker<00:02:54.960> sounds<00:02:55.410> are<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.520> only

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
Joker sounds are the same the only

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.920 
Joker sounds are the same the only
difference<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.210> we'll<00:02:57.300> see<00:02:57.510> when<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.720> pop

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
difference is and we'll see when we pop

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.840 
difference is and we'll see when we pop
them<00:02:58.080> in<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> driver<00:02:58.530> here<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.460> is<00:02:59.550> next<00:02:59.790> to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
them in the driver here it is next to

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.960 
them in the driver here it is next to
the<00:02:59.940> gashapon<00:03:00.180> or<00:03:00.750> candy<00:03:01.110> toy<00:03:01.260> version<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the gashapon or candy toy version so you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.180

the DX Joker memory this one doesn't

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.860 
the DX Joker memory this one doesn't
have<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.320> light<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.600> give<00:03:12.600> out<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.840> same

have a light but the give out the same
Joker<00:03:13.350> sound<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:15.150> let's<00:03:15.570> pop<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.050> the

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
Joker sound so let's pop it in the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.890 
Joker sound so let's pop it in the
driver<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:17.030> hear<00:03:18.030> what<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.239> sounds<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.600> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
driver and hear what it sounds like and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.650 
driver and hear what it sounds like and
then<00:03:19.050> we're<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.380> do<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:20.270> wash<00:03:21.270> driver

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
then we're going to do that wash driver

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.120 
then we're going to do that wash driver
since<00:03:22.020> that's<00:03:22.290> what<00:03:22.440> it's<00:03:22.530> used<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:22.950> pop<00:03:23.610> it<00:03:23.640> in

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
since that's what it's used in pop it in

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:33.050 
since that's what it's used in pop it in
get<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.480> waiting<00:03:27.480> sound<00:03:27.860> flip<00:03:28.860> it<00:03:28.980> open<00:03:32.060> get

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
get the waiting sound flip it open get

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.320

the regular choker and the Joker fanfare
there<00:03:36.600> now<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.620> difference<00:03:38.010> with<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.280> one

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
there now the difference with this one

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.000 
there now the difference with this one
is<00:03:40.250> pop<00:03:41.450> will<00:03:42.450> pop<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.810> DX<00:03:43.170> Joker<00:03:43.590> in<00:03:45.890> put<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
is pop will pop the DX Joker in put the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.140 
is pop will pop the DX Joker in put the
man<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:51.890> now<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.040> one's<00:03:53.220> time<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.730> work<00:03:53.880> with

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
man up now that one's time to work with

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.360 
man up now that one's time to work with
cyclone<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.590> that's<00:03:55.769> why<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.070> kind<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.250> that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
cyclone so that's why it's kind of that

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.280 
cyclone so that's why it's kind of that
pause<00:03:56.610> after<00:03:56.880> you<00:03:57.030> pop<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.390> in<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.750> then

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
pause after you pop it in and then

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.259 
pause after you pop it in and then
there's<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> pause<00:03:58.769> before<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.370> music<00:03:59.940> goes

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
there's a pause before the music goes

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.530 
there's a pause before the music goes
off<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.820> that's<00:04:02.820> pretty<00:04:03.120> much<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.360> only

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
off so that's pretty much the only

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.270 
off so that's pretty much the only
difference<00:04:03.989> inside<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.440> driver<00:04:04.739> let's<00:04:05.040> pop

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
difference inside the driver let's pop

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:19.969 
difference inside the driver let's pop
it<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.550> the<00:04:05.720> maximum<00:04:06.720> drive<00:04:07.140> slot

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.670 

you<00:04:20.979> get<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.190> same<00:04:21.430> maximum<00:04:21.760> Drive<00:04:22.449> sound<00:04:22.840> so

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you get the same maximum Drive sound so

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.900 
you get the same maximum Drive sound so
pretty<00:04:24.040> neat

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
pretty neat

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.090 
pretty neat
unfortunately<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.930> cash<00:04:26.080> upon<00:04:26.380> one<00:04:26.620> kind<00:04:26.949> of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
unfortunately the cash upon one kind of

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.500 
unfortunately the cash upon one kind of
works<00:04:27.250> in<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.520> mouth<00:04:27.699> you<00:04:27.729> can<00:04:27.910> pop<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.360> in

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
works in the mouth you can pop it in

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.510 
works in the mouth you can pop it in
it's<00:04:29.410> not<00:04:29.530> gonna<00:04:29.650> make<00:04:29.830> any<00:04:30.040> noise<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.340> can

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's not gonna make any noise you can

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.240 
it's not gonna make any noise you can
open<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:31.470> sometimes<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> goes<00:04:32.710> off<00:04:32.979> if<00:04:33.160> you

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
open it sometimes it goes off if you

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.050 
open it sometimes it goes off if you
kind<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.610> push<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.540> little<00:04:34.630> bit<00:04:35.699> you<00:04:36.699> need<00:04:36.910> to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
kind of push on a little bit you need to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.120 
kind of push on a little bit you need to
go<00:04:37.210> off<00:04:37.389> no<00:04:37.810> light<00:04:38.050> but<00:04:38.410> does<00:04:39.400> go<00:04:39.610> off<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.770> then

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
go off no light but does go off and then

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.890 
go off no light but does go off and then
the<00:04:42.220> regular<00:04:42.520> one<00:04:42.669> we<00:04:42.790> showed<00:04:43.000> off<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.720> that's

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
the regular one we showed off so that's

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.879 
the regular one we showed off so that's
pretty<00:04:44.260> much<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.560> T<00:04:44.979> to<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.850> Joker<00:04:46.150> memory

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
pretty much the T to the Joker memory

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.439 
pretty much the T to the Joker memory
very<00:04:47.889> neat<00:04:48.130> if<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.520> can<00:04:48.699> pick<00:04:48.910> one<00:04:49.090> up<00:04:49.240> for

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
very neat if you can pick one up for

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.939 
very neat if you can pick one up for
about<00:04:49.570> what<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.780> paid<00:04:50.050> for<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:50.530> totally

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
about what I paid for it it's totally

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.350 
about what I paid for it it's totally
worth<00:04:51.100> it<00:04:51.340> especially<00:04:51.669> if<00:04:51.910> you<00:04:51.970> got<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.120> launch
