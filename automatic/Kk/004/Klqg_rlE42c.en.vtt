00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
toys that I didn't have and as everybody

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470

knows<00:00:40.530> collecting<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> disease<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.329> once

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
knows collecting is a disease and once

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.240

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
came and pointed to them one up there

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.069

the<00:03:39.549> orange<00:03:39.849> and<00:03:40.030> green<00:03:40.209> one<00:03:40.449> you<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:40.930> have

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
the orange and green one you so have

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.449

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.030 
never seen that before
