work properly so milling up the lumber

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.960 
work properly so milling up the lumber
is<00:00:24.840> always<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.170> first<00:00:25.350> step<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.910> there's<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
is always the first step now there's a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.660 
is always the first step now there's a
procedure<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:27.689> milling<00:00:28.230> wood<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.550> a

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
procedure for milling wood that's a

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429 
procedure for milling wood that's a
simple<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.300> follow<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.140> has<00:00:31.289> an

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
simple one to follow and it has an

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.950 
simple one to follow and it has an
acronym<00:00:31.619> called<00:00:31.890> fee<00:00:32.550> which<00:00:33.510> stands<00:00:33.840> for

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
acronym called fee which stands for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
acronym called fee which stands for
faces<00:00:34.730> edges<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.180> ends<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.829> means

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
faces edges and ends and what that means

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.830 
faces edges and ends and what that means
is<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.280> you're<00:00:38.670> always<00:00:38.850> starting<00:00:39.180> with<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
is that you're always starting with the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.950 
is that you're always starting with the
faces<00:00:40.230> first<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.860> face<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> wide<00:00:42.180> part<00:00:42.870> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
faces first the face is the wide part of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.810 
faces first the face is the wide part of
the<00:00:43.050> board<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> you're<00:00:44.430> getting<00:00:44.700> your

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the board and you're getting your

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.630 
the board and you're getting your
flattening<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> face<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.980> edges

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
flattening the face and then edges

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
flattening the face and then edges
refers<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> edge<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.840> your<00:00:49.320> your

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
refers to the edge here your your

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
refers to the edge here your your
squaring<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> edge<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> newly

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
squaring up the edge to the newly

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.650 
squaring up the edge to the newly
flattened<00:00:52.079> faces<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.829> then<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> ends<00:00:54.090> refer

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
flattened faces and then the ends refer

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
flattened faces and then the ends refer
to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.379> ends<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> boards<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.129> you're

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
to the ends of the boards that you're

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.250 
to the ends of the boards that you're
then<00:00:56.489> cutting<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.289> crosscut<00:00:58.530> Square<00:00:59.520> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
then cutting off in a crosscut Square to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.479 
then cutting off in a crosscut Square to
the<00:01:01.260> edges<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.770> you've<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.280> made

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the edges that you've just now made

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
the edges that you've just now made
square<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> faces<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
square to the faces so it's the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
square to the faces so it's the
sequential<00:01:04.439> process<00:01:05.189> where<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.489> squaring

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sequential process where you're squaring

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.899 
sequential process where you're squaring
up<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.210> flattening<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> wood<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
up and flattening the wood in a way that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.440 
up and flattening the wood in a way that
leads<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.479> perfectly<00:01:10.080> square<00:01:10.650> flat<00:01:10.890> board

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
leads to a perfectly square flat board

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.700 
leads to a perfectly square flat board
usually<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> first<00:01:12.720> step<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.229> process

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
usually the first step in this process

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
usually the first step in this process
with<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> faces<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.479> hop<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
with the faces is to hop on to the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.219 
with the faces is to hop on to the
jointer<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.950> flatten<00:01:17.850> your<00:01:18.240> face<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.750> you've

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
jointer and flatten your face if you've

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.620 
jointer and flatten your face if you've
got<00:01:19.439> one<00:01:19.680> flat<00:01:19.890> face<00:01:20.220> already<00:01:20.630> reasonably

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
got one flat face already reasonably

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
got one flat face already reasonably
flat<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.170> check<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.619> your

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
flat and you can check it on your

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.469 
flat and you can check it on your
jointer<00:01:23.130> table<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.640> pieces<00:01:24.119> are<00:01:24.240> small

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
jointer table if your pieces are small

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.289 
jointer table if your pieces are small
like<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:26.369> pieces<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.820> sitting<00:01:27.090> flat

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
like this if the pieces are sitting flat

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.380 
like this if the pieces are sitting flat
already<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.970> there's<00:01:29.970> no<00:01:30.150> need<00:01:30.360> to

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
already like this one there's no need to

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
already like this one there's no need to
actually<00:01:30.720> even<00:01:31.530> use<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.860> jointer<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> can

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
actually even use the jointer you can

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.060 
actually even use the jointer you can
jump<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.610> into<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> planer<00:01:33.500> but<00:01:34.500> most<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
jump right into the planer but most of

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.440 
jump right into the planer but most of
the<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.340> there's<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:35.759> little<00:01:35.970> cupping<00:01:36.420> or

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the time there's some little cupping or

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.810 
the time there's some little cupping or
bowing<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> need<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> take<00:01:38.400> care<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
bowing that you need to take care of on

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
bowing that you need to take care of on
the<00:01:38.909> jointer<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.920> first

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the jointer so let's do that first

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.999 
the jointer so let's do that first
now<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.540> my<00:01:42.689> scenario<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.680> working

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now I'm in my scenario we're working

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
now I'm in my scenario we're working
with<00:01:44.130> two<00:01:44.280> pieces<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.759> wood<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.810> going

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
with two pieces of wood that are going

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.289 
with two pieces of wood that are going
to<00:01:46.079> end<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.350> being<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> same<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.640> need<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to end up being the same we need them to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
to end up being the same we need them to
be<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> same<00:01:48.689> thickness<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:50.220> going

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
be the same thickness and they're going

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.330 
be the same thickness and they're going
to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> little<00:01:50.700> tabletop<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.500> whenever

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
to be a little tabletop and so whenever

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.859 
to be a little tabletop and so whenever
you<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.640> milling<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.090> always<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:54.659> work

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
you do milling you always do your work

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
you do milling you always do your work
in<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> batch<00:01:55.350> meaning<00:01:56.070> whatever<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
in a batch meaning whatever I do to this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.969 
in a batch meaning whatever I do to this
piece<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.899> going<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> two<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.829> this

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
piece I'm going to do the two to this

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709 
piece I'm going to do the two to this
piece<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.430> well<00:01:59.579> before<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.030> change<00:02:00.329> any<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
piece as well before I change any of the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
piece as well before I change any of the
settings<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> machines<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.100> goes

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
settings on the machines and that goes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.700 
settings on the machines and that goes
to<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> jointer<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.540> planer<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.409> table

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to the jointer the planer and the table

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.450 
to the jointer the planer and the table
saw<00:02:04.829> you're<00:02:05.040> always<00:02:05.130> work<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> batch<00:02:05.729> like

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
saw you're always work in a batch like

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.449 
saw you're always work in a batch like
okay<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.990> let's<00:02:08.229> look<00:02:08.470> at<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> jointer<00:02:09.190> first

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
okay so let's look at the jointer first

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.070 
okay so let's look at the jointer first
let's<00:02:09.670> say<00:02:09.789> we<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> flatten<00:02:10.360> these<00:02:10.569> faces

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
let's say we have to flatten these faces

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.070 
let's say we have to flatten these faces
first<00:02:11.980> step<00:02:12.250> let's<00:02:13.120> get<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.480> jointer<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.989> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
first step let's get the jointer to the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.410 
first step let's get the jointer to the
proper<00:02:14.730> width<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:16.000> accommodate<00:02:16.540> our<00:02:17.019> stock

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
proper width to accommodate our stock

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
proper width to accommodate our stock
open<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.540> fence<00:02:19.840> up<00:02:20.049> a<00:02:20.080> little<00:02:20.319> bit<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.489> we've

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
open this fence up a little bit so we've

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.140 
open this fence up a little bit so we've
got<00:02:21.730> enough<00:02:21.940> room<00:02:22.180> lock<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.290> place<00:02:24.150> you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
got enough room lock it in place you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.170 
got enough room lock it in place you
want<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.390> check<00:02:25.629> again<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.530> see<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.879> depth

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
want to check again to see the depth

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.539 
want to check again to see the depth
that<00:02:28.510> you're<00:02:28.930> cutting<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.340> use<00:02:30.519> a

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
that you're cutting so you can use a

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.210 
that you're cutting so you can use a
little<00:02:31.019> engineer<00:02:32.019> square<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.440> check<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.830> see

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
little engineer square to check that see

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.559 
little engineer square to check that see
the<00:02:33.340> height<00:02:33.519> difference<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> tables

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
the height difference in the tables

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.449 
the height difference in the tables
looks<00:02:35.290> good<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.650> me<00:02:35.680> we're<00:02:35.980> not<00:02:36.099> going<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.310> take

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
looks good to me we're not going to take

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.479 
looks good to me we're not going to take
a<00:02:36.519> very<00:02:36.760> aggressive<00:02:37.150> cut<00:02:38.069> and<00:02:39.069> then<00:02:39.340> we're

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
a very aggressive cut and then we're

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.170 
a very aggressive cut and then we're
ready<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> go

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
ready to go

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.270 
ready to go
the<00:02:40.780> last<00:02:41.019> thing<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.379> want<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.590> look<00:02:41.769> at<00:02:41.980> and

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
the last thing you want to look at and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.009 
the last thing you want to look at and
consider<00:02:42.519> when<00:02:43.269> you're<00:02:43.390> using<00:02:43.720> these

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
consider when you're using these

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.839 
consider when you're using these
machines<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:45.340> jointer<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.730> planer

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
machines the jointer and planer

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.619 
machines the jointer and planer
especially<00:02:46.629> is<00:02:47.129> wood<00:02:48.129> grain<00:02:48.400> direction<00:02:48.970> okay

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
especially is wood grain direction okay

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.750 
especially is wood grain direction okay
the<00:02:50.110> grain<00:02:50.349> direction<00:02:50.829> of<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.040> wood<00:02:51.220> actually

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the grain direction of the wood actually

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.400 
the grain direction of the wood actually
has<00:02:51.879> a<00:02:51.910> big<00:02:52.150> impact<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.629> how<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.930> machines

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
has a big impact on how the machines

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.990 
has a big impact on how the machines
perform<00:02:53.860> and<00:02:54.040> how<00:02:54.099> smooth<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.670> cut<00:02:54.879> you're

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
perform and how smooth of a cut you're

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.789 
perform and how smooth of a cut you're
going<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> get<00:02:55.360> let's<00:02:56.079> look<00:02:56.290> at<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:56.560> board

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
going to get let's look at this board

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.009 
going to get let's look at this board
for<00:02:57.069> example<00:02:57.160> here<00:02:57.790> if<00:02:58.359> you<00:02:58.420> can<00:02:58.629> see<00:02:58.660> the

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
for example here if you can see the

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.650 
for example here if you can see the
grain<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> wood<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.980> side<00:03:00.660> well

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
grain of the wood in the side well

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.140 
grain of the wood in the side well
follow<00:03:01.989> one<00:03:02.230> of<00:03:02.260> these<00:03:02.410> with<00:03:02.590> my<00:03:02.739> pencil<00:03:03.150> you

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
follow one of these with my pencil you

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.059 
follow one of these with my pencil you
can<00:03:04.269> see<00:03:04.450> it's<00:03:04.569> going<00:03:04.750> uphill<00:03:04.989> from<00:03:05.829> right<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
can see it's going uphill from right to

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.940 
can see it's going uphill from right to
left<00:03:06.930> what<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.079> means<00:03:08.349> is<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.799> wood

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
left what that means is that the wood

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
left what that means is that the wood
fiber<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.609> in<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:09.879> piece<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.269> wood<00:03:10.480> are

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
fiber is in this piece of wood are

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.300 
fiber is in this piece of wood are
actually<00:03:11.019> sticking<00:03:11.410> up<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.859> pencil

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
actually sticking up like this pencil

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.569 
actually sticking up like this pencil
out<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.880> wood<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.069> machine<00:03:15.400> like

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
out of the wood so in a machine like

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.410 
out of the wood so in a machine like
this<00:03:15.910> if<00:03:16.510> we<00:03:16.569> were<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.989> pass<00:03:17.170> this<00:03:18.180> over<00:03:19.180> top<00:03:19.389> of

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
this if we were to pass this over top of

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.559 
this if we were to pass this over top of
these<00:03:19.599> blades<00:03:19.900> which<00:03:20.109> are<00:03:20.230> spinning<00:03:20.680> at<00:03:21.220> me<00:03:21.569> if

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
these blades which are spinning at me if

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.409 
these blades which are spinning at me if
the<00:03:23.470> wood<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.889> sticking<00:03:24.250> out<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:27.419> the

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
the wood is sticking out like this the

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.000 
the wood is sticking out like this the
blade<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.810> going<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.019> catch<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.260> fibers<00:03:29.950> of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
blade is going to catch the fibers of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.280 
blade is going to catch the fibers of
the<00:03:30.069> wood<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.370> tear<00:03:30.519> them<00:03:30.700> out<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:32.109> of<00:03:32.230> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
the wood and tear them out so one of the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.330 
the wood and tear them out so one of the
things<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.530> always<00:03:32.769> want<00:03:32.919> to<00:03:32.950> do<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.190> make

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
things you always want to do is make

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.680 
things you always want to do is make
sure<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.549> what<00:03:33.700> is<00:03:33.790> oriented<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.480> that

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
sure you what is oriented so that that

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.460 
sure you what is oriented so that that
doesn't<00:03:34.870> happen<00:03:35.230> if<00:03:35.650> we<00:03:35.859> spin<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.280> around

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
doesn't happen if we spin this around

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.780 
doesn't happen if we spin this around
that<00:03:38.470> means<00:03:38.650> now<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.919> fibers<00:03:39.370> are<00:03:39.489> facing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
that means now the fibers are facing

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.900 
that means now the fibers are facing
this<00:03:39.910> way<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:42.010> means<00:03:42.220> now<00:03:42.430> when<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.730> blade

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
this way that means now when the blade

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.309 
this way that means now when the blade
comes<00:03:43.150> around<00:03:43.419> it's<00:03:43.569> just<00:03:43.720> going<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:43.959> push<00:03:44.139> the

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
comes around it's just going to push the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.440 
comes around it's just going to push the
fiber<00:03:44.560> back<00:03:44.829> down<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.359> be<00:03:46.419> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
fiber back down so it's going to be a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.970 
fiber back down so it's going to be a
much<00:03:46.630> smoother<00:03:47.079> cut<00:03:47.260> we're<00:03:47.470> not<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.889> get

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
much smoother cut we're not going to get

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.250 
much smoother cut we're not going to get
any<00:03:48.099> tear-out<00:03:48.480> okay<00:03:49.480> we're<00:03:49.690> ready<00:03:49.810> for<00:03:50.139> our

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
any tear-out okay we're ready for our

any tear-out okay we're ready for our
first<00:03:50.470> face<00:03:50.980> flattening<00:03:51.959> we're<00:03:52.959> ready<00:03:53.169> to<00:03:53.290> go

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
first face flattening we're ready to go

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.900 
first face flattening we're ready to go
I'm<00:03:53.530> just<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.919> be<00:03:53.980> passing<00:03:54.400> this<00:03:54.519> over

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
I'm just going to be passing this over

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.010 
I'm just going to be passing this over
the<00:03:55.690> blade

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
the blade

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.290 
the blade

hey<00:04:16.709> that's<00:04:16.950> one<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:18.180> want<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.450> check<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.810> make

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
hey that's one we want to check and make

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.190 
hey that's one we want to check and make
sure<00:04:18.989> God<00:04:19.410> actually<00:04:19.859> did<00:04:20.010> get<00:04:20.160> flattened

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
sure God actually did get flattened

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.620 
sure God actually did get flattened
let's<00:04:22.200> put<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.610> table<00:04:23.790> yes<00:04:24.210> looks

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
let's put it on the table yes looks

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.470 
let's put it on the table yes looks
looks<00:04:25.139> good<00:04:25.380> nice<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:25.590> flat<00:04:26.180> put<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.330> one

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
looks good nice and flat put that one

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.330 
looks good nice and flat put that one
aside<00:04:27.570> and<00:04:28.260> then<00:04:28.770> you<00:04:28.889> would<00:04:29.010> do<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.190> same

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
aside and then you would do the same

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.120 
aside and then you would do the same
thing<00:04:29.790> for<00:04:30.210> your<00:04:30.360> next<00:04:30.570> piece<00:04:30.870> run<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.919> through

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
thing for your next piece run it through

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.700 
thing for your next piece run it through
and<00:04:32.490> flatten<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.000> as<00:04:33.120> well<00:04:33.350> once<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.470> have<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and flatten it as well once you have the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.170 
and flatten it as well once you have the
flat<00:04:34.980> face<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.430> done<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.730> can<00:04:35.760> bring<00:04:36.030> it<00:04:36.120> over

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
flat face is done you can bring it over

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.480 
flat face is done you can bring it over
to<00:04:36.389> the<00:04:36.480> planer<00:04:36.720> for<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.139> next<00:04:37.380> step

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
to the planer for the next step
