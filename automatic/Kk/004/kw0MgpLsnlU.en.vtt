00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.760
 game channel pixel world 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 greetings to you all gray 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.900
 time to cut pumpkins knock on homes and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 make room in the closet for new 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.390
 skeletons after all the forces on the nose and craftsmen from 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.949
 got fine on this occasion boosted 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.810
 and drove right for the holiday 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.600
 continuation of the adventures of the kids in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.180
 born in household trash costume quest 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.460
 it appears and now right after 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.890
 launch manifest perhaps the most obvious 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.899
 The problem of this game is that the creators 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.300
 You have completely passed the first casting weight and 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.090
 the plot starts exactly from the same place where 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.860
 ended with dlc robinson of so 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.930
 starts immediately with the second part of the meaning 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 little but just do not understand what is happening 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 and who in general all these people somehow 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 will explain and introduce the game 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 not even trying so for those who are in 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.090
 The first part did not poke yet I will explain 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 the basics of these nasty greens 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 guest workers from another dimension 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 all sorts of mentally ill people 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.949
 regularly try to knock out 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.379
 halloween but these nimble tomboy 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.049
 absolutely not happy about it and of course 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.920
 saves the holiday with a heap of candy 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.490
 power of imagination sounds like a plot 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 cheap kids cartoon acana yet 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.740
 cops to a degree on new attention to this 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 Do not pay Do not pay Austin Quest 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 This is the case when it is interesting to play 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.619
 both children and adults because 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.860
 the plot is simple but funny 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.090
 basic mechanics but addictive 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.020
 actually the gameplay is something like 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 jerky j 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.920
 the main movement takes place in 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.320
 free mode by big and open 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 locations here we take quests communicate with 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.950
 characters and all sorts of secrets 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.680
 which there is a lot of other things 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.070
 doing well and at the time of the battle us 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.890
 transferred from the ordinary world to the world 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.770
 fermentation where the husband step by step rza 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.320
 pay adversary basic game mechanics 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.689
 around which everything revolves it suits 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.370
 which children collect from everything under 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.560
 hand will fall because halloween 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.080
 every child of your team has 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.770
 each costume has its own pluses 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.930
 and cons 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.000
 someone deals great damage and magical 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.920
 creatures are useless against monsters 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.680
 someone is not limited to one goal and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.170
 beats all at once and someone 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.180
 sweetie costumes a bunch of change them 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.460
 have to constantly because besides 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.740
 passive bonus costumes give more 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.200
 special skills both in combat and in the main 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 location is permissible through a dark alley 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.070
 you can only pass the wizard because 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.270
 that children are afraid of the dark and the magic 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.520
 I am able to glow 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.070
 were there during the battle you can resurrect 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.470
 fallen comrades my pharaoh 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.240
 almost identical to the first part of these 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.060
 walks in turns each attack is 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.950
 small a quick time event very 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 small you just need to poke 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.840
 one button the more accurately I push the more 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.110
 well done then walks the enemies situation 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.730
 repeats press button locks any 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.590
 our action fills the suit scale 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.140
 how fill can apply 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.880
 special ability part 1 is pretty 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.570
 quickly pro and was given so now by 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.989
 the course of the game 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.840
 kids learn new fighting techniques 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.520
 re as well as such little things also 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 in battle you can and should use 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.250
 flashcards are combat modifiers 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 who are bought for candy eve herself 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.040
 week man in a raincoat effect not 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.170
 give extremely positive 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.450
 start instantly in filling out school 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 costumes for all heroes and ending 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.920
 cutting enemies in half health to 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.510
 one turn is spent on using them 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.280
 so there is often no benefit 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.070
 bother and just beat the enemies by 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.650
 face and up compared to the first part 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.030
 this system is slightly shoveled cards 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.310
 cling not to an individual hero like 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.840
 earlier but to the whole group so that 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.300
 each of the three can use any 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.459
 the character is true only once in two or three 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.710
 battle reuse should 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.110
 take a specific time 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.510
 and in general this is all you need to know 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.340
 about the costume quest is kind funny 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.660
 adventure for all ages which 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.270
 won't take you long 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 there is this business for a couple of evenings and yes 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.780
 this is not the best example 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.180
 own games but it's perfect 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.360
 sequel all that annoyed me at the feast 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.130
 participation either improved or replaced withdrawn 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.410
 30 fps annoying log 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.630
 repainted calmly in give honest 60 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.180
 Added a map of the location on which 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.870
 celebrated already visited houses spun off 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.030
 graphics 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.550
 the style remained the same but the picture became 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.380
 juicier effect from above on thrown honestly 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.990
 and the reflection in the puddles for example is pretty 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.870
 nice look and lighting of places 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.040
 nice though not without bugs 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.960
 high speed roller skate now 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.490
 not tied to a particular suit goes 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.100
 as a separate ability is available in 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.630
 any time fighting which used to be fast 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.700
 tedious and gave that is to brazil 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.640
 different fighting skills and very 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.440
 small things like skipping animations ults 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.230
 nonsense is nice that you do not need to watch 100 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.880
 once the same well and many others 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.040
 trivia has been changed to wire 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.150
 dialogues that are promoted only by 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.430
 pressing the button automatically potal 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:06.290
 I personally am sick but does it involve a similar 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.290
 decide everything for you all bye
