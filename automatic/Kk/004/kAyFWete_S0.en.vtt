00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi friends today small 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.110
 a short vidosik about what appeared 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.389
 in update 98 of all that came out so far 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.330
 nothing except dynamic 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.190
 platoon that's why I decided about it a little 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 tell a little literally explain 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.730
 show to activate it 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.570
 you need to hold the control counter pressed and here 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.369
 you can add add guys not 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 can add those who are already 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.239
 cocked 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.309
 here and for example here clicked on a plus sign and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 everything happened to you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.950
 message that you invite him to 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.110
 a platoon in a platoon will be easier to perform 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.390
 some specific task for example 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.450
 something to say how to adjust 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 action maybe maybe ask 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 man about some kind of service to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 for example, it was easier for you to do this or 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 other 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.589
 recoil is actually communication in the game this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.899
 one of the main reasons for heaps of victories and 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.320
 the absence of this communication is one of 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.630
 reasons for a bunch of defeats why no communication 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 so hard but it is quite logical why 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.310
 because when for example they compare 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.020
 the first stages especially here is the war against 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.550
 or the Germans great patriotic then 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.000
 very much affected by the absence 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.340
 communication actually really read 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.979
 each other's thoughts are extremely difficult and even 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.860
 if you ever did it then 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.590
 the fact that this time will have to be exactly the same 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.869
 so if there is such an opportunity we 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 left a minority need a little bit 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.340
 wrestle with opponents and let's say 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.500
 they have an advantage but not superfluous 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 the opportunity to actually click and 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.220
 slightly try to increase the chances of 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.860
 victory is why they clicked control 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.869
 I repeat and you have the opportunity 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.090
 choosing who to send maybe you 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.910
 already someone invited here however 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.270
 so that everything works for you 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.290
 I'm talking specifically about voice communication. 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.550
 let's say you no longer need to 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.610
 at the moment when you took 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.790
 sovzvodnogo run for example somewhere in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.820
 sky park ventru teamspeak and so on 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.070
 and the like here you owe them for 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.320
 order to hear your sovzvodnogo 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:35.060
 use voice chat with 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.870
 built into the game for this go here 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.120
 see the sound 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.100
 voice communication enable voice communication 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.739
 choose a button that will 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.299
 activate microphone 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.160
 if you have any complicated there 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.610
 multiple sound card settings 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 select a microphone in the settings and 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.450
 check out 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.580
 how can you hear how everything works further 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.020
 if you have trouble hearing the player's settings 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.030
 sound sensitivity for him 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.810
 your microphone and general level 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.330
 loudness 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.580
 all of you will be after pressing a button 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.000
 speak and basically after your 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.860
 co - op something will click it too 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 how would be willing to communicate you have it 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.080
 the case for this immediately tune once 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.400
 check if everything works and everything and everything 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.290
 when good luck in fights 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.680
 enjoy good thing on health 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.540
 I do not like wargaming and praise but 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.760
 really just great 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.300
 nice all guys hope 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.700
 things will go well everything will be all 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.130
 come in handy I went to win the fight to everyone 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.010
 you bashki everyone good luck 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.020
 you thought I would just leave you alone 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.300
 really that's a little bit really 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.390
 it turned out to go to war 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.870
 look like i threw with you 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.310
 talked like this did not behave badly and to anyone 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.580
 it did not help with everything 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.100
 nothing like I dragged a little bit 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.160
 got a hand Well, of course not I dragged the team 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.200
 Well done , I took my little bit 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.360
 now let's go punish the last thing 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.930
 because it is right well, something like this 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.640
 actually still happens ask me 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.790
 such is an interesting question and you 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.000
 you lose fights if you lose 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.400
 so already lost that even nasty 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.709
 everything happens everything happens do not despair 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.199
 all you get is the main thing to try and 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.389
 not to do stupid things of course very much 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.180
 depends on the team this game and not on 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.050
 command dependent and therefore completely 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.759
 you can never get the whole game out 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.639
 But for this, in order not to 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.740
 so to help the team 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.530
 do all the best of you all that 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.800
 you can do a little bit 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.810
 I get to Fri-shki, okay 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.970
 Do not do anything stupid 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.789
 merge and then you will have everything 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.789
 get and your team 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.360
 here's a little bit killed a little bit shot

 team result probably 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.599
 will be fufufu even so nothing about 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:06.300
