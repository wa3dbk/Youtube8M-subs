00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.320

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.330
 lasagna 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.870
 I would like to present here the following 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.790
 a packet and a half of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.380
 ready mass that goes straight 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.740
 to the oven 700 grams of tea outside 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:55.020

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:59.400
 peeled tomatoes a the grated onion 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.850
 8 tablespoons olive oil 4 cloves garlic 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:07.000
 100 grams of capers and salt to taste 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.390
 we also have as a sauce a video of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 traditional ketchup two cans of cream 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 of milk and 150 grams of parmesan cheese 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:22.560
 grated and 400 grams of mozzarella 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.870
 Let's start first we put the garlic 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.120
 the oil already gave braised 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:36.010
 then oil the onion and place the 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:40.630
 carrot and adds meat soon stirs 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:44.530
 well the meat for her to look good in the uniform 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.010
 and already added the caper does not need 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.630
 to remove the liquid from capers may be 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.140
 all together 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.970
 always stirring and now the tomatoes 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.400
 peeled 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.270
 these tomatoes are already ready in the can 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.990
 skinless tomato a beautiful thing and puts 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 inside everything when he moves it already 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.450
 is developing and getting all the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.750
 uniform NAC 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.750
 car 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.510
 the caper already jumps up if you want 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.290
 add more to the taste of each 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.720
 one 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.720
 now the first came for August 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.230
 We're staying here with a little 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.830
 10 to 15 minutes to go drinking and 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.780
 then complete with plenty of water to 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.630
 leave this rose meat for 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.660
 an hour and a half two hours 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.960
 so I'm going to add to water the 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.470
 water can cover all the meat and 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.070
 here we have an hour and a half to two 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.420
 hours cooking and to give that touch 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.770
 Special 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.890
 I'm going to put a few sheets of 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.010
 Basil can put with the stem 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.670
 because then in the end you take the stem 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.050
 and the leaves already let in and already give 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.990
 all the smell 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.740
 Meanwhile, we are preparing the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.070
 sauce 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.560
 I think it 's a bit of a jerk when 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:25.840
 I already told you that it is very practical ketchup 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.170
 and the two cans of sour cream does 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.870
 this rosÃ© sauce mixes everything that is 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.150
 chop with meat and with the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.910
 alcaparreira that already has in the meat strips 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.910
 that one time gives a special taste 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.030
 ready burned faster than this 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.890
 now let's start the assembly to take 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.300
 the oven first we put a 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.870
 sauce 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.820
 It's always good to put this sauce before 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.090
 so that the mass does not get impregnated in the 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.760
 here in the refractory 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.560
 we distribute here the mass we occupy here 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.020
 all spaces 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.720
 we breaking here a little bit 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.180
 mass is already pre-cooked this mass it does not 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.780
 accurate and on fire it goes directly to the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:44.210
 oven and now the meat and we are doing the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:46.670
 layers after sauce we put 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.850
 a little here grated cheese to 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:54.350
 then we put the last layer 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:57.110
 Parmesan cheese grated cheese leaves a 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.100
 little to leave to the last layer in the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.250
 Last 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:06.010
 and complemented with mozzarella cheese 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.010
 the last layer of mozzarella cheese 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.699
 and to finish a lot of grated cheese 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:20.750
 on top and then we go to the oven and eat 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.490
 This one of the delicious ranch here is the cheese 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.909
 grated always gives that touch zinho 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:29.360
 end on the plate is that dish 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.810
 more tidy but well presented to 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.800
 after it delicious gratina 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:48.949

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:53.449

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:55.310
