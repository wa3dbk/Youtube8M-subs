first<00:00:29.220> impressions<00:00:29.490> video<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.210> didn't

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
first impressions video but it didn't

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.630 
first impressions video but it didn't
really<00:00:30.720> pan<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.349> didn't<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.430> time

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
really pan out and didn't do it in time

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.010 
really pan out and didn't do it in time
so<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:33.180> I'm<00:00:33.300> halfway<00:00:33.480> through<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.870> game

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so now I'm halfway through the game

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.540 
so now I'm halfway through the game
because<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.590> went<00:00:34.770> through<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.920> slowly<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> guess

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
because I went through it slowly I guess

my face and you know it's not often for

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
my face and you know it's not often for
the<00:01:04.589> game<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> makes<00:01:04.949> me<00:01:05.129> do<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.720> you

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the game that makes me do that and you

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
the game that makes me do that and you
know<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> made<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> video<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> while<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.619> about

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
know I made a video a while back about

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
know I made a video a while back about
how<00:01:08.340> clean<00:01:08.700> parts<00:01:09.119> could<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.720> awesomer<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
how clean parts could be awesomer and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.370 
how clean parts could be awesomer and
how<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.590> think<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.210> her<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.260> as

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
how I think that you know her as good as

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.050 
how I think that you know her as good as
this<00:01:13.500> series<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.250> always<00:01:14.490> has<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.880> lot<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this series is it always has a lot of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.429 
this series is it always has a lot of
problems<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.810> things<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.259> could

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
problems and a lot of things they could

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.280 
problems and a lot of things they could
cook<00:01:16.979> done<00:01:17.130> way<00:01:17.310> better<00:01:17.460> um<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.689> King<00:01:18.869> verse<00:01:19.080> 3

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cook done way better um but King verse 3

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.210 
cook done way better um but King verse 3
i<00:01:19.320> think<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.710> first<00:01:19.890> game<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.159> series

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
i think is the first game in this series

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
i think is the first game in this series
where<00:01:20.729> i<00:01:20.759> think<00:01:21.030> they've<00:01:21.150> addressed<00:01:21.509> pretty

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
where i think they've addressed pretty

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.710 
where i think they've addressed pretty
much<00:01:22.500> all<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> problems<00:01:23.220> ahead<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.540> play

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
much all the problems ahead I don't play

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
much all the problems ahead I don't play
this<00:01:24.900> game<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.740> about<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.700> they

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this game and I think about what they

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.219 
this game and I think about what they
could<00:01:27.000> have<00:01:27.090> fixed<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:29.659> what<00:01:30.659> major

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
could have fixed or like what what major

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
could have fixed or like what what major
problems<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> game<00:01:32.009> past<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:33.180> that's<00:01:33.299> not

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
problems the game past but that's not

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.399 
problems the game past but that's not
true<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> any<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.869> theirs<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> any<00:01:34.290> other

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
true of any of theirs that any other

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.840 
true of any of theirs that any other
team<00:01:34.710> hearts<00:01:34.950> games<00:01:35.130> i'm<00:01:35.340> always<00:01:35.610> thinking

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
team hearts games i'm always thinking

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
team hearts games i'm always thinking
about<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.090> audition<00:01:36.450> list<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.049> should<00:01:37.200> done

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
about my audition list it should done

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
about my audition list it should done
that<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.680> should<00:01:37.829> fix<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> etc<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.180> not

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that they should fix this etc but not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
that they should fix this etc but not
with<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.450> game<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.110> i<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.950> that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
with this game so i really think that

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740 
with this game so i really think that
unless<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> goes<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:42.119> down<00:01:42.299> hill<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
unless it goes way down hill in the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
unless it goes way down hill in the
latter<00:01:43.259> half<00:01:43.470> which<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.950> possible<00:01:44.520> that

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
latter half which is possible that

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
latter half which is possible that
happens<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.000> times<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:46.049> but<00:01:46.799> uh

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
happens all the times you know but uh

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.950 
happens all the times you know but uh
unless<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.520> happens<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> be

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
unless that happens this is going to be

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.420 
unless that happens this is going to be
the<00:01:49.140> best<00:01:49.259> kingdom<00:01:49.560> hearts<00:01:49.770> game<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.310> me<00:01:50.399> I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the best kingdom hearts game for me I

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.270 
the best kingdom hearts game for me I
think<00:01:51.409> that's<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> say<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.799> perfect

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
think that's not to say it's perfect

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.069 
think that's not to say it's perfect
there<00:01:53.430> are<00:01:53.520> obviously<00:01:54.060> some<00:01:54.149> problems<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
there are obviously some problems and it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:07.969 
there are obviously some problems and it
does<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.710> annoyances<00:01:56.310> but

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
have these two characters you can play

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.400 
have these two characters you can play
simultaneously<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.480> two<00:02:25.660> very<00:02:25.989> different

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
simultaneously with two very different

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.990 
simultaneously with two very different
versions<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> same<00:02:27.190> world<00:02:27.489> which<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.700> very

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
versions of the same world which is very

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.180 
versions of the same world which is very
interesting<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.680> interplay

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
interesting and I like the interplay

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.530 
interesting and I like the interplay
between<00:02:30.220> two<00:02:30.640> characters<00:02:30.819> as<00:02:31.150> they<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.360> this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
between two characters as they do this

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.540 
between two characters as they do this
there's<00:02:32.050> also<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.620> mechanical<00:02:33.220> side<00:02:33.400> of

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
there's also just the mechanical side of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.630 
there's also just the mechanical side of
it<00:02:33.640> where<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.150> um<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.160> these<00:02:36.400> two

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it where you have um you have these two

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.860 
it where you have um you have these two
different<00:02:36.819> versions<00:02:37.209> of<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.330> world<00:02:37.510> reverse

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
different versions of the world reverse

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.259 
different versions of the world reverse
but<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.190> drop<00:02:39.610> mechanic<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.239> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
but you have the drop mechanic and the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.789 
but you have the drop mechanic and the
drop<00:02:40.540> points<00:02:41.019> where<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.380> collect<00:02:41.530> these

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
drop points where you can collect these

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.320 
drop points where you can collect these
points<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.340> get<00:02:42.489> bonuses<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.209> other

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
points and get bonuses for the other

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.910 
points and get bonuses for the other
character<00:02:43.750> it's<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.350> an<00:02:44.440> interesting

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
character it's just an interesting

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.590 
character it's just an interesting
additional<00:02:45.310> layer<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.640> game<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
additional layer to the game but on the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.690 
additional layer to the game but on the
flip<00:02:46.660> side<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.470> really<00:02:48.160> annoying

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
flip side you have this really annoying

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.350 
flip side you have this really annoying
mechanic<00:02:49.239> nice<00:02:49.360> won't<00:02:49.569> strangle<00:02:49.840> someone<00:02:50.590> um

mechanic nice won't strangle someone um

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.490 
mechanic nice won't strangle someone um
that<00:02:52.360> basically<00:02:53.110> uh<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:55.150> know<00:02:55.330> makes<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.290> time

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that basically uh you know makes a time

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.780 
that basically uh you know makes a time
when<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.100> stop<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:57.400> you're<00:02:57.610> doing

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
when you have to stop what you're doing

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.729 
when you have to stop what you're doing
and<00:02:57.850> go<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.269> other<00:02:58.390> guy<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:59.350> could<00:02:59.650> have

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
and go do the other guy it could have

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.070 
and go do the other guy it could have
been<00:02:59.830> done<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.250> lot<00:03:00.489> better<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:01.030> guess<00:03:01.780> he<00:03:01.930> can

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
been done a lot better I guess he can

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.170 
been done a lot better I guess he can
use<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.350> drop<00:03:02.680> he<00:03:02.950> not<00:03:03.130> hilarious<00:03:03.790> name

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
use the drop he not hilarious name

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.120 
use the drop he not hilarious name
retarded<00:03:05.140> names<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.560> game<00:03:05.709> sometimes

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
retarded names in this game sometimes

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.699 
retarded names in this game sometimes
especially<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.640> title<00:03:06.940> dream<00:03:07.209> Drop<00:03:07.570> Distance

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
especially the title dream Drop Distance

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.240 
especially the title dream Drop Distance
anyway<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:08.739> digress<00:03:08.859> um<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.540> know<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.250> ditch

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
anyway I digress um you know the ditch

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.349 
anyway I digress um you know the ditch
is<00:03:12.280> better<00:03:12.609> way<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.760> think<00:03:12.850> I've<00:03:13.000> handled<00:03:13.269> it

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
is better way to think I've handled it

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.569 
is better way to think I've handled it
something<00:03:13.570> I'm<00:03:13.660> sorry<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.200> talk<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.920> lost

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
something I'm sorry I just talk I lost

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:16.979 
something I'm sorry I just talk I lost
my<00:03:15.670> train<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.940> thought<00:03:16.030> anyway<00:03:16.720> there<00:03:16.870> are<00:03:16.900> a

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
my train of thought anyway there are a

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.990 
my train of thought anyway there are a
lot<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.320> new<00:03:17.530> mechanics<00:03:17.980> in<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.220> game<00:03:18.430> and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
lot of new mechanics in this game and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.610 
lot of new mechanics in this game and
I'm<00:03:19.150> very<00:03:19.329> impressed<00:03:19.510> with<00:03:19.690> some<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:19.959> them<00:03:20.109> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
I'm very impressed with some of them the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.680 
I'm very impressed with some of them the
flow<00:03:20.829> motion<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.430> great<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.030> lot<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.329> it's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
flow motion is great it's a lot of it's

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.390 
flow motion is great it's a lot of it's
a<00:03:22.780> lot<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.019> strategy<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.590> depth<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
a lot of strategy and depth to the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.490 
a lot of strategy and depth to the
combat<00:03:24.790> but<00:03:25.269> also<00:03:25.420> enhances<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.989> platforming

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
combat but also enhances the platforming

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.750 
combat but also enhances the platforming
on<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.769> thought<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.070> was<00:03:27.220> something<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.579> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
on I thought that was something that the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.430 
on I thought that was something that the
series<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.090> elapsed<00:03:28.450> since<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.840> original<00:03:29.079> I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
series is elapsed since the original I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.349 
series is elapsed since the original I
just<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.459> didn't<00:03:30.730> have<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:30.910> platforming

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
just it didn't have the platforming

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.300 
just it didn't have the platforming
again<00:03:31.570> I<00:03:31.600> think<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.109> really<00:03:32.290> missed<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.769> and

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
again I think it really missed that and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.699 
again I think it really missed that and
I<00:03:33.370> think<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.640> adds<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:34.000> lot<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.359> combat<00:03:35.079> options

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
I think it adds a lot to combat options

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.259 
I think it adds a lot to combat options
it's<00:03:35.890> another<00:03:36.100> flaw<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.519> i<00:03:36.760> have<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.000> series

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
it's another flaw that i have the series

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.670 
it's another flaw that i have the series
had<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.480> they<00:03:37.780> never<00:03:37.930> really<00:03:38.019> addressed<00:03:38.410> is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
had that they never really addressed is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.349 
had that they never really addressed is
that<00:03:38.829> you're<00:03:39.250> mostly<00:03:39.549> doing<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.910> same<00:03:40.060> thing

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
that you're mostly doing the same thing

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.440 
that you're mostly doing the same thing
enemies<00:03:40.870> often<00:03:41.380> will<00:03:41.530> force<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.450> change

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
enemies often will force you to change

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.120 
enemies often will force you to change
your<00:03:43.840> strategy<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:44.650> more<00:03:44.890> true<00:03:45.040> in

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
your strategy and that's more true in

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.220 
your strategy and that's more true in
this<00:03:45.250> game<00:03:45.459> too<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:45.850> you<00:03:46.540> always<00:03:46.840> were<00:03:46.989> doing

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
this game too but you always were doing

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.349 
this game too but you always were doing
the<00:03:47.350> same<00:03:47.560> attack<00:03:48.040> against<00:03:48.579> them<00:03:48.730> aside<00:03:49.209> from

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
the same attack against them aside from

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.330 
the same attack against them aside from
your<00:03:49.540> maneuvers<00:03:49.930> so<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.769> game<00:03:51.010> they

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
your maneuvers so in this game they

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.580 
your maneuvers so in this game they
seamlessly<00:03:52.090> actually<00:03:52.959> integrated<00:03:53.410> both

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
seamlessly actually integrated both

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.740 
seamlessly actually integrated both
attack<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.190> maneuver<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.940> given<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.569> lot

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
attack and maneuver and given you a lot

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.030 
attack and maneuver and given you a lot
of<00:03:55.810> different<00:03:55.900> options<00:03:56.440> for<00:03:56.620> how<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.769> can

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
of different options for how you can

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.979 
of different options for how you can
attack<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.400> enemies<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.730> its<00:03:58.660> really<00:03:58.840> great

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
of exploration and the story is just so

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.320 
of exploration and the story is just so
well<00:04:41.650> integrated<00:04:41.949> because<00:04:42.550> like<00:04:42.729> in<00:04:43.060> previous

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330

kingdom<00:04:43.780> hearts<00:04:43.930> games<00:04:44.139> I<00:04:44.319> always<00:04:44.500> felt<00:04:44.680> that

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
kingdom hearts games I always felt that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.490 
kingdom hearts games I always felt that
the<00:04:45.039> overarching<00:04:45.729> plot<00:04:46.210> and<00:04:46.509> each<00:04:47.080> individual

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
the overarching plot and each individual

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.140 
the overarching plot and each individual
world<00:04:47.740> story<00:04:47.949> were<00:04:48.099> very<00:04:48.430> irrelevant<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:49.060> each

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
world story were very irrelevant to each

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.820 
world story were very irrelevant to each
other<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.630> game<00:04:49.870> arts<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.259> there<00:04:50.440> was<00:04:50.620> some

other in game arts to there was some

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.399 
other in game arts to there was some
overlap<00:04:51.280> but<00:04:51.759> usually<00:04:52.150> when<00:04:52.240> organization<00:04:52.930> 13

there<00:04:58.240> as<00:04:58.479> well<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.409> does<00:04:59.650> tie<00:04:59.979> in<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.190> main

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
there as well it does tie in the main

there as well it does tie in the main
plot<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.639> bit<00:05:00.909> because<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.210> those<00:05:01.419> characters

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
plot a bit because of those characters

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.559 
plot a bit because of those characters
and<00:05:02.050> involvement<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:03.580> was<00:05:03.759> always<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.210> matter

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:04.569 
and involvement it was always a matter

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:06.629 
and involvement it was always a matter
of<00:05:04.750> what<00:05:05.349> they<00:05:05.530> were<00:05:05.590> doing<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.220> world

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
of what they were doing in that world

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.999

and it never really affected the other

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:10.649 
and it never really affected the other
stuff<00:05:09.310> even<00:05:09.580> though<00:05:09.639> they<00:05:09.759> said<00:05:10.120> it<00:05:10.240> did<00:05:10.419> it

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659

was<00:05:10.960> an<00:05:11.110> arbitrary<00:05:11.680> statement<00:05:12.009> and<00:05:12.340> the

was an arbitrary statement and the

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.070 
was an arbitrary statement and the

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
overlapping characters we're sinking

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:20.610 
overlapping characters we're sinking
where<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:18.490> 3d<00:05:18.819> um<00:05:19.120> you<00:05:19.509> really<00:05:19.780> just<00:05:20.110> have<00:05:20.349> a

where it's 3d um you really just have a

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.249 
where it's 3d um you really just have a

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
lot of integration of it like maybe

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.809 
lot of integration of it like maybe
that's<00:05:23.500> because<00:05:23.620> of<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.919> dream<00:05:24.099> thing<00:05:24.400> theme

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
that's because of the dream thing theme

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.120 
that's because of the dream thing theme
dream<00:05:25.659> theme<00:05:26.229> every<00:05:26.620> bill<00:05:26.889> that<00:05:26.919> was

dream theme every bill that was
pronounced<00:05:27.580> right<00:05:27.789> this<00:05:27.909> time<00:05:28.030> uh<00:05:28.599> where<00:05:29.259> you

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
pronounced right this time uh where you

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.100 
pronounced right this time uh where you
have<00:05:29.710> characters<00:05:30.340> uh<00:05:30.729> to<00:05:31.360> are<00:05:31.509> basically

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
have characters uh to are basically

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.230 
have characters uh to are basically
dreaming<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.949> worlds<00:05:33.580> are<00:05:33.729> about<00:05:33.759> their

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
dreaming and the worlds are about their

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.240 
dreaming and the worlds are about their
growth<00:05:34.539> but<00:05:35.409> at<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.590> same<00:05:35.740> time<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:35.979> think<00:05:36.159> that

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
growth but at the same time I think that

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.100 
growth but at the same time I think that
that<00:05:36.279> mechanic<00:05:36.789> something<00:05:37.509> similar<00:05:37.779> could<00:05:38.050> be

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
that mechanic something similar could be

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.510 
that mechanic something similar could be
done<00:05:38.319> in<00:05:38.349> future<00:05:38.710> games<00:05:38.740> are<00:05:39.159> in<00:05:39.340> different

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
done in future games are in different

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.580 
done in future games are in different
ways<00:05:39.759> and<00:05:40.090> what<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:40.900> love<00:05:41.110> about<00:05:41.139> it<00:05:41.380> is<00:05:41.560> just

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
ways and what I love about it is just

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.379 
ways and what I love about it is just
the<00:05:41.800> fact<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.190> characters<00:05:42.699> are<00:05:42.819> involvement

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
the fact the characters are involvement

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.749 
the fact the characters are involvement
are<00:05:43.509> interacting<00:05:44.289> with<00:05:44.529> the<00:05:45.250> characters<00:05:45.669> from

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:48.159 
the world but it's always trying into

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.890 
the world but it's always trying into
what<00:05:48.550> they<00:05:48.669> learn<00:05:48.969> about<00:05:49.300> themselves<00:05:49.569> about
