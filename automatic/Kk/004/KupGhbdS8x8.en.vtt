and<00:02:46.440> spawn<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:49.160> another<00:02:50.160> thing<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.580> noticed<00:02:51.030> is

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
and spawn so another thing I noticed is

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.190 
and spawn so another thing I noticed is
that<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:53.489> are<00:02:53.640> no<00:02:53.820> longer<00:02:54.090> able<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.989> the

that you are no longer able to see the

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.370 
that you are no longer able to see the
lag<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> shotgun<00:02:56.610> if<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.060> does<00:02:57.270> lag<00:02:57.540> now

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
lag on the shotgun if it does lag now

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.620 
lag on the shotgun if it does lag now
what<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.590> means<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.000> notice<00:03:00.300> before

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
what that means is if you notice before

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.690 
what that means is if you notice before
the<00:03:00.750> hammer<00:03:00.989> burst<00:03:01.320> no<00:03:01.830> matter<00:03:02.040> how<00:03:02.250> bad<00:03:02.670> it

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
the hammer burst no matter how bad it

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.490 
the hammer burst no matter how bad it
lagged<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.330> was<00:03:03.450> always<00:03:03.870> show<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.110> hammer

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
lagged it was always show the hammer

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.180 
lagged it was always show the hammer
burst<00:03:04.800> hitting<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.550> target<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.770> shotgun

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
burst hitting the target but the shotgun

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.470 
burst hitting the target but the shotgun
does<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.520> now<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:09.390> more

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
does that now so it's a little more
