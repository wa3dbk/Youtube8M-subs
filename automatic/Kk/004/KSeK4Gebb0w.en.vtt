00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.420
Jamie is over and Jamie is gone...

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.800
Jamie has decided it's time to move on.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.900
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon...

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.480
and I'm still hurting.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.340
Did I just hear an alarm start ringing?

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.980
Did I see sirens going flying past?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.340
I gotta a singular impression things are moving too fast.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.840
Pretty good right?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.440
I've never been more attracted to you.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.860
I could wander Paris after dark

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.115
take a carriage ride through Central Park.

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:57.680
But it wouldn't be as nice

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.760
as the summer in Ohio

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.360
friends sharing a room with a former stripper

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.174
and her snake.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.160
Wayne.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.940
Oh my God!

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.820
Look at me!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.500
Look at him!

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.360
Son of a bitch I guess I'm doing something right!

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.800
I finally got something right!

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.540
I have to go!

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.740
You do not have to go!

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:27.768
Cathy...

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.380
CATHY!
