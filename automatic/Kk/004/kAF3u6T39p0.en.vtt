00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 the ministry of communications began to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.990
 prepare the way to turn off the signal 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.599
 Analog TV in 2016 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.119
 last week the group dealing with 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.090

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.550
 check out the report by andrÃ© xavier 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.550
 the group met with a goal in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 mind suggest a timetable by the end of 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.929
 analog TV transmissions is that 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.120
 in just over three years 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 Brazilians are starting to receive only 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.530
 the digital signal 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 today the new technology coexists with a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 old sign 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.670
 even before a setting a point already 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.860
 It's okay with the shutdown, nobody's going 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 To stay without TV signal in Brazil. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.719
 What are we going to do with a schedule? 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 gradually and gradually as the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.250
 population was taking the receiver in their 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.260
 House 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 the little device in your house to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.129
 receive the digital signal 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.430
 we will turning off the cities 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.729
 Brazilian government has already established 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.369
 that broadcasters have to operate 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.229
 simultaneously both nodes and digital 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.330
 so there is no such thing as vai 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 delete and everyone will go without a sign 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 that they do not exist 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 the government intends to make the shutdown 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.020
 of the analog signal step by step 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.270
 first two tests will be done 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.150
 cities will be chosen to be alone. 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.590
 with the pilot digital signal in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.180
 2013 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.759
 the working group wants the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.159
 municipalities have different profiles of 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.380
 population and income 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.630
 the group has one year to complete the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.490
 discussions during this time a 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.909
 proposal will go into public consultation 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 the idea is to do tests already next year 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.630
 all this so that in 2016 130 million 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.719
 of Brazilians can watch TV with 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.490
 exclusively digital technology 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.030
 People want to make a schedule that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.899
 has climbed in these links until 2016 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.060
 will reach about 70% of the population 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 are 130 million inhabitants 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.790
 the rest of the inhabitants will continue 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.500
 an analogue service and from there 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.989
 People are going to make a graduation switch. 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.319
 our digital TV standard was 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.709
 officially chosen in 2006 and has 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.239
 three basic features to 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:31.110
 sound and image interactivity high 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.730
 definition and the possibility of having 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.730
 mobile equipment such as mobile
