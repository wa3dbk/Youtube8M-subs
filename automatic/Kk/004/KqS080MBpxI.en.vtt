 week 173 years 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 the municipality is considered one of the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.049
 major cities of the northeastern interior 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 Brazilian 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.990
 speaking out victory of conquest not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.960
 is only the third largest city in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 Bahia state outside the regions 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.529
 metropolitan today conquest victory 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.510
 also the third largest city in the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.390
 interior of the Brazilian Northeast 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.279
 together with caruaru in pernambuco on the 9th of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
 November the municipality completes one more 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.260
 173 year old birthday 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.200
 throughout this time it seems 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.329
 growth rate of the city to 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.270
 the beginning of the 40 's lived here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.710
 approximately 18 thousand people 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.629
 but during the period of the Second War 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 the lands of conquest 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.910
 have become more attractive to the world 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.190
 here everything was exported an immense 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.090
 variety of products with plant origin 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 and animal 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.390
 Thus, in the 50's, the city 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.990
 jumped to 45 thousand inhabitants giving a 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 of his first broad steps 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 conquest as well as being linked to a 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.070
 bread also had a connection 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.409
 very intense with the coast to develop 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 in cocoa culture and then delmonte 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 lion 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.770
 after en okay right arrow is this 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.090
 development of cocoa 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 in this coastal area in the forest zone 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.360
 with which there was a great city of 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.020
 food and other goods the population 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.290
 has grown very much in the Atlantic 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.329
 region near the coast where 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.450
 in cocoa implanted without the crop is 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.820
 large economic structure then 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.759
 conquest began to send to this 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.060
 the skin to flour a curd is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.270
 product dried meat products not here 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.590
 is the same time get there the products 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.340
 propper movement is at this time and rui 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.280
 I link linking conquest to this region 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.350
 the city began to grow first 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.480
 the eastern part of the municipality in the 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.940
 avenue olivia flowers after the zone 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.940
 west result of construction of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.950
 such as the avenue 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.290
 integration that cuts victory of the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.720
 conquest in the middle connecting the municipality to 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.370
 southeast region of the country 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.120
 people from all over Brazil 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.400
 began to arrive like to live that the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.330
 increased in the 1990s. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.650
 of 80 plus utilities 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.120
 began to be offered 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 beginning with level education 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.989
 upper and a little further 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.860
 in 1997 with the municipalization of the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.019
 Cheers 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.850
 the dirty service of the sus at that time 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.590
 is important but accreditation is 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.790
 made direct with hospitals 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.440
 then the several municipalities patients 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.590
 came and looked directly for the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.720
 service and at that time did not have 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.640
 thank you services and civilians until 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.350
 low - complexity care little 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.709
 spontaneous demand that existed in that 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.530
 time as health municipalization 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.829
 a very important fact occurred because 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:39.070
 He took from these various services 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.019
 hospitals practically the accreditation 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.500
 that they had then there was a reduction 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.450
 of the quotas they met 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.750
 spontaneously the municipality became 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.970
 manage it so all the hospitals 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.769
 they had to find a 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.590
 The way they had to find 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.329
 a solution then the municipalization means 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.570
 that forced the staff to shake the dust 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:04.299
 and rethinking health through municipalization 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.940
 health initiative, the private initiative 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.250
 to offer more and more 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.709
 high and medium clinical complexity 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.870
 grew into hospitals 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.280
 all this construction for example is 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.920
 rated at 30 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.260
 millions of reais akira work one 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.750
 hospital of high complexity 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.120
 today approximately 90 municipalities 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.110
 depend on these health services. 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.840
 in 1978 victory of the conquest had less 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.970
 of 80 thousand inhabitants in the 80's was 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.340
 can count on one hand the number of 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.000
 buildings that existed here 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.380
 today's conquest victory has almost 350 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.389
 thousand residents 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.160
 not to mention the floating population 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.590
 those people who come to the city to 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.320
 study and work but do not live here 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.740
 ten years ago this immense amount of 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.570
 buildings did not exist the process of 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.669
 verticalization of the city ​​comes with 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.890
 progress increases the quantity and 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.870
 money movement in the municipality 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.450
 but we need to think about the impact that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:08.260
 so much change can generate revenue 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:12.010
 visually imposes that the city is 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.910
 strong but it hides serious problems 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.950
 for example you did not prepare the city 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.080
 here are some points for that 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.400
 point is vertical there we have 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.110
 narrow streets 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.370
 so you then if you have streets 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.860
 how close are we going 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.530
 equate the mass transport of that 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.289
 region and at the same time equate it 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.750
 together with private transport 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.460
 in addition to the attractive sectors of health and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.380
 education is one of the main 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.410
 growth in real estate 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.810
 here is the federal project my house 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.180
 my life, credit in institutions 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.370
 public financial institutions has 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.010
 increased and thus the number of 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.229
 speculations and constructions also 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.240
 people look for apartments and 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.150
 look for houses also this question 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.820
 of the gated community has really been 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.479
 a tendency of these condominiums to 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.910
 houses and is are new things in conquest 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.950
 then it has been the trend is also 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.990
 victory of conquest is one of the few 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.070
 municipalities of the interior of Bahia that 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.630
 a master plan of development 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.250
 urban 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.289
 however the project that is in force 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.110
 needs to be reviewed in the light of 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.510
 urgency the plan was drawn up in 2006 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.390
 but forecasts have not been able to 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.880
 imagine a growth 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.620
 year as big as the clan now 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.560
 everything has to be reviewed every five 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.350
 years right now and you are experiencing 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.630
 growth let's say so do not 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.450
 to contemplate in the urban planning of 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.400
 hands of 10 years from six years ago 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.630
 especially with these programs 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.120
 federal 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.700
 it is not that we identify the principal 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.310
 My home, my life, I brought the 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.200
 urban development for most of the 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.340
 Brazilian municipalities, this was not 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.590
 foreseen 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.990
 for example in the 2006 Master Plan of 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.930
 victory of conquest and this could 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.210
 expand the city in a way that is 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.570
 attracting not only these enterprises 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.070
 social class from zero to three 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:11.160
 minimum wages plus others 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.560
 ventures of large size and 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.690
 large investments proposed by 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.310
 Brazil's business time in the city 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.910
 medium-sized 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:23.370
 even in the face of all the difficulties 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:26.610
 80% of the city has or is in the process of 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.010
 installation of sewage networks and 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.380
 municipalities of brazil seven cities of Minas Gerais 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.890
 resort to the victory of conquest seeks 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.900
 services and better living conditions 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.590
 during this whole week we will be 

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:42.930
 showing here matters in relation to 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.450
 reports on the city ​​of 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.030
 victory of conquest is the third largest 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.639
 bahia state that is growing there 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.400
 selection is that entrepreneurs know this 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:56.449
 construction of building constructions 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.729
 city ​​has grown and continues to grow 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:05.669
 victory of conquest it tarter around 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:07.680
 of 336 thousand inhabitants but of all that 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:10.889
 region around its achievements and 

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.669
 almost 500 thousand inhabitants 

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:13.669
 at the time of conquest
