hodo blending brush I am just going to
start<00:01:18.000> putting<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> outer<00:01:19.170> corner

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
start putting this in the outer corner

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
start putting this in the outer corner
and<00:01:20.000> starting<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> build<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.660> there<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and starting to build it up there and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
and starting to build it up there and
pull<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:23.730> halfway<00:01:24.000> across<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
pull it just about halfway across the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.920 
pull it just about halfway across the
crease<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.260> now<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.690> just<00:01:27.750> going

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
crease for now and then I'm just going

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.420 
crease for now and then I'm just going
to<00:01:27.990> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.260> lightly<00:01:28.500> blend<00:01:28.830> it<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> rest<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
to kind of lightly blend it the rest of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.130 
to kind of lightly blend it the rest of
the<00:01:29.520> way<00:01:29.640> without<00:01:29.820> any<00:01:30.090> extra<00:01:30.450> product<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the way without any extra product and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.980 
the way without any extra product and
then<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.340> take<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:32.760> 286<00:01:33.480> brush<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
then just take that 286 brush with a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.290 
then just take that 286 brush with a
little<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.350> more<00:01:34.530> free<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.370> continue

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
little bit more free to be and continue

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.330 
little bit more free to be and continue
blending<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.840> color<00:01:37.230> in<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.830> it<00:01:37.950> blends<00:01:38.190> in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
blending that color in so it blends in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.840 
blending that color in so it blends in
really<00:01:38.400> softly<00:01:39.260> and<00:01:40.260> I'm<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.590> basically

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
really softly and I'm just basically

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.950 
really softly and I'm just basically
building<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.090> color<00:01:42.330> until<00:01:42.660> it's<00:01:42.840> as

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
building up this color until it's as

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.990 
building up this color until it's as
deep<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.830> be<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.550> I'm<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
deep as I want it to be but I'm really

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.020 
deep as I want it to be but I'm really
mainly<00:01:45.300> focusing<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.260> outer<00:01:46.500> V<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
mainly focusing on that outer V and the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.210 
mainly focusing on that outer V and the
