estimate<00:00:31.619> it'd<00:00:31.740> be<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.009> summer<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> next

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
stuff I think we haven't really decided

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
stuff I think we haven't really decided
yet<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.879> section<00:00:42.300> 8<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
yet but like section 8 was like kind of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.100 
yet but like section 8 was like kind of
like<00:00:43.170> something<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:46.079> know

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
on the EP is like a new song but I think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.439

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.510 
the fans fans recommendations on that
well<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> mean<00:01:37.409> we've<00:01:38.250> had<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.820> guest<00:01:40.520> vocalist

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
well I mean we've had a guest vocalist

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.460 
well I mean we've had a guest vocalist
on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> last<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.869> first<00:01:43.079> album<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.439> did

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
on the last to the first album we did

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.130 
on the last to the first album we did
and<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.280> mean<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.210> guess<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> will<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.049> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and I mean I guess it will just have to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.990 
and I mean I guess it will just have to
go<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> flow<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.159> happens

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
go with the flow and see what happens

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.170 
go with the flow and see what happens
because<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.899> mean<00:01:49.560> there's<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.880> guest

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
because I mean there's there's guest

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
because I mean there's there's guest
vocalists<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.930> there<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> know<00:01:52.590> could

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
vocalists out there that you know could

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.700 
vocalists out there that you know could
easily<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> album<00:01:53.670> but<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.710> it's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
easily make the album but it's just it's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
easily make the album but it's just it's
it's<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.130> matter<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.759> actually<00:01:57.210> being

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
it's a matter of like actually being

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330

able<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.799> them<00:01:58.979> find<00:01:59.219> the
