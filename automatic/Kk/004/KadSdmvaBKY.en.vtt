like<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:46.900> larger<00:03:47.350> 12<00:03:47.620> that's<00:03:48.340> because<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.880> is

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
like a larger 12 that's because it is

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.190

motor<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.920> same<00:03:51.870> roughly<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.050> same

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
motor is the same roughly the same

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.300

amount<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.500> weight<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:53.770> actually<00:03:54.100> kind<00:03:54.280> of

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
amount of weight it actually kind of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.010 
amount of weight it actually kind of
feels<00:03:54.490> lighter<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.910> guess<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.270> a<00:03:55.300> 15<00:03:55.720> just

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020
