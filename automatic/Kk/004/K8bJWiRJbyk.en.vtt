air sealing and of filling the cavity
completely<00:00:23.470> to<00:00:24.100> get<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.550> really<00:00:24.940> good<00:00:25.350> r-value

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
completely to get a really good r-value

completely to get a really good r-value
in<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.980> walls<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:28.150> we're<00:00:29.109> going<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.410> be<00:00:29.500> fixing

in the walls so we're going to be fixing
this<00:00:30.070> situation<00:00:30.699> in<00:00:30.820> this<00:00:30.970> particular<00:00:31.330> house

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
this situation in this particular house

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.989 
this situation in this particular house
which<00:00:32.469> is<00:00:32.649> a<00:00:32.680> raised<00:00:33.010> ranch<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:33.670> has<00:00:33.819> an

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:33.999 
which is a raised ranch that has an

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.360 
which is a raised ranch that has an
addition<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:34.569> to<00:00:34.809> it<00:00:34.989> and<00:00:35.199> we're<00:00:36.010> going<00:00:36.039> to<00:00:36.159> do

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
addition on to it and we're going to do

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.329 
addition on to it and we're going to do
that<00:00:36.519> by<00:00:36.789> injecting<00:00:36.999> urethane<00:00:37.989> foam<00:00:38.289> into<00:00:39.249> the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
that by injecting urethane foam into the

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.430 
that by injecting urethane foam into the
wall<00:00:39.550> cavities<00:00:40.089> so<00:00:40.569> now<00:00:40.719> you<00:00:40.780> might<00:00:41.019> say<00:00:41.229> well

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
wall cavities so now you might say well

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.619 
wall cavities so now you might say well
gee<00:00:41.469> how<00:00:42.190> do<00:00:42.249> you<00:00:42.429> do<00:00:42.609> that<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:42.819> an<00:00:43.089> existing

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
gee how do you do that on an existing

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.779 
gee how do you do that on an existing
house<00:00:43.839> let<00:00:44.440> me<00:00:44.469> show<00:00:44.710> you<00:00:44.769> this<00:00:45.219> house<00:00:45.489> has

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
house let me show you this house has

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.180 
house let me show you this house has
vinyl<00:00:46.210> siding<00:00:46.659> so<00:00:46.870> vinyl<00:00:47.679> siding<00:00:48.069> is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
vinyl siding so vinyl siding is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.759 
vinyl siding so vinyl siding is
relatively<00:00:48.760> easy<00:00:49.089> for<00:00:49.269> us<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.659> get<00:00:49.780> off<00:00:50.049> so<00:00:50.620> we

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
relatively easy for us to get off so we

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.039 
relatively easy for us to get off so we
can<00:00:50.920> access<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.639> wall<00:00:51.909> sheathing<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.600> drill<00:00:52.870> 2

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
can access the wall sheathing to drill 2

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.319 
can access the wall sheathing to drill 2
and<00:00:53.199> 1/2<00:00:53.289> inch<00:00:53.620> holes<00:00:53.889> into<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.519> so<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.209> we

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
and 1/2 inch holes into it so that we

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.360 
and 1/2 inch holes into it so that we
can<00:00:55.479> get<00:00:55.690> the<00:00:55.809> foam<00:00:56.049> in<00:00:56.289> there<00:00:56.469> if<00:00:56.709> you<00:00:57.339> have

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
can get the foam in there if you have

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.649 
can get the foam in there if you have
shingles<00:00:58.359> then<00:00:58.719> we<00:00:58.899> simply<00:00:59.739> cut<00:01:00.069> a<00:01:00.280> shingle

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
shingles then we simply cut a shingle

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.910 
shingles then we simply cut a shingle
wherever<00:01:01.659> we<00:01:01.809> want<00:01:01.989> to<00:01:02.079> drill<00:01:02.260> a<00:01:02.289> hole<00:01:02.379> pull

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
wherever we want to drill a hole pull

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.680 
wherever we want to drill a hole pull
that<00:01:03.039> shingle<00:01:03.339> off<00:01:03.639> drill<00:01:04.059> our<00:01:04.210> hole<00:01:04.420> and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
that shingle off drill our hole and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.810 
that shingle off drill our hole and
afterwards<00:01:05.620> we'll<00:01:05.830> plug<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.100> hole<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.670> put

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
afterwards we'll plug the hole and put

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.000 
afterwards we'll plug the hole and put
that<00:01:07.000> shingle<00:01:07.270> back<00:01:07.660> where<00:01:07.960> it<00:01:08.110> was<00:01:08.140> as<00:01:08.950> you

but<00:01:49.450> look<00:01:49.480> at<00:01:49.659> this<00:01:49.870> this<00:01:50.200> is<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:51.220> turned<00:01:51.810> grey

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
but look at this this is it turned grey

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.930 
but look at this this is it turned grey
and<00:01:53.200> black<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:53.980> means<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.760> it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
and black and that means that it's

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.120 
and black and that means that it's
filtering<00:01:55.420> air<00:01:55.870> so<00:01:56.500> there's<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.710> lot<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.950> air

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
filtering air so there's a lot of air

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.550 
filtering air so there's a lot of air
flowing<00:01:57.760> through<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:58.060> wall<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.780> as<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.409> air

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
flowing through this wall and as the air

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.410 
flowing through this wall and as the air
flows<00:01:59.860> through<00:02:00.159> this<00:02:00.370> fiberglass<00:02:00.820> just<00:02:01.210> acts

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
flows through this fiberglass just acts

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.930 
flows through this fiberglass just acts
as<00:02:01.630> an<00:02:01.750> air<00:02:01.900> filter<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.560> doesn't<00:02:03.430> block<00:02:03.640> air

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
as an air filter it doesn't block air

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.090 
as an air filter it doesn't block air
flow<00:02:04.210> at<00:02:04.390> all<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.840> lets<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.290> air<00:02:05.320> through<00:02:05.950> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
flow at all it lets the air through the

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.300 
flow at all it lets the air through the
wall<00:02:06.280> into<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.360> house<00:02:07.510> and<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.830> captures

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
wall into the house and just captures

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.300 
wall into the house and just captures
the<00:02:09.489> dust<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:09.999> with<00:02:10.599> fiberglass<00:02:11.069> you've<00:02:12.069> got

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
the dust so with fiberglass you've got

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.240 
the dust so with fiberglass you've got
basically<00:02:12.579> one<00:02:13.209> big<00:02:13.510> pink<00:02:13.870> air<00:02:14.170> filter

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
basically one big pink air filter

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.980 
basically one big pink air filter
