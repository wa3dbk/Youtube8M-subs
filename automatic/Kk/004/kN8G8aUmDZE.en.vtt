00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
have normal piston doors we have logic

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.370 
have normal piston doors we have logic
gates<00:00:26.290> and<00:00:26.910> yeah<00:00:27.910> block<00:00:28.540> swampers<00:00:28.930> all<00:00:29.200> that

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.170 
gates and yeah block swampers all that
stuff<00:00:29.649> but<00:00:30.189> what<00:00:30.489> I'm<00:00:30.579> going<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:30.849> be<00:00:30.939> showing

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
stuff but what I'm going to be showing

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.299 
stuff but what I'm going to be showing
you<00:00:31.360> is<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:31.899> hipster<00:00:32.649> door<00:00:32.829> which<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.100> made

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
you is this hipster door which I made

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.709 
you is this hipster door which I made
and<00:00:35.130> piston<00:00:36.130> layout<00:00:36.489> on<00:00:36.700> this<00:00:36.850> is<00:00:37.149> kind<00:00:37.600> of

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
and piston layout on this is kind of

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.540 
and piston layout on this is kind of
different<00:00:38.410> from<00:00:38.800> what<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.190> would<00:00:39.309> usually

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
different from what you would usually

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.009 
different from what you would usually
use<00:00:39.820> which<00:00:40.660> is<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:41.280> xxx<00:00:42.280> Center<00:00:42.609> with<00:00:42.899> row<00:00:43.899> of

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019 
use which is a xxx Center with row of

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.139 
use which is a xxx Center with row of
Pistons<00:00:44.140> here<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.239> yeah<00:00:46.480> this<00:00:46.629> is<00:00:46.690> inspired<00:00:47.379> by

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
Pistons here so yeah this is inspired by

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.509 
Pistons here so yeah this is inspired by
say<00:00:49.149> torch<00:00:49.539> I<00:00:49.989> think<00:00:50.890> that's<00:00:51.070> his<00:00:51.219> username

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
say torch I think that's his username

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.860 
say torch I think that's his username
say<00:00:51.879> torches<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.800> high<00:00:53.980> expandable<00:00:54.579> wall

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
say torches for high expandable wall

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.259 
say torches for high expandable wall
this<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:56.440> slight<00:00:57.129> modification<00:00:57.309> of<00:00:57.999> his

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
this is a slight modification of his

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:04.110 
this is a slight modification of his
piston<00:00:58.629> layups<00:00:59.039> to<00:01:00.039> make<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.969> to<00:01:01.809> high<00:01:03.120> or

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
piston layups to make it a to high or

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.600 
piston layups to make it a to high or
too<00:01:04.720> low

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
too low

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.170 
too low
hipster<00:01:06.990> ceiling<00:01:08.610> ceiling<00:01:09.610> hipster<00:01:10.030> door

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
hipster ceiling ceiling hipster door

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.530 
hipster ceiling ceiling hipster door
yeah<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.970> yeah

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
yeah so yeah

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.450 
yeah so yeah
as<00:01:13.780> with<00:01:14.049> all<00:01:14.229> servers<00:01:14.680> there<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.040> going<00:01:15.250> to<00:01:15.340> be

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
as with all servers there is going to be

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.810 
as with all servers there is going to be
a<00:01:15.670> little<00:01:16.090> little<00:01:16.960> bit<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.439> lag<00:01:17.799> because<00:01:18.159> I'm

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
a little little bit of lag because I'm

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.940 
a little little bit of lag because I'm
actually<00:01:19.570> quite<00:01:19.960> far<00:01:20.259> away<00:01:20.409> from<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.710> server

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
actually quite far away from the server

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.399 
actually quite far away from the server
and<00:01:21.070> also<00:01:21.610> because<00:01:21.880> my<00:01:22.060> internet<00:01:22.780> isn't<00:01:23.229> going

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
and also because my internet isn't going

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.840 
and also because my internet isn't going
to<00:01:23.500> be<00:01:23.590> instant<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.060> yeah<00:01:25.299> here's<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.200> closing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
to be instant so yeah here's the closing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.150 
to be instant so yeah here's the closing
and<00:01:28.890> here's<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:30.100> opening

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.520 

so<00:01:36.160> there<00:01:36.640> I'm<00:01:37.180> going<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.630> pop<00:01:37.900> over<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.170> single

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
so there I'm going to pop over to single

are<00:03:42.610> going<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.030> be<00:03:43.500> normal<00:03:44.500> blocks

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
are going to be normal blocks

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:55.630 
are going to be normal blocks
and<00:03:45.650> these<00:03:46.160> will<00:03:46.400> be<00:03:46.489> half<00:03:46.730> subs<00:03:47.000> now<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:55.340> wire

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
so give it a spin and it should work so

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.390 
so give it a spin and it should work so
there<00:06:43.700> you<00:06:43.820> have<00:06:43.850> it<00:06:44.139> does<00:06:45.139> it<00:06:45.380> guys<00:06:45.590> I'll<00:06:45.979> see
