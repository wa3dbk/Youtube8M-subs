00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
hi this is a quick fix on one of the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.570 
hi this is a quick fix on one of the
things<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.570> go<00:00:03.689> bad<00:00:03.899> with<00:00:04.170> your<00:00:04.580> fish

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
things that can go bad with your fish

things that can go bad with your fish
tank<00:00:05.790> air<00:00:06.029> pump<00:00:07.790> I've<00:00:08.790> had<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.269> problem

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
tank air pump I've had this problem

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.749 
tank air pump I've had this problem
twice<00:00:10.800> now<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:11.870> what<00:00:12.870> happens<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.759> little

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
twice now and what happens is the little

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.810 
twice now and what happens is the little
Reed<00:00:15.089> valve<00:00:15.360> inside<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.199> pump<00:00:16.619> breaks<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
Reed valve inside the pump breaks and

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.450 
Reed valve inside the pump breaks and
the<00:00:18.810> pump<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:19.140> be<00:00:19.230> humming<00:00:19.529> along<00:00:19.830> but<00:00:20.279> no

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
the pump will be humming along but no

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.250 
the pump will be humming along but no
air<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:20.789> be<00:00:20.910> coming<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.300> now<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.140> just

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
air will be coming out now this is just

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
air will be coming out now this is just
one<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> problems<00:00:23.119> there<00:00:24.119> are<00:00:24.300> other<00:00:24.480> ones

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
one of the problems there are other ones

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660 
one of the problems there are other ones
that<00:00:24.900> can<00:00:25.019> happen<00:00:25.199> inside<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.369> one's<00:00:26.580> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that can happen inside but this one's a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.650 
that can happen inside but this one's a
very<00:00:26.880> easy<00:00:27.119> fix

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
very easy fix

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.189 
very easy fix
you<00:00:28.619> pull<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> cover<00:00:29.609> off<00:00:29.750> most<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> pumps

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you pull the cover off most of the pumps

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.959 
you pull the cover off most of the pumps
are<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> same<00:00:31.619> inside<00:00:32.009> not<00:00:32.279> all<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.669> mostly

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
are the same inside not all but mostly

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.810 
are the same inside not all but mostly
and<00:00:33.739> you<00:00:34.739> pull<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> actual<00:00:35.460> pump

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and you pull out the actual pump

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.340 
and you pull out the actual pump
mechanism<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:38.030> when<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.149> pop<00:00:39.360> off<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
mechanism and when you pop off the the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.650 
mechanism and when you pop off the the
diaphragm<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.340> fits<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.030> top<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.480> just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
diaphragm here that fits on top it just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.290 
diaphragm here that fits on top it just
it's<00:00:42.960> snaps<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.920> top<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.700> pull<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.059> off<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it's snaps on top just pull that off and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's snaps on top just pull that off and
inside<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.230> will<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:47.149> little<00:00:48.149> valve<00:00:48.360> body

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
inside there will be a little valve body

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.290 
inside there will be a little valve body
and<00:00:50.719> this<00:00:51.719> valve<00:00:51.989> body<00:00:52.289> has<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.070> two<00:00:54.000> little

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and this valve body has the two little

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.250 
and this valve body has the two little
rubber<00:00:55.250> Reed<00:00:56.250> valves<00:00:57.030> inside<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.989> lot<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
rubber Reed valves inside and a lot of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.779 
rubber Reed valves inside and a lot of
times<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> those<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.190> break<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.579> doesn't

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
times one of those will break it doesn't

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609 
times one of those will break it doesn't
matter<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> either<00:01:04.049> one<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.500> them

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
matter which one it either one of them

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.920 
matter which one it either one of them
breaks<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.369> pumps<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.119> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.630> it's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
breaks the pumps not going to work it's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
breaks the pumps not going to work it's
going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> hum<00:01:08.070> along<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> not<00:01:08.850> actually<00:01:09.240> pump

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to hum along and not actually pump

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.580 
going to hum along and not actually pump
air<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> fix<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.140> actually

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
air so the fix is is you can actually

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
air so the fix is is you can actually
replace<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> ziplock<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:16.110> plastic

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
replace this with a ziplock the plastic

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.880 
replace this with a ziplock the plastic
from<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.799> ziplock<00:01:17.220> plastic<00:01:17.250> bag<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.890> that's

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
from a ziplock plastic bag and that's

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
from a ziplock plastic bag and that's
what<00:01:20.130> I've<00:01:20.250> done<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.640> main<00:01:21.000> pump<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what I've done with my main pump and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
what I've done with my main pump and
I've<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:23.189> had<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.700> running<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:25.259> four

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I've now had it running for about four

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.319 
I've now had it running for about four
months<00:01:26.479> straight<00:01:27.650> 24<00:01:28.650> hours<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> day<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
months straight 24 hours a day and it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.499 
months straight 24 hours a day and it
hasn't<00:01:30.509> failed<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.020> me<00:01:31.049> yet<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> I've<00:01:32.820> tried<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
hasn't failed on me yet so I've tried it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.249 
hasn't failed on me yet so I've tried it
it's<00:01:33.780> worked<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.799> super<00:01:35.400> cheap<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.259> super

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's worked it's super cheap and super

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.950 
it's worked it's super cheap and super
easy<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:38.909> see<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.390> valve<00:01:39.630> body

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
easy as you can see on this valve body

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.219 
easy as you can see on this valve body
there's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.619> plastic<00:01:41.810> like<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
there's a little plastic like a little

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.810 
there's a little plastic like a little
piece<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> rubber<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.399> holds<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
piece of rubber that actually holds the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.590 
piece of rubber that actually holds the
little<00:01:45.720> Reed<00:01:45.960> valve<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.619> place<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:48.570> can

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
little Reed valve in place and you can

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.569 
little Reed valve in place and you can
pop<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:50.509> with<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:52.290> use<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.460> an

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
pop that out with a I use a like an

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.960 
pop that out with a I use a like an
exacto<00:01:54.060> knife

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.310 

there<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:02.119> goes<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.450> just<00:02:02.600> popped<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.960> out<00:02:03.049> and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
there it goes I just popped it out and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.020 
there it goes I just popped it out and
then<00:02:03.439> on<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.979> bottom<00:02:04.310> here<00:02:04.490> you'll<00:02:04.640> see<00:02:04.850> this

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
then on the bottom here you'll see this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.080 
then on the bottom here you'll see this
is<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.330> actual<00:02:05.689> little<00:02:06.350> revolve<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.909> lot

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
is the actual little revolve and a lot

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.910 
is the actual little revolve and a lot
of<00:02:08.209> times<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:10.369> will<00:02:10.520> break<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:12.020> what<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.800> do

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
of times that will break so what you do

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.339 
of times that will break so what you do
now<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.760> cut<00:02:14.239> out<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.420> piece<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.720> plastic

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
now is you cut out a piece of plastic

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.180 
now is you cut out a piece of plastic
out<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.830> ziplock<00:02:16.340> plastic<00:02:16.940> bag<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> same

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
out of a ziplock plastic bag to the same

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
said I've had it running for about four

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.130 
said I've had it running for about four
months<00:02:30.110> now<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.709> no<00:02:30.860> problems<00:02:31.840> it's<00:02:32.840> an<00:02:32.989> easy

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
months now with no problems it's an easy

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.430 
months now with no problems it's an easy
fix<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.660> just<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.050> things<00:02:36.290> that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
fix and just one of the things that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.660 
fix and just one of the things that
could<00:02:36.530> go<00:02:36.590> bad<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.069> your<00:02:37.190> pump<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.550> you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
could go bad with your pump and you

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.509 
could go bad with your pump and you
don't<00:02:37.819> need<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:37.970> buy<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.209> new<00:02:38.330> pump<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:40.400> I'm

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
don't need to buy a new pump what I'm

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.670 
don't need to buy a new pump what I'm
going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.730> do<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.000> up<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:42.410> what<00:02:42.530> I'm<00:02:42.590> going

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
going to do it up I think what I'm going

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.220 
going to do it up I think what I'm going
to<00:02:42.739> end<00:02:42.799> up<00:02:42.950> doing<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.340> my<00:02:43.459> my<00:02:44.090> pawn<00:02:44.870> pump

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
to end up doing on my my pawn pump

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770 
to end up doing on my my pawn pump
anyway<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.950> I'm<00:02:46.610> going<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.819> have<00:02:46.940> two<00:02:47.330> smaller

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
anyway is I'm going to have two smaller

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.860 
anyway is I'm going to have two smaller
pumps<00:02:48.260> running<00:02:48.500> at<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.830> same<00:02:49.010> time<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.870> that

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
pumps running at the same time and that

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.690 
pumps running at the same time and that
way<00:02:51.049> if<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.709> failure<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.400> future

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
way if I do have a failure in the future

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.440 
way if I do have a failure in the future
I<00:02:54.069> will<00:02:55.069> at<00:02:55.250> least<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.700> one<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.090> pumps

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
I will at least have one of the pumps

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.520 
I will at least have one of the pumps
pump<00:02:56.959> an<00:02:57.110> error<00:02:58.450> now<00:02:59.450> what<00:02:59.660> I<00:02:59.690> did<00:02:59.989> was<00:03:00.170> I<00:03:00.290> went

ahead<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.540> replaced<00:03:02.540> both<00:03:02.780> sides<00:03:03.200> even

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
ahead and replaced both sides even

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.930 
ahead and replaced both sides even
though<00:03:03.739> only<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.160> failed

though only one failed
I<00:03:05.200> cut<00:03:06.200> replacements<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:06.950> both<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:08.500> put<00:03:09.500> it

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
I cut replacements for both and put it
