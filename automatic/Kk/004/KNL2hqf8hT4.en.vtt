00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello readers hotel show of jota's blog 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.299
 for the online space to the point with you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.000
 here again 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.800
 and today I'll show you how it is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.190
 what we do to access partitions 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.020
 of linux being on windows 8 but 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.369
 suppose you have a computer 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.730
 dual boot and this dual boot has to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.800
 example ubuntu and windows 8 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 Ah, I'll show you how the 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.390
 People do to access the petitions dodo 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.750
 or ubuntu 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.450
 even being inside windows 8 on 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.700
 in case this very interesting tutorial 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.670
 Because I searched, I needed it. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.219
 today I looked for thousands of programs 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.640
 that used in windows 7 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 actually it was two I think not 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 they worked neither of the two and amb 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.149
 search some forums and nobody 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.149
 knew nothing and nobody said anything 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.719
 about this then i uncover linux 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.470
 windows and linux and reader that in case 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.020
 here it is it's not like the others 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.689
 places not mount the conditions and he me 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.010
 you can access the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.400
 linux versions 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.860
 inside it will not mount position here 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.810
 on your computer as is the case with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 program made it here so it's really 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.939
 you will actually download this 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.009
 program besides twitter will install and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 Let's install it here, right? 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.250
 a next next to eurides until the end no 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.229
 It has very secret not finished 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570
 installation has this box marked 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.549
 here to run the program as soon as 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.979
 finish the installation I'll leave it checked 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.720
 I'll put it in a finish 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.509
 from the moment a click on 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.930
 finish here it will read detect your 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.050
 drivers 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 there are in fact the positions you have in your 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.230
 hd in case I have hd sound with a 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.780
 two three four five issues 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.840
 There here have versions of windows 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.430
 Even though you can see there in my 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.850
 computer IACC itaú 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.200
 the seizure of linux is there to download 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.780
 something to access the data 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.950
 simply give the petition two clicks 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.930
 He's going to open there, I believe he 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 works and not at higher resolutions 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.230
 computer because in my case 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.530
 wealth 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.020
 in this resolution but it was very good 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.130
 the small medium but still works 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.050
 perfectly 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.270
 so for example you want to get the file 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.100
 it's in my workspace side of the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.280
 beautiful dodo 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.160
 so I came here on roni open the folder 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.640
 luiz otávio that in the case of my name a 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.220
 I go there on my desktop to the folder 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.020
 work call and pick up the 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.930
 file here 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.239
 here is the following I simply 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.430
 click on for example the file to 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.720
 folder that I do not want to assume that a 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.640
 shortcut 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.950
 Let's suppose I want to get this 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.620
 folder that calls email and the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.090
 sure I sing select folder 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.840
 click the right mouse button 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.400
 on it and select the sei option 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.739
 I know this option is only an option not to 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.230
 that there is this window here maybe in 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.930
 other regions is something else 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.430
 here you do not touch anything of the advance 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.590
 next in case 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.049
 then he will ask you what is the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.239
 directory you want to save this 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:38.110
 folder here also ask if you want 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:43.750
 save directory structure mark 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.489
 team is the one I want to fibrosis or even 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.760
 for example you want to save that 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.220
 part of my work area than the 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.090
 from mexico here 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.290
 Then he shows me what I'm saving. 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:01.500
 on the next one and then it's kind of 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.870
 in quotation marks download the file to your 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.310
 desktop files in fact 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.380
 for your desktop 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.540
 Then I give a movie x I already determined I 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.980
 I can close, I can continue 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.990
 looking for other files here to selic 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.769
 in case he asks if it has closed 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:25.950
 so let's check it out from here 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:28.260
 send mail and the data that is what 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.240
 were on the linux desktop now 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.970
 is the name of the desktop of the 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.950
 windows is important to remember that this 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.230
 not is not is not the sync 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.020
 then the files you 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.540
 operate here so you're probably going to 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.930
 have to go back and pick it up again and 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.790
 put it in your book file that 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.890
 you will get in linux will not be 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.400
 updated on windows you will have to 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.530
 go there and go down again to personal well 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.419
 this very fast turning point actually 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.150
 nor a tutorial a presentation of 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.120
 excellent program and I found it in 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:07.320
 I hope it is useful for everything
