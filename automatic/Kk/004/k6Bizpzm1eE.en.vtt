00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello everyone, I am Ando. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.560
 One day, my head was hit by a knee and thought of two things. 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
 One is a headache, the other is that I should make a film. 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.710
 Teach everyone how to withstand attacks 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.199
 Search for similar topics will find a lot of videos 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.439
 Teach you to clench your teeth 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.769
 Take off, relax, deflect with boxing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.329
 These are all right, but if you can’t deviate and you can’t rotate? 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.740
 What should I do after being hit? 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.649
 Today, I teach two tricks, not only to help you withstand attacks. 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.549
 Can also help you get back to combat but before that, take a look at my business card 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 Please remember, I am not a medical staff member. 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.129
 I am a long-term illness, so it is purely a suggestion. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.869
 When you are hurt, touch! The first move is my martial arts career. 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.850
 Most valuable advice 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 When you are hurt, you need to restore focus before giving up. 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
 For example, if you are kicked to the face, you will say "Wait! Wait!" 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.549
 Someone pokes your eyes with your fingers and you say "Hey! Stop! Stop!" 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.640
 Did you find the problem? 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 Attention! Life will not wait for you, time will not wait for you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 The bad guy won’t wait for you when you are injured. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.690
 You have to try to restore focus as soon as possible 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.060
 Adjust your breathing, follow the steps, restore the frame, and start punching 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.959
 Try to get through this stage instead of letting him stop 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
 Until the focus is restored. 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.600
 When my head was hit by my knee 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.709
 My sparring said "Sorry! Sorry!" But I said "It doesn't matter! Continue" 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:44.819
 "Come back! Come again!" 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.450
 I didn't play for another ten minutes, but I insisted on being able to get out of the quagmire. 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.119
 And let me recover 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.539
 Don't misunderstand, I am not asking you to ignore pain and fear. 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.560
 I want you to control him. Next time someone pokes your eyes 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.800
 Break your fingers, twist your legs or elbows on your face 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.040
 Please don't panic, protect yourself, find yourself back 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.159
 Sounds crazy, but when you are injured or even injured 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.489
 That is the moment you are closest to the real battle. 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.129
 Is the most precious moment of your training 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.450
 Please don't waste your time, you can get a glimpse of the true look of yourself. 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
 What kind of person were you at the time of creation? Is it an escaped person or a stubborn resistance? 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 Will be out of control or be able to stay calm 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.900
 Understand, if training is for you to escape or give up 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.959
 When you are injured or injured, this habit will kill you in real battles. 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.279
 Remind again: When you are hurt, you need to find your focus before giving up. 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.440
 Step 2: Give yourself a spell 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.049
 Guard dogs have a keyword to launch an attack 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.230
 They were still grooming and suddenly heard "Sauerkraut!" 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.159
 They will enter the attack state, you can do the same 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.740
 But it’s right not to include the grooming... 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.200
 When you are traumatized, you will be caught in the fog of pain and horror. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.650
 If you want to survive, you must blow it away as soon as possible, and the most effective way for me. 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.569
 Just use my own spell, when I am wounded, I will say "go!go!go!" 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.140
 Come again, "Hit! Hit! Hit!" 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.200
 It doesn't matter what spell you use, for example, you can say "killing war" 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.420
 Or "Wolf" or even "He's going to die" 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.569
 As long as it can ignite your war 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.549
 Always hang it on your lips, it’s a battle! It’s important 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.879
 Even if you are full of confidence, start to glory 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.109
 But when you are traumatized, the spell in your mind can help you regain your strength. 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.530
 Don't be "Hey! Run wow! Hide! Mom!" 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.300
 The trick is that if you can't master your heart, you won't be able to master this battle. 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.879
 So give your heart a focus 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.950
 Your spell is the key to restoring state. This is also a topic of life. 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.260
 We are all hurt every day 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.400
 When your partner betray you, touch! Partner A, your money, touch! 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.769
 Or encounter a traffic jam on the highway 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.269
 Unemployed, death of relatives and friends, or fingers caught by the door 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.690
 Starbucks's whipped cream is sold out! Everyday every day 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.579
 We all bear big and small blows 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.119
 Don't forget that these blows are opportunities to enhance your will to fight. 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.979
 Don't let anyone else break your balance 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.150
 Don't let anything disrupt your breath 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.370
 Don't be nervous, shiver or give up for anything, no matter what happens. 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.389
 When you are traumatized 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.750
 Face it, take a deep breath, evaluate the situation 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.490
 Make a decision, take action, and carry it through 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.300
 The most important habit of speaking seriously is when you are hit. 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.889
 Control your heart 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.300
 Train yourself to adjust your breathing, think, keep moving (action) 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.940
 Not only the key to winning the fight is the secret of success in life. 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.020
 Do you have your own spell now? 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.160
 If you haven't, find one soon! 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.530
 Use it and tell me its effect! 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.250
