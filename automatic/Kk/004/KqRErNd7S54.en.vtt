makes the Blanc very very strong we can

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:03.149 
makes the Blanc very very strong we can
design<00:01:01.089> it<00:01:01.539> very<00:01:01.780> lightweight<00:01:02.109> and<00:01:02.680> have<00:01:02.949> the

design it very lightweight and have the

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.309 
design it very lightweight and have the
strength<00:01:03.519> so<00:01:04.119> we<00:01:04.239> get<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.570> benefit<00:01:05.019> of<00:01:05.050> that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:05.319 
strength so we get the benefit of that

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.700 
strength so we get the benefit of that

material in a saltwater application so

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.639 
material in a saltwater application so
we<00:01:08.890> have<00:01:09.100> nine<00:01:09.819> new<00:01:10.060> rod<00:01:10.270> models<00:01:10.780> in<00:01:10.990> three

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
we have nine new rod models in three

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.469 
we have nine new rod models in three
different<00:01:12.009> power<00:01:12.159> levels<00:01:12.340> in<00:01:12.970> different

different power levels in different

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.080 
different power levels in different
lengths<00:01:13.899> so<00:01:14.080> we<00:01:14.649> can<00:01:14.830> work<00:01:15.039> a<00:01:15.220> lighter<00:01:15.460> bait<00:01:15.759> in

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
lengths so we can work a lighter bait in

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.590 
lengths so we can work a lighter bait in
soft<00:01:16.649> shallower<00:01:17.649> water<00:01:17.950> smaller<00:01:18.580> lures<00:01:19.030> all

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
soft shallower water smaller lures all

the<00:01:19.750> way<00:01:19.840> up<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.200> eight<00:01:20.380> foot<00:01:20.649> two<00:01:20.920> which<00:01:21.220> is<00:01:21.340> a

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
the way up to eight foot two which is a

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.100 
the way up to eight foot two which is a
very<00:01:21.610> good<00:01:21.850> length<00:01:22.060> for<00:01:22.179> longer<00:01:22.690> distance

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
very good length for longer distance

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.340 
very good length for longer distance
casting<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:24.159> these<00:01:24.369> rods<00:01:24.640> have<00:01:25.080> amazing<00:01:26.080> power

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
casting so these rods have amazing power

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.620 
casting so these rods have amazing power
for<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.459> weight<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.670> mean<00:01:27.970> if<00:01:28.240> you're<00:01:28.390> casting

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
for the weight I mean if you're casting

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.230 
for the weight I mean if you're casting
all<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.350> day<00:01:29.500> long<00:01:29.770> that's<00:01:30.459> the<00:01:30.759> benefit

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
all the day long that's the benefit

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.059 
all the day long that's the benefit
because<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.110> light<00:01:32.319> weight<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.799> rod<00:01:33.039> you

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
because the light weight of the rod you

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.130 
because the light weight of the rod you
hardly<00:01:33.640> notice<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.270> it's<00:01:34.450> like<00:01:34.659> fishing<00:01:35.110> with

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
hardly notice it it's like fishing with

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.770 
hardly notice it it's like fishing with
much<00:01:35.830> smaller<00:01:36.250> equipment<00:01:36.939> but<00:01:37.329> when<00:01:37.479> you<00:01:37.600> need

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
much smaller equipment but when you need

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.230 
much smaller equipment but when you need
the<00:01:37.960> power<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.740> there<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:39.640> these<00:01:39.789> have<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
the power it is there so these have the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.539 
the power it is there so these have the
benefit<00:01:40.689> of<00:01:40.719> lightweight<00:01:41.289> power<00:01:42.070> and

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
benefit of lightweight power and

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.830 
benefit of lightweight power and
sensitivity<00:01:43.530> maybe<00:01:44.530> we<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:44.979> show<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:46.450> means

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
sensitivity maybe we can show what means

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.230 
sensitivity maybe we can show what means

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.510 

let's<00:02:00.369> our<00:02:01.409> friends<00:02:02.409> understand<00:02:02.979> what<00:02:03.310> does

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
let's our friends understand what does

let's our friends understand what does
it<00:02:03.670> what<00:02:04.299> it<00:02:04.479> means

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.419 

so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.119 
so
in<00:02:09.939> this<00:02:10.209> way<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:11.260> could<00:02:11.439> tell<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.739> the

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
in this way you could tell that the

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.490 
in this way you could tell that the
bottom<00:02:12.549> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> rod<00:02:12.909> has<00:02:13.209> so<00:02:13.659> much<00:02:13.870> lifting

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
bottom of the rod has so much lifting

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.580 
bottom of the rod has so much lifting
power<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.640> could<00:02:15.939> catch<00:02:16.180> fish<00:02:16.689> of<00:02:16.930> 10<00:02:17.200> 12

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
power that I could catch fish of 10 12

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.699 
power that I could catch fish of 10 12
kilos<00:02:18.099> in<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.610> much<00:02:19.299> power<00:02:19.629> level<00:02:20.230> fighting

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
kilos in this much power level fighting

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.970 
kilos in this much power level fighting
the<00:02:20.829> fish<00:02:21.099> but<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:21.939> rod<00:02:22.120> itself<00:02:22.659> is<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.230> so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the fish but the rod itself is like so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.220 
the fish but the rod itself is like so
lightweight<00:02:24.579> it's<00:02:24.879> amazing<00:02:25.480> how<00:02:25.629> light<00:02:26.049> in

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
lightweight it's amazing how light in

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.740 
lightweight it's amazing how light in
