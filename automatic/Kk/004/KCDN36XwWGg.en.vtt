00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
little adapter that is a male threaded

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.750 
little adapter that is a male threaded
inch<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.060> half<00:01:46.270> piece<00:01:46.420> of<00:01:47.100> fitting<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:50.760> we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
inch and a half piece of fitting then we

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.910 
inch and a half piece of fitting then we
cut<00:01:51.970> a<00:01:52.000> piece<00:01:52.300> to<00:01:52.750> get<00:01:52.870> above<00:01:53.140> this<00:01:53.530> bar<00:01:55.920> now

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
cut a piece to get above this bar now

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.260 
cut a piece to get above this bar now
we're<00:01:57.070> gonna<00:01:57.220> glue<00:01:57.490> it<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:03.280> glue<00:02:03.580> sets<00:02:03.880> up<00:02:04.120> in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
we're gonna glue it this glue sets up in

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.200 
we're gonna glue it this glue sets up in
a<00:02:04.360> matter<00:02:04.540> of<00:02:04.720> seconds<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.310> push<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.120> and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
a matter of seconds so push it in and

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.969 
a matter of seconds so push it in and
give<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.510> a<00:02:07.540> little<00:02:07.660> twist<00:02:07.990> keep<00:02:08.800> some

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
give it a little twist keep some

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.290 
give it a little twist keep some
pressure<00:02:09.100> on<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.430> because<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.700> tries<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:09.910> back

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
pressure on it because it tries to back

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.700 
pressure on it because it tries to back
up<00:02:10.570> out<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.929> there<00:02:11.730> yeah<00:02:14.640> cool

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
up out of there yeah cool

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.230 
up out of there yeah cool
okay<00:02:17.710> next<00:02:18.220> we're<00:02:18.430> gonna<00:02:18.490> put<00:02:18.790> on<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> check

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
okay next we're gonna put on a check

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.660 
okay next we're gonna put on a check
valve<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.960> a<00:02:20.140> check<00:02:20.380> valve<00:02:20.410> allows<00:02:21.190> water<00:02:21.520> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
valve and a check valve allows water to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.810 
valve and a check valve allows water to
only<00:02:21.970> flow<00:02:22.450> one<00:02:23.380> way<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.310> other<00:02:24.400> words<00:02:24.640> when

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
only flow one way so in other words when

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.120 
only flow one way so in other words when
the<00:02:24.940> pump<00:02:25.150> kicks<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:26.380> comes<00:02:26.680> up<00:02:26.890> and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
the pump kicks it on this comes up and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.710 
the pump kicks it on this comes up and
inside<00:02:27.520> just<00:02:27.850> kind<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.150> hard<00:02:28.270> to<00:02:28.300> see<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.480> won't

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
inside just kind of hard to see I won't

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720 
inside just kind of hard to see I won't
see<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.110> there's<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.890> little<00:02:30.160> valve<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.580> there

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
see that there's a little valve in there

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.160 
see that there's a little valve in there
there<00:02:30.910> that<00:02:31.030> keeps<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.570> water<00:02:31.720> from<00:02:31.990> coming

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
there that keeps the water from coming

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.350 
there that keeps the water from coming
back<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.830> spinning<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.610> impeller<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.180> wrong

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
back and spinning the impeller the wrong

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.180 
back and spinning the impeller the wrong
way<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.750> burning<00:02:35.050> out<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> pump<00:02:35.530> we've

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
way and burning out the pump we've

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.330 
way and burning out the pump we've
loosened<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:36.880> clamp<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.860> real<00:02:38.860> important

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
loosened up this clamp a real important

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.110 
loosened up this clamp a real important
note<00:02:39.930> if<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.170> see<00:02:41.350> that<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.910> little

note if you can see that there's little

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.000 
note if you can see that there's little
arrows<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.900> show<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.170> which<00:02:44.500> way<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.830> water

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
arrows that show you which way the water

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.660 
arrows that show you which way the water
goes<00:02:45.250> make<00:02:46.090> sure<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.480> they're<00:02:46.600> pointing<00:02:47.020> up

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
goes make sure that they're pointing up

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.060 
goes make sure that they're pointing up
now<00:02:48.670> now<00:02:48.880> we're<00:02:49.030> going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> hook<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:50.890> use

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
now now we're going to hook it up we use

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.110 
now now we're going to hook it up we use
a<00:02:51.100> drill<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.730> 5/16<00:02:54.730> inch<00:02:55.000> bit<00:02:56.940> makes<00:02:57.940> it

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
a drill with a 5/16 inch bit makes it

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:15.440 
a drill with a 5/16 inch bit makes it
simple<00:02:58.920> tighten<00:02:59.920> it<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.070> that's<00:03:00.610> good

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.170 

okay<00:03:16.450> next<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.800> cord<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.760> hole<00:03:18.940> right<00:03:18.970> through

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
okay next we cord a hole right through

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.120 
okay next we cord a hole right through
this<00:03:19.600> brick<00:03:19.900> with<00:03:20.620> our<00:03:20.800> diamond<00:03:21.900> bladed

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
we're going to put a ninety degree turn

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.190 
we're going to put a ninety degree turn
on<00:03:27.610> there<00:03:27.820> because<00:03:28.540> we're<00:03:28.720> plumbing<00:03:29.080> this

around and down into the sump pit we've

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.040 
around and down into the sump pit we've
already<00:03:31.990> pushed<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.530> through<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.830> wall

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.870 
up goes over to the wall across the wall
and<00:04:10.300> goes<00:04:11.230> through<00:04:11.440> our<00:04:11.620> core<00:04:11.950> to<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.400> outside

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and goes through our core to the outside

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.360 
and goes through our core to the outside
now<00:04:16.500> we're<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.680> cover<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.130> whole<00:04:18.340> area

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
now we're going to cover this whole area

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.280 
now we're going to cover this whole area
with<00:04:18.880> gravel<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.510> of<00:04:19.660> course<00:04:19.870> put<00:04:20.109> some

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
with gravel and of course put some

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.500 
with gravel and of course put some
gravel<00:04:20.470> down<00:04:20.739> along<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> outside<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.880> pet

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
gravel down along the outside of the pet

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.260 
gravel down along the outside of the pet
and<00:04:23.470> allow<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.070> water<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.580> get<00:04:24.729> into<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.090> pit

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
and allow that water to get into the pit

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.500 
and allow that water to get into the pit
so<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.540> can<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.870> carried<00:04:26.200> away
