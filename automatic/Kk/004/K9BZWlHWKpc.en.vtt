00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.850
 every day there are people who 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.070
 they begin to pursue their goals and all 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.559
 the days there are people who move away from 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.170
 have you ever wondered which 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.869
 is your challenge in life before answering 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.750
 think you would like to change or improve 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.330
 of your life what kind of things you would like 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 do or for example what is that to which 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.370
 would dedicate his life if money does not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.590
 have any value 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.810
 surely you are a person who wants 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.510
 live the present and be happy but that 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.790
 many times relive the past or you 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.740
 worries the future is also likely 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.810
 that in some aspects of life there 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.930
 know well what you want but what 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.440
 important is that if you know well what 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.300
 you do not want you have received an education in 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.000
 the one you have been instilled with love and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 righteousness a lot of knowledge that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.010
 supposedly they would give you more 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.739
 probabilities of success in life but 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.199
 when did they tell you about dreams 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.260
 at what time someone told you what 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.630
 important that it is to believe in you what 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.120
 possibly if they told you is to dream 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.270
 is wasting time and that the best is 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.520
 have your feet on the earth what 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.800
 curious is that our goals and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.530
 goals in life begin when we 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.560
 we dare to dream the rest you get 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.570
 leaving the past behind and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.510
 committing ourselves with the effort and in 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.550
 about your future if you're worried about that 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.860
 because unless you changed your 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.350
 old habits and your thoughts of 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 past you will create your future from it 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.710
 way that you have created your present leave 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.840
 from those places where everything turns out 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.300
 family to dare to experience 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.580
 new things at the beginning will cause you 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 vertigo but then wake up to your 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.370
 curiosity and you'll want to know that there's more 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.620
 forward in this new stage you should 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.590
 have the courage to fight against yourself 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.020
 against your own beliefs and against 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.260
 all those people who will not believe in 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.720
 your projects or ideas they will tell you that 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.600
 do not try, they will tell you that you will not arrive 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.170
 to nowhere and that the crisis will last 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.750
 at least five more years when 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.620
 listen to things like these or in your mind 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.799
 that little voice that says 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.409
 you can not is then when you should 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.080
 put your strength to the test because you 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:34.349
 Energy your creativity and your dreams 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.140
 they will fight a battle against fears and 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.370
 especially against the most fearsome of 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.860
 all of them the fear of failure for 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.560
 face that fear think that is what 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.140
 worst that can happen to you that's what 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.170
 you have now and how much you fear losing 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.299
 you dare to pursue your dreams if 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.790
 you cross the barrier and enter the stage 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.790
 of the change will soon appear the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.670
 motivation and the dreams that are now 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.120
 asleep they will wake up becoming 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.680
 the most powerful of the fuels 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720

 opportunities that exist around you 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.299
 and that your fears will not let you see then 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.760
 the moment will come when you will tell me the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.400
 distance between your current life and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.159
 the life you want to achieve this will make you 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.890
 shake the body but it's normal because 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:28.470
