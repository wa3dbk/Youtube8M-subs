 the west as well as his present year adding up 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 a wider milestone because the team demonstrated we're going 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.449
 it's part 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.190
 of this work contains important at the time it is unknown whether the head 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.730
 de pérez that was with the san luis with the necaxa the Uruguayan víctor píriz 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.630

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.350
 to the first score of the rare match and those of the recovery zone 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.020

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.360
 goal 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.900
 the last time you finished the first part the last time you side 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.080
 positive they did not meet in this warm stadium 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.950
 the score was 0 to 0 and the win accordingly for the squad 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.380
 of the deer in that final of the previous tournament in the second half and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.840
 after the first part with 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.549
 good 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.920
 you get less and also from tijuana so it comes to the complementary part 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.990
 already for the complementary part from the beginning it entered the red tico more 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.369
 forward over guadarrama 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.469
 Iquique Vadillo 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.250
 a zacatecano with good offensive conditions 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.610
 here mario garcía putting this red alticor service detaching 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.490
 right leg and the Zerman goalkeeper 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.220
 it comes well he was with him he crossed his outside shot interesting because he has 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.710
 played 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.070
 contest are punctual with querétaro san luis potosí es 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.460
 many teams already 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.770
 and he is a goalkeeper who has good reflexes then look at these tribulations 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.130
 radar company 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.940
 carlos cariño founding the header 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 of enrique is that this was 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.350
 to become a goal 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.659
 of the sea the headbutts on the offensive I think 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.640
 p were not good options for me I do not know if I have to see the condition 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.049
 the synthetic court with 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.810
 us since he is an addict 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.860
 If you have to see Peru, I noticed the deer with many more shots from 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.090
 long distance and long distance what they do not normally sticks very well 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.299
 roberto vargas 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.659
 An operative is operating in Santa María Cáceres Almendralejo and 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.170
 generate 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.209
 here in giving the voice to this month 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.369
 from what I understood in the images 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:25.469
 that a nudge 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.309
 like that to a tijuana player 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:31.299
 I did not think it was such, but the referee decided 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.159
 I was determined to take 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.129
 Red card is everywhere and yellow cards 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.680
 you look there we are going to see the play I think there was no such thing I think more 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.919
 well it is a recargon 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.049
 but the fever of the game 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.969
 well I think it's a cube 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:45.890
 they followed 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.980
 as it has happened in other big tournaments and then in the field in this 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.179
 Serbian takeoff to the only one that takes the yellow 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:54.710
 and then goes for the red 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.609
 if he insulted him peña that version the direct red 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.259
 Without a doubt 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:03.019
 and then again the Hungarian camera which is to say that if he did not tell me 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.339
 of the negative 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.889
 protesting in the fourth official equal 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:10.849
 Victor Perez had to leave the game the Uruguayan released remained 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.209
 with one more player 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.929
 then tijuana resorted to this to the counterattack and look here to come raul 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:20.479
 díaz that trompica in this one so now the forward 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.549
 10 enríquez and takes the card not to Juan Carlos Bulnes that will take 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.489
 to raúl days the red card good idea the nations 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.609
 did not hit it to bottom it's not they're not 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.590
 the magnitude of the fault and another that is pure missteps in play 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.029
 manifest of goal at the last minute said 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:45.669
 There was not much to look for, daroca, and there was nothing more to protest 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.359
 same as the cover 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.259
 red 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:49.520
 that you have to accept it 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.520
 the slicing inside the area and there are the deer again looking 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.739
 the Zermeño forward option with fast exit 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.699
 and so he was playing tijuana also unfolding opening the court as 

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.739
 is port and I love in Juan Carlos Muñoz 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.229
 very good very good 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.639
 for this player the service within the area 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.369
 and I also liked a lot of spending you have two elements that give you 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.439
 and look at it in this action 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:19.180
 where badillo is practiced they commit this fault that it seems that it does not take long 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.109
 the lack 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.919
 but it is near the area 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.550
 and you know that you will see a lot the use of takeoff from saving sun 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.990
 because the ball was well placed 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.080
 against the distance it hits a hundred in the red sector of right leg 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.430
 Zermeño has a lot to do 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.259
 what fundamental 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.439
 The file 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.649
 we already see that combined already worked for the first time in favor 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.689
 the use of 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.240
 complaint and south that also obviously 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.580
 and the actions of the opposing team you will also have to take those 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.430
 celebrations of the case that indicates that there is in the team 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.229
 the red tics celebrate 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.340
 put fellow remains of the sea very good image where the sky is happy 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.740
 and then 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.550
 tijuana goes with everything 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.889
 in the final minutes that were few 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.499
 be this play is left hamas rejects the guayas gold that emptied his shot to 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:09.319
 A side 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.860
 in the braves a few minutes after the victory a goal to zero 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.400
 for the goal of the red tico that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.389
 Marcola the balance of the game I repeat two teams that have been 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.599
 of the most regular in the last tournaments they met again in front of 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.919
 in front of another Roma and in Tijuana in the warm stadium 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.699
 aware 'hope of the heart'
