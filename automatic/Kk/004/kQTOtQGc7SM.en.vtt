00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
episode 61 and today we're gonna be

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.010 
episode 61 and today we're gonna be
doing<00:00:04.920> about<00:00:05.100> map<00:00:05.430> rendering<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:06.810> map

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
doing about map rendering so map

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.060 
doing about map rendering so map
renderings<00:00:07.470> very<00:00:08.160> easy<00:00:09.170> due<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.320> some<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.769> have

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
renderings very easy due to some I have

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.039 
renderings very easy due to some I have
despite<00:00:11.700> some<00:00:11.880> sort<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.360> controversy<00:00:12.870> very

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
despite some sort of controversy very

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.999 
despite some sort of controversy very
people<00:00:13.380> think<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.710> getting<00:00:13.920> really

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
people think it's getting really

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.470 
people think it's getting really
difficult<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.429> actually<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:14.759> very<00:00:14.880> easy<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
difficult is actually very very easy to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.510 
difficult is actually very very easy to
to<00:00:16.080> use<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.770> know<00:00:16.859> manipulate<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.340> stuff

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
to use and you know manipulate and stuff

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.189 
to use and you know manipulate and stuff
so<00:00:18.150> what<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.330> gonna<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.140> very

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
so what we're gonna do is it's very

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.540 
so what we're gonna do is it's very
simple<00:00:19.619> which<00:00:19.710> will<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> class<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
simple which will make a class that

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.160 
simple which will make a class that
extends<00:00:21.119> job<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.510> an<00:00:21.600> influence<00:00:21.869> list<00:00:22.020> like

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
extends job like an influence list like

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.870 
extends job like an influence list like
we<00:00:22.230> do<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.529> other<00:00:22.859> plugins<00:00:23.220> let's<00:00:23.789> pick

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
we do with all other plugins let's pick

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.000 
we do with all other plugins let's pick
an<00:00:23.970> enabled<00:00:24.660> by<00:00:24.720> hand<00:00:24.930> control<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.500> space<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
an enabled by hand control and space and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
an enabled by hand control and space and
then<00:00:26.130> opening<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:26.820> little<00:00:26.970> screen<00:00:27.300> where

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
then opening up that little screen where

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.750 
then opening up that little screen where
we<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.869> select<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.320> enable<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.670> have

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
we can select on enable and here we have

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.200 
we can select on enable and here we have
control<00:00:30.029> space<00:00:30.210> again<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.320> server

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
control space again say it get server

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.780 
control space again say it get server

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
get plugin manager dot register events

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.240 
get plugin manager dot register events

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
in this listener class for this plugin

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.940 
in this listener class for this plugin
because<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.329> both<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
because we are both you know that the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
because we are both you know that the
plug-in<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> listener<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> same<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
plug-in and the listener in the same the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
plug-in and the listener in the same the
same<00:00:43.260> class<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:44.760> gonna<00:00:44.879> do<00:00:45.059> is

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
same class so what we're gonna do is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.580 
same class so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:45.989> make<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.200> event

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we're gonna want to make an event

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.010 
we're gonna want to make an event
handler<00:00:47.270> and<00:00:48.270> we're<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> say

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
handler and we're going to want to say

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.240 
handler and we're going to want to say
public<00:00:49.410> void<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.250> map<00:00:51.079> initialize<00:00:52.250> map

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
public void on map initialize map

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.330 
public void on map initialize map
initialize<00:00:53.910> event<00:00:54.300> event<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
initialize event event so this is just a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.310 
initialize event event so this is just a
method<00:00:56.699> listener<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> gets<00:00:57.899> called<00:00:58.140> every

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
method listener that gets called every

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.400 
method listener that gets called every
time<00:00:58.649> map<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.129> created<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.199> what<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
time map is created and what we want to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.840 
time map is created and what we want to
do<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.710> want<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> remove<00:01:02.129> everything<00:01:02.520> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
do is we want to remove everything that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.380 
do is we want to remove everything that
may<00:01:03.030> render<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.960> map<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.820> do<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
may render to that map and to do that we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.200 
may render to that map and to do that we
are<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> shave<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.310> event<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:08.970> get

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
are going to shave for event don't get

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.890 
are going to shave for event don't get
map<00:01:10.400> also<00:01:11.400> no<00:01:11.760> no<00:01:11.970> sir<00:01:12.150> we're<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.720> want<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
map also no no sir we're gonna want to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.300 
map also no no sir we're gonna want to
get<00:01:13.020> an<00:01:13.080> object<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.710> first<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.100> map

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
get an object than that first so map

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.149 
get an object than that first so map
view<00:01:15.470> map<00:01:16.470> equals<00:01:17.310> event<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:18.509> map<00:01:18.979> like<00:01:19.979> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
view map equals event get map like so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
view map equals event get map like so
and<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:20.400> we're<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.820> wanna<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.810> we're

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and now we're gonna wanna see so we're

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.469 
and now we're gonna wanna see so we're
gonna<00:01:21.990> say<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.439> map<00:01:23.220> render<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.970> map<00:01:24.299> map

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
gonna say for map render is map map

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.289 
gonna say for map render is map map
renderer<00:01:24.869> our<00:01:25.640> map<00:01:26.840> dot<00:01:27.840> gets<00:01:28.409> renderers<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
renderer our map dot gets renderers so

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.490 
renderer our map dot gets renderers so
what<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.750> does<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> loop

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
what that does it's going to loop

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.140 
what that does it's going to loop
through<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> map<00:01:32.369> renderers<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.970> put

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
through all the map renderers and put

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.030 
through all the map renderers and put
them<00:01:33.270> into<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.990> object<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.650> every<00:01:34.920> time

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
them into the the object are every time

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.319 
them into the the object are every time
it<00:01:35.130> iterates<00:01:35.460> through<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.119> every

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it iterates through it it's for every

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.999 
it iterates through it it's for every
time<00:01:36.450> iterates<00:01:36.780> through<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.049> loop<00:01:37.200> it's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
time iterates through this loop it's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
time iterates through this loop it's
gonna<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.700> map<00:01:38.850> renderer<00:01:39.210> that's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
gonna get the map renderer that's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
gonna get the map renderer that's
rendering<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.579> wanted<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> remove

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
rendering and we just wanted to remove

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.859 
rendering and we just wanted to remove
this<00:01:42.930> renderer<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.159> say<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:45.509> nap<00:01:46.729> dots

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
this renderer so we say are or nap dots

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.749 
this renderer so we say are or nap dots
remove<00:01:48.869> renderer<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.009> removing<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
remove renderer are so removing the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.780 
remove renderer are so removing the
variant<00:01:51.299> renderer<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.350> map<00:01:52.700> from<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
variant renderer are from map from the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.100 
variant renderer are from map from the
map<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.960> because

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
map because it was in there because

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.330 
map because it was in there because
we're<00:01:55.380> looping<00:01:55.500> through<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.860> render<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.159> than

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
we're looping through the render is than

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.740 
we're looping through the render is than
that<00:01:56.460> pass<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.000> no<00:01:57.149> renderers<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.630> this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that pass we want no renderers on this

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.399

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and then we put two brackets and we put

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.040 
and then we put two brackets and we put
the<00:02:15.670> squealing<00:02:16.000> bracket<00:02:16.300> opening<00:02:16.630> brace<00:02:16.780> hit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
the squealing bracket opening brace hit

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.490 
the squealing bracket opening brace hit
enter

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500

down<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.550> put<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.730> semicolon<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.450> we

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
down here we put a semicolon and then we

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.160 
down here we put a semicolon and then we
say<00:02:20.530> public<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.450> can<00:02:22.570> say<00:02:22.690> public<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.080> then

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
say public we can say public and then

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.820 
say public we can say public and then
hit<00:02:23.290> control<00:02:23.530> space<00:02:23.860> or<00:02:24.280> no<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.420> just<00:02:26.380> ruins

doesn't come up automatically you can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.370 
doesn't come up automatically you can
always<00:02:33.460> just<00:02:33.670> add<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.970> manually<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:35.110> for<00:02:35.320> this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
always just add it manually so for this

always just add it manually so for this
map<00:02:35.560> view<00:02:35.800> Algeria<00:02:36.400> changed<00:02:36.730> back<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:36.880> view

map view Algeria changed back to view

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180 
map view Algeria changed back to view
now<00:02:37.660> canvas<00:02:38.140> will<00:02:38.260> change<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.770> canvas

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
now canvas will change this to canvas

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.430 
now canvas will change this to canvas
and<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.240> player<00:02:40.510> wishing<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> change<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.200> to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
and the player wishing to change that to

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.000 
and the player wishing to change that to
player<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:43.330> we're<00:02:43.840> now<00:02:43.930> adding<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.620> renderer

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
player so we're now adding this renderer

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.010 
player so we're now adding this renderer
we've<00:02:45.220> created<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.640> into<00:02:46.240> our<00:02:46.270> map<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.870> can

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
we've created here into our map you can

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.720 
we've created here into our map you can
obviously<00:02:47.320> make<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.590> new<00:02:47.860> class<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.430> entire

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
obviously make a new class this entire

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.520 
obviously make a new class this entire
renderer<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.330> you<00:02:49.390> could<00:02:49.630> put<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.050> object<00:02:50.440> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
renderer so you could put the object of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.290 
renderer so you could put the object of
the<00:02:50.620> new<00:02:50.800> map<00:02:51.460> render<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> thing<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.090> there<00:02:52.180> but

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
the new map render a thing in there but

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.490 
the new map render a thing in there but
don't<00:02:52.930> worry<00:02:52.990> about<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.380> you'd

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
don't worry about that if you'd

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.800 
don't worry about that if you'd
understand<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.830> mean<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.760> if<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.360> do<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.690> know

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
understand I mean but if you do you know

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.230 
understand I mean but if you do you know
you<00:02:56.440> can<00:02:56.560> always<00:02:56.710> do<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.920> I've<00:02:57.820> ever<00:02:58.090> do<00:02:58.180> it

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
you can always do that I've ever do it

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.310 
you can always do that I've ever do it
this<00:02:58.330> way<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.810> keeps<00:02:58.960> it<00:02:59.080> all<00:02:59.140> nice

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
this way because it keeps it all nice

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.960 
this way because it keeps it all nice
and<00:02:59.350> compact<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.010> not<00:03:00.580> having<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.820> spread

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
and compact and not having to spread

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.250 
and compact and not having to spread
that<00:03:01.030> through<00:03:01.210> my<00:03:01.270> classes<00:03:01.630> but<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:01.960> you<00:03:02.050> like

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
that through my classes but if you like

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.500 
that through my classes but if you like
your<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.980> know<00:03:03.070> programs<00:03:03.520> spread<00:03:04.300> out<00:03:04.390> for

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
your you know programs spread out for

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.730 
your you know programs spread out for
lots<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.720> classes<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.350> perfectly<00:03:05.680> fine

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
lots of classes that is perfectly fine

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.130 
lots of classes that is perfectly fine
you<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.130> everyone<00:03:06.460> so<00:03:07.180> with<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.930> map

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you can do everyone so with this map

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.760 
you can do everyone so with this map
view<00:03:08.500> thingy<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.520> can<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:10.050> lots<00:03:11.050> of<00:03:11.170> things<00:03:11.230> so

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
view thingy we can do lots of things so

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.410 
view thingy we can do lots of things so
in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.190> view<00:03:12.400> thing<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:13.000> showing<00:03:13.210> us

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
in this view thing is just showing us

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900 
in this view thing is just showing us
how<00:03:13.860> basically<00:03:14.860> just<00:03:15.070> telling<00:03:15.310> us<00:03:15.400> what<00:03:15.730> map

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
how basically just telling us what map

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
how basically just telling us what map
we're<00:03:16.150> viewing<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.400> set<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.090> center<00:03:19.390> Z

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
we're viewing so we can set the center Z

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.090 
we're viewing so we can set the center Z
we<00:03:20.110> can<00:03:20.260> set<00:03:20.470> where<00:03:20.680> it's<00:03:20.830> going<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:20.980> be

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
we can set where it's going to be

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.440 
we can set where it's going to be
centered<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.610> stuff<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.130> canvas<00:03:24.490> we

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
centered and stuff and for the canvas we

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.330 
centered and stuff and for the canvas we
can<00:03:25.480> actually<00:03:26.260> draw<00:03:26.470> things<00:03:26.709> under<00:03:26.920> here<00:03:27.070> and

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
can actually draw things under here and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.140 
can actually draw things under here and
for<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.030> player<00:03:29.280> that's<00:03:30.280> just<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:30.580> player<00:03:30.760> who

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
for the player that's just a player who

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.720 
for the player that's just a player who
has<00:03:31.390> initialized<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:31.930> map<00:03:32.050> so<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.400> canvas

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
you'll see that some of the colors are a

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.300 
you'll see that some of the colors are a
bit<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:38.760> know<00:06:38.880> miss<00:06:39.600> colored<00:06:40.020> because<00:06:40.770> of<00:06:40.950> how

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
bit you know miss colored because of how

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.620 
bit you know miss colored because of how
its<00:06:41.550> rendered<00:06:41.730> it's<00:06:42.000> rendered<00:06:42.240> using<00:06:42.360> the

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
its rendered it's rendered using the

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.750 
its rendered it's rendered using the
blocks<00:06:42.870> so<00:06:43.140> each<00:06:43.470> block<00:06:43.770> is<00:06:43.920> a<00:06:43.950> certain<00:06:44.340> each

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
blocks so each block is a certain each

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.060 
blocks so each block is a certain each
tile<00:06:45.060> is<00:06:45.210> like<00:06:45.360> a<00:06:45.390> certain<00:06:45.600> block<00:06:45.990> so<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:46.980> has

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
tile is like a certain block so it has

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.890 
tile is like a certain block so it has
to<00:06:47.280> you<00:06:47.610> know<00:06:47.640> obey<00:06:47.940> certain<00:06:48.150> rules<00:06:48.300> and<00:06:48.690> and

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
to you know obey certain rules and and

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.190 
to you know obey certain rules and and
that<00:06:49.370> but<00:06:50.370> overall<00:06:50.610> I<00:06:50.940> think<00:06:51.330> it's<00:06:51.750> it's

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
that but overall I think it's it's

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.050 
that but overall I think it's it's
actually<00:06:52.470> done<00:06:52.620> it's<00:06:52.830> done<00:06:52.950> very<00:06:53.160> well<00:06:53.190> you

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060 
actually done it's done very well you

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.730 
actually done it's done very well you

see we've got the white here and and the
green<00:06:55.980> Greens<00:06:56.460> the<00:06:56.610> same<00:06:56.790> sort<00:06:57.090> green<00:06:57.270> the

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
green Greens the same sort green the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.200 
green Greens the same sort green the
blue<00:06:57.540> we've<00:06:58.320> got<00:06:58.470> these<00:06:58.680> sort<00:06:58.920> of<00:06:58.980> colors<00:06:59.250> the

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
blue we've got these sort of colors the

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.940 
blue we've got these sort of colors the
skin<00:07:00.420> colors<00:07:00.660> a<00:07:00.750> bit<00:07:00.900> you<00:07:00.990> know<00:07:01.110> off<00:07:01.350> but<00:07:01.800> we

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
skin colors a bit you know off but we

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.590 
skin colors a bit you know off but we
can<00:07:02.100> live<00:07:02.220> with<00:07:02.340> that<00:07:02.390> so<00:07:03.390> we<00:07:03.480> can<00:07:03.540> actually

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
can live with that so we can actually

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.270 
can live with that so we can actually
draw<00:07:03.930> images<00:07:04.320> to<00:07:04.440> our<00:07:04.470> maps<00:07:04.710> and<00:07:04.920> we<00:07:04.980> can<00:07:05.130> draw

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
draw images to our maps and we can draw

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.800 
draw images to our maps and we can draw
text<00:07:05.670> to<00:07:05.730> our<00:07:05.790> maps<00:07:06.000> and<00:07:06.240> I<00:07:06.300> think<00:07:06.540> that<00:07:06.690> is<00:07:06.780> a

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
text to our maps and I think that is a

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.470 
text to our maps and I think that is a
very<00:07:07.170> very<00:07:07.950> cool<00:07:08.190> thing<00:07:08.370> that<00:07:08.400> we<00:07:08.550> can<00:07:08.700> do<00:07:08.850> so

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
very very cool thing that we can do so

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.090 
very very cool thing that we can do so
