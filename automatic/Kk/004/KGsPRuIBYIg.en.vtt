00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.379
 after a hard casting session 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 at the candidates only the nervousness 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.619
 or bread partly announce that from 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.060
 rosental is with the front lies that 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.160
 third small 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.720
 but in most cases it is 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.250
 not easy and, therefore, provides the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.329
 Competence team and no wrong 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 To make a decision 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:36.960
 Welcome to the first 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 decision says oliver you want 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.190
 Of course, when we are on 6 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 but here against dortmund run it 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.309
 can only meet one of you 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.620
 the great person ex area right 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.170
 impressed his fight price 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 Willpower's ambition, for example, really 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.949
 exemplary if i lost though i did 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 anyway at my eye angle about her 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.850
 look what you technical 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 Cabinet pieces on hate for a total of 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.160
 very very good the women hate 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.850
 right pressure that was actually 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.480
 Absolutely first but will be here 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.770

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.770

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.399
 it does not recommend it many thanks 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.079
 That's why I'm saying that 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.390
 maybe should run a bit 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.520
 now also the midfield stands for that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.509
 a lot of weight as professionals it these kickers 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.729
 have managed 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.229

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.819
