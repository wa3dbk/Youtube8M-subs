have on the back is a msata slot so if
you<00:03:20.970> want<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.390> use<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.220> smaller<00:03:23.960> msata

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
you want to use one of the smaller msata

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.880 
you want to use one of the smaller msata

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
ssds on this board you can use that here

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.600 
ssds on this board you can use that here
and<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.550> what<00:03:30.830> the<00:03:31.830> slot<00:03:32.100> right<00:03:32.310> here<00:03:32.370> is

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.190 
come in today including this and one of
the<00:04:29.790> things<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.150> I'm<00:04:30.420> really<00:04:30.720> looking

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
the things that I'm really looking

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.230 
the things that I'm really looking
forward<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.620> is<00:04:31.920> getting<00:04:32.220> everything<00:04:32.640> set<00:04:33.210> up

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
forward to is getting everything set up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.080 
forward to is getting everything set up
so<00:04:33.420> that<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:33.990> actually<00:04:34.460> start<00:04:35.460> using<00:04:35.580> the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
so that I can actually start using the

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.480 
so that I can actually start using the
system<00:04:36.590> right<00:04:37.590> now<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.740> memory<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.250> still

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
system right now a memory is still

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.460 
system right now a memory is still
missing<00:04:38.900> hopefully<00:04:39.900> and<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.170> will<00:04:40.260> be

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
missing hopefully and that will be

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.860 
missing hopefully and that will be
delivered<00:04:40.860> tomorrow<00:04:41.210> we'll<00:04:42.210> have<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.750> wait

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
else is as good there's also several USB

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.110 
else is as good there's also several USB
3.0<00:04:49.860> headers<00:04:50.190> on<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.460> board<00:04:50.700> as<00:04:50.820> well<00:04:51.000> as

other USB two headers on the board and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.020 
other USB two headers on the board and
this<00:04:55.080> should<00:04:55.350> be<00:04:55.980> able<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.250> provide<00:04:56.580> quite<00:04:56.970> a

this should be able to provide quite a
bit<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.300> power<00:04:57.450> it's<00:04:57.750> also<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:58.410> fairly<00:04:59.210> fairly

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
bit of power it's also a fairly fairly
