couple tons of energy a lot of energy he

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.070 
couple tons of energy a lot of energy he
was<00:02:21.400> light<00:02:21.610> energy<00:02:21.970> on<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> field<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.750> energy

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
was light energy on the field the energy

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.410 
was light energy on the field the energy
was<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.530> absolutely<00:02:24.400> fantastic<00:02:25.030> top<00:02:25.239> to
