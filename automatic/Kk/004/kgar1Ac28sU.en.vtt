00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.940
 The father of Pokémon, Tian Yuzhi, when he was a child 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.380
 I like to catch small insects. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 After he grew up, he brought this hobby into the video game. 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.564
 He named the game 

00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:20.260
 ㄆ...Po....Po.... 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.060
 (Capsule Monsters) Capsule Monsters 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.220
 His inspiration comes from the 1967 TV specials. 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.740
 Ultra Seven 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.260
 The protagonist will use the capsule monster to help him fight 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.500
 OK, really, what is this special film σ`∀ ́) σ 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.720
ヽ(_ ́∀`_)ノ

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.700
 Rrrrrrrrrrrr 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.780
 (́◉◞౪◟◉‵) 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.496
 Ok, let's continue 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.220
 But the name capsule monster will have a trademark problem. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.280
 So they changed their pocket monsters (now the Pokémon) 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.440
 Then referred to as Pokemon 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.100
 Where does the meat come from in the world of Pokémon? 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.200
 This problem has been entangled in the fans for a long time. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.180
 Nintendo did not make any official response to this question. 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.440
 We can only find in games and animations. 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.840
 The scary thing is that people in the Pokémon world should eat 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.872
 Pokémon Σ(;゚д゚) 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.860
 At the same time, their world also has real animals. 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.020
 But they seem very rare, almost to the point of extinction 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.800
 Because they are almost invisible in games and animations. 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.020
 And already hinted that a particular Pokémon is edible. 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.640
 (No ~ squid king you can't die R) and have hinted that certain Pokémons can be eaten 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.020
 Some can even be made into delicious dishes. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.260
 For example, the onion duck can make a delicious dish. 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.740
 Because it has been hunt and almost extinct 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 Only to make it so rare 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.620
 I have mentioned it several times in the animation 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.160
 Fish Pokémon can be hunt and eaten 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.499
 (The squid king is so bad that you die) but only the squid king 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.180
 But it may not be the strangest in that world. 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.160
 Pokémon or basic animal 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.040
 So Pokémon may be used as a pet, or as a reserve grain 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.520
 Back in 2005, there was a personal gene called Pokemon. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.980
 But Nintendo wants to sue the center of this prosecution. 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.740
 This center found that this gene can control the production of cancer cells. 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.220
 Nintendo does not want to be associated with this bad gene 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 So the center renamed it 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.380
 Now it has a more spectacular name 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.220
 ZBTB7 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.960
 But don't worry, we also have Pikachusu. 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.500
 Human protein in the name of Pokémon 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.940
 There are currently 718 Pokémons in the entire series. 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.560
 If we look at the wonderful frog seed is the official list of the National Illustration No. 001 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.100
 Does this mean that the wonderful frog seed is the first Pokemon ever? 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.720
 Right? 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.420
 wrong 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.100
 We must pull down to see the No. 112 Iron Tyrannosaurus 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.960
 It is the first magical baby to be created. 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.840
 It even has a sketch of Pokémon also known as Capsule Monsters 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.180
 Pokémon can be divided by "attributes" 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.420
 They have 18 different attributes 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.295
 General department 

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:14.920
 Fire system 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.420
 Fighting department 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.300
 Water system 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.000
 Flight system 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.627
 Grass system 

00:03:17.627 --> 00:03:18.280
 Viral system 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.015
 Electrical department 

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:19.724
 Ground system 

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:20.267
 Super power system 

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:20.995
 Rock system 

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:21.716
 Ice system 

00:03:21.716 --> 00:03:22.520
 Insect 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.249
 Dragon system 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:23.860
 Ghost 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.440
 Evil system 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.180
 Steel system 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.200
 Fairy 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.760
 Attributes are used to tell us what Pokémon can and can't do 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.360
 Specifically, its properties determine its ability to attack and defend. 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.740
 For example, Pikachu is an electrical department Pokémon. 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.300
 A Pokémon can have one or two attributes 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.780
 If a Pokémon has all the attributes 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.860
 Interestingly, his weakness will be only rock 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.980
 The water system has the largest variety of Pokemon, with 124 species (16.8%) 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.660
 (I just counted 36 kinds of ghosts and 38 kinds of fairy spirits.) The rarest Pokémons are ghosts and goblins, each with only 34 species (4.5%). 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.320
 This is the most valuable Pokémon card 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.800
 (Pikachu Illustrator, Pokemon Illustrator) It's called Pikachu Illustrator or Pokémon Illustrator 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.080
 Only 6 pieces in the world 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.820
 These were originally given to the winners of the Pokémon Competition in Japan in 1997. 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.360
 Only the Japanese version exists 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.360
 (600,000 ah.....(|||゚д゚)) It is worth about 20,000 US dollars 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.480
 Recently, however, there is an auction on eBay that has a high price of up to $100,000. 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.100
 a lot of this paper 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.937
 Can you change this kind of paper ಠ_ಠ 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.140
 In 2001, a small country in the South Pacific, Niue 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.180
 They released a series of commemorative coins printed with Pokémon on the back. 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.040
 Although it is very difficult to find it today. 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.020
 It is very rare and these coins are considered collectibles 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.020
 In the long-term animation, the character is very cute. 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.480
 In fact, his eyes will naturally close 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.740
 But at some point, his eyes will open briefly. 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.800
 But sometimes, some viewers think that when he opens his eyes, it is scary. 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.380
 Feel yourself 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.040
 The protagonist of Pokémon Animation, Xiao Zhi, actually surnamed Ketchum 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.100
 Is changed from Catch 'em 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.760
 From the English version of the animated slogan Gotta catch 'em all! 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.000
 In the Japanese version of the animation, the protagonist is called Satoshi. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.180
 It is taken from the name of Tian Zhizhi, the father of Pokémon. 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.620
 And the protagonist of the protagonist Xiaomao 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.920
 In Japanese, called Shigeru 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.800
 Taken from the super Mario and the legend of the legend of Salda, Miyamoto 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.800
 There are many reasons for people to start exercising. 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.720
 The strange thing is that Pokémon is actually one of them. 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.112
 At least for this guy, 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.020
 Ashley McKenzie fights with another child when he is 11 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.060
 He tried to recapture his fire-breathing dragon card 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.440
 And what you don’t know is 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.692
 Spitfire Dragon Card in the same year 

00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:56.452
 Super 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.900
 After he failed, he did some research. 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.940
 And found that this child will use judo 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.866
 He went to the local judo club 

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:06.000
 Then face the person who fights with him and take back his fire-breathing dragon card 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.580
 McKenzie will achieve judo thanks to him. 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.760
 Now, all this thanks to the Fire Dragon Card. 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.680
 McKenzie is a judo champion 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.660
 (Thank you for watching, I will not translate it here)
