 interface so good let's go 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.720
 directly to what has been 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.940
 configurations 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.250
 and well this rom comes from 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.320
 defect with its design in the style of 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.600
 configuration is the different section 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.660
 as dark with 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.670
 with what has been these icons 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.649
 like turquoise color turquoise which 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.449
 makes device would be elegant already 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.100
 that the color black is a color that 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.020
 go to give an elegance in the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.820
 device and good let's go 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.159
 directly to the device 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 and we will see that they are valid arum with 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.649
 android and 5.1.1 and with comments 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.140
 I'm testing approximately one 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:21.549
 week and a half is a very complete light 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.320
 the truth that very satisfied with this 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.930
 rice since they did not find any book 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.819
 and well here we will see the hidden game that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.000
 integrate the overwhelmers of the o in the 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:33.220
 new version of good lollipop 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.530
 I want to tell you that we are going to activate 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 at this time the root and we will go 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.640
 to the section of 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 compilation number here we are going to 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.810
 press several times and collect in a 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.730
 countdown now we're going to 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.670
 go back and we'll see the option to 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.220
 programmer options 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.290
 here in the programmer's options and we're going 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.549
 to look for the option that says access 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.840
 administrative 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.580
 this administrative descent comes 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.350
 being the root so good we're going to 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.240
 touch it and as grant by default I 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.100
 comes this option of only applications 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.780
 but good for the root to work with 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.440
 all applications and it was not 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.659
 problems 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.369
 let's go to applications and that 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.860
 we have to have it marked to us 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.239
 for the device and recognize 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.430
 all those applications that are 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.350
 spheres the root so good you fill today 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.270
 let's leave it like that and good 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.090
 and by default we also have 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.160
 superuser option here and good this 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.500
 it's optional 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.060
 so well activated here he mentions us 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.780
 if we see the script is going to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.780
 to accept 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 and ready binaries have already been used 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.560
 and we are going to talk a little very to see 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.450
 reviews of the use of this rom and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.190
 what this rom this is based on 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.410
 cyanogenmod 12 that we have the 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 change theme feature its 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.140
 installation of themes which will do 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.819
 that we can give it a better 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.069
 personalization to the device 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.959
 I arrived with this section of topics and 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.299
 we can change the physical aspect and what 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.790
 that is being known as animation and 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.150
 this double notification bar of 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.819
 here of IDs and good and this 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 is going to get according to the themes 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.389
 that make up the topics as I comment 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.430
 friends and good topics and I do not know if 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.109
 you want to get them and know that the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.909
 elegance of these themes the song is 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.919
 let go of a video of topics you want today in 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.500
 a 12 but then review them and 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.020
 customize your device to the fullest 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.570
 as also valid that has a 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.600
 section of extras that are being 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.340
 as very minimal personalizations but 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.650
 they're going to help the device a lot and 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.110
 we have the status bar and the 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.810
 lock screen notifications and 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.700
 webber buttons sound and so on between 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.709
 other configurations this is because 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.110
 they're going to check on you since it's a 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.270
 very long section as well as it is also 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.940
 room as I told you is a battery and 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.620
 he helped me a lot 13 hours 12 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 good hours is a favorable performance 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.580
 in the rune as well as in what 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.800
 comes the performance 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.890
 performance has been optimal much needed 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.660
 and good more than anything this rom comes with 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.250
 the optimized applications that already 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.900
 has zeppelin which is going to make 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.510
 the applications no longer consume so much 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.550
 battery in what has been the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.260
 device without another we install 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.780
 applications will no longer occupy so much 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.250
 battery not much as well as in the 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.169
 ram memory since memory always 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.720
 rom is an aspect that we always take care of 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.190
 on all the devices and now we're going 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.410
 to see the fluidity in the games the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.240
 function the games to the medium quite and 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.760
 well I here I have personalized 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.620
 by default and because when we 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.240
 we installed this tree brought launcher 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.220
 default which is to cyanogenmod 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.530
 11 and he does not go so I have it 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.300
 confirmed with nova and that does not go to the 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.050
 woman is the best throw to my point of 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.940
 view as well as there is another 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.680
 but good friends this is still the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.509
 review of what this room is being 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.819
 so good - if you liked this video 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:49.259

 video so good friends do not go 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.479
 we will continue to see the installation of 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.330
 tree so it seems obvious to turn off my 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.909
 device and well I'm going to turn off another 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.699
 device with the power button and volume 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.710
 further down pressed for about five 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.379
 seconds approximately enter the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.240
 so that facebook healthy that in the 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.280
 fast boot mode and we'll see the option that 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.800
 says recovery in the second word we 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.229
 let's unfold with the volume below and 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.780
 with more volume let's go in and 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.909
 remember to have as well as in 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.770

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.040
 of the video that not being here friends we 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.310
 we go to the wifi section 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.150
 city vance and good let's look for the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.100
 options that say albin cache data 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.050
 cache system which are the options that 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.330
 let's occupy us to make a 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.130

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.220
 more complete installation can give 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.020
 install this abroad but 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.400
 well here it's going to erase everything 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.110
 let's have internal memory 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.700
 I, as such, have a device like this and 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.950
 I'm going to clean it and then make another 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.020

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.520
 so good that red letter is normal 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.680
 do not worry it's from the same recovery 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.600
 We are going to unfold some 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.970
