00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.440
 Good day to all my name is 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.629
 Brian in this video you will know where 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.610
 you can get 3 more new pets 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:13.619
 for them we go to the raid under 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.230
 the name of the fortress of storms in this regina 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.279
 3 pets can fall this is small 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.170
 abyssalizer 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.349
 the probability of his drop is almost 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.330
 10 percent so can we fall 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.380
 little destroyer likelihood 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.089
 that he will fall is 9 percent and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.220
 Finally, we can get a chick Istra 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.600
 phoenix the likelihood that he will fall 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.910
 is almost seven and a half 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 percent if you don't know where 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.110
 is the entrance to the fortress whether in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.469
 This moment and can see link on 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.449
 roller 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.609
 where I tell in detail where 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:48.989
 is the entrance to this raid and so 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:51.750
 go first boss who us 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.010
 need this alor he is at all 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.100
 near the entrance from this boss on may 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 fall pet nestling phoenix sister 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.329
 I remind you that the probability of a drop is 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 almost seven and a half percent boss 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 killing is pretty easy 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.360
 However, I do not know if I may be something 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.580
 did wrong entered because when i 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.740
 killed the boss for some reason he resurrected again 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.480
 I do not know or everything is fine in general 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.480
 the main thing is that in the end I killed him 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.810
 go on to the next boss who 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.880
 I went this is the guardian of the abyss from this 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.680
 boss on may fall pet small 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.920
 destroyer I remind you that the chance of drop 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 causes nine percent 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.830
 before the boss stood pokemon i 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.990
 I recommend to clean them 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.700
 to have them not be distracted and that 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.850
 regards the boss here has the following 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.950
 tactic if you're a melee then you just beat 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.760
 the boss is nothing complicated and if 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.280
 you are a caster 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.410
 then you have a bit more complicated to you 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.060
 you need to throw dota on the boss that is 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.100
 your spell that inflict 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.260
 periodic damage also all the time 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.510
 move all the time be movement to 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.580
 you have an occasional window 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.550
 thanks to which you can again 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.990
 update dota yourself if anything rasp 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.900
 and of course beat the boss 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.040
 also it will not be superfluous to stock up 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.140
 some bottles of which 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.140
 restore your health finally 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.010
 the boss is down and I get 1 pet 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.610
 from this raid 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.280
 and the last boss we need is 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.860
 supreme astrologer larian he is 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.870
 on the right side of the raid 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.730
 from this boss on may fall pet 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.739
 lesser abyssalizer 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.050
 the probability of a drop is 9 whole and 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.000
 seven tenths percent as soon as you 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.370
 entered this room first thing you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.290
 Need to clean up absolutely all mobs then 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.750
 eat kill otherwise you will 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.390
 to control and when you are in 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.850
 control by the way even if you have pvp 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.830
 3 no it doesn't work so here when you 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.370
 are you there in 5 seconds 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.510
 control and 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.700
 the boss hp recovers completely 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.830
 you must first kill the mobs and after that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.830
 already without effort you can take down the boss 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.540
 I only got one pet today 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.299
 so charming little 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.549
 the destroyer that is, you get 1 out of 3 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.600
 I hope lucky a lot more will fall 2 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.520
 there are 3 or even 3 of 3 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.560
 on this video came up to 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.030
 end thanks for watching leave
