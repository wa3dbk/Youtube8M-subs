00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.389 
course of your quad core pc much better
okay<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.289> Windows<00:00:55.590> 7<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
okay then in Windows 7 so they can

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.319 
okay then in Windows 7 so they can
quickly<00:00:56.699> boot<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:58.190> utilize<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.789> cores<00:01:00.239> of

you<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> different<00:01:07.080> test

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you can see here all the different test

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.770 
you can see here all the different test

results that they did on their PCs and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.890 
results that they did on their PCs and
I'll<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.049> testing<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.560> well<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.400> duel<00:01:12.360> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
I'll be testing it as well now duel you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.609 
I'll be testing it as well now duel you

you've<00:01:20.430> seen<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> windows<00:01:21.509> phone<00:01:21.869> as

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you've seen this on the windows phone as

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.570 
you've seen this on the windows phone as
well<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.950> tiled<00:01:23.280> look<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.900> basically

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
well this tiled look so that basically

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
well this tiled look so that basically
will<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.790> there<00:01:27.030> okay<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.259> form<00:01:28.530> or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
will be there okay so in one form or

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.810 
will be there okay so in one form or
another<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.159> don't<00:01:29.340> know<00:01:29.460> one<00:01:29.610> hundred

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
another we don't know one hundred

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
another we don't know one hundred
percent<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.600> look<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.110> be

everybody's familiar and used to using

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
everybody's familiar and used to using
so<00:01:38.490> we'll<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.150> forward<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.869> new<00:01:40.110> user

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
so we'll look forward to this new user

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.880 
so we'll look forward to this new user

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.550 
different types of tools
now<00:02:03.820> do<00:02:03.880> things<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.570> fly<00:02:04.780> without<00:02:05.170> having

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
now do things on the fly without having

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.460 
now do things on the fly without having
to<00:02:05.680> leave<00:02:05.890> basically<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.540> Windows<00:02:07.960> Explorer

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
to leave basically the Windows Explorer

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.559 
to leave basically the Windows Explorer
interface<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.190> looking<00:02:09.910> forward<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.330> seeing

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
interface so looking forward to seeing

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.780 
interface so looking forward to seeing
some<00:02:11.440> new<00:02:11.470> features<00:02:11.770> in<00:02:12.250> there<00:02:12.430> as<00:02:12.550> well

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
some new features in there as well

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.240 
some new features in there as well
compared<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.810> windows<00:02:14.080> 7<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:14.980> there's<00:02:15.190> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
compared to windows 7 so there's a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.690 
compared to windows 7 so there's a
side-by-side<00:02:17.069> snapshot<00:02:18.069> none<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.520> these

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
side-by-side snapshot none of these

copying files now the interface the
pop-up<00:02:27.430> menu<00:02:27.459> will<00:02:27.940> be<00:02:28.090> different<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.630> give

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
pop-up menu will be different to give

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930 
pop-up menu will be different to give
you<00:02:29.020> more<00:02:29.230> information<00:02:29.470> more<00:02:30.130> details<00:02:30.640> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
you more information more details you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.759 
you more information more details you
can<00:02:31.120> pause<00:02:31.480> coughing<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.200> all<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> stuff<00:02:32.620> so

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
can pause coughing and all that stuff so

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.460 
can pause coughing and all that stuff so
that<00:02:32.980> will<00:02:33.220> be<00:02:33.340> nice<00:02:33.540> mounting<00:02:34.540> ISO<00:02:35.019> images

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
you'll be able to select an ISO and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.509 
you'll be able to select an ISO and
mount<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.260> save<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> hassle<00:02:42.250> of
