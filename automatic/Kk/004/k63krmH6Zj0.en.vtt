00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870 
need to cut out cookies using hexagonal
shape<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> cutter<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.609> would<00:00:20.760> be

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
shape if you have a cutter that would be

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.290 
shape if you have a cutter that would be
ideal

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
ideal

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
ideal
I<00:00:21.539> don't<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> cutter<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
I don't have a cutter so I use a

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.009 
I don't have a cutter so I use a
template<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.970> about<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.539> half<00:00:24.689> inch

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
template it's about two and a half inch

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.820 
template it's about two and a half inch
across<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.300> to<00:00:27.300> make<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.869> honeycomb<00:00:28.410> cookie

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
across and to make one honeycomb cookie

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.669 
across and to make one honeycomb cookie
you<00:00:28.949> need<00:00:29.189> total<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.210> four<00:00:30.510> cookies<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.380> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you need total of four cookies so you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.680 
you need total of four cookies so you
see<00:00:31.920> my<00:00:32.070> base<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.700> full<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.210> then<00:00:33.360> three

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
see my base is full and then three

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.310 
see my base is full and then three
remaining<00:00:34.140> cookies<00:00:35.090> have<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> small<00:00:36.660> holes<00:00:37.079> in

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
remaining cookies have a small holes in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.799 
remaining cookies have a small holes in
them<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.559> all<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.700> need<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.390> bake<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
them so all you need to do is bake the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.930 
them so all you need to do is bake the
cookies<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.399> cut<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
cookies for and then cut out the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
cookies for and then cut out the
center's<00:00:42.450> once<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> cookies<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.320> baked<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
center's once the cookies are baked and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.700 
center's once the cookies are baked and
still<00:00:44.280> hard<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.690> maintain<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.110> sharp<00:00:46.410> edges

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
still hard to maintain the sharp edges

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.540 
still hard to maintain the sharp edges

using some yellow icing I'm adding a dot
in<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> center<00:01:13.049> creating<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.680> daisy<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:17.009> could

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in the center creating a daisy you could

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.520 
in the center creating a daisy you could
use<00:01:17.430> different<00:01:17.610> colors<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.020> decided

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
use different colors for this I decided

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
use different colors for this I decided
to<00:01:19.770> go<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:19.950> white<00:01:20.460> flower<00:01:21.030> because<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
to go with white flower because it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.030 
to go with white flower because it
creates<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.710> nice<00:01:22.860> contrast<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.909> my<00:01:24.600> base

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
creates a nice contrast with my base

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.399 
creates a nice contrast with my base
cookie<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.960> colored<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:27.990> cookie<00:01:28.680> dough<00:01:28.890> with

Emery colors food gel colorings you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.440 
Emery colors food gel colorings you
could<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.100> different<00:01:35.280> colors<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.150> it's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
could use different colors as well it's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
could use different colors as well it's
not<00:01:36.630> set<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.140> stone<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:38.990> just<00:01:39.990> play<00:01:40.740> with<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
not set in stone so just play with it a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
not set in stone so just play with it a
little<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.700> flowers<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.960> make<00:01:43.140> them

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
little and flowers you can make them

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
little and flowers you can make them
small<00:01:43.799> big<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.460> don't<00:01:44.640> have<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> be<00:01:44.970> exactly

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
small big they don't have to be exactly

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.010 
small big they don't have to be exactly
same<00:01:45.659> size<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.100> really<00:01:47.579> go<00:01:47.960> with<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
same size so you can really go with the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.730 
same size so you can really go with the
flow<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.070> once<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:50.970> done<00:01:51.560> decorating<00:01:52.560> all

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
flow and once you're done decorating all

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.300 
flow and once you're done decorating all
the<00:01:52.979> cookies<00:01:54.890> we<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.310> move<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> making<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.659> B

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
the cookies we can move on to making a B

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
the cookies we can move on to making a B
so<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.939> B<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.210> will<00:02:00.689> show<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> how<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
so this is a B I will show you how to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.580 
so this is a B I will show you how to
make<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.610> quite<00:02:02.850> simple<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.630> use<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
make it's quite simple so I use the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.440 
make it's quite simple so I use the
marzipan<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.329> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
marzipan for this and this is what it

just some almonds first I'm going to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
just some almonds first I'm going to
make<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> little<00:02:22.380> guide<00:02:22.950> for<00:02:23.310> me<00:02:23.460> I'm<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.850> to

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
make a little guide for me I'm going to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.470 
make a little guide for me I'm going to
measure<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.660> theft<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.740> my<00:02:25.830> cookie<00:02:26.310> piece<00:02:26.520> so

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
measure the theft of my cookie piece so

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.180 
measure the theft of my cookie piece so
I<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:29.390> create<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.540> bee<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.170> will<00:02:31.410> be<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
I can create a bee that will be just the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.330 
I can create a bee that will be just the
right<00:02:32.730> size<00:02:32.790> for<00:02:33.570> my<00:02:34.200> piece<00:02:34.470> because<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.160> will

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
right size for my piece because it will

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.340 
right size for my piece because it will
be<00:02:35.550> nested<00:02:36.000> inside<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.760> honeycomb<00:02:38.760> piece

be nested inside of the honeycomb piece

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
be nested inside of the honeycomb piece
so<00:02:40.350> just<00:02:40.560> mark<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.920> toothpick<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.730> little

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
so just mark a toothpick with a little

also you're gonna have to cut to black
rounds<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.890> we'll<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:05.040> stacking<00:03:05.489> these

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
rounds and we'll be stacking these

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.510 
rounds and we'll be stacking these
together<00:03:05.910> first<00:03:06.810> though<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.440> want<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.310> make

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
a stinger this is the end part of the B

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.960 
a stinger this is the end part of the B
just<00:03:13.290> shape<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.680> into<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:14.010> little<00:03:14.160> pointy<00:03:15.620> disc

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
just shape it into a little pointy disc

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.170 
just shape it into a little pointy disc
and<00:03:18.110> then<00:03:19.110> start<00:03:19.500> with<00:03:20.040> yellow<00:03:20.430> at<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.910> black

pretty<00:03:33.330> well<00:03:33.660> together<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:34.380> just<00:03:34.530> roll

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
pretty well together and then just roll

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.770 
pretty well together and then just roll

roll<00:03:42.780> it<00:03:42.900> again<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.860> get<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.220> even<00:03:45.170> thickness

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
roll it again to get the even thickness

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.940 
roll it again to get the even thickness
and<00:03:47.100> now<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> can<00:03:47.610> add<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.870> head<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.709> take

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
and now you can add a head so just take

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.009 
and now you can add a head so just take
some<00:03:50.220> marzipan<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.180> roll<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.510> between<00:03:51.600> your

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.180 
onto a body of your bee and I'm just
measuring<00:04:02.310> its<00:04:02.910> perfect<00:04:03.420> size<00:04:03.830> so<00:04:04.830> now<00:04:05.130> you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
measuring its perfect size so now you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.630 
measuring its perfect size so now you
have<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.760> add<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.810> eyes<00:04:07.160> for<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.250> eyes<00:04:08.370> I'm

each side of the B this way it's easier

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.270 
each side of the B this way it's easier
to<00:04:43.160> insert<00:04:43.669> the<00:04:43.960> almond<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.560> now<00:04:45.800> just<00:04:46.100> gently

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
to insert the almond and now just gently

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.700 
to insert the almond and now just gently
insert<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.910> almond<00:04:47.210> inside<00:04:47.690> of<00:04:48.290> the<00:04:48.530> be

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
insert the almond inside of the be

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.600 
insert the almond inside of the be
further<00:04:49.610> incisions<00:04:51.100> marzipan<00:04:52.100> is<00:04:52.340> really

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
further incisions marzipan is really

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.870 
further incisions marzipan is really
easy<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:53.030> work<00:04:53.180> with<00:04:53.590> now<00:04:54.590> your<00:04:54.889> hands<00:04:55.250> may<00:04:55.370> get

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
easy to work with now your hands may get

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.850 
easy to work with now your hands may get
a<00:04:55.910> little<00:04:56.030> sticky<00:04:56.510> because<00:04:57.199> of<00:04:57.350> all<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.650> sugar

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
a little sticky because of all the sugar

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.540 
a little sticky because of all the sugar
that<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.430> contains<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.440> now<00:05:00.830> I'm<00:05:01.160> going<00:05:01.370> to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
that it contains so and now I'm going to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.390 
that it contains so and now I'm going to
show<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.760> how<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.030> put<00:05:02.750> this<00:05:02.870> piece<00:05:03.139> together

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
show you how to put this piece together

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.940 
show you how to put this piece together
so<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.910> is<00:05:05.090> our<00:05:05.270> honeycomb<00:05:05.630> piece<00:05:06.320> and<00:05:06.740> I'm

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
so this is our honeycomb piece and I'm

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.530 
so this is our honeycomb piece and I'm
going<00:05:07.190> to<00:05:07.340> glue<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.610> together<00:05:07.850> with<00:05:08.270> some

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
going to glue it together with some

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.640 
going to glue it together with some
royal<00:05:08.810> icing<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:11.479> here<00:05:11.750> I'm<00:05:11.900> just<00:05:11.930> piping<00:05:12.440> some

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
royal icing so here I'm just piping some

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.110 
royal icing so here I'm just piping some
icing<00:05:12.950> around<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.280> cookie<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.760> now<00:05:14.000> I'm

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
icing around the cookie and now I'm

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.480 
icing around the cookie and now I'm
going<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> flip<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.780> over<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.229> just<00:05:16.010> attach<00:05:16.310> it

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
going to flip it over and just attach it

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.940 
going to flip it over and just attach it
onto<00:05:16.639> the<00:05:16.880> base<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.479> just<00:05:18.080> continue<00:05:18.620> stacking

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950 
onto the base and just continue stacking

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.890 
onto the base and just continue stacking
them<00:05:19.250> together<00:05:19.610> make<00:05:20.210> sure<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.690> they<00:05:20.840> are

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
them together make sure that they are

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.730 
them together make sure that they are
aligned<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:23.229> now<00:05:24.229> onto<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:25.130> top<00:05:25.610> part<00:05:25.970> so

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
aligned and now onto the top part so

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.529 
aligned and now onto the top part so
just<00:05:27.740> attach<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.460> like<00:05:28.490> that<00:05:28.850> now<00:05:29.030> you<00:05:29.090> have<00:05:29.389> to

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
just attach it like that now you have to

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.080 
just attach it like that now you have to
let<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.750> sit<00:05:30.080> for<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.590> little<00:05:30.680> bit<00:05:30.970> until<00:05:31.970> the

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
let it sit for a little bit until the

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.210 
let it sit for a little bit until the
icing<00:05:32.180> dries<00:05:32.900> and<00:05:33.289> then<00:05:33.410> we<00:05:33.590> can<00:05:33.770> handle<00:05:34.100> the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
icing dries and then we can handle the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.219 
icing dries and then we can handle the
cookies<00:05:36.280> so<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.370> attach<00:05:37.940> our<00:05:38.060> B<00:05:38.419> inside<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:39.110> the

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
cookies so to attach our B inside of the
