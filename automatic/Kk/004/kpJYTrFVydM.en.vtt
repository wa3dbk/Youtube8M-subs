I<00:01:04.489> think<00:01:05.489> naval<00:01:05.850> architecture<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> great

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
I think naval architecture is is a great

I think naval architecture is is a great
specialization<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.030> probably<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> the

they go into the ocean so I'm using a

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.350 
they go into the ocean so I'm using a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and structural loads and stuff so I

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.070 
and structural loads and stuff so I
still<00:02:25.490> have<00:02:25.640> my<00:02:25.670> textbooks<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:26.570> notes<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
still have my textbooks and notes and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.870 
still have my textbooks and notes and
stuff<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.590> I'm<00:02:27.830> applying<00:02:28.280> them<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880

helped develop his idea for a new

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.970 
helped develop his idea for a new
business<00:04:46.690> what<00:04:47.690> we've<00:04:47.840> created<00:04:48.320> here<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.950> a

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
business what we've created here is a

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.210 
business what we've created here is a
it's<00:04:49.550> called<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.880> transpire<00:04:50.420> craft<00:04:50.780> it's<00:04:51.080> a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
it's called the transpire craft it's a

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.970 
it's called the transpire craft it's a
wind<00:04:52.220> turbine<00:04:52.550> access<00:04:53.060> vessel<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.980> offshore

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
wind turbine access vessel for offshore

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.660 
wind turbine access vessel for offshore
wind<00:04:55.220> turbines<00:04:55.630> especially<00:04:56.630> over<00:04:56.870> in<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.050> UK

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
wind turbines especially over in the UK

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.250 
wind turbines especially over in the UK
so<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.820> design<00:04:59.150> sort<00:04:59.390> of<00:04:59.510> came<00:04:59.690> from<00:04:59.930> a

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
so the design sort of came from a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.950 
so the design sort of came from a
competition<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.460> was<00:05:01.520> held<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:02.060> in<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:02.810> UK

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
competition that was held over in the UK

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.130 
competition that was held over in the UK
by<00:05:03.320> a<00:05:03.350> company<00:05:03.950> called<00:05:04.040> the<00:05:04.490> Carbon<00:05:04.790> Trust

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
by a company called the Carbon Trust

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.700 
by a company called the Carbon Trust
they<00:05:06.140> put<00:05:06.350> out<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> call<00:05:06.740> for<00:05:08.140> novel<00:05:09.140> vessels<00:05:09.530> to

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
they put out a call for novel vessels to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.260 
they put out a call for novel vessels to
get<00:05:09.890> people<00:05:10.280> to<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.550> from<00:05:10.610> offshore<00:05:10.940> wind

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
get people to and from offshore wind

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.900 
get people to and from offshore wind
turbines<00:05:11.750> in<00:05:12.070> more<00:05:13.070> difficult<00:05:13.460> weather

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
turbines in more difficult weather

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.760 
turbines in more difficult weather
conditions<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:14.630> larger<00:05:15.020> waves<00:05:15.230> and<00:05:15.560> further

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
conditions so larger waves and further

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.410 
conditions so larger waves and further
from<00:05:16.010> shore<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.640> is<00:05:16.760> what<00:05:16.910> we<00:05:17.030> came<00:05:17.210> up

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
from shore and this is what we came up

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.260 
from shore and this is what we came up
with<00:05:17.890> so<00:05:18.890> they<00:05:19.010> had<00:05:19.130> four<00:05:19.340> hundred<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.640> twenty

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270
