to<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.300> minimum<00:02:39.540> by<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> saw<00:02:40.350> two<00:02:40.560> per<00:02:40.739> one<00:02:42.320> sony

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
to the minimum by I saw two per one sony

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.560 
to the minimum by I saw two per one sony
less<00:02:43.620> than<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:46.790> 2.1<00:02:47.790> i'm<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.330> going<00:02:48.510> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
less than that so 2.1 i'm just going to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.400 
less than that so 2.1 i'm just going to
use<00:02:48.720> fight<00:02:48.959> for<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> calculator<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> under<00:02:51.840> 2.1

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
use fight for a calculator so under 2.1

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.979 
use fight for a calculator so under 2.1
is<00:02:52.590> 1.9<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.730> anything<00:02:54.150> under<00:02:54.360> thats<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:54.780> i<00:02:54.900> look

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
is 1.9 so anything under thats if i look

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.619 
is 1.9 so anything under thats if i look
at<00:02:55.080> one<00:02:55.290> point<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:56.959> search

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
at one point a search

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.200 
at one point a search
come<00:03:00.629> on<00:03:00.719> the<00:03:00.780> must<00:03:00.930> be<00:03:01.049> 14<00:03:01.379> hey<00:03:01.829> come<00:03:02.280> on

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.090 

and<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:06.230> guess<00:03:06.440> there<00:03:06.830> was

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
and I guess there was

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.770 
and I guess there was
well<00:03:08.730> that's<00:03:08.970> what<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> want<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.360> do<00:03:09.480> really

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
well that's what you want to do really

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.430 
well that's what you want to do really
just<00:03:09.990> pick<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> pic<00:03:10.800> fun<00:03:11.100> player<00:03:12.110> with<00:03:13.110> the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
just pick the pic fun player with the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.250 
just pick the pic fun player with the
hunter<00:03:14.280> find<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.270> minimum<00:03:15.420> by<00:03:15.780> now<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.110> then

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
hunter find the minimum by now and then

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.610 
hunter find the minimum by now and then

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
blaming work position see that I could

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.730 
blaming work position see that I could
bid<00:03:26.940> luck<00:03:27.120> one<00:03:27.330> point<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.600> Hernandez<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.620> make

bid luck one point a Hernandez and make

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.850 
bid luck one point a Hernandez and make
a<00:03:28.770> given<00:03:29.220> like<00:03:29.730> easy<00:03:30.030> profit<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.770> do

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
a given like easy profit and you can do

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.020 
a given like easy profit and you can do
that<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.130> any<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.460> chemistry<00:03:32.790> start

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
that with any of the chemistry start

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.200 
that with any of the chemistry start
succeed<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.540> there<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:35.220> add<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.490> in<00:03:35.670> like

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
succeed on there I just add that in like

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.270 
succeed on there I just add that in like
so<00:03:36.540> that's<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.810> first<00:03:36.930> method<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.710> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
so that's the first method and the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.980 
so that's the first method and the
second<00:03:38.610> method<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.300> pick<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> player

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
second method you want to pick a player

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.810 
second method you want to pick a player
so<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.560> use<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.890> striker<00:03:41.160> for<00:03:41.310> example

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
so I can use the striker for example

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.150 
so I can use the striker for example
usually<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:42.810> usually<00:03:43.200> like<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.510> look<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.690> coup

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
usually I usually like to look a coup

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.840 
usually I usually like to look a coup
might<00:03:47.160> even<00:03:47.430> take<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.410> incidence

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
might even take it for this incidence

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.450 
might even take it for this incidence
she<00:03:50.850> wants<00:03:51.090> us<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.270> play<00:03:51.390> our<00:03:51.510> benteke<00:03:52.460> but

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
she wants us to play our benteke but

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.820 
she wants us to play our benteke but
then<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:53.700> wanna<00:03:53.990> Jana<00:03:54.990> chemistry<00:03:55.440> star<00:03:55.680> you

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
then you wanna Jana chemistry star you

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.080 
then you wanna Jana chemistry star you
want<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.100> look<00:03:56.400> at<00:03:56.550> him<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.820> convert

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
want to look at him and convert

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.220 
want to look at him and convert
positions<00:03:57.570> you've<00:03:57.750> probably<00:03:57.900> seen<00:03:58.110> this

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
positions you've probably seen this

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
positions you've probably seen this
method<00:03:58.620> before<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.970> first<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.360> wanna<00:04:00.540> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
method before so first you wanna you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.500 
method before so first you wanna you
don't<00:04:00.840> look<00:04:01.110> a<00:04:01.170> cam<00:04:01.470> one<00:04:01.740> sent<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.550> mid<00:04:02.790> and

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
don't look a cam one sent to mid and

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:12.580 
don't look a cam one sent to mid and
look<00:04:04.020> at<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.200> prices<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:06.180> 12<00:04:06.600> kak<00:04:07.910> 5.91<00:04:09.590> 45.3

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
look at the prices so 12 kak 5.91 45.3

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.759 
look at the prices so 12 kak 5.91 45.3
somebody<00:04:13.590> probably<00:04:13.860> trial<00:04:14.160> my<00:04:14.310> rice<00:04:14.910> look<00:04:14.940> in

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
somebody probably trial my rice look in

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.520 
somebody probably trial my rice look in
see<00:04:17.769> there's<00:04:17.979> one<00:04:18.129> on<00:04:18.250> an<00:04:18.370> open<00:04:18.549> bed<00:04:18.909> and<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.989> 4.9

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
see there's one on an open bed and a 4.9

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.589 
see there's one on an open bed and a 4.9
you're<00:04:23.530> there<00:04:23.830> I<00:04:24.280> could<00:04:24.879> probably<00:04:25.000> sell<00:04:25.509> them

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
you're there I could probably sell them

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.409 
you're there I could probably sell them
on<00:04:25.780> for<00:04:25.960> 5k<00:04:26.469> like<00:04:27.189> the<00:04:27.310> minimum<00:04:27.639> by<00:04:27.789> nose<00:04:28.000> and

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
on for 5k like the minimum by nose and

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.339 
on for 5k like the minimum by nose and
two<00:04:29.580> probably<00:04:30.580> pick<00:04:30.819> one<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.330> for<00:04:31.629> like<00:04:32.050> full

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
two probably pick one up for like full

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.700 
two probably pick one up for like full
point<00:04:32.590> line<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.949> seven<00:04:33.990> if<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.139> will<00:04:35.319> know<00:04:35.439> I

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
point line of seven if I will know I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.619 
point line of seven if I will know I
guess<00:04:36.310> 56<00:04:36.550> back<00:04:38.400> 52<00:04:39.400> I'm<00:04:39.849> probably<00:04:40.150> just<00:04:40.360> going

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
guess 56 back 52 I'm probably just going

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.140 
guess 56 back 52 I'm probably just going
to<00:04:40.719> put<00:04:40.870> bid<00:04:41.080> on<00:04:41.259> that<00:04:41.550> so<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.819> want<00:04:43.000> like<00:04:43.030> a

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
to put bid on that so you want like a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.209 
to put bid on that so you want like a
Senate<00:04:43.449> made<00:04:43.629> search<00:04:43.930> for<00:04:44.439> that<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:45.069> then

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:45.219 
Senate made search for that and then

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.990 
Senate made search for that and then
your<00:04:45.370> look<00:04:45.550> CDM<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.889> know<00:04:47.889> it's<00:04:48.219> like<00:04:48.310> why<00:04:48.819> would

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
your look CDM I know it's like why would

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.469 
your look CDM I know it's like why would
you<00:04:49.120> buy<00:04:49.360> benteke<00:04:50.349> in<00:04:50.590> CDM<00:04:51.120> now<00:04:52.120> people

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
you buy benteke in CDM now people

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.499 
you buy benteke in CDM now people
actually<00:04:52.779> do<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.199> there's<00:04:53.500> one<00:04:53.680> for<00:04:53.800> 5k<00:04:54.509> and

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
actually do like there's one for 5k and

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.890 
actually do like there's one for 5k and
the<00:04:55.569> rest<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.199> like<00:04:56.379> six<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.300> can<00:04:58.569> probably

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
the rest so like six so you can probably

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.080 
the rest so like six so you can probably
pick<00:04:59.080> up<00:04:59.259> that<00:04:59.650> Ben<00:05:00.039> Heck<00:05:00.219> and<00:05:00.430> some<00:05:00.639> mid<00:05:00.879> I
