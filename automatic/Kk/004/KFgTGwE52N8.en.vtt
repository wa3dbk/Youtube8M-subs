00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.109
 what shines here in the sun is the new Ford Focus since 1998 this is 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.980
 Model on the market and has since sold over 10 million times 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 now ordered and the third generation of the world bestseller not only in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.160
 Germany should he the eternal competitors Opel Astra and VW Golf 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.310
 make pressure 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.250
 Forecasts say the compact car segment in need of worldwide growth 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.120
 ahead in 2013, every second car should be a compact as Ford wants 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.860
 mix vigorously 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.650
 So the strategy is that this car is convinced of that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.440
 What the brand should represent is excellent 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.290
 to offer in a hundred 22 markets we once started the Focus 1 too 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.790
 Ahlen, however, even at that time were about 80 markets on the way 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.900
 So you can say in principle any market to which the purchasing power of the ESC 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.820
 We are using the corridors to power a vehicle of this size 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.770
 Equipped Ford Focus 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 Kinetic Design Lintfort has fallen in style all over the world 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.450
 find and give the car a special dynamic 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.410
 at the front, the kinetic design comes mainly in trapezoidal shape I designed 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.450
 Grille to expression 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.860
 Extensive customer surveys from China to America have encouraged Front 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 In the future, product development will take place even more on the world market 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.580
 to align individual regions 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.830
 At the rear, the focus is as dynamic as at the front 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.640
 sportily the roof line falls backwards a chrome trim guesses the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.159
 lower edge of the windows and emphasizes the rising line 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.650
 the taillights encompass rear and time and also all other lines 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.910
 Swinging committed the bottom is sturdy and scratch resistant 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.910
 Plastic covered 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.089
 First comes the 5-door hatchback on the market a little 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.769
 later it will also be a four ThÃ¼ringer notchback sedan and the 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.169
 kombi-modell Tournament in the main plant in Saarlouis, the models for 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.809
 Europe 120 countries is exported from here 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:33.230
 The vehicles for the Russian market are built in Saint Petersburg 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.559
 In addition, Schiemer and Thailand are manufactured in the USA 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.639
 the Ford Focus as a global world car 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.639
 no easy task 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.169
 that was certainly a challenge they have different 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.520
 Safety standards in Europe went beyond North America 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:58.489
 There are other legal requirements to give Sunny Masih Arctic 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.829
 Space the partners offered had to be tight 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.839
 and all of that we actually have in our so-called Center of Excellence 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.119
 So that means a home for engineers in Cologne designed for the 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:14.239
 World if you like and this vehicle if you have the global now 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.979
 Look at all markets based on 80 percent equal parts strategy 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.699
 which may not be as visible to the customer as we always are 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.979
 still have loose color distinctions 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.869
 the Science in the water a vehicle made up of lock it over engines 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:33.779
 Over the body we talk about 80% recklessly forgiven 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.349
 Group-wide uniform norms and standards make the rows of trees 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.639
 world's smallest and hardly anything has to be redeveloped 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.029
 only parts that are subject to different legal provisions 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:50.059
 such as lights or Mr. Beck largest differ 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.619
 and only ten percent vary due to local preferences and tastes 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:58.479
 The careless driver can support numerous assistance systems such as 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.249
 The Active City Stop System uses the infrared reader to read the space in front of the vehicle 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:08.219
 standing and complete a rear-end collision at speeds up to 50 km / h 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.559
 avoids further available track-holding and a parking assistant in 

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:13.430
 this segment 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.809
 a Hartmann this 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:21.009
 this set of assistance systems not yet seen isolated in some 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.489
 Application in the premium segment but not in the complete hype so of 

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:29.809
 Therefore, we here Glauberg very proud defines its real benchmark 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:30.580
 to have 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.580
 Fire and standards for the future 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:39.209
 This year, 65,000 Focus plans to sell in Germany alone 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:40.440
 the focus in this country 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.440
 the most popular ford model 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.680
 we test the strongest gasoline engine as the number 6 liter EcoBoost with a hundred 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.870
 34 kW 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.120
 This model is equipped as standard with a start-stop automatic 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.450
 in seven municipalities seconds reached that 100 km / h mark 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.150
 At 1 222 kilometers per hour, the acceleration ends 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 6 liters should consume the model for 100 kilometers 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.099
 As a three-door, it will not give the Focus in the future because of the 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.770
 coupÃ©haft sporty five-door model covers this model range 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.940
 sporting spearhead will be from 2012 again the Ford Focus St 1 2 liters 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.690
 EcoBoost petrol direct injection with 184 kilowatts is thus for performance 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.210
 pure care
