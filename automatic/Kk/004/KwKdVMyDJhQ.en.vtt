 and to know a little better about the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.690
 universe of the house for today the man is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.079
 more modern 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.600

 old mind is the woman who made purchases

 For him, the woman would take her father. 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.809
 he at home 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.750
 Today he already knows who he is. 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.120
 shop one thing and the man stays it today 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.960
 wants to choose his clothes even if he 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.000
 to produce 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.520
 he wants to look in the mirror he is more 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.170
 vain following the fashion he tells 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 After two months with me she 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.510
 quantities or smaller but it is always 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 buy it and see what's going on 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.460
 updated 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.020
 but in my opinion what draws 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.880
 attention the increase goes through the mall 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.250
 notices the showcase comes on account of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.280
 some piece is in front of who she 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.710
 to the weekly VIP platform 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.330
 The week we play 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.330
 lisa the white shirt necktie accessory 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.010
 I feel this solid good is only sometimes 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.170
 items that you can not find in several 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.850
 Places are good, it's in the window says 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.440
 thinking is a major problem that the 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 man still has to dress 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.140
 the greatest doubt is the one capable even of 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.690
 no, no, people say that we have 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.270
 today our team is yes consultants 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.759
 so in many cases the person guides 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 depending on the type of sale you 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.320
 He comes to the mall to consume and comes 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.179
 to the mall to have fun but he sees 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.729
 the mall to learn 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.280
 we want to learn what is fashionable 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.340
 We want to understand the latest 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.920
 technologies and where we will learn 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 What is in the fashion of the mall is the man 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940
 is practical 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.420
 So in the store, man, they're self. 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.450
 explanatory the man he needs to see 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.730
 the store as a solver 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.790
 problems for him he has difficulty in 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.269
 Match the shoe to the pantyhose shirt 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.640
 necktie shirt, and then this kind of 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.190
 suggestion to the public is fundamental 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.100
 among the more masculine 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.280
 still the man and loves me enough to call 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.860
 the seller was sincere I want it and 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.019
 that is exactly the set that speaks 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.970
 mannequin is a navy blue suit it is so 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.250
 imagine synonymous with 4 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.590
 so if you want something easy 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.600
 celso marini india where what will aggravate the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.250
 record everything indicates in the lash line 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.080
 I think the most important tip is the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.850
 people keep this in mind that the tie is 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.410
 a complement of the ceiling you can not 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.980
 blazer has no reason to 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.010
 television recorded in English is not enough 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.560
 closer to the body and it only has two 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.600
 buttons I think this our heritage of the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.390
 barack obama gave it just we do not have 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.150
 three buttons are always two and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.520
 rule is to leave the bottom button open 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.540
 and the band to know the right moment 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.300
 we make a detour on the way to 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.520
 be that this is a super stylish suit 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.320
 elegant and quite traditional takes and 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.830
 How to choose to do is to leave this look 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.560
 a bit more casual informal well go and 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.770
 who will be able to take the tie put the 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.300
 social pants put your team one 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.970
 I think it's cool and it's going to be a 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.970
 Nice image opened the shirt the tongue 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.950
 she started in a street store and today 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.600
 Do you have mall stores? 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.420
 Why this change what is it? 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.730
 brought benefit in being today 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.830
 at the mall and we felt that the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.420
 public had a resistance began to 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.940
 have a life of for the far rooster 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.070
 did not have access parking 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.050
 the mall has a community offering 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.880
 this mall security target air 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.750
 conditioning and we only have to rain 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.370
 People are no longer on the street. 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.590
 the store will ensure that it comes with a 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.570
 new layout is a layout that here in 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.040
 cuiabá has not yet been developed 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.050
 by falzoni alves lima who is a 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.510
 office in são paulo and is the new 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.460
 concept of the house store for us 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.970
 believes much there at the mall bar 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.730
 because the first one that is the second 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.460
 mato grosso state city 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.360
 so you 're already betting on the location 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.529
 from the mall 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.389
 I believe it will be a total success. 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.789
 together I think that the concept 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:51.399
 that the mall comes is also the mall 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.859
 Comes with the cinema comes with several stores of the 

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:55.959
 enterprise as a whole, it generates a 

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:57.609
 expectation and we want to sing 

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:59.799
 together from the beginning and I believe 

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:02.259
 enough in the success you enjoy our 

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.969
