for<00:00:26.430> most<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> my<00:00:26.820> videos<00:00:26.849> are<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.630> coming<00:00:27.990> up

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
for most of my videos are we coming up

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.019 
for most of my videos are we coming up
in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> near<00:00:28.529> future<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.949> will<00:00:29.160> edit<00:00:29.609> with<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
in the near future I will edit with this

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
in the near future I will edit with this
so<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.170> we'll<00:00:31.380> just<00:00:31.529> open<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
so if we'll just open it up this is the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.010 
so if we'll just open it up this is the
version<00:00:32.640> 10<00:00:38.180> alright<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> see<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.960> is

depth review on it later but this is
final<00:00:57.750> cut<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.340> heavy<00:00:59.609> editing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
final cut it's a very heavy editing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
final cut it's a very heavy editing
program<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.199> whole<00:01:01.590> bunch<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.890> titles

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
program you have a whole bunch of titles

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
program you have a whole bunch of titles
you<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> transitions<00:01:03.510> music<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> can

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you can do transitions music and you can

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
you can do transitions music and you can
also<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.339> some<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.760> cool<00:01:05.970> effects<00:01:06.299> where

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
also do some pretty cool effects where

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
also do some pretty cool effects where
they'll<00:01:06.600> start<00:01:06.990> getting<00:01:07.200> into<00:01:07.380> some

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
they'll start getting into some

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
they'll start getting into some
tutorials<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> later<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.420> that's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
tutorials with that later so that's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.800 
tutorials with that later so that's
final<00:01:09.960> cut<00:01:10.140> pro<00:01:10.549> my<00:01:11.549> next<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.090> another<00:01:12.420> video

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
final cut pro my next is another video

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.899 
final cut pro my next is another video
editor<00:01:13.200> editor<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.250> cheaper<00:01:14.520> its

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
editor editor it's a little cheaper its

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.390 
editor editor it's a little cheaper its
motion<00:01:15.509> 5<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:16.350> Apple<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.009> both<00:01:17.159> from

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
motion 5 from Apple these are both from

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.429 
motion 5 from Apple these are both from
Apple<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.570> 300<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> 50<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> if<00:01:22.320> we

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
Apple this is 300 this is 50 so if we

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.700 
Apple this is 300 this is 50 so if we
were<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.830> open<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.250> motion<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
were to just open up motion this is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.260 
were to just open up motion this is
basically<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> same<00:01:26.220> thing<00:01:26.400> as<00:01:26.580> final<00:01:27.030> couple

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
basically the same thing as final couple

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.350 
basically the same thing as final couple
you<00:01:27.420> cannot<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.049> many<00:01:28.200> things<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.360> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
you cannot do as many things with it so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.800 
you cannot do as many things with it so
this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.570> version<00:01:30.900> 5<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.530> motion<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> see

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
this is version 5 of motion so you see

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
this is version 5 of motion so you see
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.470> um<00:01:34.710> open<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.729> types<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you can just um open up types of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.700 
you can just um open up types of
projects<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:38.070> hold<00:01:38.640> on

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
projects you can do like them hold on

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
projects you can do like them hold on
for<00:01:40.710> some<00:01:40.890> reason<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> feel<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.790> uses<00:01:42.689> up

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
for some reason I feel like this uses up

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
for some reason I feel like this uses up
more<00:01:44.810> CPU<00:01:45.810> usage<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.560> Final<00:01:47.159> Cut<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> see

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
more CPU usage then Final Cut you see

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
more CPU usage then Final Cut you see
you<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> whole<00:01:48.060> bunch<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.450> built-in<00:01:48.960> ones

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you have a whole bunch of built-in ones

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
you have a whole bunch of built-in ones
that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.680> edit<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.640> most<00:01:50.850> likely<00:01:51.000> you're

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
that you can edit but most likely you're

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.569 
that you can edit but most likely you're
going<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> blank<00:01:52.020> one<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.250> let's<00:01:53.399> say

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
going to want a blank one so let's say

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.310 
going to want a blank one so let's say
you<00:01:53.610> were<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> open<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.509> blank<00:01:55.969> effect

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
you were to just open a blank effect

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.569 
you were to just open a blank effect
this<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.799> come<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.399> see

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
this is what you come up with you see

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.730 
this is what you come up with you see
not<00:01:59.790> as<00:01:59.969> many<00:02:00.119> options<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.350> final<00:02:01.710> cut

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
not as many options as with final cut

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.010 
not as many options as with final cut
but<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.520> still<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.210> pretty<00:02:03.450> heavy<00:02:03.719> editing

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but you still get a pretty heavy editing

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
but you still get a pretty heavy editing
program<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.860> recommend<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.759> you're<00:02:05.850> just

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
program I recommend if you're just

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.059 
program I recommend if you're just
starting<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.630> get<00:02:06.869> into<00:02:07.290> heavy<00:02:07.469> editing<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
starting to get into heavy editing I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.999 
starting to get into heavy editing I
suggest<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> start<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.330> motion<00:02:09.929> 5<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> then

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
suggest you start with motion 5 and then

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.490 
suggest you start with motion 5 and then
move<00:02:11.250> over<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.730> final<00:02:12.060> cut<00:02:12.349> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
move over to final cut so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.300 
move over to final cut so
its<00:02:13.590> motion<00:02:13.740> 5<00:02:14.360> now<00:02:15.360> my<00:02:15.930> next<00:02:16.200> application<00:02:16.980> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
its motion 5 now my next application you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.040 
its motion 5 now my next application you
probably<00:02:17.610> heard<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.210> ScreenFlow

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
probably heard of it is ScreenFlow

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.720 
probably heard of it is ScreenFlow
that's<00:02:19.620> what<00:02:19.770> I'm<00:02:19.860> using<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.190> record<00:02:20.400> this

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that's what I'm using to record this

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.600 
that's what I'm using to record this
video<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.990> much<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.290> say<00:02:22.610> it's

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
video right now not much I can say it's

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.580 
video right now not much I can say it's
very<00:02:23.730> good<00:02:24.120> screen<00:02:24.390> recording<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.350> can

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
very good screen recording you you can

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.230 
very good screen recording you you can
go<00:02:25.770> up<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.930> UM<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:29.100> resolution<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.970> your

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
go up to the UM the resolution of your

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.260 
go up to the UM the resolution of your
screen<00:02:30.660> for<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> video<00:02:31.860> recording<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:33.150> that's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
screen for the video recording so that's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.380 
screen for the video recording so that's
pretty<00:02:33.450> cool<00:02:34.190> my<00:02:35.190> next<00:02:35.550> appt<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.120> that's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
pretty cool my next appt I think that's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.460 
pretty cool my next appt I think that's
number<00:02:36.990> four<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.940> Pixelmator<00:02:39.020> you've<00:02:40.020> seen<00:02:40.350> I

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
number four is Pixelmator you've seen I

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.290 
number four is Pixelmator you've seen I
have<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> tutorial<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.459> that<00:02:41.640> already<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.150> how

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
have a tutorial on that already on how

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.750 
have a tutorial on that already on how
to<00:02:42.360> make<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.750> background<00:02:43.490> basically<00:02:44.490> it's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
to make this background basically it's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.750 
to make this background basically it's
just<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.420> Photoshop<00:02:45.930> which<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.760> but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
just like Photoshop which I do have but

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
just like Photoshop which I do have but
I<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:48.720> seem<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> little<00:02:49.800> better

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
I just seem to like this a little better

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.449 
I just seem to like this a little better
it<00:02:50.070> seems<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.400> little<00:02:50.520> more<00:02:50.760> user<00:02:51.030> friendly<00:02:52.459> so

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it seems a little more user friendly so

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.010 
it seems a little more user friendly so
if<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.640> were<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.790> open<00:02:53.970> up<00:02:54.180> pick<00:02:54.360> some<00:02:54.510> ADC<00:02:54.870> this

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
if we were to open up pick some ADC this

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.570 
if we were to open up pick some ADC this
is<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.320> you<00:02:55.410> opened<00:02:55.770> with<00:02:55.920> basically<00:02:56.400> all

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
is what you opened with basically all

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.120 
is what you opened with basically all
the<00:02:56.670> same<00:02:56.700> tools<00:02:57.060> as<00:02:57.330> um<00:02:57.680> photoshop<00:02:58.680> just

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
the same tools as um photoshop just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.310 
the same tools as um photoshop just
apples<00:02:59.520> version<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.959> seems<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.290> be

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
apples version of it and it seems to be

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.630 
apples version of it and it seems to be
a<00:03:01.410> little<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.770> user<00:03:02.160> friendly<00:03:02.280> than

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
a little more user friendly than

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.870 
a little more user friendly than
photoshop<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.900> also<00:03:04.050> cheaper<00:03:04.880> so

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
photoshop and it's also cheaper so

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.430 
photoshop and it's also cheaper so

computer but you can't find it all what
this<00:03:22.950> basically<00:03:23.160> does<00:03:23.640> is<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.060> finds<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> for

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
this basically does is it finds it for

you so let's say that we were to scan
oops<00:03:31.610> let's<00:03:32.610> say<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:32.880> were<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.030> scan<00:03:33.540> my
