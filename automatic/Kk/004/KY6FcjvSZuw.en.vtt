helped me people feel better and so our

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.240 
helped me people feel better and so our
treatments<00:00:13.380> are<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.500> directed<00:00:13.890> it<00:00:14.040> there<00:00:14.190> were

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
treatments are we directed it there were

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.189 
treatments are we directed it there were
different<00:00:14.910> pathologic<00:00:15.480> processes<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.049> can

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
different pathologic processes that can

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.740 
different pathologic processes that can
cause<00:00:16.379> disease<00:00:17.060> firstly<00:00:18.060> obstructions

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
cause disease firstly obstructions

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.240 
cause disease firstly obstructions
basically<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> compromise<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.800> blood

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
basically the compromise of blood

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
basically the compromise of blood
getting<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> heart<00:00:21.030> because<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.780> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
getting out of the heart because of the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.840 
getting out of the heart because of the
papillary<00:00:22.650> muscles<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.340> mitral<00:00:23.699> valve

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
papillary muscles of mitral valve

impinging upon the muscle except them
there

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
there

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.430 
there
the<00:00:27.090> additional<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.600> symptoms<00:00:28.050> are<00:00:28.170> from<00:00:28.350> the

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
the additional a symptoms are from the

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.810 
the additional a symptoms are from the
heart<00:00:28.529> being<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.980> bit<00:00:29.070> stiffer<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.640> call

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
heart being a little bit stiffer we call

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.580 
heart being a little bit stiffer we call
it<00:00:29.970> diastolic<00:00:30.359> dysfunction<00:00:30.660> when<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> heart

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
it diastolic dysfunction when the heart

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.260 
it diastolic dysfunction when the heart
muscle<00:00:31.650> still<00:00:32.099> pumps<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.789> but<00:00:33.030> all<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
muscle still pumps very well but all the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
muscle still pumps very well but all the
hard<00:00:33.390> time<00:00:33.719> relaxing<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.379> filling<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.340> neck

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
hard time relaxing and filling the neck

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.069 
hard time relaxing and filling the neck
result<00:00:35.819> elevated<00:00:36.300> filling<00:00:36.539> pressures<00:00:36.870> within

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
result elevated filling pressures within

result elevated filling pressures within
the<00:00:37.199> heart<00:00:37.379> which<00:00:37.679> can<00:00:37.710> relieve<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
the heart which can relieve some of the

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.090 
the heart which can relieve some of the
symptoms<00:00:38.780> kind<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.839> third<00:00:40.079> thing<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.739> directed

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
symptoms kind of third thing we directed

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.379 
symptoms kind of third thing we directed
at<00:00:41.249> is<00:00:41.429> that<00:00:41.699> people<00:00:42.059> who<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:42.389 
at is that people who have this

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:43.910 
at is that people who have this
condition<00:00:42.600> can<00:00:42.929> often<00:00:43.199> have<00:00:43.319> compromised

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
condition can often have compromised

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.559 
condition can often have compromised
blood<00:00:44.489> flow<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.819> the<00:00:44.909> heart<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.479> heart

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
blood flow to the heart to the heart

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.180 
blood flow to the heart to the heart
itself<00:00:45.929> it<00:00:46.229> says<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> heart<00:00:46.620> demands<00:00:46.949> more

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
itself it says the heart demands more

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.160 
itself it says the heart demands more
oxygen<00:00:47.639> so<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.179> the<00:00:48.210> absence<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.809> critical

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
oxygen so you in the absence of critical

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
oxygen so you in the absence of critical
blockages<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> arteries<00:00:49.979> we<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.819> hard

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
blockages in the arteries we have a hard

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.579 
blockages in the arteries we have a hard
time<00:00:51.089> getting<00:00:51.299> enough<00:00:51.629> blood<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.139> supply<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:52.589 
time getting enough blood to supply the

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.110 
time getting enough blood to supply the
heart<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:52.859> adequate<00:00:53.399> oxygen<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> work

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
heart with adequate oxygen it's the work

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.939 
heart with adequate oxygen it's the work
that's<00:00:54.329> being<00:00:54.510> asked<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.769> lot<00:00:55.889> of

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that's being asked of it and a lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.229 
that's being asked of it and a lot of
times<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.249> small<00:00:56.670> vessels<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.179> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
times are very small vessels in the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.879 
times are very small vessels in the
capillaries<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> heart<00:00:58.260> muscle<00:00:58.589> can<00:00:58.739> also

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889 
capillaries so the heart muscle can also

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.549 
capillaries so the heart muscle can also
have<00:00:59.159> some<00:00:59.399> compromised<00:01:00.299> condition<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.469> we

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
have some compromised condition so we

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
have some compromised condition so we
tried<00:01:01.739> direct<00:01:01.979> agent<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.369> might<00:01:02.489> help

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
tried direct agent that might help

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
tried direct agent that might help
improve<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.089> blood<00:01:03.269> flow<00:01:03.510> over<00:01:03.659> there<00:01:03.839> as

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
improve the blood flow over there as

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:04.520 
improve the blood flow over there as
well

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
well

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
well
okay<00:01:05.400> well<00:01:05.519> because<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.940> above<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.570> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
okay well because the above can get a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.820 
okay well because the above can get a
little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.990> congestion<00:01:07.110> or<00:01:07.560> fluid

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
little bit of congestion or fluid

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.530 
little bit of congestion or fluid
overloaded<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> lungs<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.150> length

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
overloaded in the lungs or the length

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
overloaded in the lungs or the length
swelling<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.130> direct<00:01:11.370> our<00:01:11.460> treatment<00:01:11.790> at

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
swelling so we direct our treatment at

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.150 
swelling so we direct our treatment at
that<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.150> well<00:01:12.330> too<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.870> also<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.440> leak<00:01:13.800> on<00:01:13.980> the

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
that as well too and also a leak on the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.920 
that as well too and also a leak on the
mitral<00:01:14.430> valve<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:14.970> fairly<00:01:15.510> common

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
mitral valve which is a fairly common

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
mitral valve which is a fairly common
situation<00:01:16.050> so<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:16.980> kind<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.190> agents<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.640> use<00:01:17.820> or

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
situation so it kind of agents we use or

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.580 
situation so it kind of agents we use or
medicines<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.510> can<00:01:18.660> make<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> heart<00:01:19.080> beat<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
medicines that can make the heart beat a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
medicines that can make the heart beat a
little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:20.100> less<00:01:20.250> slower<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.240> slower

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
little bit less slower a little slower

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
little bit less slower a little slower
which<00:01:22.260> allows<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.620> heart<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> fill<00:01:23.160> more<00:01:23.430> time

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
which allows the heart to fill more time

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
which allows the heart to fill more time
to<00:01:23.790> fill<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.600> heart<00:01:24.810> function<00:01:25.230> less

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
to fill with heart function less

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
to fill with heart function less
vigorous<00:01:25.830> slaws<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.550> marked<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.180> time<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
vigorous slaws again marked the time to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
vigorous slaws again marked the time to
fill<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> also<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> less<00:01:28.740> oxygen<00:01:28.950> demand

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
fill and also that less oxygen demand

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
fill and also that less oxygen demand
agents<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.480> can<00:01:30.570> improve<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> blood<00:01:31.170> flow

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
agents that can improve the blood flow
