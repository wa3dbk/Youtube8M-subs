00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.139 

I'm<00:01:27.859> just<00:01:27.979> gonna<00:01:28.100> put<00:01:28.280> some<00:01:28.310> random<00:01:28.670> stuff<00:01:28.880> on

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
I'm just gonna put some random stuff on

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:30.880 
I'm just gonna put some random stuff on
course<00:01:29.780> grow<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.079> youngest<00:01:30.350> age<00:01:30.469> because<00:01:30.770> you

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
course grow the youngest age because you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.380 
course grow the youngest age because you
can<00:01:31.009> stay<00:01:31.189> in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.899> yuh<00:01:33.520> season<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.149> stay

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
can stay in the yuh season you stay

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.349

playing longer basically karate already

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.340 
playing longer basically karate already
so<00:01:38.359> this<00:01:38.479> stuff<00:01:38.659> doesn't<00:01:38.810> really<00:01:38.899> matter

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
so this stuff doesn't really matter

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
reason walks off with athletic is

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.220 
reason walks off with athletic is
because<00:03:21.340> um<00:03:21.689> you're<00:03:22.689> automatically<00:03:23.019> spell

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
because um you're automatically spell

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.250 
because um you're automatically spell
off<00:03:23.349> with<00:03:23.500> high<00:03:23.650> layup<00:03:24.099> hot<00:03:24.280> dog<00:03:25.170> also<00:03:26.170> you

have<00:03:26.530> high<00:03:26.769> or<00:03:26.879> much<00:03:27.879> higher<00:03:28.060> speed<00:03:28.450> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
have high or much higher speed and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.360 
have high or much higher speed and
quickness<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.799> these<00:03:29.950> are<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.129> two<00:03:30.250> most

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
quickness and these are the two most

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.369 
quickness and these are the two most
expensive<00:03:30.909> things<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.299> UM<00:03:31.420> in<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:32.170> game

expensive things in the UM in the game

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.069 
expensive things in the UM in the game
so<00:03:32.849> that's<00:03:33.849> why<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.030> prefer<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.420> use<00:03:34.540> athletic

so that's why I prefer to use athletic

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.009 
so that's why I prefer to use athletic
because<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:36.120> mean<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.269> don't<00:03:37.329> like<00:03:37.510> spending<00:03:37.689> the

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
because I mean I don't like spending the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.479 
because I mean I don't like spending the
two<00:03:38.680> thousand<00:03:39.160> points<00:03:39.519> just<00:03:40.449> to<00:03:40.540> get<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.810> up<00:03:40.930> so
