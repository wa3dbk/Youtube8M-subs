will<00:01:25.500> fall<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.810> might<00:01:27.810> find<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> it's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
will fall out you might find that it's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.160 
will fall out you might find that it's
difficult<00:01:29.010> to<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.610> rid<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.390> gap<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.900> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
difficult to get rid of the gap as you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.550 
difficult to get rid of the gap as you
close<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.830> jump<00:01:32.010> ring<00:01:33.050> and<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.350> best

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
close the jump ring and the best

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
close the jump ring and the best
technique<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.729> once<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
technique to do that is once when the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.999 
technique to do that is once when the
jumping<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.990> open<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.220> push<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:40.710> Rings

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
jumping is open you push the Rings

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.980 
jumping is open you push the Rings
together<00:01:41.250> push<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> two<00:01:41.850> ends<00:01:42.240> together<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
together push the two ends together so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
together push the two ends together so
that<00:01:43.110> they<00:01:43.200> overlap<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.070> bit<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> create

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that they overlap a little bit to create

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.499 
that they overlap a little bit to create
a<00:01:44.880> bit<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> tension<00:01:45.860> then<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.759> put<00:01:48.000> line<00:01:48.300> them

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a bit of tension then we put line them

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.920 
a bit of tension then we put line them
up<00:01:50.780> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> continue<00:01:52.410> with<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.560> process<00:01:53.930> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
up if you continue with that process you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.700 
up if you continue with that process you
will<00:01:55.050> end<00:01:55.350> up<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:58.610> bracelet<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.470> last

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
will end up with bracelet and the last

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.300 
will end up with bracelet and the last
step<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.789> thread<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.570> your<00:02:03.899> class<00:02:04.310> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
step is to thread in your class the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.850 
step is to thread in your class the
class<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:06.240> be<00:02:06.300> threaded<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.470> one<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
class could be threaded in to one of the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.250 
class could be threaded in to one of the
limbs<00:02:08.100> at<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> end<00:02:11.959> there<00:02:12.959> are<00:02:13.050> lots<00:02:13.170> of

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
limbs at the end there are lots of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.979 
limbs at the end there are lots of
