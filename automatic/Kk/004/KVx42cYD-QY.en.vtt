00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.590
 we are going to show you how you can install 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.100
 the beta version of sx 10.10 called 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.140
 yosemite that is the operating system that 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.249
 has presented Paul in his last 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:18.560
 developer conference wwdc in 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:21.560
 this year 2014 with the method that we are going 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.439
 to show our archives our 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.300
 absolutely everything folders will not run 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.359
 no risk of that good then 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.849
 when you have tired of trying it 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.670
 you have to restore or make copies of 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.769
 security or anything since we're going to use 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.469
 an external unit therefore to 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.300
 start with the tutorial the first thing that 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.700
 let's do is open utility of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.320
 discs 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.040
 and connect a usb either a pendrive or 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.650
 a hard disk with at least about 32 gb of 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.110
 storage approximately as you see 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 we have connected here a unit 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.610
 usb that is 64 gigs ssd and what 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.680
 let's do is we're going to go to 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.500
 section of partitions we will give a 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.110
 a partition as they are we indicate 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 here the name we are going to remove we are going to 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.760
 put for example 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.740
 you can put any other name and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.710
 this is very important the format has 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.310
 that be frames with registration and in 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.650
 options as you see here the table of 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.770
 partitions has to be git can not 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.830
 be a map of contribution partitions ni 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.680
 br has the kit we accept 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.910
 we apply the changes will tell us that it's going 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.440
 to erase the partition that we had 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.229
 stayed previously and that is going to 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.740
 add a new partition with the name 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.180
 yosemite let's create partitions and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.280
 Well depending on how quickly 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.009
 be your unit this process can 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.910
 take more or less time and now what 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.910
 let's do is let's download 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.390
 we go on safari 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:09.459
 and on this web page 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:14.410
 let's download the beta version of sx 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 as you can see we go to the page is and mz of 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.070
 dotcom and in the tab or sx betas and 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.350
 today is x yosemite well then here 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.380
 we have two options we can download it 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.940
 with a torrent file then you can 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.260
 download with your client torrent 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.689
 what you want or direct download 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 well we have already downloaded this 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.579
 file as you see is here in the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.530
 desktop install or sx and what are we going to 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.440
 do is install it on our pendrive 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.350
 To do this double click on the icon 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.580
 and the installer will open we will 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.100
 continue we accept the conditions and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.900
 good because here it will say that we are going to 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.880
 install on macintosh hd us 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.340
 remember that we do not want this because it 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.740
 will install on mavericks if not 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.110
 we want this but we will show 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.550
 all the discs and as you see good then 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.770
 now they are going to show us down here 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.100
 all the partitions that our 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.080
 computer or external disks that 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.310
 are available we are going to do 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.780
 In Yosemite we will give you to install 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.390
 we will enter the password of our 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.070
 user and nothing because now the only thing 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.070
 we have to do is wait for the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.840
 process has concluded the process of 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.510
 installation will be carried out 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.000
 automatically and the only thing we will have 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.360
 what to do is wait for this one 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.490
 determine 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.980
 once the process seems to have 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.340
 finished the computer will restart two 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.340
 times 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.609
 Well, as you can see, this is the installer 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.439
 yosemite 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.060
 is already installed on computer and now 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.459
 what we will do will be good 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.159
 configure previously this let's see that 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.150
 we are in Spain the type of keyboard 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.269
 it exists since it contains the Ã± 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.640
 and now we can connect or we can connect 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.939
 not to our wifi network and we're going to 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.099
 continue offline here we will tell you 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.799
 that we are not going to transfer absolutely 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.380
 nothing at this time and we will accept 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.840
 the conditions as you see good then it 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.860
 you have to create an account as always 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.289
 has happened and it is not x on the computer 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.949
 and once it's configured then 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.789
 we can start using the computer 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.520
 obviously the performance is not the 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.560
 same as if we have it installed in 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.289
 our computer since good to remember 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.620
 What we are doing is running the 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.150
 operating system from this pendrive of 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.819
 here such a way that good 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.379
 we restarted having given and we do not have the 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:50.219
 pendrive connected good, well, not 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:52.490
 we can use this and well then as 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:58.620
 you see now on the screen you are going to see 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.490
 we already have or sx 10.10 yosemite installed 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.470
 in our computer 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.180
 and well, from here we will go 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:12.639
 showing all the news that brings 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.639
 this new apple operating system
