00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
town internet year is kind of shitty

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.250 
town internet year is kind of shitty
unfortunately<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.570> not<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:39.930> shitty

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
unfortunately but it's not so shitty

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.229 
unfortunately but it's not so shitty
that<00:02:40.380> it's<00:02:40.500> unplayable<00:02:40.830> which<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.310> nice<00:02:41.489> just

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
that it's unplayable which is nice just

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.680 
that it's unplayable which is nice just
not<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.630> was<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:45.060> don't<00:02:45.239> have<00:02:45.360> internet

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
not what it was just don't have internet

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.000 
not what it was just don't have internet
that<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.959> used<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.739> too<00:02:47.610> bad<00:02:48.950> video<00:02:49.950> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
that I used to have so too bad video is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
that I used to have so too bad video is
take<00:02:50.190> a<00:02:50.220> lot<00:02:50.400> longer<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.700> upload<00:02:51.120> so<00:02:51.540> that

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
take a lot longer to upload so that

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.900 
take a lot longer to upload so that
means<00:02:52.650> i'll<00:02:52.770> probably<00:02:53.040> doing<00:02:53.459> most<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.820> my

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
means i'll probably doing most of my

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.460 
means i'll probably doing most of my
uploading<00:02:54.330> at<00:02:54.420> night<00:02:54.630> versus<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.410> know

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
there's going to be not as much as Mike

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.479 
there's going to be not as much as Mike
used<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:25.709> they'll<00:03:25.829> definitely<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.400> a

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
used to but they'll definitely be a

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.390 
used to but they'll definitely be a
steady<00:03:27.390> flow<00:03:27.600> of<00:03:27.690> content<00:03:27.989> coming<00:03:28.470> out<00:03:28.590> just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
steady flow of content coming out just

stuff like that you know we made a
little<00:03:45.660> bit<00:03:45.780> easier<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:47.180> start<00:03:48.180> putting<00:03:48.329> out

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540

Jesus<00:04:47.400> Christ<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.820> think<00:04:48.060> mass<00:04:48.240> effect<00:04:48.630> 3<00:04:48.870> will

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
Jesus Christ I think mass effect 3 will

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.870 
Jesus Christ I think mass effect 3 will
probably<00:04:49.410> be<00:04:49.530> out<00:04:49.680> before<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:50.190> finish<00:04:50.669> mass

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
probably be out before you finish mass

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.150 
probably be out before you finish mass
effect<00:04:51.240> 2<00:04:51.419> it<00:04:52.110> looks<00:04:52.289> like<00:04:52.470> i<00:04:52.620> have<00:04:52.650> missed<00:04:52.919> out

burglar and it'll be really nice to

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.180 
burglar and it'll be really nice to
overtime<00:05:38.520> slowly<00:05:39.229> get<00:05:40.229> back<00:05:40.530> into<00:05:40.800> shape

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
again it's just hard to do that when

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.939
