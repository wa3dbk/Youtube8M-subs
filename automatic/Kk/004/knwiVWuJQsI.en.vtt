well to continue on with the discussion

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.910 
well to continue on with the discussion
about<00:00:08.010> FD<00:00:08.520> lenses<00:00:09.000> for<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.450> canon<00:00:10.020> eos<00:00:10.260> system

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
about FD lenses for the canon eos system

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.029 
about FD lenses for the canon eos system
and<00:00:11.100> specifically<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> t2<00:00:12.330> i<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:13.039> wanted

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
and specifically for the t2 i I wanted

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.310 
and specifically for the t2 i I wanted
to<00:00:14.160> show<00:00:14.430> what<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.150> looks<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.539> in<00:00:15.869> some<00:00:16.230> of

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
to show what it looks like in some of

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.769 
to show what it looks like in some of
the<00:00:16.379> situations<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.490> FD<00:00:17.820> lens<00:00:18.060> isn't

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
the situations where the FD lens isn't

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.960 
the situations where the FD lens isn't
exactly<00:00:19.350> practical<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.250> that's<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> be

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
exactly practical and that's going to be

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.510 
exactly practical and that's going to be
in<00:00:21.060> bright<00:00:21.300> sunlight<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.110> I'm<00:00:22.950> about<00:00:23.190> to<00:00:23.250> show

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
in bright sunlight and I'm about to show

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.420 
in bright sunlight and I'm about to show
you<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.730> piece<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.180> footage<00:00:24.440> mmm<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.890> really

you a piece of footage mmm that really

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.580 
you a piece of footage mmm that really
shows<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.150> effect<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.260> called

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
shows up that effect that is called

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640 
shows up that effect that is called
either<00:00:28.770> the<00:00:28.890> bright<00:00:29.280> spot<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> halo<00:00:30.930> take

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
either the bright spot or the halo take

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.240 
either the bright spot or the halo take
a<00:00:31.680> look<00:00:33.559> you're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.949> forgive

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
a look you're going to have to forgive

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.560 
a look you're going to have to forgive
the<00:00:35.399> audio<00:00:35.730> because<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.210> using<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
the audio because I'm using the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970 
the audio because I'm using the
microphone<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:37.170> built<00:00:37.440> into<00:00:37.650> the<00:00:37.800> camera

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
microphone that's built into the camera

microphone that's built into the camera
for<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.570> mainly<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:39.989> something<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.590> want

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
for this mainly this is something I want

for this mainly this is something I want
you<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.280> using<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.180> FD<00:00:42.750> lens<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.410> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you to see using an FD lens out in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.710 
you to see using an FD lens out in
bright<00:00:43.980> sunlight<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> effect<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
bright sunlight and the effect that

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.450 
bright sunlight and the effect that
we're<00:00:45.870> after<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.410> what's<00:00:47.010> known<00:00:47.220> as<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
we're after is what's known as the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.380 
we're after is what's known as the
bright<00:00:47.940> spot<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.620> halo<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.640> shows<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.210> in

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
bright spot or the halo that shows up in

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.590 
bright spot or the halo that shows up in
the<00:00:51.630> center<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> image<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.390> just

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the center of the image and this is just

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
the center of the image and this is just
one<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> negatives<00:00:55.470> when<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.710> comes<00:00:55.860> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
one of the negatives when it comes to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
one of the negatives when it comes to
using<00:00:56.160> FD<00:00:56.760> lenses<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.050> way<00:00:58.290> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
using FD lenses this one by the way is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.630 
using FD lenses this one by the way is
the<00:00:58.710> 28<00:00:59.190> millimeter<00:00:59.700> F<00:00:59.969> 2.8<00:01:00.780> Tokina<00:01:01.399> FD<00:01:02.399> lens

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the 28 millimeter F 2.8 Tokina FD lens

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
the 28 millimeter F 2.8 Tokina FD lens
and<00:01:02.989> I'm<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.229> pan<00:01:04.500> across<00:01:04.649> here<00:01:05.219> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
and I'm going to pan across here a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
and I'm going to pan across here a
little<00:01:05.369> bit<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.969> to<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
little bit and you want to see the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.649 
little bit and you want to see the
bright<00:01:07.560> spot<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.490> moving<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> center

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
bright spot that's moving at the center

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.559 
bright spot that's moving at the center
and<00:01:09.959> all<00:01:10.679> that<00:01:10.859> is<00:01:11.069> well<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.119> simply

00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:12.569 
and all that is well it's just simply

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:15.469 
and all that is well it's just simply
light<00:01:12.869> that's<00:01:13.740> coming<00:01:14.219> through<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.939> adapter

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
light that's coming through the adapter

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.169 
light that's coming through the adapter
and<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.619> does<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.979> magnified<00:01:17.399> on<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> center

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
and it does get magnified on the center

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:19.730 
and it does get magnified on the center
of<00:01:18.389> the<00:01:18.509> sensor<00:01:18.899> or<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.109> least<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.409> assume

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
of the sensor or at least I assume

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.580 
of the sensor or at least I assume
that's<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.130> way<00:01:20.249> that<00:01:20.459> works<00:01:20.729> either<00:01:21.119> way<00:01:21.630> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's the way that works either way it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
that's the way that works either way it
gives<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> problem<00:01:23.279> so<00:01:24.149> what<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.389> comes

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
gives you a problem so what it comes

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.169 
gives you a problem so what it comes
down<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:25.039> it's<00:01:26.039> a<00:01:26.189> situation<00:01:26.399> where<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.819> can't

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
down to it's a situation where you can't

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.029 
down to it's a situation where you can't
use<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.990> FD<00:01:28.380> lenses<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:31.619> any<00:01:31.799> other

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.039 
use the FD lenses and like any other

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.969 
use the FD lenses and like any other
tool<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:33.270> do<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.689> their<00:01:33.840> place<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.770> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
tool they do have their place but this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.589 
tool they do have their place but this
just<00:01:35.189> doesn't<00:01:35.340> happen<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.729> be<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.999> place<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.589 --> 00:01:36.599 
just doesn't happen to be the place I

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.330 
just doesn't happen to be the place I
mean<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.929> have<00:01:37.139> a<00:01:37.170> fine<00:01:37.469> set<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.859> jeweler's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mean I have a fine set of jeweler's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.449 
mean I have a fine set of jeweler's
screwdrivers<00:01:38.999> but<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> can't<00:01:39.959> exactly<00:01:40.310> fix<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
screwdrivers but I can't exactly fix the

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.760 
screwdrivers but I can't exactly fix the
brakes<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.849> my<00:01:41.969> car<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.569> them<00:01:42.749> but<00:01:43.469> as<00:01:43.709> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
brakes on my car with them but as a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.559 
brakes on my car with them but as a
result<00:01:44.069> I<00:01:44.429> don't<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.849> dismiss<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.359> out<00:01:45.509> of

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
result I don't just dismiss them out of

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.319 
result I don't just dismiss them out of
hand<00:01:46.159> again<00:01:47.159> we<00:01:47.399> got<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.849> discussion

get<00:01:56.789> some<00:01:57.029> fine<00:01:57.270> quality<00:01:57.869> glass<00:01:58.349> this<00:01:59.219> isn't<00:01:59.520> a

get some fine quality glass this isn't a
bad<00:01:59.729> way<00:01:59.939> to<00:01:59.969> get<00:02:00.179> started<00:02:00.749> and<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:01.979> they

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
bad way to get started and are they

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.019 
bad way to get started and are they
going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.249> be<00:02:02.340> right<00:02:02.489> for<00:02:02.520> every<00:02:02.819> situation

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:03.029 
going to be right for every situation

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.800 
going to be right for every situation
probably<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.159> now<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.239> seeing<00:02:06.450> one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
probably not and now you're seeing one

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.109 
probably not and now you're seeing one
of<00:02:06.840> those<00:02:07.079> reasons<00:02:07.319> now<00:02:08.250> oddly<00:02:08.489> enough<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of those reasons now oddly enough it's a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
of those reasons now oddly enough it's a
little<00:02:09.360> hard<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.099> wanted

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
little hard to see there but I wanted

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.430 
little hard to see there but I wanted
you<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.700> also<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:12.120> some<00:02:12.690> footage<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.080> shot<00:02:13.319> now

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you to also see some footage I shot now

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.260 
you to also see some footage I shot now
that<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.920> 28<00:02:14.370> millimeter<00:02:14.790> lens<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that was with the 28 millimeter lens and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.810 
that was with the 28 millimeter lens and
I<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.570> mentioned<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.960> I<00:02:16.920> shot<00:02:17.490> some

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
I think I mentioned that I shot some

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.680 
I think I mentioned that I shot some
with<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
with the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.980 
with the
50<00:02:18.900> millimeter<00:02:19.530> lens<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:21.570> really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
50 millimeter lens and you can really

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.700 
50 millimeter lens and you can really
see<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.160> bright<00:02:23.370> spots<00:02:23.730> showing<00:02:24.270> up<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:25.110> can

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
see the bright spots showing up it can

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.980 
see the bright spots showing up it can
be<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.860> problem<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.670> once<00:02:27.270> again<00:02:27.450> like<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.930> said

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
be a problem but once again like I said

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.500 
be a problem but once again like I said
before<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.770> these<00:02:29.340> FD<00:02:29.670> lenses<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> tool

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
before it's a these FD lenses are a tool

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.650 
before it's a these FD lenses are a tool
they're<00:02:31.470> not<00:02:31.680> always<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.280> perfect<00:02:32.460> tool<00:02:32.820> but

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
they're not always the perfect tool but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.300 
they're not always the perfect tool but
considering<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.560> prices<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.280> are

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
considering the prices that are

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.150 
considering the prices that are
available<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:36.600> lenses<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.590> variety

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
available for these lenses the variety

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.530 
available for these lenses the variety
of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> lenses<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
of the lenses that you can get and the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.330 
of the lenses that you can get and the
opportunity<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.440> experiment<00:02:41.190> without

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
opportunity to just experiment without

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760 
opportunity to just experiment without
breaking<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> bank<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:43.200> you'll<00:02:43.560> find

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
breaking the bank I think you'll find

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.220 
breaking the bank I think you'll find
that<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.700> can<00:02:44.850> really<00:02:45.060> come<00:02:45.210> in<00:02:45.390> handy<00:02:45.540> for

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
that they can really come in handy for

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.270 
that they can really come in handy for
our<00:02:46.560> cameras

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
our cameras

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.390 
our cameras
I<00:02:47.540> enjoyed<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> discussion<00:02:48.890> that<00:02:49.890> followed

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
I enjoyed the discussion that followed

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550 
I enjoyed the discussion that followed
yesterday's<00:02:51.030> video<00:02:51.300> there<00:02:52.290> were<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> few

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
yesterday's video there were a few

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.550 
yesterday's video there were a few
comments<00:02:52.800> about<00:02:53.130> back<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.760> forth<00:02:54.000> about

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
comments about back and forth about

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.920 
comments about back and forth about
using<00:02:55.560> FD<00:02:55.890> lenses<00:02:56.280> or<00:02:56.490> not<00:02:56.760> using<00:02:57.060> FD<00:02:57.540> lenses

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
using FD lenses or not using FD lenses

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.770 
using FD lenses or not using FD lenses
on<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:58.410> camera<00:02:59.040> system<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:00.210> one<00:03:00.480> thing<00:03:00.660> I

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
on this camera system but one thing I

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.390 
on this camera system but one thing I
think<00:03:00.840> there's<00:03:01.380> really<00:03:01.530> no<00:03:01.860> right<00:03:02.220> or<00:03:02.370> wrong

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
think there's really no right or wrong

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.030 
think there's really no right or wrong
to<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.150> as<00:03:03.390> I<00:03:03.690> said<00:03:03.900> yesterday<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:04.860> an

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to this as I said yesterday it's an

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.790 
to this as I said yesterday it's an
artistic<00:03:05.550> choice<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.080> want<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.590> use

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
artistic choice so if you want to use

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.100 
artistic choice so if you want to use
them<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.310> great<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:09.000> you<00:03:09.390> don't<00:03:09.690> want<00:03:09.990> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
them that's great if you don't want to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.900 
them that's great if you don't want to
use<00:03:10.290> them<00:03:10.490> that's<00:03:11.490> great

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
use them that's great

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.770 
use them that's great
I<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.840> imagine<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:14.210> discussion<00:03:15.210> board<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
I can imagine a discussion board a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.630 
I can imagine a discussion board a
couple<00:03:16.500> hundred<00:03:16.860> years<00:03:17.010> ago<00:03:17.430> with<00:03:18.090> vengo<00:03:18.570> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
couple hundred years ago with vengo and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.300 
couple hundred years ago with vengo and
Suzanne<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.850> Gogan<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:22.080> you<00:03:22.860> know<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.070> name

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
Suzanne and Gogan and you know you name

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.040 
Suzanne and Gogan and you know you name
it<00:03:23.489> some<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.790> painters<00:03:24.120> all<00:03:24.270> arguing<00:03:24.690> over

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
it some of the painters all arguing over

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.290 
it some of the painters all arguing over
which<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> best<00:03:25.800> kind<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.250> brush<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:27.060> use

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
which was the best kind of brush to use

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.410 
which was the best kind of brush to use
for<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.720> particular<00:03:28.500> type<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.770> painting<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
for a particular type of painting you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.790 
for a particular type of painting you
get<00:03:30.600> into<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.930> technical<00:03:31.350> stuff<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.620> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
get into the technical stuff and it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.280 
get into the technical stuff and it
really<00:03:32.280> takes<00:03:32.940> away<00:03:33.180> from<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.420> creative<00:03:33.930> I

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
really takes away from the creative I

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.490 
really takes away from the creative I
mean<00:03:34.680> again<00:03:35.090> making<00:03:36.090> movies<00:03:36.450> is<00:03:36.660> an<00:03:36.930> art<00:03:37.140> form

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
mean again making movies is an art form

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
mean again making movies is an art form
it's<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:38.100> creative<00:03:38.550> exercise<00:03:39.530> unfortunately

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
it's a creative exercise unfortunately

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.229 
it's a creative exercise unfortunately
it's<00:03:40.650> one<00:03:40.739> of<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> few<00:03:41.280> creative<00:03:41.730> exercises

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
it's one of the few creative exercises

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.810 
it's one of the few creative exercises
that<00:03:42.660> requires<00:03:43.110> engineers<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.640> course

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
that requires engineers and of course

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.280 
that requires engineers and of course
when<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.060> let<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.480> discussion<00:03:45.660> break<00:03:46.110> down

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
when you let the discussion break down

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.470 
when you let the discussion break down
by<00:03:46.500> two<00:03:46.830> engineers<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.610> lot<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.150> times<00:03:48.330> they're

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
by two engineers a lot of times they're

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.820 
by two engineers a lot of times they're
just<00:03:48.510> going<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> tell<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.050> what<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.320> can't<00:03:49.620> do

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
just going to tell you what you can't do

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.479 
just going to tell you what you can't do
and<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.130> can<00:03:50.280> say<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.910> was<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.390> and

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
and I can say that because I was one and

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.710 
and I can say that because I was one and
you're<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.670> going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.820> break<00:03:54.030> down<00:03:54.209> into<00:03:54.450> all

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
you're just going to break down into all

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.870 
you're just going to break down into all
of<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.019> technical<00:03:55.380> minutiae<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.160> that's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
of the technical minutiae and that's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.820 
of the technical minutiae and that's
where<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.209> don't<00:03:57.450> want<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.680> it's

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
where you don't want to be but it's

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
where you don't want to be but it's
still<00:03:59.010> fun<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.340> read<00:03:59.550> because<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.450> can<00:04:00.600> always

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
still fun to read because you can always

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660 
still fun to read because you can always
find<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.140> good<00:04:01.290> tip<00:04:01.530> somewhere<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:02.519> you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
find a good tip somewhere in there you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.490 
find a good tip somewhere in there you
just<00:04:02.820> don't<00:04:03.030> have<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.300> always<00:04:03.480> buy<00:04:04.019> into<00:04:04.470> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
just don't have to always buy into it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.190 
just don't have to always buy into it
anyway<00:04:05.489> that's<00:04:06.300> about<00:04:06.450> as<00:04:06.630> much<00:04:06.750> as<00:04:06.810> I<00:04:06.989> want<00:04:07.170> to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
anyway that's about as much as I want to

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.290 
anyway that's about as much as I want to
say<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.590> FD<00:04:07.860> lenses<00:04:08.190> today<00:04:08.340> next<00:04:09.060> time<00:04:09.209> we

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
say for FD lenses today next time we

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.880 
say for FD lenses today next time we
might<00:04:09.420> take<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.690> look<00:04:09.780> at<00:04:09.989> some<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.290> these<00:04:10.380> great

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
might take a look at some of these great

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.780 
might take a look at some of these great
big<00:04:11.720> telephoto<00:04:12.720> jobs<00:04:13.080> and<00:04:13.640> something<00:04:14.640> that's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
big telephoto jobs and something that's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.409 
big telephoto jobs and something that's
particularly<00:04:15.180> interesting<00:04:17.030> this<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.209> called

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
particularly interesting this is called

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.840 
particularly interesting this is called
a<00:04:18.540> teleconverter<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.980> actually<00:04:20.130> doubles

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
a teleconverter and it actually doubles

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 
a teleconverter and it actually doubles
the<00:04:21.239> lens<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:21.810> we'll<00:04:21.989> take<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.169> look<00:04:22.380> at<00:04:22.470> that

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the lens so we'll take a look at that

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.159 
the lens so we'll take a look at that
next<00:04:22.860> time

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:30.169 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.229
