00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.650
 the boys are 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.670
 trento in this video 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.760
 let's see a little lately with the PC not 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.170
 there are more active problems to access 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.920
 many a little then free the computer 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.110
 new in the meantime let's do a little 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.900
 video blog different from the usual 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.250
 going to see how they are cooked 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.100
 there 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 pork majin steaks called 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.090
 just from me chops to the brand 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.090
 lights the fire 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:20.679
 so and then what we will use we feel 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:28.469
 fennel seeds a little prepared 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:34.959
 for August and finally of wine vinegar 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:39.280
 advertising hidden bridges from 1867 again 

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:41.860
 then buy what you do 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.689
 the amount a video immediately but then 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.679
 then taken again the apples really so 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:54.909
 however they will be good they are given to 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:58.359
 let's cook our cutlets wait 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.630
 that the other part is also cooked 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.579
 here you see that now we say 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.259
 which are cooked both on one side and 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:12.010
 on the other hand, however, not quite enough 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:15.780
 and again we turn now we pass 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.150
 since they are almost cooked with seasoning 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.110
 this video is a bit lively at 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.110
 balsamic vinegar 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.270
 oh well so more or less 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.000
 put them 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.460
 in abundance but in truth it is not 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.810
 abundant this because you will see 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.730
 however, how it is absorbed by the carnera 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.120
 and now that they are almost cooked 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:51.220
 let's finish with a bit of spice 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:59.080
 it starts precisely from the preparation for 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:02.350
 roasts killed by a sprinkle and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.980
 after which a bit of fennel seeds 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:12.750
 which practically are are whole that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.200
 they are thus put so whole 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.200
 ask yourself about yourself 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.380
 they rush to this meat like this 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:28.640
 in this way we say the gand one 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:31.460
 roma nothing now gives another mini 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.650
 giratina is practically the dish is 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:43.580
 almost no one does not know 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:48.260
 how good so now let's say it is 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:50.320
 cooked and now i really think yes 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.160
 can hear 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.160
 here is dissimilar yes no 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.930
 here we say that I eat 2 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.030
 so with a bit of the beautiful sorrentino 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:24.680
 here 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.680
 here remind the pivot what to do 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.070
 our steaks then when 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.330
 they are almost cooked a little is added 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.730
 of vinegar prepared for roast seeds of 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.720
 fennel to give a good rome e 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:05:11.630
 now all that remains is to taste them ready 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:05:17.270
 My forum has fainted a crazy thing 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.270
 simple but very effective preparation 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:25.860
