00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.180
 slightly different manufacturer 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.959
 I have to say while I was looking for my 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.650
 Kizlyar manufacturer on the Internet 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.450
 convinced that he was not there at all the city 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.140
 Kizlyar represented by a large number 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.540
 manufacturers and they are on the most different 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.849
 knives 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.819
 I made what I liked here 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.250
 firstly that knife was awesome 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.709
 this knife is very different 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.530
 workmanship here are these things 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.069
 look they all fit all 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.389
 the elements here are all made very high 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.849
 quality level of processing 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.849
 remarkable in this respect nothing 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.600

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.510
 steel 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.940
 thick enough blade overall thickness 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.150
 about 3 3 and a half millimeters for. 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.240
