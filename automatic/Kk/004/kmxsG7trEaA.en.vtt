00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 ah 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.219
 Hello everyone and I bring you a trick to 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.020
 talk to all the zombies on the map 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.449
 origins good as you are seeing we are 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.310
 in the area where you start refueling 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.800
 the first the tank is worth in the first 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.259
 station is worth just behind the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.630
 generator 2 and well I'm here in the 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.980
 tank are you going to see now what are we going to 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.600
 try to make a barrier 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.280
 and it came out a little good, look at me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.980
 I put to try and by chance then look 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 it came out and as you can see the bighead was 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.879
 that caught you know when you are 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.770
 above the tank is sought and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 well here I started to try and there I saw that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.949
 the zombie made the mistake of staying 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.809
 hooked I said here there has to be 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.210
 something and I went putting a little bit each 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.400
 more time on the right, you have to 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.720
 put as behind the panel this and 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.129
 throw a little bit to the right until the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.559
 limit is worth here I put a little bit more 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.640
 and here it is the perfect place worth 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.290
 now you are going to see that the zombies are 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 they're going to stay there in front they're going to stay 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.550
 there hooked that make a barrier 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.619
 although good the barrier is a bit 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.539
 dangerous because when they accumulate 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.770
 how many on the right side do not 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.360
 but on the part of the left 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.820
 there is always someone who reveals a little 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 and you hit some guantazo you know so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 you have to dissuade how fast you do not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.550
 you have to shoot him fast I was 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.750
 here was with the caixa is that the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.690
 truth that is going of luxury we are in the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.700
 round 11 and they still killed a shot worth 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.080
 here how they get hooked what 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.570
 there is one that escapes me and as you see 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.850
 and you have to shoot him there so 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.590
 good is not a 100% effective barrier 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.119
 but hey it may be fine 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.770
 entertained could simply as already 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.490
 I say I started to try a little and 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 when I 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.509
 and we laugh a lot here with 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.759
 the zombies and such and little else there is no more 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.229
 story you're going to see that because they stay 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.180
 hooked that there is someone who rebels 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.470
 and little better so nothing simply 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.820
 is this I hope you liked it if you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.439
 he liked to send me I like favorites and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 see you in the next video greetings to 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.710
 everyone 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.950
 I
