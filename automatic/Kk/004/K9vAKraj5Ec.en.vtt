00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
subfolder actually won't see anything so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.870 
subfolder actually won't see anything so

here so let's copy that so I'm going to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.620 
here so let's copy that so I'm going to
close<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.540> terminal<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.650> I<00:03:13.550> don't<00:03:14.300> know<00:03:14.390> why

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
close that terminal and I don't know why

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.250 
close that terminal and I don't know why

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
because if I don't do that ubuntu will

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.390 
because if I don't do that ubuntu will
say<00:03:30.020> there's<00:03:30.320> an<00:03:30.500> error<00:03:30.680> accessing<00:03:31.130> the

say there's an error accessing the

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.720 
say there's an error accessing the
device<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:32.739> don't<00:03:33.739> know<00:03:33.830> why<00:03:34.040> but<00:03:34.280> that's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
device and I don't know why but that's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.690 
device and I don't know why but that's
how<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.000> works<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.840> i<00:03:35.870> get<00:03:36.410> i<00:03:36.620> go<00:03:36.860> back<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.130> my

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
how it works so i get i go back to my

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.580 
how it works so i get i go back to my
document<00:03:38.450> folders<00:03:38.840> then<00:03:39.440> press<00:03:39.830> ctrl<00:03:40.100> L<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.590> I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
document folders then press ctrl L and I

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.890 
document folders then press ctrl L and I
have<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:44.650> like<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> big<00:03:46.070> URL<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:47.090> there<00:03:47.300> starting

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
have a like a big URL in there starting

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.030 
have a like a big URL in there starting
with<00:03:48.140> AFC

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.600 

there<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.579> go<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:53.140> I<00:03:53.379> do<00:03:53.439> at<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.860> end<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.430> at

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
there we go and if I do at the end it at

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.220 
there we go and if I do at the end it at
the<00:03:55.150> end<00:03:55.739> let's<00:03:56.739> say<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.950> would<00:03:57.489> move<00:03:57.700> into<00:03:58.230> air

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
the end let's say I would move into air

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.160 
the end let's say I would move into air
disk<00:03:59.650> pro<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.250> move<00:04:00.640> into<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.420> you<00:04:01.900> see

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
disk pro I move into that and you see

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.899 
disk pro I move into that and you see
there's<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.859> key<00:04:03.099> of<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.310> app<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:05.200> but<00:04:05.909> all

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
there's the key of the app here but all

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.710 
there's the key of the app here but all
I<00:04:06.969> see<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.870> those<00:04:08.829> that<00:04:09.340> have<00:04:09.700> implemented<00:04:10.180> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
I see is those that have implemented the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.179 
I see is those that have implemented the
shared<00:04:11.079> folder<00:04:11.370> feature<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:13.560> for<00:04:14.560> Minecraft

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:15.189 
shared folder feature but for Minecraft

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.640 
shared folder feature but for Minecraft
it's<00:04:15.519> not<00:04:16.000> implemented<00:04:16.810> by<00:04:16.959> default<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.500> don't

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
it's not implemented by default I don't

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.699 
it's not implemented by default I don't
know<00:04:17.769> why<00:04:18.009> how<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.549> does<00:04:18.759> that<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.239> anyway

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
know why how it does that but anyway

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.029 
know why how it does that but anyway
remember<00:04:20.709> i<00:04:21.009> copied<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.690> the<00:04:23.620> folder<00:04:24.009> name

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
remember i copied the the folder name

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.060 
remember i copied the the folder name
which<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.460> actually<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:25.240> application<00:04:25.960> key<00:04:26.259> so

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
which is actually the application key so

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.879 
which is actually the application key so
if<00:04:27.460> i<00:04:27.729> paste<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.360> here<00:04:28.389> which<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.620> come<00:04:30.419> Mojang

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
if i paste it here which is come Mojang

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.629 
if i paste it here which is come Mojang
minecraft<00:04:32.889> PE<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.810> i<00:04:34.810> simply<00:04:35.139> go<00:04:36.070> there<00:04:36.400> I

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
minecraft PE and i simply go there I

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.629 
minecraft PE and i simply go there I
access<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:38.050> document<00:04:38.650> folder<00:04:38.800> anyway<00:04:39.370> even

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
access that document folder anyway even

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.330 
access that document folder anyway even
if<00:04:39.880> it's<00:04:40.090> not<00:04:40.240> listed<00:04:40.539> by<00:04:40.870> default<00:04:41.259> and<00:04:41.500> if<00:04:42.190> I

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
if it's not listed by default and if I

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.730 
if it's not listed by default and if I
drill<00:04:42.849> down<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:44.699> end<00:04:45.699> up<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.270> minecraft<00:04:47.110> worlds

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
drill down I end up in minecraft worlds

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.980 
drill down I end up in minecraft worlds
and<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:49.120> can<00:04:49.389> see<00:04:49.720> all<00:04:49.930> my<00:04:50.910> mind<00:04:51.910> maps<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.599> did

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
and you can see all my mind maps I did

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.370 
and you can see all my mind maps I did
in<00:04:53.259> Minecraft<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:55.030> could<00:04:55.240> use<00:04:55.449> like<00:04:55.599> all

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
in Minecraft so I could use like all

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.689 
in Minecraft so I could use like all
kinds<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:57.990> any<00:04:58.990> application<00:04:59.740> can<00:05:00.370> be<00:05:00.400> accessed

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
kinds of any application can be accessed

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.529 
kinds of any application can be accessed
this<00:05:01.120> way<00:05:01.409> so<00:05:02.409> let's<00:05:02.680> go<00:05:02.830> back<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:04.150> have

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
this way so let's go back and I have

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.560 
this way so let's go back and I have
generated<00:05:05.699> where<00:05:06.699> is<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:07.000> again<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:09.220> my<00:05:09.570> home

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
generated where is it again in my home

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.020 
generated where is it again in my home
folder<00:05:10.900> in<00:05:11.409> the<00:05:11.590> bin<00:05:11.800> folder<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:12.490> have

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
folder in the bin folder I have

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.510 
folder in the bin folder I have
generated<00:05:13.539> a<00:05:15.090> scrip<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.960> list<00:05:17.949> all<00:05:18.190> those<00:05:19.380> I'll

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
generated a scrip to list all those I'll

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.490 
generated a scrip to list all those I'll
although<00:05:21.520> some<00:05:21.849> folders<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.599> create<00:05:23.260> some

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
although some folders and create some

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.890 
although some folders and create some
URLs<00:05:24.070> so<00:05:24.610> it's<00:05:24.729> kind<00:05:24.909> of<00:05:24.970> going<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.419> be<00:05:25.479> easier

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
URLs so it's kind of going to be easier

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
time so let's try that there we go

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.499 
time so let's try that there we go
reconnect<00:06:07.050> it<00:06:09.830> should<00:06:10.830> show<00:06:11.039> up<00:06:11.330> also<00:06:12.330> maybe

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:12.509

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
want to access one folder so let's try

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.199 
want to access one folder so let's try
that<00:06:18.649> there<00:06:19.649> we<00:06:19.830> go<00:06:20.039> so<00:06:20.369> once<00:06:20.849> you<00:06:21.059> have

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:21.209
