that<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:35.090> yeah<00:02:35.570> I<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.760> had<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.790> done<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.180> in

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
that is so yeah I think had I done it in

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.940 
that is so yeah I think had I done it in
a<00:02:38.450> different<00:02:38.630> order<00:02:38.959> because<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.500> seems<00:02:39.739> to

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
a different order because it seems to

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.820 
a different order because it seems to
have<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:41.030> same<00:02:41.230> order<00:02:42.230> I<00:02:42.260> can't<00:02:42.620> remember

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
have the same order I can't remember

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.949 
have the same order I can't remember
what<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.100> right<00:02:43.340> now<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.360> would<00:02:44.630> have<00:02:44.750> been

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
what it is right now it would have been

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.600 
what it is right now it would have been
that<00:02:45.170> looks<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.680> was<00:02:45.830> trying<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> copy<00:02:46.340> it

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
that looks like I was trying to copy it

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.800 
that looks like I was trying to copy it
but<00:02:47.239> I<00:02:47.630> must<00:02:48.530> admit<00:02:48.709> my<00:02:49.100> ignorance<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.150> did

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
collection for the orphanages she gets

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.819

tons of things for girls and she doesn't

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.100 
tons of things for girls and she doesn't
get<00:03:39.980> as<00:03:40.100> much<00:03:40.130> for<00:03:40.610> boys<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.570> was<00:03:41.720> trying<00:03:41.989> to

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
get as much for boys so I was trying to

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.530 
get as much for boys so I was trying to
think<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.380> little<00:03:42.500> bit<00:03:42.680> more<00:03:42.920> masculine<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.360> I

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
think a little bit more masculine and I

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.339 
think a little bit more masculine and I
know<00:03:44.600> my<00:03:44.959> boys<00:03:45.200> object<00:03:46.100> to<00:03:46.280> anything<00:03:46.549> that's

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
know my boys object to anything that's

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.880 
know my boys object to anything that's
matching<00:03:48.040> matching<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.569> did<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.049> one<00:03:50.109> blue

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
matching matching so I did this one blue

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.869 
matching matching so I did this one blue
with<00:03:51.249> small<00:03:51.670> maroon<00:03:52.510> stripes<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:54.609> one<00:03:54.849> I

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
with small maroon stripes and this one I

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.800 
with small maroon stripes and this one I
did<00:03:55.180> maroon<00:03:55.599> with<00:03:55.959> small<00:03:56.230> blue<00:03:57.010> stripes<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.480> I

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
did maroon with small blue stripes so I

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:07.399 
did maroon with small blue stripes so I
thought<00:03:59.109> maybe<00:04:00.389> I<00:04:01.389> think<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.049> looks<00:04:02.230> good
