00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.070
 today is a whole male of 11 years of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.710
 age 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.770
 the query is presented by bulge 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.120
 in the perineal area to the right of the 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:32.330
 defect with difficulty and complaint 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:36.290
 there is instability when palpating 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.550
 of the perineum apparently adipose tissue 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.280
 originating in the abdominal cavity 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 blood profile and plates ordered 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.059
 X-rays with contrast medium 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.340
 although rectal deviation is not shown 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.340
 perineal hernia is confirmed 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.129
 perineal hernias appear almost 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.190
 exclusively in non-castrated males of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.500
 middle or advanced age cats and females 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.830
 canines hardly present it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.320
 although any breed can be affected 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.920
 report as most affected breeds to the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 boxer boston terrier pequinÃ©s coli tech 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.620
 the bop tale and poodle 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.250
 also common among mestizos 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.980
 buzzard type dogs 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.230
 the origin of the hernia is the deterioration 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.240
 of the pelvic diaphragm with weakness 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.899
 muscular 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 several causes usually converge so that 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.229
 the atrophy or degeneration of the perineum 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.229
 take place 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.790
 among those that should be mentioned are 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.490
 the neurogenic atrophy produced by the 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.979
 lengthening of the motor nerves of 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.620
 the perineal area in patients with 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.350
 chronic constipation and tenesmus 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.530
 senile atrophy 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.500
 the atrophy of the cox musculature and already in 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.860
 cow dogs confiscated 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.980
 the myopathies produced by disorders 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.790
 androgens of sex hormones and the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.790
 prostatic pathology 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.280
 the result in any case is the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.870
 reduction in wall support 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
 rectal 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.530
 so that the terminal portion of the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 digestive tube is diverted is taken liza or 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.400
 form a diverticulum 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.280
 the ordinary ring is found 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.970
 usually lateral to the anal sphincter 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.970
 external 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.900
 the ordinary content can slip 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.250
 between the sphincter and the levator muscle 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.860
 of the anus frequently the elevator is 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.250
 atrophied and the content leaves the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.280
 abdomen 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.850
 between the anal sphincter and the muscle 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.850
 got 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.300
 the most common content in a hernia 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.430
 perineal is intestine or adipose tissue 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.590
 of abdominal origin 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.780
 as a result of the failure of the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.920
 muscle function diaphragm 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.939
 pelvic can very often be 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.739
 find the rectum laterally deviated 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.960
 constituting a flexure in the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.730
 contents of the hernia 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.840
 sometimes a circulation is formed 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.620
 rectal as a consequence of 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.620
 chronic constipation 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.920
 and it is the pressure exerted on the wall 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.360
 of the perineum by the stool retained the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.360
 that ends up producing the hernia 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.350
 the bladder or the prostate 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.980
 they can also herniate 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.590
 sometimes it is the bladder that is 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.880
 reflects and hernia other prostate 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.670
 dragging behind the bladder 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.140
 the clinical signs include 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.360
 bulge of the perineum usually 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.020
 reducible 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:31.030
 to one or both sides of the anus according to 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:35.230
 try a uni or bilateral hernia 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.200
 constipation you have very discretion 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.010
 new performance is difficult that in 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.730
 occasions alternate with diarrhea or 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.730
 fecal incontinence 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.490
 if the bladder is part of the content 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.580
 of the hernia and is in retro 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.300
 bending the clinical picture can 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.360
 aggravate when urination is impossible 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.659
 arriving to produce a roof post 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.659
 renal 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.500
 a complete diagnosis must include the 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.790
 identification of structures 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.350
 anatomies baked by radiology 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:21.250
 and rectal tract 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.040
 only then can you anticipate 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:26.050
 possible surgical problems and choose 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.460
 the most appropriate treatment for 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:33.520
 If this is the case , a 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.820
 X-ray in which we can help 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.800
 with a contrast in the urinary bladder or 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.800
 the rectum as the case may be 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.160
 the dietary and medical treatment has 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.480
 as an objective the defecation of those 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.020
 soft 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.460
 is based on combining diets rich in 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:01.120
 fiber and humid content on occasion 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.120
 accompanied by laxatives 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.480
 you should add the fork take a 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:11.280
 hormonal therapy 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.280
 this in case of prostatic hypertrophy 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.980
 according to the technique that will be used 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.040
 the cutaneous surgical incision presents 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.490
 variations 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:27.180
 for a raffia hernia or to place a 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:30.570
 mesh will suffice with a lateral incision to 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:33.180
 the anus over the ordinary bag that 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.670
 will extend longitudinally from the 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.060
 base of the tail to the ischium in ventral 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.060
 mind 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.830
 when it is necessary to perform the one 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.110
 transposition of the superficial gluteal 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:51.320
 it will be necessary to prolong the incision 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:56.000
 dorsally mind or perform a second 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.980
 incision perpendicular to the first in 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.900
 direction of the greater trochanter of the femur 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.900
 and the wing of the ileum 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.820
 the placement of a necklace is recommended 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.820
 Elizabethan after surgery 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.149
 add a soft diet 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:16.349
 Analgesics are used and 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:21.419
 anti-inflammatory 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:21.419
 antibiotic and antiseptic 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.390
 this information is important and 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:35.100
 free any pellet or bulge 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.100
 requires attention and seriousness
