00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.980
STARTS RIGHT NOW.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.170
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ANY

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.670
OTHER TEACHER OR BUS DRIVER

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.280
WOULDN'T DO.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.120
A LOCAL TEACHER DESCRIBES THE

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.290
MOMENTS A FIRE ERUPTED ON HER

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.750
SCHOOL BUS.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.220
GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.990
I'M JIM PAYNE.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.380
I'M MEREDITH McDONOUGH.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.260
THAT TEACHER WHO SUBS AS A BUS

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.560
DRIVER IS BEING DESCRIBED AS A

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.880
HERO.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.420
AMANDA OBER JOINS US LIVE

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.970
FROM DISCOVERY ACADEMY MIDDLE

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.300
SCHOOL IN LAKE ALFRED WITH MORE.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.840
AMANDA?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.240
WHEN YOU SEE THE FLAMES THAT

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.810
ENGULFED THIS SCHOOL BUS AND

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.740
ULTIMATELY DESTROYED IT, IT'S

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.280
DISTURBING TO THINK HOW CLOSE

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.510
THE 37 STUDENTS ON BOARD CAME TO

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.010
REAL HARM.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.010
BUT THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.320
THEIR SCHOOL BUS DRIVER AND TO

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.480
THE COOPERATION OF ALL THE

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.380
STUDENTS, THE ONLY THING THAT

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.090
WAS DAMAGED WAS THE SCHOOL BUS.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.620
THIS CELL PHONE VIDEO SHOWS

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.130
FLAMES SHOOTING INTO THE SKY AS

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.920
A SCHOOL BUS BURNED ON THE SIDE

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.500
OF I-4 IN DAVENPORT WEDNESDAY

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.530
MORNING.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.630
THANKS TO A QUICK THINKING BUS

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.340
DRIVER, ALL 37 KIDS ON BOARD

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.770
ESCAPED UNHARMED.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.400
WHEN EMERGENCIES HAPPEN, YOU

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.710
DON'T THINK.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.210
YOU JUST DO WHAT YOU ARE TRAINED

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.440
TO DO.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.580
AND SO THAT IS WHAT I DID.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.710
CHRISTINA BERMAN TEACHES MATH

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.880
AT DISCOVERY ACADEMY MIDDLE

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.320
SCHOOL IN LAKE AM FRED WHERE --

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.520
ALFRED WHERE SHE ALSO FILLS IN

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.190
SEVERAL DAYS A WEEK AS A BUS

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.050
DRIVER.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.960
SHE SAYS AS SHE WAS DRIVING THE

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.230
BUS ON I-4 JUST AFTER 7:00 A.M.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.360
SHE NOTICED THE ODOR OF GAS AS

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.860
WELL AS SOME SMOKE COMING FROM

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.300
THE BACK OF THE BUS.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.890
SHE IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.470
AS THE SMOKE WORSENED SHE HAD

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.270
ONLY ONE THOUGHT.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.010
JUST TAKING CARE OF THE KIDS.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.610
THEY'RE THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.740
THING.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.740
THAT'S WHAT WE DO AS TEACHERS,

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.310
EDUCATORS AND BUS DRIVERS.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.480
WE TAKE CARE OF THEM AND

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.110
EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECONDARY.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.980
BERMAN EVACUATED THE STUDENTS

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.990
THEN DIRECTED THEM TO A SPOT AS

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.250
FAR AWAY AS SHE COULD WHERE SHE

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.380
TOOK A HEAD COUNT.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.020
THE FLAMES GOT TO INTENSE THAT

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.650
TROOPERS HAD TO TEMPORARILY

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.790
CLOSE DOWN BOTH SIDES OF I-4

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.600
CAUSING A MAJOR BACK-UP.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.500
THE FLAMES WERE PRETTY BIG.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.770
11-YEAR-OLD DANIEL WAS ON THE

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.420
BUS.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.870
HE SAID WHILE THE STUDENTS WERE

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.000
CALM DURING THE EVACUATION AS

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.070
THEY WATCHED THE BUS BURN THEY

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.240
REALIZED HOW CLOSE THEY CAME TO

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.010
REAL DANGER.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.170
I WAS HAPPY OUR BUS DRIVER

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.950
DID HER JOB AND STOPPED AND GOT

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.910
US OFF THE BUS AND KEPT US SAFE.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.590
I WAS SAD.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.090
I HAD TO CALL MY MOM.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.650
AS FOR WHAT CAUSED THIS BUS

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.720
FIRE?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.490
A TROOPER SAYS IT'S SOME TYPE OF

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.030
A MECHANICAL ISSUE BUT WILL BE

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.830
UP TO A MECHANIC TO IDENTIFY THE

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.390
EXACT CAUSE.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.700
THE SCHOOL OWNS THAT BUS AND

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.600
THEY SAY IT WAS UP TO DATE WITH

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.010
ITS MONTHLY INSPECTIONS.
