hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.309 
hi I'm dr. David Hill and today we're
going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.939> be<00:00:03.060> talking<00:00:03.240> about<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.840> tix

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
going to be talking about how tix

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.330 
going to be talking about how tix
attached<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:05.190> their<00:00:05.310> hosts<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:06.420> ticks<00:00:06.960> are

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
attached to their hosts now ticks are

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.070 
attached to their hosts now ticks are
creatures<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.639> are<00:00:08.700> related<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.300> spiders

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
creatures that are related to spiders

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.110 
creatures that are related to spiders
they<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.650> six<00:00:11.010> legs<00:00:11.250> when<00:00:11.519> they're<00:00:11.670> juvenile

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
they have six legs when they're juvenile

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.419 
they have six legs when they're juvenile
and<00:00:12.389> eight<00:00:12.599> legs<00:00:12.900> when<00:00:13.200> they're<00:00:13.349> adults<00:00:13.590> but

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and eight legs when they're adults but

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.480 
and eight legs when they're adults but
unlike<00:00:14.700> spiders<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> tix<00:00:15.660> meal<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.199> your<00:00:16.949> blood

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
unlike spiders a tix meal is your blood

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.510 
unlike spiders a tix meal is your blood
so<00:00:18.240> how<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.900> taking<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.710> meal<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
so how is it taking to get that meal the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.099 
so how is it taking to get that meal the
first<00:00:20.730> thing<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> know<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.539> tix<00:00:21.779> don't

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
first thing to know is the tix don't

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.900 
first thing to know is the tix don't
have<00:00:22.350> wings<00:00:22.560> they<00:00:22.920> don't<00:00:23.100> fly<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.730> don't

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
have wings they don't fly they don't

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
have wings they don't fly they don't
jump<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.390> don't<00:00:24.570> drop<00:00:24.779> from<00:00:25.019> trees<00:00:25.320> they

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
jump they don't drop from trees they

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.650 
jump they don't drop from trees they
actually<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> brush<00:00:26.760> up<00:00:26.970> against<00:00:27.510> you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
actually have to brush up against you

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
actually have to brush up against you
and<00:00:27.689> attach<00:00:28.500> usually<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.279> legs<00:00:29.550> or

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and attach usually to your legs or

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.339 
and attach usually to your legs or
whatever<00:00:30.090> other<00:00:30.269> part<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.630> your<00:00:30.720> body<00:00:30.779> happens

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
whatever other part of your body happens

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.440 
whatever other part of your body happens
to<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.619> convenient<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.640> places<00:00:33.090> where<00:00:33.270> there's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
to be convenient so places where there's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.170 
to be convenient so places where there's
brush<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.170> tall<00:00:34.440> grass<00:00:34.890> are<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> places<00:00:35.910> were

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
brush and tall grass are the places were

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.720 
brush and tall grass are the places were
you<00:00:36.300> most<00:00:36.450> likely<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.079> encounter<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.680> tick<00:00:37.950> once

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
you most likely to encounter a tick once

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
you most likely to encounter a tick once
a<00:00:38.879> tick<00:00:39.180> senses<00:00:39.809> through<00:00:40.020> heat<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.500> carbon

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a tick senses through heat or carbon

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.330 
a tick senses through heat or carbon
dioxide<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.000> host<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.809> near<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
dioxide that a host is near then the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.160 
dioxide that a host is near then the
wait<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> right<00:00:45.120> moment<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.629> jump<00:00:45.719> onto

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
wait for the right moment to jump onto

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
wait for the right moment to jump onto
you<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.469> crawl<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.039> someplace<00:00:47.399> warm<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.539> then

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you and crawl to someplace warm and then

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
you and crawl to someplace warm and then
sink<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:50.039> right<00:00:50.309> they're<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.700> spiders

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sink that's right they're like spiders

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.810 
sink that's right they're like spiders
too<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.750> fangs<00:00:52.050> into<00:00:52.620> your<00:00:53.250> flesh<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
too little fangs into your flesh and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.479 
too little fangs into your flesh and
these<00:00:54.660> are<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.489> syringes

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
these are just like little syringes

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.849 
these are just like little syringes
designed<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.210> suck<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.600> blood<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.620> key<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
designed to suck out blood the key to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.310 
designed to suck out blood the key to
know<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.730> these<00:00:59.850> mouthparts<00:01:00.510> bend<00:01:01.079> up

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
know is that these mouthparts bend up

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
know is that these mouthparts bend up
underneath<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.789> tix<00:01:03.120> body<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> tick<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
underneath the tix body so the tick is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.590 
underneath the tix body so the tick is
sitting<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:06.000> these<00:01:06.180> little<00:01:06.360> two

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sitting there with these little two

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
sitting there with these little two
things<00:01:06.840> embedded<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> skin<00:01:07.950> now<00:01:08.670> another

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
things embedded in the skin now another

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
things embedded in the skin now another
thing<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.420> they<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.260> their<00:01:10.500> saliva

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
thing that they do is use their saliva

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.850 
thing that they do is use their saliva
to<00:01:11.580> generate<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.210> sort<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.630> cement<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to generate a sort of little cement to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
to generate a sort of little cement to
hold<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:14.760> grab<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.420> those

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
hold them on and they grab on with those

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.499 
hold them on and they grab on with those
legs<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.799> terribly<00:01:17.430> easy<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.360> get

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
legs so it's not terribly easy to get

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
legs so it's not terribly easy to get
ticks<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.159> knowing<00:01:20.159> how<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.460> tick<00:01:20.670> attaches

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
ticks off knowing how it tick attaches

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.179 
ticks off knowing how it tick attaches
however<00:01:21.630> lets<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> right<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
however lets you know the right way to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
however lets you know the right way to
get<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> tick<00:01:23.729> off<00:01:23.970> what<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.720> don't<00:01:25.229> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> do

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
get a tick off what you don't want to do

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.090 
get a tick off what you don't want to do
is<00:01:26.070> pull<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> body<00:01:27.259> straight<00:01:28.259> out<00:01:28.500> that's

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
is pull the body straight out that's

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.069 
is pull the body straight out that's
going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> leave<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.240> fangs<00:01:30.479> right

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
going to leave these little fangs right

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.050 
going to leave these little fangs right
there<00:01:31.470> inside<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.310> skin<00:01:32.579> where<00:01:32.820> they<00:01:32.939> can

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
there inside the skin where they can

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
there inside the skin where they can
cause<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> reaction<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:34.560> an<00:01:34.680> infection<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
cause a reaction or an infection the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
cause a reaction or an infection the
other<00:01:35.909> thing<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.479> want<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.869> do<00:01:36.960> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
other thing you don't want to do is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.160 
other thing you don't want to do is
squeeze<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.280> tix<00:01:38.549> abdomen<00:01:39.210> trying<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.930> get<00:01:40.049> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
squeeze the tix abdomen trying to get it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.980 
squeeze the tix abdomen trying to get it
off<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.009> tick<00:01:41.670> has<00:01:41.909> now<00:01:42.180> gotten<00:01:42.840> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
off because that tick has now gotten a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
off because that tick has now gotten a
blood<00:01:43.290> meal<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.890> blood<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.340> mixed<00:01:44.549> with<00:01:44.790> the

blood meal that blood is mixed with the
tix<00:01:45.119> saliva<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.930> any<00:01:46.170> disease<00:01:47.180> infectious
