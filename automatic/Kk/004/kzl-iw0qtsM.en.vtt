rope which I as I said I did used to use

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.920 
rope which I as I said I did used to use
it<00:01:47.189> simply<00:01:47.369> because<00:01:47.820> pantyhose<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.750> cut

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.230 
it simply because pantyhose do not cut
into<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> vine<00:01:49.549> string<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> rope<00:01:51.030> or

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
into the vine string and rope or

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.300 
into the vine string and rope or
anything<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.840> hard<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> plant<00:01:53.040> Rose

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
anything very hard as the plant Rose

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
anything very hard as the plant Rose
cuts<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> vine<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> will<00:01:54.780> kill<00:01:54.990> your

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
cuts into the vine and it will kill your

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.280 
cuts into the vine and it will kill your
vine<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.340> nylon<00:01:56.700> stretches<00:01:57.689> with<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.990> plant

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
vine but nylon stretches with the plant

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.130 
vine but nylon stretches with the plant
and<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:59.100> works<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.210> better<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.930> top

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
and it works so much better and on top

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
and it works so much better and on top
of<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:02.009> easier<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.670> handle<00:02:02.939> okay

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
of that it's much easier to handle okay

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.050 
of that it's much easier to handle okay
so<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> things<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.820> works

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so this is one of the things that works

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.559 
so this is one of the things that works
for<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:07.849> another<00:02:08.849> thing<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.239> works<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.720> me

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
for me another thing that works for me
