hi guys this is a turn G programming
card<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.540> short<00:00:04.200> video<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.710> how<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.069> set<00:00:05.580> up

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
card of short video on how you set up

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.629 
card of short video on how you set up
speed<00:00:06.660> controllers<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.680> quadcopter<00:00:09.860> or<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:13.639> Y

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
speed controllers on a quadcopter or a Y

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.390 
speed controllers on a quadcopter or a Y
UFO<00:00:15.210> type<00:00:15.480> tricopter<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.830> right<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.279> we're

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
UFO type tricopter but right now we're

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.470 
UFO type tricopter but right now we're
just<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> focus<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> quadcopter

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
just going to focus on the quadcopter

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880 
just going to focus on the quadcopter
because<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.140> people<00:00:19.350> ask<00:00:19.529> how<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.800> you

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
because a lot of people ask how do you

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.370 
because a lot of people ask how do you
set<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.880> speed<00:00:21.150> controllers<00:00:21.600> if<00:00:22.140> they're

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
set up the speed controllers if they're

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.620 
set up the speed controllers if they're
all<00:00:22.500> connected<00:00:22.800> into<00:00:23.189> one<00:00:23.340> power<00:00:23.519> source<00:00:23.880> so

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
all connected into one power source so

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.910 
all connected into one power source so
this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> real<00:00:25.410> quick

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
this is real quick

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.700 
this is real quick
basically<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.180> regular<00:00:27.750> quadcopter<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
basically all the regular quadcopter you

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.919 
basically all the regular quadcopter you
got<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.580> speed<00:00:29.849> controls<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.359> wiring

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
got for speed controls that all wiring

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.020 
got for speed controls that all wiring
together<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.920> run<00:00:32.070> off<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.460> power<00:00:32.730> source

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
together so you run off one power source

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.760 
together so you run off one power source
that<00:00:33.510> powers<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.290> doing

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
that powers all you're just doing

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.950 
that powers all you're just doing
pigtails<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> each<00:00:35.489> one<00:00:36.860> right<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
pigtails on each one right now I have

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.799 
pigtails on each one right now I have
I'm<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> do<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> right<00:00:40.649> speed<00:00:41.460> control

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
I'm going to do the right speed control

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
I'm going to do the right speed control
so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.140> already<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> speed<00:00:44.879> control

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
so I already have have the speed control

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.170 
so I already have have the speed control
hooked<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.500> card<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.070> I'll<00:00:47.670> go<00:00:47.850> ahead

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
hooked up to the card and I'll go ahead

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:58.790 
hooked up to the card and I'll go ahead
and<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.780> plug<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:56.989> soon<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> plug<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and just plug in soon as you plug in the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.250 
and just plug in soon as you plug in the
battery<00:00:59.390> the<00:01:00.390> program<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> card<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
battery the program the card is going to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
battery the program the card is going to
light<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.530> without<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:02.010> options<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.080> not

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
light up without your options so not

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.560 
light up without your options so not
like<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.320> airplane<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.070> regular<00:01:05.570> helicopter

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
like an airplane or a regular helicopter

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
like an airplane or a regular helicopter
where<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.780> got<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.080> speed<00:01:07.320> control<00:01:07.760> which<00:01:08.760> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
where you got one speed control which is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.789 
where you got one speed control which is
kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> easy<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.650> don't

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
kind of easy to do so in here you don't

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
kind of easy to do so in here you don't
have<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> worry<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.810> soldering

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
have to worry about soldering

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
have to worry about soldering
unsoldering<00:01:13.500> any<00:01:13.680> wires<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.810> disconnect

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
unsoldering any wires just disconnect

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
unsoldering any wires just disconnect
all<00:01:16.020> your<00:01:16.619> wires<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.280> board<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.850> this

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

plug-and-play

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
plug-and-play
will<00:01:26.700> work<00:01:26.909> with<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.689> brushless

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
will work with you know brushless

will work with you know brushless
brushed<00:01:28.729> spectrum<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.060> name<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
brushed spectrum you name it

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
brushed spectrum you name it
you<00:01:31.920> should<00:01:32.100> check<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.490> quad<00:01:32.820> fire<00:01:33.030> code

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you should check it out quad fire code

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
you should check it out quad fire code
anyways<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.280> now<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.909> my

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
anyways so right now I got this is my

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.789 
anyways so right now I got this is my
settings<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.450> my<00:01:36.540> card<00:01:36.780> I'm<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
settings on my card I'm going to go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.350 
settings on my card I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.159> change<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.610> couple<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.240> things

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
ahead and just change a couple of things

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.649 
ahead and just change a couple of things
on<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.640> basically<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.479> those

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
on here but basically you just all those

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
on here but basically you just all those
speed<00:01:43.049> controls<00:01:43.320> your<00:01:43.439> power<00:01:43.590> right<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:43.829> but

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
speed controls your power right now but

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.700 
speed controls your power right now but
I<00:01:44.430> only<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.820> one<00:01:45.210> speed<00:01:46.020> control<00:01:46.320> at<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> time

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I only have one speed control at a time

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.300 
I only have one speed control at a time
connect<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.399> my<00:01:47.549> BC<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.240> my<00:01:48.600> card<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
connect to my BC on my card so all of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
connect to my BC on my card so all of
them<00:01:50.399> are<00:01:50.430> removed<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.329> they're<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
them are removed and they're all on the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.330 
them are removed and they're all on the
side<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.130> I'll<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:53.970> ahead<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:55.340> I'm

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
side here so I'll go ahead and just I'm

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.940 
side here so I'll go ahead and just I'm
going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.579> ahead<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.820> take<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> brake<00:01:57.210> off

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
going to go ahead and take the brake off

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
going to go ahead and take the brake off
and<00:01:58.950> I'm<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.159> update<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.320> renounce

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and I'm going to update it so renounce

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.010 
and I'm going to update it so renounce
updating<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> speed<00:02:01.979> control

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.940 

now<00:02:06.020> I'm<00:02:06.110> going<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.259> take<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.500> music<00:02:06.799> off<00:02:06.920> of

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
now I'm going to take the music off of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.410 
now I'm going to take the music off of
three<00:02:07.310> of<00:02:07.399> these<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.640> only<00:02:07.729> have<00:02:07.939> one<00:02:08.149> speed

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
three of these and only have one speed

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.690 
three of these and only have one speed
control<00:02:08.660> around<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.929> music<00:02:09.369> that<00:02:10.369> way<00:02:10.489> just

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
control around the music that way just

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.020 
control around the music that way just
eliminates<00:02:11.390> any<00:02:11.510> better<00:02:11.840> usage<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.459> then

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
eliminates any better usage so and then

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.660 
eliminates any better usage so and then
I'll<00:02:14.180> go<00:02:14.330> down<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:17.500> music<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:18.890> passed<00:02:19.519> it
