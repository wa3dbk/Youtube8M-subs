00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
learn crank lips flat but without a hop

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:10.839 
learn crank lips flat but without a hop
I'll<00:01:57.500> do<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:57.829> couple<00:01:58.130> examples

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.860 

you're<00:02:11.849> gonna<00:02:11.939> want<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.239> make<00:02:12.329> sure<00:02:12.629> you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you're gonna want to make sure you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.110 
you're gonna want to make sure you
always<00:02:13.019> keep<00:02:13.319> your<00:02:13.530> eyes<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.519> pedals<00:02:14.879> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
always keep your eyes on the pedals to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.410 
always keep your eyes on the pedals to
know<00:02:15.810> when<00:02:16.049> to<00:02:16.079> land<00:02:16.439> and<00:02:17.340> make<00:02:17.670> sure<00:02:17.879> that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
know when to land and make sure that

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.179 
know when to land and make sure that
your<00:02:18.599> front<00:02:18.900> foot<00:02:19.079> always<00:02:19.500> lands<00:02:19.920> first

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
your front foot always lands first

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.690 
your front foot always lands first
that's<00:02:20.939> gonna<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.329> pretty<00:02:21.900> much<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.099> key<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
that's gonna be pretty much the key to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.309 
that's gonna be pretty much the key to
not<00:02:23.849> getting<00:02:24.629> or<00:02:24.840> anything<00:02:25.049> like

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
not getting or anything like

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.039 
not getting or anything like
that<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:26.000> make<00:02:27.000> sure<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.390> front<00:02:27.599> foot<00:02:27.840> always

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
that so make sure your front foot always

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.670 
that so make sure your front foot always
lands<00:02:28.470> first<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.890> then<00:02:29.069> your<00:02:29.220> back<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:31.590> now

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
lands first and then your back so now

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
lands first and then your back so now
once<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.099> get<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.459> those<00:02:32.819> down<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.480> dialed

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
once you get that those down and dialed

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.640 
once you get that those down and dialed
it's<00:02:34.950> gonna<00:02:35.069> time<00:02:35.609> to<00:02:35.849> do<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.450> hop<00:02:37.140> crank<00:02:37.439> flip

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
it's gonna time to do a hop crank flip

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.339 
it's gonna time to do a hop crank flip
so<00:02:37.859> pretty<00:02:38.129> much<00:02:38.359> it's<00:02:39.359> pretty<00:02:39.689> much<00:02:39.810> similar

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
so pretty much it's pretty much similar

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.009 
so pretty much it's pretty much similar
to<00:02:40.379> doing<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.010> crank<00:02:41.970> lips<00:02:42.209> without<00:02:42.420> hopping

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
to doing a crank lips without hopping

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.930 
to doing a crank lips without hopping
