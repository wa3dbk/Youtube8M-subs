going down across my hair because the

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.449 
going down across my hair because the
force<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.200> water<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.650> what<00:02:21.680> will<00:02:21.950> wash<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
force of the water is what will wash the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.430 
force of the water is what will wash the
conditioner<00:02:23.090> out<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> don't<00:02:23.959> have

every single camera that meticulously

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.949 
every single camera that meticulously
takes<00:03:41.180> me<00:03:41.650> probably<00:03:42.650> in<00:03:43.069> about<00:03:43.579> 15-20<00:03:44.359> minutes

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
takes me probably in about 15-20 minutes

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.099 
takes me probably in about 15-20 minutes

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.730 
moisture mist and let it air dry once
again<00:05:34.699> so<00:05:35.419> my<00:05:35.570> hair<00:05:35.750> when<00:05:36.229> it's<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.560> weave

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
again so my hair when it's in the weave

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.490 
again so my hair when it's in the weave
is<00:05:37.009> protected<00:05:37.520> from<00:05:37.639> heat<00:05:38.000> it's<00:05:38.720> protected

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
is protected from heat it's protected

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.279 
is protected from heat it's protected
from<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:40.550> elements<00:05:40.759> such<00:05:41.360> as<00:05:41.389> the<00:05:41.659> cords<00:05:42.139> it

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
from the elements such as the cords it

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.469 
from the elements such as the cords it
she's<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.500> wind<00:05:42.860> and<00:05:43.340> it's<00:05:44.060> still<00:05:44.300> getting

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
she's the wind and it's still getting

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.460 
she's the wind and it's still getting
its<00:05:44.810> nutrients<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:46.009> moisture<00:05:46.460> so<00:05:47.470> hopefully

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
its nutrients and moisture so hopefully

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.020 
its nutrients and moisture so hopefully
at<00:05:48.530> some<00:05:48.590> point<00:05:48.949> in<00:05:49.070> time<00:05:49.099> you'll<00:05:49.520> see<00:05:49.729> me<00:05:49.909> when

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
at some point in time you'll see me when

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.879 
at some point in time you'll see me when
I<00:05:50.060> take<00:05:50.300> out<00:05:50.449> this<00:05:50.570> we've<00:05:50.780> all<00:05:50.990> see<00:05:51.289> what<00:05:51.680> kind

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
I take out this we've all see what kind
