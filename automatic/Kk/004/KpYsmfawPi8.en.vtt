redness I have sallow undertones and I
have<00:03:19.949> sunspots<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:21.900> thought<00:03:22.169> I'm<00:03:22.349> going<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
have sunspots so I thought I'm going to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.170 
have sunspots so I thought I'm going to
be<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.739> perfect<00:03:23.129> candidate<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.790> see<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.060> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
be the perfect candidate to see if this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.539 
be the perfect candidate to see if this
works<00:03:24.449> because<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.040> mean<00:03:26.040> I<00:03:26.069> just<00:03:26.250> have

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
works because I mean I just have

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.369 
works because I mean I just have
discoloration<00:03:27.239> going<00:03:27.900> on

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
discoloration going on

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.189 
discoloration going on
everywhere<00:03:28.919> I<00:03:29.510> don't<00:03:30.510> think<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.019> does

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
everywhere I don't think it does

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.789 
everywhere I don't think it does
anything<00:03:31.620> for<00:03:32.069> any<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.459> that

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
anything for any of that

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.119 
anything for any of that
however<00:03:35.180> it's<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.329> nice<00:03:36.540> primer<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.500> really

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
however it's a nice primer and I really

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.339 
however it's a nice primer and I really
like<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.549> if<00:03:38.729> you<00:03:39.299> don't<00:03:39.419> like<00:03:39.599> silicone

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
like it if you don't like silicone

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.530 
like it if you don't like silicone
primers<00:03:40.979> you<00:03:41.790> might<00:03:41.940> want<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> give<00:03:42.299> this<00:03:42.419> a

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
primers you might want to give this a

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.180 
primers you might want to give this a
try<00:03:42.720> even<00:03:43.349> though<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.709> know<00:03:43.829> maybe<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.099> can

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
try even though you know maybe you can

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.800 
try even though you know maybe you can
get<00:03:44.310> your<00:03:44.400> hands<00:03:44.729> on<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.849> sample<00:03:45.389> I<00:03:45.510> know<00:03:45.569> it's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
get your hands on a sample I know it's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.949 
get your hands on a sample I know it's
expensive<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.699> feels<00:03:48.209> more<00:03:48.780> like<00:03:48.900> a

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
expensive but it feels more like a

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.430 
expensive but it feels more like a
moisturizer<00:03:49.560> when<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.099> put<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.609> and<00:03:51.440> I'm

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
moisturizer when you put it on and I'm

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.349 
moisturizer when you put it on and I'm
trying<00:03:52.500> it'll<00:03:53.129> dry<00:03:53.430> pretty<00:03:54.419> smooth<00:03:55.099> and<00:03:56.359> a

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
trying it'll dry pretty smooth and a

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.770 
trying it'll dry pretty smooth and a
slightly<00:03:58.109> bit<00:03:58.500> tacky<00:03:58.919> but<00:03:59.519> once<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.060> absorbs

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
slightly bit tacky but once it absorbs

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.960 
slightly bit tacky but once it absorbs
it's<00:04:01.019> good<00:04:01.260> now<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.590> think<00:04:01.859> maybe<00:04:02.400> because<00:04:02.669> it's

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
it's good now I think maybe because it's

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.789 
it's good now I think maybe because it's
winter<00:04:03.269> my<00:04:03.510> skin's<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:03.900> dry<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.349> think<00:04:04.680> it

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
winter my skin's a little dry I think it

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.659 
winter my skin's a little dry I think it
absorbs<00:04:05.579> pretty<00:04:06.479> quickly<00:04:06.840> in<00:04:07.229> the<00:04:07.409> skin<00:04:07.680> um<00:04:07.979> so

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
absorbs pretty quickly in the skin um so

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.890 
absorbs pretty quickly in the skin um so
you<00:04:08.759> don't<00:04:08.909> have<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.090> wait<00:04:09.299> awhile<00:04:09.479> and<00:04:09.780> it's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050 
you don't have to wait awhile and it's

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
rubbed it in enough excuse me the

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.960 
rubbed it in enough excuse me the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
you know I always feel like silicone

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.560 
you know I always feel like silicone
always<00:04:21.310> still<00:04:21.519> feels<00:04:21.790> like<00:04:21.910> it's<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:22.240> my<00:04:22.390> face

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
always still feels like it's on my face

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.230 
always still feels like it's on my face
like<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.990> never<00:04:23.140> absorbs<00:04:23.890> enough<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.850> know<00:04:25.000> so

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
like it never absorbs enough you know so

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640 
like it never absorbs enough you know so
sometimes<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.690> hide<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.050> off<00:04:26.170> with<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.440> tissue

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650

that it made brighten out a little but

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.790 
that it made brighten out a little but
maybe<00:04:58.660> just<00:04:58.990> because<00:04:59.140> I'm<00:04:59.410> putting<00:04:59.620> on

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
you know and it's reflecting the light a

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.020 
you know and it's reflecting the light a
little<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.150> it's<00:05:04.450> not<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:06.700> didn't<00:05:06.970> change

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
little but it's not it didn't change

little but it's not it didn't change
anything<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:08.320> thought<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.860> know<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:08.980> might<00:05:09.340> see

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
anything I thought you know I might see

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.360 
anything I thought you know I might see
a<00:05:10.419> difference<00:05:11.230> in<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.500> appearance<00:05:11.950> of

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
a difference in the appearance of

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.220 
a difference in the appearance of
anything<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:13.450> know<00:05:13.540> I'm<00:05:13.690> looking<00:05:13.960> at<00:05:14.050> my

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
anything you know I'm looking at my

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.920 
anything you know I'm looking at my
forehead<00:05:14.620> cheeks<00:05:15.340> anything<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:16.090> didn't<00:05:16.720> see

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
forehead cheeks anything I didn't see

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.620 
forehead cheeks anything I didn't see
that<00:05:17.140> at<00:05:17.320> all<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:18.610> as<00:05:18.730> far<00:05:18.940> as<00:05:19.000> all<00:05:19.360> those

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
that at all so as far as all those

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.350 
that at all so as far as all those
claims<00:05:20.140> it<00:05:20.950> didn't<00:05:21.310> really<00:05:21.430> happen<00:05:21.760> for<00:05:21.970> me

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
claims it didn't really happen for me

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.230 
claims it didn't really happen for me
but<00:05:23.020> as<00:05:23.140> far<00:05:23.169> as<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.530> primer<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.430> think<00:05:25.120> it's

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
but as far as a primer I think it's

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.050 
but as far as a primer I think it's
fantastic<00:05:25.419> I<00:05:26.230> really<00:05:26.260> like<00:05:26.860> it<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.400> even

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
fantastic I really like it and even

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.950 
fantastic I really like it and even
though<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.480> is<00:05:28.860> $36<00:05:29.860> for<00:05:29.890> one<00:05:30.220> ounce<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:31.690> need

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
though it is $36 for one ounce you need

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.320 
though it is $36 for one ounce you need
a<00:05:31.990> very<00:05:32.530> tiny<00:05:32.830> amount<00:05:32.980> that<00:05:33.460> amount<00:05:34.000> you<00:05:34.090> saw

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
a very tiny amount that amount you saw

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.080 
a very tiny amount that amount you saw
me<00:05:34.479> put<00:05:34.660> on<00:05:34.750> that's<00:05:35.290> like<00:05:35.410> twice<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.760> mean<00:05:37.000> you

could<00:05:37.270> use<00:05:37.300> that<00:05:37.600> twice<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:39.550> very<00:05:40.390> little

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
could use that twice so very little

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.170 
could use that twice so very little
about<00:05:41.040> you<00:05:42.040> know<00:05:42.280> like<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.520> said<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:42.850> wrote<00:05:43.030> it
