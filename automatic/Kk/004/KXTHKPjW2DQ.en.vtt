 steady-state involve modern warfare 3 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.400

 the huawei the vests and in the end 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.540
 I ended up taking myself out 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.519
 quite 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.250
 from contradictory it helps you get 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.600
 the hand I take it out with a lot of help 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.400
 but I'm going to stop background because 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.020
 I'm going to collect all the information 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.970
 that has come out in recent days has 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.630
 been a short video that has come out 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.340
 quite a lot of images from maps of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.500
 the search when a lot of things 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.140
 that the explosion of ever although it 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.370
 I would put it now I will not be putting it and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.500
 well we go fast because maybe not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.230
 it gives me time so let's go they have already left 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.480
 a lot of images I put you first 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.290
 this map image right that says that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.600
 that's how in hollywood, yes and so 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.020
 there is a kind of plaza as well as with 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.100
 a house a luxurious house so a little 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 saw to the right 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.360
 some colors a little more alive but 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.640
 good after two photos had come out 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.950
 from the map east that is a boat or not 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.110
 hi since the one we 've seen all the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.509
 time but a boat as well as more like 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.729
 bigger more done shit I do not know how 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.409
 say it is playing with the franc here 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.830
 you see the two images as I tell you a 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.200
 boat I think it is a boat and then already 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.320
 they have left 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.670
 is 1000 down here I put the photo that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.259
 we see how the map is loading and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.840
 he says it 's in pakistan it looks like a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
 kind of nuclear power plant there with the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 cooling towers and we have to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.990
 be playing search and destroy let's 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.770
 here as the game starts they have to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 catch the bomb 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.549
 by the way they said that all this was going to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.649
 be very balanced for both 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.659
 defenders and the important ones then here 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.270
 another photo attached to the fireplace this map 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.200
 of the truth it looks pretty good and then 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.310
 another picture here I already think that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.310
 is waiting for 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.890
 I think it's an endorsement yesterday at the bottom it 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.100
 see the fireplace and then finally it has 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.229
 come out another mom called slum let's go 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.690
 here the photo as it is loading 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.690
 it appears like a plaza a saint there 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.180
 a saint there I tell you a place in the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.670
 City of Panama Republic of Panama 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.000
 you can not say many of these 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 photos and then here they have put a photo 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.450
 he nodded next to the plaza de es 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.180
 running then another one that is waiting 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.469
 is waiting to start the game 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.090
 then it is that it is here next to a 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.889
 house and then already the last one with a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.950
 gun that we see as he killed a 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.560
 uncle who had a pretty ugly emblem and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.079
 aa Equis not know what a Equis 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.269
 and there is a little yellow with the gun 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.030
 and such and such and well then also has 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.720
 come out the image is more certainly that 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.099
 I forgot they have left some images 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.470
 of statistics so for example 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.480
 let's start with this and go here 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 which is when you finish the game all 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.540
 this gives you the points that have 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.700
 so the components come out here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
 of the team and put of ordered 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.349
 ordered from the one that has gotten the most 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 score less down to the level that 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.150
 is down to the right and if you look 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.250
 puts your wins trick streak two 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.129
 victories puts you that you have given 130 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.900
 points that if 100 points is worth and then what 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.760
 most interesting of all is what comes out to 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.310
 the right that puts bronze division 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.140
 they already said that the costs were going 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.750
 they entered the world of 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.959
 competitive so we see here how is 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.819
 in the bronze division let's say dilute 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.390
 has taken another photograph that is 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.180
 quite similar to similar as the luv 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.550
 and the previous room that are there waiting 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.050
 looking for players I think it's the way 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.870
 of game agree and then here to 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.510
 right below the side of the shield 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:53.310
 of this green with the other sticks that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:56.310
 if you look at world live as a league 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.500
 world of whites toshiaki and down to the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.900
 left produces bronze division 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.700
 rank 1 so I want to tell you that it's 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.060
 to have many levels of white being 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.660
 competitive a lot of things that we're going 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.420
 to classify the levels and everything 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.420
 that and when finally last then good 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.010
 yesterday the typical explosion of the 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.400
 ship 'don always had to have a 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.400
 expression 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.780
 25 - we live here the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.759
 the video that was very handsome exploits the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.560
 expansive wave that generates the truth I 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:35.099
 love how they have put this point like this 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.199
 as with more more vivid colors and if 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.449
 we see in slow motion again we see that 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.669
 there in the background there is a dome and the 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.620
 and exploding out of that dome look 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.449
 fix is ​​with the help of something from the 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.060
 dome and I get the blast wave me 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.580
 it seems like a pass and then the last 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.830
 the last thing that came out was for 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.160
 talk 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.710
 talking an incredible speed last 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.720
 has been the search how is it going to do 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.050
 blank because it moves apart from that what 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.970
 they did and I was not with the people that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.040
 he lived in our same region so that 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.540
 the connection was better but I think that 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.830
 what they have done in whites 2 is the most 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.630
 successful they could have done that is 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.890
 that they will search by ping by connection 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.420
 by latency or basically the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.460
 connection that we have will put us with 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.610
 people that we have better connection if 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.170
 we have 100 megabytes and we have 10 to 10 of 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.590
 pin for example the ping is the most 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.780
 important to play he said that who 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.169
 let's continue ping before seeing rooms 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.389
 to the enemies and there is much better 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.999
 Well, he's going to put us with people who have 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:38.979
 our same pin and so we're always going to 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.659
 be playing with people who have this 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.340
 same profession and will not see well one 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.080
 more than everything that you do not see here as 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.999
 There was a little sign to finish and I say 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.860
 please I have one left for soul in 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.629
 I really did not know if the virgin appears 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.870
 here on the left the most and give me the 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:51.870
 fashion 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:06.799
 can not explode but I'm saying 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:09.409
 thank goodness and turkey that I have of the few 

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:12.619
 times I have good word appeared 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.929
 here comes my last low as he killed him and 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.189
 well we are going to learn in this mix 

00:06:14.929 --> 00:06:18.799
 how much help I hope you liked it 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.379
 this video in which I have shown you a 

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:24.049
 million things what you liked to 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:27.249
 the favorite extras and we do in the 

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:27.249
 next video goodbye 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.630
 s 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.860
 I do not want 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.860
 before 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:12.340
 I do not want 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.340
 to my mind
