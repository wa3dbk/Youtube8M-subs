00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
see the open tread pattern is greatly

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.390 
see the open tread pattern is greatly
improved<00:00:22.089> if<00:00:22.779> I<00:00:23.289> want<00:00:23.439> to<00:00:23.529> do<00:00:23.650> any<00:00:23.859> kind<00:00:24.279> of

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
improved if I want to do any kind of

gravel hard pack loose I think the the

you can see there's kind of a chevron
pattern<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.930> is<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.260> direction<00:00:50.680> of<00:00:50.920> travel

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
pattern this is the direction of travel

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.980

it points in the direction of the travel
and<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:54.100> can<00:00:54.250> see<00:00:54.490> that<00:00:54.700> on<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> sidewall<00:00:55.950> so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
and you can see that on the sidewall so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.800 
and you can see that on the sidewall so
I'll<00:00:57.250> be<00:00:57.400> sure<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.820> pay<00:00:57.940> attention<00:00:57.970> when<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.630> do

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
I'll be sure to pay attention when I do

get these installed I did get these in
the<00:01:03.940> original<00:01:04.930> stock<00:01:05.320> sizes<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.690> 137<00:01:07.690> a12<00:01:08.140> for

looking<00:01:16.960> at<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.470> load<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.580> speed<00:01:18.700> rating<00:01:19.920> 56

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
looking at the load and speed rating 56

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.070 
looking at the load and speed rating 56
J<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.640> 56<00:01:22.390> corresponds<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.270> load<00:01:25.630> rating

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
J the 56 corresponds to the load rating

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.530 
J the 56 corresponds to the load rating
and<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.860> was<00:01:27.040> almost<00:01:27.490> 500<00:01:28.210> pounds<00:01:28.900> per<00:01:29.290> tire

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and it was almost 500 pounds per tire

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380 
and it was almost 500 pounds per tire
which<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.680> pretty<00:01:32.680> ample<00:01:33.159> for<00:01:33.430> what<00:01:34.150> I'll<00:01:34.270> be

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
which is pretty ample for what I'll be

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
doing the front is just a little bit

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.010 
doing the front is just a little bit
less<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.299> believe<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.720> was<00:01:37.870> in<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.170> 480<00:01:38.920> range

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
less I believe it was in the 480 range

rated my earlier research had stated

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.890 
rated my earlier research had stated
that<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.369> rating<00:01:52.060> was<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.240> little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.690> higher

that the rating was a little bit higher
for<00:01:53.530> speed<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:54.670> J<00:01:54.909> corresponds<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.960> 62<00:01:56.680> miles

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
for speed but J corresponds to 62 miles

for speed but J corresponds to 62 miles
per<00:01:57.100> hour<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.450> I'm<00:01:58.780> not<00:01:58.990> sure<00:01:59.049> what<00:01:59.500> really

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
per hour so I'm not sure what really

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.630 
per hour so I'm not sure what really
happens<00:02:00.100> after<00:02:00.520> 62<00:02:01.000> miles<00:02:01.240> per<00:02:01.360> hour

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.410 
happens after 62 miles per hour
I<00:02:02.990> hope<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.350> my<00:02:04.530> Grom<00:02:04.860> over<00:02:05.490> 62<00:02:06.000> miles<00:02:06.210> per

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.620 
hour very shortly but um my latest speed
test<00:02:09.929> had<00:02:10.770> him<00:02:10.890> going<00:02:11.069> 61<00:02:11.819> miles<00:02:12.030> per<00:02:12.240> hour<00:02:12.360> in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.230 
test had him going 61 miles per hour in
the<00:02:12.720> flats<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.350> that's<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.950> only<00:02:14.160> true<00:02:14.400> test

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the flats and that's the only true test

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.860 
the flats and that's the only true test
I'm<00:02:15.630> sure<00:02:16.080> they'll<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.470> faster<00:02:16.980> downhill<00:02:17.190> but

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
I'm sure they'll go faster downhill but

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'm sure they'll go faster downhill but
haven't<00:02:18.870> done<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.170> yet<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.970> know<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:23.610> it
