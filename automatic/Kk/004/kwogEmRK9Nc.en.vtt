you<00:00:27.810> could<00:00:27.960> fit<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.560> gallon<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> quarter<00:00:29.849> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you could fit a gallon and a quarter of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
you could fit a gallon and a quarter of
water<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:32.219> only<00:00:32.309> holds<00:00:32.790> about

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
water in it but it only holds about

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.690 
water in it but it only holds about
three<00:00:33.300> quarters<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.780> gallon<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.579> what

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
three quarters of a gallon this is what

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.440 
three quarters of a gallon this is what
I<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.940> left<00:00:36.120> after<00:00:37.879> cleaning<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> filling

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I have left after cleaning and filling

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.790 
I have left after cleaning and filling
the<00:00:39.540> tank<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> top<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.100> removable<00:00:44.550> lid

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
the tank the top of a removable lid

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.459 
the tank the top of a removable lid
right<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> take<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> off<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.230> clean

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
right there you can take it off to clean

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.880 
right there you can take it off to clean
it<00:00:49.969> or<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> hole<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it or and then the hole right there you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.229 
it or and then the hole right there you
can<00:00:53.010> use<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> feed<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> fish<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
can use out to feed the fish so it's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
can use out to feed the fish so it's
really<00:00:54.539> easy<00:00:57.050> cleaning<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.550> clean<00:00:59.550> mine

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
really easy cleaning it I clean mine

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.779 
really easy cleaning it I clean mine
like<00:01:00.059> twice<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> week<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.640> wait

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
like twice a week because if you wait

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
like twice a week because if you wait
longer<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.329> gets<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.750> grody<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> front

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
longer it gets really grody on the front

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
longer it gets really grody on the front
and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> wipe<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.320> but<00:01:07.320> if

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
and then you have to wipe it down but if

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
and then you have to wipe it down but if
you<00:01:07.500> clean<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> twice<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> week<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.760> have

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you clean it twice a week all you have

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.230 
you clean it twice a week all you have
to<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.420> empty<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.340> rinse<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> fill

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
to do is empty it rinse it out and fill

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.179 
to do is empty it rinse it out and fill
it<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:13.939> we<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.210> filtered<00:01:15.960> water<00:01:16.189> because

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
it back up we use filtered water because

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.760 
it back up we use filtered water because
we<00:01:18.060> used<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> use<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.540> tap<00:01:18.780> water<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
we used to use just tap water and we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.420 
we used to use just tap water and we
found<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.970> gets<00:01:21.150> dirtier<00:01:21.540> faster

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
found out that it gets dirtier faster

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.140 
found out that it gets dirtier faster
it's<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.670> gross<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> only<00:01:26.850> takes<00:01:27.060> about

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's really gross it only takes about

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.240 
it's really gross it only takes about
five<00:01:27.270> minutes<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:28.860> thing<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
five minutes so the only thing you have

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.270 
five minutes so the only thing you have
to<00:01:29.369> watch<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.270> batteries<00:01:31.280> it's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
to watch out for is the batteries it's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280 
to watch out for is the batteries it's
got<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.700> regular<00:01:33.150> clock<00:01:33.420> batteries<00:01:33.930> where

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
got like regular clock batteries where

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
got like regular clock batteries where
it's<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.369> an<00:01:35.579> open<00:01:35.729> battery<00:01:36.180> sitting<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it's just an open battery sitting in the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
it's just an open battery sitting in the
back<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.610> sure<00:01:38.729> not<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> get

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
back so you have to make sure not to get

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
back so you have to make sure not to get
that<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.810> biggest<00:01:43.140> drawback<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that with the biggest drawback is that

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.249 
that with the biggest drawback is that
you<00:01:44.490> can't<00:01:44.970> put<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.930> decorative

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you can't put the little decorative

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.980 
you can't put the little decorative
rocks<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:48.180> decorative<00:01:48.450> stuff<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
rocks and the decorative stuff in the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
rocks and the decorative stuff in the
bottom<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> little<00:01:49.740> castles

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
bottom you know like the little castles

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940 
bottom you know like the little castles
and<00:01:50.399> stuff<00:01:50.540> because<00:01:51.590> cleaning<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.799> have

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and stuff because cleaning it you have

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
and stuff because cleaning it you have
to<00:01:53.070> turn<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> upside<00:01:53.460> down<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:55.170> put

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to turn it upside down so you can put

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
to turn it upside down so you can put
that<00:01:55.500> stuff<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.159> it'd<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.399> big

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that stuff in there but it'd be a big

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
that stuff in there but it'd be a big
hassle<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.479> wouldn't<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.350> able<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> find

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
hassle and you wouldn't be able to find

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.170 
hassle and you wouldn't be able to find
the<00:01:58.979> or<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.399> wouldn't<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.670> able<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.820> read<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the or you wouldn't be able to read the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
the or you wouldn't be able to read the
clock<00:02:00.630> face<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:03.119> added<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.229> little<00:02:04.799> floating

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
clock face I added a little floating

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.559 
clock face I added a little floating
tree

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
tree

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.930 
tree
up<00:02:08.569> top<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.140> just<00:02:09.170> floats<00:02:09.530> there<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.979> couple
