pyro<00:02:44.959> vore<00:02:45.350> I<00:02:45.650> bought<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.130> kind<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> see

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
pyro vore I bought one just kind of see

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.800 
pyro vore I bought one just kind of see
what<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.030> was<00:02:47.150> all<00:02:47.269> about<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:50.780> really

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
what that was all about not not really

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.190 
what that was all about not not really
making<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.860> not<00:02:52.160> making<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.640> cut<00:02:52.750> hi<00:02:53.750> report

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
called shrikes now and just in case we

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.000 
called shrikes now and just in case we
needed<00:03:09.170> them<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:10.480> here<00:03:11.480> we<00:03:11.510> go<00:03:11.630> here's<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.470> PS

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
needed them and here we go here's the PS

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.910 
needed them and here we go here's the PS
the<00:03:13.250> resistance<00:03:13.790> for<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.239> day<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
the resistance for the day this is the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.060 
the resistance for the day this is the
harpy<00:03:16.519> conversion<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.600> did<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.799> I<00:03:18.890> take

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
harpy conversion that we did and I take

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.099 
harpy conversion that we did and I take
still<00:03:19.370> pictures<00:03:19.670> later<00:03:20.030> let's<00:03:20.329> take<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.900> look

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
still pictures later let's take a look

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.259 
still pictures later let's take a look
at<00:03:21.200> what<00:03:21.320> that<00:03:21.350> looks<00:03:21.470> like<00:03:21.709> now<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.609> a<00:03:22.730> 60

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
at what that looks like now this is a 60

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.830 
at what that looks like now this is a 60
so<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.750> quite<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.049> substantive<00:03:24.709> figure<00:03:25.280> as

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
so this is quite a substantive figure as

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.699 
so this is quite a substantive figure as
beef<00:03:26.840> it's<00:03:27.170> something<00:03:28.160> with<00:03:28.400> as<00:03:29.239> many<00:03:30.109> wounds

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
beef it's something with as many wounds

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.880 
beef it's something with as many wounds
and<00:03:30.890> high<00:03:31.160> toughness<00:03:31.489> as<00:03:31.820> this<00:03:32.060> has<00:03:33.019> so<00:03:33.440> has

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
and high toughness as this has so has

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.150 
and high toughness as this has so has
this<00:03:34.070> long<00:03:34.340> tail<00:03:35.079> now<00:03:36.079> this<00:03:36.260> one's<00:03:36.470> dragging<00:03:37.070> a

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
this long tail now this one's dragging a

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.349 
this long tail now this one's dragging a
little<00:03:37.190> bit<00:03:37.489> which<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.790> think<00:03:38.000> looks<00:03:38.030> great

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
little bit which I think looks great

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.449 
little bit which I think looks great
that's<00:03:38.660> also<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:38.989> function<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:39.799> kind<00:03:40.340> of

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
that's also a function of this kind of

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.690 
that's also a function of this kind of
not<00:03:40.970> being<00:03:41.239> tilted<00:03:41.620> right<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.549> could

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
not being tilted right but it could

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.160 
not being tilted right but it could
definitely<00:03:43.910> be<00:03:44.209> done<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.840> was<00:03:44.959> more

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
definitely be done so it was more

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.229 
definitely be done so it was more
arrow-straight<00:03:45.739> I<00:03:46.070> kind<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.370> like<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.609> this

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
arrow-straight I kind of like it this

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.860 
arrow-straight I kind of like it this
way<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:48.859> Trigon<00:03:49.519> body<00:03:49.870> Trigon

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
way and this is a Trigon body Trigon

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.900 
way and this is a Trigon body Trigon
head<00:03:51.109> it's<00:03:51.260> got<00:03:51.410> all<00:03:51.590> appropriate<00:03:52.190> armament

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
head it's got all appropriate armament

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.449 
head it's got all appropriate armament
we<00:03:53.720> took<00:03:53.840> these<00:03:53.989> Balrog<00:03:54.620> wings<00:03:54.920> these<00:03:55.190> have

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
we took these Balrog wings these have

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.590 
we took these Balrog wings these have
been<00:03:55.609> curved<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.310> shaped<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.579> fit<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.450> body

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
been curved and shaped to fit the body

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.080 
been curved and shaped to fit the body
so<00:04:00.109> that's<00:04:00.380> looking<00:04:00.799> good<00:04:00.980> and<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:01.940> been

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
so that's looking good and it's been

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.890 
so that's looking good and it's been
given<00:04:02.390> tyranid<00:04:02.930> type<00:04:03.410> talons<00:04:04.250> here<00:04:05.150> now<00:04:05.690> on

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
given tyranid type talons here now on

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.220 
given tyranid type talons here now on

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the bottom in the groin region it has

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.599 
the bottom in the groin region it has

spore sack launchers and also the camera

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.789 
spore sack launchers and also the camera

went to the hardware store and got epoxy

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.900 
went to the hardware store and got epoxy
glue<00:05:33.120> which<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.800> worst<00:05:35.070> thing<00:05:35.550> you<00:05:35.730> could

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
glue which is the worst thing you could

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.560 
glue which is the worst thing you could
possibly<00:05:35.940> buy<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:37.430> so<00:05:38.430> that<00:05:38.610> that<00:05:39.150> was<00:05:39.300> really

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
possibly buy and so that that was really

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.480 
possibly buy and so that that was really
tough<00:05:39.780> but<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.320> did<00:05:40.620> manage<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.130> get<00:05:41.250> them<00:05:41.370> all

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
tough but I did manage to get them all

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.969 
tough but I did manage to get them all
together<00:05:41.669> with<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.300> and<00:05:42.720> once<00:05:43.440> it<00:05:43.590> was<00:05:43.680> dried

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
together with that and once it was dried

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.219 
together with that and once it was dried
it<00:05:44.160> worked<00:05:44.340> great<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:45.390> anyway<00:05:45.660> hope<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.050> got

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
it worked great so anyway hope you got
