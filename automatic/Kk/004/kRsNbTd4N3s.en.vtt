00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.580
 good we went to do our 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.389
 exfoliating the first thing we did 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.360
 when we took the zero was to mix 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.000
 glycerin with broccoli and pork loin and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.099
 then we filter everything press 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.039
 on the one hand we have had our 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:28.039
 zero and on the other hand we had one 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.840
 bunch of pressed half pulp is not a 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:34.550
 broccoli pulp from 0 side already to that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.920
 same what we are going to do is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.670
 transform it into an exfoliant what 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.190
 we do first is to place him 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.920
 a little aloe vera in this case I would 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.539
 I added about three or four tablespoons 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.839
 this is going to make our exfoliant 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.760
 apart we have have components that 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.170
 they help us to regenerate the skin because 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.869
 obviously we are going to be eliminating 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.329
 the old skin and we generate a bit of 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.579
 irritation and then what we do is 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.640
 more or less based on the amount that 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.630
 we have pulp we add as a 70 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.830
 extra percent of salt in this case if 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.509
 we have 100 grams of broccoli pulp 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.929
 with glycerin what we do is 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.360
 add about 70 grams of salt salt 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.890
 fine and also if you want you can sugar 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.860
 but I prefer salt because it makes 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.009
 the product remains on its own and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.659
 you beat mixtures and in the end what you do 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.479
 is to add the oil droplets 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.330
 essential eucalyptus me in this case 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.870
 place as 5 or 6 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.610
 droplets per 50 grams of product 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.430
 and there we have our exfoliating 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.540
 truth is that this product lasts a lot 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.290
 months I have it many more or less 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.870
 about 78 months is not spoiled because 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.300
 how it has glycerin and has the salt 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.660
 are part of the essential oil of 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.000
 eucalyptus remain alone the 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.680
 essential oil you can replace the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.170
 eucalyptus on the other the truth that I 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.250
 like the eucalyptus because it covers very well 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.720
 the aroma of broccoli and apart that helps 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.640
 to activate circulation and also how 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 It does not have an antibacterial effect 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 well there we have our exfoliating 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 broccoli then what we do is 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.380
 sanitizing a container with a little 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.840
 spray with alcohol and simply 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.670
 we pack and do not forget to also label 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.040
 so they know after a while that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.080
 is what I had in that pot the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.630
 I recommend using it in the shower when not 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 you are bathing is very light easy to 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.410
 apply and then with the same water of 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.410
 shower and rinse
