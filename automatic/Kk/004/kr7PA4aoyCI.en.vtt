00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.550
 Hello everyone, we do not see rus 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 and today we do not deliver to our attention 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.040
 3 lego exchange and I spoil anyone 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.829
 The author of the regulations that I showed 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.349
 September 24, 2013 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.869
 so after a while I him 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.450
 remembered and understood that this heading already 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.500
 long time not engaged and decided it 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 remember about and that's actually created 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.720
 your third league exchange and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.700
 but this time he is serviceable but 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.280
 the only negative that I had mood 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.900
 only for Russians unfortunately for 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.540
 residents of other countries 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.470
 I have not shat him yet and so well 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.170
 actually what is he like 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.300
 represents , firstly, we have a lever 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.610
 in by clicking on which we will 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.579
 get some money out of this one 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 a big hole like that is also here 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:13.329
 there is a coin acceptor and of course the bank 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.149
 design is yellow blue but let's 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:21.939
 we will try it one let's say 20 tenge 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.479
 insert and as we see they will 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.479
 rogers 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.740
 they will burst endlessly therefore 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.270
 this useless project was not in the past 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.910
 and a mini-hotel so I decided it 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 add and I decided not to do two 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.760
 holes because this is too 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.930
 it will look poor and so it works 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.630
 we have 5 rubles by the way 1 ruble too 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.380
 will give birth to what he has now is not what 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.440
 we make 5 rubles 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.250
 forcing and as you see us fell 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.450
 I have 10 tenge 5 for five whole days 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.680
 pieces but they can be replaced with one ruble in 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.510
 This falls 5 rubles that is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.690
 accordingly we will exchange money here 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.490
 he works for me twice for 5 rubles 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.790
 no longer they have in the bank and 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.430
 as you see they appeared in our banks 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.020
 so we can calmly get but 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.510
 let's try change again 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.010
 take the same 5 rubles 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.930
 give it back by the way is still embarrassing to press 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:42.080
 Nothing produces and who does nothing 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:46.940
 falls out and as we see us again fell out 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.459
 again ordinary coins this time I have 5 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.050
 tenge pipe view and so they me 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.540
 lost and I decided to replace 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.690
 Kazakh coins but nothing 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.420
 scary there you can put 5 kopecks 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.110
 1 ruble and it will work precisely 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.790
 correct it does not work twice but 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.790
 if you increase it on top there will 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.140
 work a lot more so again here 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.140
 our five rubles which we can take 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.140
 here 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.020
 now how do you recharge it so for 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.850
 to recharge it here from above 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.580
 we have such a block which we 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.490
 open here there is such here 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.900
 the hole in which you need to put money 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.930
 however, money must not be inserted 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:36.390
 one and so here is such a pile 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:40.990
 pile as usual bank lays here 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.760
 just take a shot and see 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.760
 so here is a little hard but gray 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:56.890
 so let's get one more and us you 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:59.170
 I will demonstrate how you see again 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:04.420
 fell again he will give exactly 5 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.400
 kopecks not to cheat and so 10 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.760
 tenge is approximately like 1 ruble 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.760
 if we put them 0 3 Jett 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.780
 what exactly is this here with me 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.810
