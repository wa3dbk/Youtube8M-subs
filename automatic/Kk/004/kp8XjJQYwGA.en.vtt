in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.170> actual<00:00:43.530> game<00:00:43.770> did<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.610> spot<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
in the actual game did not spot what is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.690 
in the actual game did not spot what is
possible<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:48.200> think<00:00:49.200> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.039> get<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
possible here I think if you get this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.270 
possible here I think if you get this
position<00:00:51.270> as<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.140> tactical<00:00:52.680> puzzle<00:00:53.100> like

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
position as a as a tactical puzzle like

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
position as a as a tactical puzzle like
here<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> maybe<00:00:56.360> more<00:00:57.360> likely<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.410> you

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
here it is maybe more likely that you

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.580 
here it is maybe more likely that you
will<00:00:59.430> yeah<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.870> actually<00:01:01.020> spot

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
will yeah that you will actually spot

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.770 
will yeah that you will actually spot
what's<00:01:01.859> possible<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.550> an<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> game<00:01:03.449> where

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
what's possible in an in a game where

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
what's possible in an in a game where
you<00:01:03.870> don't<00:01:03.899> know<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.739> there<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.100> something

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you don't know that there is something

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.590 
you don't know that there is something
concrete<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> even<00:01:08.820> more<00:01:08.850> more

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
concrete going on this is even more more

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.250

at the position but the big issue is of
course<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.310> need<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.520> look<00:02:31.820> at<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
course we need to look at the the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900 
course we need to look at the the
capture<00:02:33.020> black<00:02:33.200> really<00:02:33.650> has<00:02:34.490> no<00:02:34.760> alternative

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
capture black really has no alternative

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.460 
capture black really has no alternative
black<00:02:35.810> takes<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.970> what<00:02:37.970> is<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.330> point<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.990> all

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
black takes and what is the point of all

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.070 
black takes and what is the point of all
of<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.800> if<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.730> take<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.270> f5<00:02:41.690> black

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
of that if you just take on f5 black

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.800 
of that if you just take on f5 black
recaptures<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.010> we<00:02:43.130> have<00:02:43.310> no<00:02:43.810> promising

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
recaptures and we have no promising

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.930 
recaptures and we have no promising
continuation<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.280> what<00:02:47.090> about<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:48.760> look<00:02:49.760> at

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
continuation but what about this look at

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.930 
continuation but what about this look at
form<00:02:51.790> hmm

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
form hmm

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.410 
form hmm
now<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:53.810> are<00:02:54.140> quite<00:02:55.040> clearly<00:02:55.490> threatening<00:02:56.240> to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
now we are quite clearly threatening to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.250 
now we are quite clearly threatening to
take<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.840> f5<00:02:57.230> with<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.830> rook<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.250> wins<00:02:59.260> yeah

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
take on f5 with the rook and wins yeah

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.250 
take on f5 with the rook and wins yeah
we<00:03:00.470> are<00:03:00.590> winning<00:03:00.770> material<00:03:01.130> then<00:03:01.790> yeah<00:03:02.720> what

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
we are winning material then yeah what

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.100 
we are winning material then yeah what
responses<00:03:04.070> does<00:03:04.520> black<00:03:04.820> have<00:03:04.850> he<00:03:05.420> needs<00:03:05.930> to

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
responses does black have he needs to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.810 
responses does black have he needs to
move<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.440> king<00:03:06.650> that's<00:03:06.890> pretty<00:03:07.250> much<00:03:07.460> clear

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
move the king that's pretty much clear

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.410 
move the king that's pretty much clear
so<00:03:08.690> if<00:03:08.960> we<00:03:09.170> start<00:03:09.500> with<00:03:09.710> this<00:03:10.240> we<00:03:11.240> have<00:03:11.390> a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
so if we start with this we have a

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.750 
so if we start with this we have a
pretty<00:03:12.320> simple<00:03:12.650> move<00:03:13.100> that<00:03:13.490> I<00:03:14.920> guess<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.130> is

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
pretty simple move that I guess this is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.500 
pretty simple move that I guess this is
within<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:19.070> abilities<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.550> most<00:03:19.940> players<00:03:20.239> to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
within the abilities of most players to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.880 
within the abilities of most players to
see<00:03:20.720> g-form<00:03:21.290> picking<00:03:22.010> up<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.370> piece<00:03:22.580> due<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
see g-form picking up a piece due to the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.560 
see g-form picking up a piece due to the
pin<00:03:24.890> on<00:03:25.070> their<00:03:25.250> phone<00:03:26.200> however<00:03:28.540> what<00:03:29.540> about

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
pin on their phone however what about

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.420 
pin on their phone however what about
this<00:03:30.020> move<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.120> real<00:03:32.330> problem<00:03:33.430> if

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
this move this is the real problem if

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.320 
this move this is the real problem if
you<00:03:34.489> look<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.820> this<00:03:34.970> now<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:36.459> yeah<00:03:37.459> we<00:03:37.700> can<00:03:38.150> take

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
you look at this now we yeah we can take

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.280 
you look at this now we yeah we can take
on<00:03:38.600> f5<00:03:38.989> now<00:03:39.260> but<00:03:39.650> if<00:03:39.769> we<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.100> that<00:03:40.340> that's<00:03:41.290> just

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
on f5 now but if we do that that's just

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.400 
on f5 now but if we do that that's just
putting<00:03:42.590> on<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.890> board<00:03:43.130> black<00:03:43.550> as<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> piece<00:03:44.030> up

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
putting on the board black as a piece up

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.070 
putting on the board black as a piece up
so<00:03:45.410> we<00:03:45.920> don't<00:03:46.160> really<00:03:46.340> regain<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:46.970> piece<00:03:47.390> now<00:03:47.720> by

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
so we don't really regain a piece now by

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.400 
so we don't really regain a piece now by
grabbing<00:03:48.500> on<00:03:48.620> f5<00:03:49.070> but<00:03:49.880> we<00:03:50.450> have<00:03:50.600> all<00:03:50.870> kinds<00:03:51.320> of

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
grabbing on f5 but we have all kinds of

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 
grabbing on f5 but we have all kinds of
pieces<00:03:51.620> hanging<00:03:52.010> our<00:03:52.340> Knight<00:03:52.640> hang<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.209> rook

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
pieces hanging our Knight hang the rook

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.130 
pieces hanging our Knight hang the rook
hangs<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.650> looks<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.190> failure<00:03:56.140> what

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
hangs so this looks like a failure what

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.630 
hangs so this looks like a failure what
is<00:03:57.489> what<00:03:58.489> should<00:03:58.700> why<00:03:58.880> do<00:03:59.150> now<00:03:59.470> in<00:04:00.470> fact<00:04:00.860> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
is what should why do now in fact the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.300 
is what should why do now in fact the
big<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.120> amazing<00:04:02.900> point<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.160> whole

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
big and amazing point of the whole

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.870 
big and amazing point of the whole
combination<00:04:04.640> is<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:06.500> white<00:04:06.800> now<00:04:07.100> has<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
combination is that white now has the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.199 
combination is that white now has the
great<00:04:08.180> move<00:04:08.950> g3<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.550> is<00:04:10.730> one<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:10.940> those

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
great move g3 and this is one of those

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.070 
great move g3 and this is one of those
moves<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.560> can<00:04:13.630> yeah<00:04:14.630> give<00:04:14.900> two

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
moves that you can yeah give two

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.050 
moves that you can yeah give two
exclamation<00:04:15.980> marks<00:04:16.370> with<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.700> clear

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
exclamation marks with a clear

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.479 
exclamation marks with a clear
conscience<00:04:17.770> especially<00:04:18.770> well<00:04:19.250> actually

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
conscience especially well actually

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.720 
conscience especially well actually
Bishop<00:04:20.030> f5

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
Bishop f5

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.810 
Bishop f5
the<00:04:20.820> two<00:04:21.030> exclamation<00:04:21.810> mark<00:04:22.050> move<00:04:22.350> as<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:23.610> only

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
the two exclamation mark move as it only

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.320 
the two exclamation mark move as it only
makes<00:04:24.180> sense<00:04:24.480> in<00:04:24.810> connection<00:04:25.350> with<00:04:25.380> g3<00:04:26.090> yeah

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
makes sense in connection with g3 yeah

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.530 
makes sense in connection with g3 yeah
what<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:28.080> g3<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:29.070> covers<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.700> night<00:04:29.940> and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
what is this g3 it covers the night and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.650 
what is this g3 it covers the night and
it<00:04:30.840> covers<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.260> rook<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.760> there's<00:04:33.510> nothing

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
it covers the rook so there's nothing

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.650 
it covers the rook so there's nothing
hanging<00:04:33.990> anymore<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.460> what<00:04:35.700> exactly<00:04:35.880> is<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
hanging anymore but what exactly is the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.870 
hanging anymore but what exactly is the
threat<00:04:36.960> if<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.950> look<00:04:38.160> at<00:04:38.280> it<00:04:39.620> again<00:04:40.620> here<00:04:40.920> the

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
threat if you look at it again here the

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.790 
threat if you look at it again here the
threat<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.420> fact<00:04:42.720> is<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.290> this<00:04:43.380> is<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
threat in fact is and this is the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.580 
threat in fact is and this is the
amazing<00:04:44.100> point<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:45.480> threat<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.810> white<00:04:46.290> has

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
amazing point the threat that white has

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.930 
amazing point the threat that white has
is<00:04:47.900> white<00:04:48.900> threatens<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.560> capture<00:04:50.040> on<00:04:50.190> f5<00:04:50.580> and

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
is white threatens to capture on f5 and

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.710 
is white threatens to capture on f5 and
then<00:04:51.540> play<00:04:51.810> ninety<00:04:52.260> form<00:04:52.650> and<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:54.120> regains

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
then play ninety form and this regains

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.200 
then play ninety form and this regains
the<00:04:55.220> peace<00:04:56.220> with<00:04:57.060> an<00:04:57.150> extra<00:04:57.600> form<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:58.110> boot<00:04:59.210> so

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
the peace with an extra form to boot so

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.690 
the peace with an extra form to boot so
for<00:05:00.540> example<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.170> black<00:05:01.410> plays<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> means

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
for example if black plays a means

check we have an absolute the amazing
situation<00:05:12.210> here<00:05:12.900> where<00:05:13.170> two<00:05:13.440> Knights

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
situation here where two Knights

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.420 
situation here where two Knights
completely<00:05:15.120> dominate<00:05:15.690> king<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.260> rook<00:05:16.430> yeah

completely dominate king and rook yeah

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
completely dominate king and rook yeah
black<00:05:18.030> King<00:05:18.420> has<00:05:19.140> to<00:05:19.410> move<00:05:19.650> and<00:05:19.920> then<00:05:20.490> we<00:05:20.790> are

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
black King has to move and then we are

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.510 
black King has to move and then we are
just<00:05:21.630> going<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:22.460> take<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.640> rook<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:25.520> get

to an endgame now where we are yeah I

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.820 
to an endgame now where we are yeah I
guess<00:05:29.490> winning<00:05:29.910> two<00:05:30.720> knights<00:05:30.990> on<00:05:31.290> both<00:05:31.500> sides

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
guess winning two knights on both sides

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.730 
guess winning two knights on both sides
and<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> extra<00:05:32.640> pawn<00:05:32.880> is<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.720> very<00:05:34.200> close<00:05:34.470> to

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
and the extra pawn is just very close to

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.140 
and the extra pawn is just very close to
a<00:05:34.770> win<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:37.110> always<00:05:37.470> about<00:05:37.980> winning<00:05:38.820> one

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
a win so it always about winning one
