if<00:00:04.560> you're<00:00:04.890> familiar<00:00:05.069> with<00:00:05.460> the<00:00:05.670> thoracic

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
if you're familiar with the thoracic

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.970 
if you're familiar with the thoracic
cavity<00:00:06.330> then<00:00:07.080> you'll<00:00:07.200> be<00:00:07.290> familiar<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.830> this

five six so around about here on either
side<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.559> internal<00:00:38.370> thoracic<00:00:38.670> artery

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
side then this internal thoracic artery

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
side then this internal thoracic artery
divides<00:00:39.860> divides<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> blood<00:00:41.370> vessel<00:00:41.399> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
divides divides into a blood vessel that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
divides divides into a blood vessel that
goes<00:00:41.850> around<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.780> supplies<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
goes around here and supplies the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
goes around here and supplies the
diaphragm<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> muscular<00:00:45.239> phrenic

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
diaphragm that's the muscular phrenic

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
diaphragm that's the muscular phrenic
artery<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.289> won't<00:00:46.500> worry<00:00:46.800> too<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.100> about

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
artery we won't worry too much about

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
artery we won't worry too much about
that<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> yet<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.660> internal<00:00:49.140> thoracic

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that is yet but internal thoracic

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
that is yet but internal thoracic
divides<00:00:49.800> muscular<00:00:50.399> phrenic<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
divides muscular phrenic around here and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.520 
divides muscular phrenic around here and
then<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> carries<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.710> as<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.610> superior

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
then it carries on as the superior

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
then it carries on as the superior
epigastric<00:00:55.530> artery<00:00:55.890> carries<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
epigastric artery carries on as the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.299 
epigastric artery carries on as the
superior<00:00:57.510> epigastric<00:00:58.140> artery<00:00:58.500> which<00:00:59.039> run

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
superior epigastric artery which run

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.229 
superior epigastric artery which run
down<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.789> this<00:00:59.969> direction<00:01:01.430> as<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.850> get<00:01:02.969> towards

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
down in this direction as we get towards

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.369 
down in this direction as we get towards
the<00:01:03.270> end<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> course<00:01:03.930> we're<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the end of the course we're going to

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
the end of the course we're going to
look<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> branches<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> internal

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
look at the branches of the internal

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.000 
look at the branches of the internal
iliac<00:01:06.510> artery<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.290> we'll<00:01:07.409> jump<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
iliac artery but we'll jump to that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.550 
iliac artery but we'll jump to that
quite<00:01:08.280> quickly<00:01:08.580> now<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.229> see

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
quite quickly now and here we can see

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
quite quickly now and here we can see
the<00:01:10.770> iliac<00:01:11.280> blood<00:01:11.850> vessels<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.140> iLab

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
the iliac blood vessels and the iLab

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
the iliac blood vessels and the iLab
blood<00:01:13.770> vessels<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.250> divide<00:01:14.549> into<00:01:14.820> internal

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
blood vessels will divide into internal

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.410 
blood vessels will divide into internal
external<00:01:15.659> supply<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> organs<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> pelvis

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
external supply the organs of the pelvis

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.100 
external supply the organs of the pelvis
and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.290> on<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> supply<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.810> lower<00:01:21.810> limb

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and then go on to supply the lower limb

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.359 
and then go on to supply the lower limb
but<00:01:22.710> an<00:01:22.799> important<00:01:23.340> branch<00:01:23.520> coming<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
but an important branch coming up is

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
but an important branch coming up is
inferior<00:01:26.369> epigastric<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.990> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
inferior epigastric this one here this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
inferior epigastric this one here this
inferior<00:01:29.340> epigastric<00:01:29.400> artery<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.329> running<00:01:30.930> up

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
inferior epigastric artery is running up

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
inferior epigastric artery is running up
in<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.409> direction<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> blood

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
in this direction and that's the blood

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.550 
in this direction and that's the blood
vessel<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.570> saw<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> previous<00:01:34.290> slide

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
vessel we saw on the previous slide

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
vessel we saw on the previous slide
which<00:01:35.369> we<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:35.939> running<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.630> this

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
which we can see running up in this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.609 
which we can see running up in this
direction<00:01:37.579> inferior<00:01:38.579> epigastric<00:01:39.619> inferior

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.469 
direction inferior epigastric inferior
epigastric<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.460> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> an<00:01:42.030> aster

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
epigastric is then going to an aster

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.950 
epigastric is then going to an aster
Mo's<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:43.759> superior<00:01:44.759> epigastric<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.840> that's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
Mo's with superior epigastric and that's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.600 
Mo's with superior epigastric and that's
where<00:01:46.140> these<00:01:46.229> two<00:01:46.290> arteries<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
where these two arteries are going to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.149 
where these two arteries are going to
join<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.750> join<00:01:49.079> together<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.680> form<00:01:49.860> a

join they join together to form a
complete<00:01:50.460> circuit<00:01:51.390> these<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
complete circuit these are really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
complete circuit these are really
important<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> supply<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
important as they go on to supply the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
important as they go on to supply the
muscles<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> anterolateral<00:01:55.409> abdominal
