00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
some artificial 150cc how many years

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.200 
some artificial 150cc how many years
since<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.040> was<00:01:11.220> six

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.380 

you<00:01:15.210> planned<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.520> 20<00:01:17.880> years<00:01:18.119> when

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you planned a lot and in 20 years when

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.499 
you planned a lot and in 20 years when
you<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.110> watch<00:01:19.710> back<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> will

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you will watch back you think you will

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
you will watch back you think you will
smile<00:01:21.869> much<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.650> will<00:01:22.890> smile<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.759> when<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.280 
smile much you will smile more when you
will<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.810> about<00:01:25.369> your<00:01:26.630> artist<00:01:27.630> sport<00:01:28.049> I'm

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
will think about your artist sport I'm

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.520 
will think about your artist sport I'm
your<00:01:28.829> artist<00:01:29.729> Boulder<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.509> victory<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
your artist Boulder a victory in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.730 
your artist Boulder a victory in the
World<00:01:31.799> Cup<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.329> artist<00:01:33.990> multi-pitch<00:01:34.799> I

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
World Cup or your artist multi-pitch I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.359 
World Cup or your artist multi-pitch I
think<00:01:37.970> for<00:01:38.970> me<00:01:39.229> will<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.680> hardest

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
think for me will be the hardest

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.310 
think for me will be the hardest
achievement<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:45.630> dedicate<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
achievement that I will dedicate the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.999 
achievement that I will dedicate the
most<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.340> most<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.710> probably<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> will

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
most time the most so probably it will

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.480 
most time the most so probably it will
be<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> most<00:01:50.729> poor<00:01:51.119> timing<00:01:51.450> route<00:01:51.810> or<00:01:52.280> if<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
be the most poor timing route or if I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
be the most poor timing route or if I
will<00:01:53.700> change<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.360> approach<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:55.229> might<00:01:55.560> be

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
will change the approach it might be

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
will change the approach it might be
something<00:01:56.130> different<00:01:56.640> something<00:01:57.180> longer

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
something different something longer

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770 
something different something longer
or<00:01:58.259> maybe<00:01:58.560> something<00:01:59.159> longer<00:01:59.399> but<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.450> didn't

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
or maybe something longer but you didn't

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.399 
or maybe something longer but you didn't
say<00:02:00.990> competition

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.719 

how<00:02:07.340> many<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:07.790> years<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.119> competitions<00:02:08.869> I

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
how many more years of competitions I

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.140 
how many more years of competitions I
think<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.850> will<00:02:11.030> take<00:02:12.040> one<00:02:13.040> season<00:02:13.370> comparison

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
think I will take one season comparison

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.590 
think I will take one season comparison
climbing<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.020> then<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:16.100> two<00:02:16.520> years<00:02:16.850> break<00:02:17.180> and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
climbing and then to two years break and

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.420 
climbing and then to two years break and
then<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.410> come<00:02:18.650> back<00:02:19.209> okay

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
then I think I come back okay

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.729 
then I think I come back okay
but<00:02:22.430> around<00:02:22.940> your<00:02:23.180> own<00:02:23.330> if<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:24.020> if<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.410> go<00:02:24.560> by

let's<00:02:28.850> say<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.840> many<00:02:29.930> 9a<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.489> haven't

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
let's say how many 9a so you haven't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.220 
let's say how many 9a so you haven't
find<00:02:32.060> yet<00:02:33.910> 1000<00:02:34.910> kilometres<00:02:35.209> still<00:02:35.900> quite<00:02:36.200> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
find yet 1000 kilometres still quite a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:45.970 
find yet 1000 kilometres still quite a
long<00:02:37.720> yellow<00:02:38.720> knee<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:40.300> after<00:02:41.300> 15<00:02:41.870> maybe<00:02:44.410> 15<00:02:45.410> in

long yellow knee so after 15 maybe 15 in

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.940 
long yellow knee so after 15 maybe 15 in
the<00:02:46.510> circle<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.870> circle<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:54.080> if<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.650> Drive

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
the circle of the circle but if I Drive

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.190 
the circle of the circle but if I Drive

about<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.150> if<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:51.960> bought<00:03:52.200> something

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
about it if you if you bought something

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.090 
about it if you if you bought something
put<00:03:53.280> some<00:03:53.520> work<00:03:53.730> into<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.240> and<00:03:54.390> then<00:03:54.840> freed<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.220 
put some work into it and then freed and
I<00:03:56.370> think<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.790> think<00:03:57.270> that's<00:03:58.610> reason<00:03:59.610> why<00:04:00.330> quite

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
I think I think that's reason why quite

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.090 
I think I think that's reason why quite
many<00:04:01.500> climbers<00:04:01.800> both<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.440> really

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
many climbers both because it's really

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.660 
many climbers both because it's really
something<00:04:05.760> new<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.960> gives<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.100> a<00:04:08.160> lot<00:04:08.550> of

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
something new and it gives you a lot of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.300 
something new and it gives you a lot of
motivation<00:04:09.330> for<00:04:09.570> climbing<00:04:11.990> but<00:04:12.990> still<00:04:13.350> much

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310
