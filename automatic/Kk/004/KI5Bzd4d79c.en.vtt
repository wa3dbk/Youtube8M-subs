a little different route and I found

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.550 
a little different route and I found
this<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:20.910> spot<00:00:21.480> right<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.260> found

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this little spot right here and I found

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.640 
this little spot right here and I found
that<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:23.600> license<00:00:24.600> plate<00:00:24.689> will<00:00:25.080> fit<00:00:25.289> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
nicely across the width of there so I

the<00:01:03.390> table<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.229> can<00:01:04.350> put<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> 90<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.730 

all<00:01:19.970> right<00:01:20.180> now<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:20.720> actually<00:01:21.259> fits<00:01:21.500> quite

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
all right now that actually fits quite

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.219 
all right now that actually fits quite
nicely<00:01:21.860> there<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:23.600> I've<00:01:23.689> got<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.899> couple

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
nicely there now I've got a couple

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.859 
nicely there now I've got a couple
options<00:01:24.409> here<00:01:24.880> there's<00:01:25.880> two<00:01:26.119> screws<00:01:26.450> one

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
options here there's two screws one

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.240 
options here there's two screws one
right<00:01:27.140> here<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.619> one<00:01:27.679> right<00:01:27.829> here<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.610> could

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
right here and one right here so I could

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.789 
right here and one right here so I could
bend<00:01:31.250> this<00:01:31.490> all<00:01:31.929> forward<00:01:32.929> and<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:33.500> cut<00:01:33.770> it

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
bend this all forward and then cut it

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.429 
bend this all forward and then cut it
off<00:01:34.039> the<00:01:34.880> level<00:01:35.329> here<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:35.810> then<00:01:35.929> just<00:01:36.170> screw

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
off the level here and then just screw

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.710 
off the level here and then just screw
it<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.740> top<00:01:37.069> or<00:01:37.819> I<00:01:37.850> could<00:01:38.179> bend<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.569> all

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
it to the top or I could bend it all

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
it to the top or I could bend it all
inward<00:01:39.640> except<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:40.819> two<00:01:40.970> little<00:01:41.270> tabs<00:01:41.740> where

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
inward except for two little tabs where

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.169 
inward except for two little tabs where
I<00:01:42.770> could<00:01:43.270> screw<00:01:44.270> it<00:01:44.390> in<00:01:44.569> here<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:44.959> here<00:01:46.149> or<00:01:47.149> I

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
I could screw it in here and here or I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.529 
I could screw it in here and here or I
guess<00:01:47.780> I<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.170> bend<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:48.890> drill<00:01:49.340> hole<00:01:49.700> to

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
guess I can bend it all in drill hole to

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.699 
guess I can bend it all in drill hole to
access<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.259> screws<00:01:52.030> so<00:01:53.030> I've<00:01:53.179> got<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.649> try<00:01:54.649> and

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
access the screws so I've got to try and

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.029 
access the screws so I've got to try and
think<00:01:54.920> clearly<00:01:55.159> here<00:01:55.610> what<00:01:55.789> I<00:01:55.819> want<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.090> do<00:01:56.270> I

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
think clearly here what I want to do I

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.499 
think clearly here what I want to do I
think<00:01:58.039> what<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.399> want<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.670> do<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:58.970> bend<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.360> all

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
think what I want to do is bend it all

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.350 
think what I want to do is bend it all
in<00:01:59.750> except<00:02:00.170> for<00:02:00.200> two<00:02:00.560> little<00:02:00.829> tabs<00:02:01.099> so<00:02:01.579> I'm

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
in except for two little tabs so I'm

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.109 
in except for two little tabs so I'm
going<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.539> mark<00:02:02.720> right<00:02:03.619> here<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:04.340> right<00:02:05.090> there

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
going to mark right here and right there

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.279 
going to mark right here and right there
for<00:02:05.720> where<00:02:05.840> those<00:02:06.020> two<00:02:06.289> screws<00:02:06.740> are<00:02:08.200> then<00:02:09.200> I'm

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
for where those two screws are then I'm

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.920 
for where those two screws are then I'm
going<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.470> lift<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.860> up<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.250> push<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:10.640> down

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
going to lift it up and push it down

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.319 
going to lift it up and push it down
mark<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.079> height<00:02:12.790> probably<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.819> little<00:02:14.060> bit

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
mark the height probably a little bit

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.349 
mark the height probably a little bit
tall<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.870> always<00:02:15.140> make<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:16.180> shorter<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.299> I

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
tall I can always make it shorter but I

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.559 
tall I can always make it shorter but I
can't<00:02:17.630> make<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.810> longer

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:28.899 

alright<00:02:21.640> let's<00:02:22.640> try<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:27.489> alright<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:28.549> all

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
alright let's try that alright so all

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.789 
alright let's try that alright so all
that's<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.569> get<00:02:29.719> bent<00:02:30.049> backward<00:02:30.590> just

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
that's going to get bent backward just

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.270 
that's going to get bent backward just
like<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.569> but<00:02:32.859> right<00:02:33.859> there<00:02:34.099> where

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
like this one but right there where

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.479 
like this one but right there where
those<00:02:34.400> two<00:02:34.670> lines<00:02:34.700> are<00:02:35.239> there<00:02:35.739> are<00:02:36.739> not<00:02:37.189> going

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
those two lines are there are not going

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.800 
those two lines are there are not going
to<00:02:37.549> get<00:02:37.670> bent<00:02:37.939> back<00:02:38.150> they're<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.629> get

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
to get bent back they're going to get

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.800 
to get bent back they're going to get
bent<00:02:39.079> forward<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:41.090> do<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.390> I'll<00:02:41.569> just

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
bent forward and to do that I'll just

00:02:41.810 --> 00:03:07.920 
bent forward and to do that I'll just
cut<00:02:45.370> here<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.400> here

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.820 

okay<00:03:08.930> let's<00:03:09.140> see<00:03:09.290> if<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.530> fits<00:03:09.800> in<00:03:10.010> there

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.020 

it's<00:03:15.830> going<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.070> need<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.220> be<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.460> little<00:03:16.670> bit

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
it's going to need to be a little bit

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's going to need to be a little bit
shorter<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:20.480> right<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.840> need<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:21.110> flatten

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
shorter all right so I need to flatten

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.050 
shorter all right so I need to flatten
this<00:03:21.560> back<00:03:21.860> out<00:03:22.070> and<00:03:22.280> make<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.610> little<00:03:22.790> bit

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
this back out and make it a little bit

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.000 
this back out and make it a little bit
narrower<00:03:23.890> maybe<00:03:24.890> right<00:03:25.130> about<00:03:25.250> there<00:03:26.950> how<00:03:27.950> to

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
narrower maybe right about there how to

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:51.610 
narrower maybe right about there how to
do<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.400> trick

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.050 

all<00:03:52.099> right<00:03:52.220> let's<00:03:52.640> fit<00:03:52.879> that<00:03:53.090> all<00:03:57.940> right<00:03:58.940> so

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
all right let's fit that all right so

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.400 
all right let's fit that all right so
there's<00:03:59.239> just<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.480> few<00:03:59.510> more<00:03:59.690> things<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.230> need<00:04:00.379> to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
there's just a few more things I need to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
there's just a few more things I need to
do<00:04:00.970> one<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.120> which<00:04:02.300> is<00:04:02.629> on<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.680> left<00:04:03.890> side<00:04:04.010> here

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
do one of which is on the left side here

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.729 
do one of which is on the left side here
this<00:04:04.790> little<00:04:05.060> piece<00:04:05.360> keeps<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.379> from<00:04:06.530> getting

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
this little piece keeps it from getting

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.020 
this little piece keeps it from getting
pushed<00:04:07.160> back<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.920> inside<00:04:10.340> but<00:04:10.790> on<00:04:10.819> this

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
pushed back to the inside but on this

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.970 
pushed back to the inside but on this
side<00:04:11.269> there's<00:04:12.019> nothing<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.470> keep<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.830> from

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
side there's nothing to keep it from

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.520 
side there's nothing to keep it from
getting<00:04:13.160> pushed<00:04:13.580> back<00:04:13.879> on<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.239> bottom<00:04:14.599> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
getting pushed back on the bottom the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.009 
getting pushed back on the bottom the
top<00:04:15.739> screw<00:04:16.100> will<00:04:16.220> hold<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.660> bottom<00:04:17.989> is

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
top screw will hold it but the bottom is

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.620 
top screw will hold it but the bottom is
nothing<00:04:18.470> nothing's<00:04:19.220> there<00:04:19.519> so<00:04:20.269> I<00:04:20.299> think<00:04:20.359> I'll

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
nothing nothing's there so I think I'll

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.530 
nothing nothing's there so I think I'll
just<00:04:20.660> take<00:04:20.900> a<00:04:21.490> drill<00:04:22.490> drill<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.240> hole<00:04:23.510> right

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
just take a drill drill a hole right

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.640 
just take a drill drill a hole right
here<00:04:24.020> if<00:04:24.139> I<00:04:24.290> can<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.950> then<00:04:25.940> put<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.900> short<00:04:27.320> screw

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
here if I can and then put a short screw

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.379 
here if I can and then put a short screw
in<00:04:27.860> there<00:04:28.010> just<00:04:28.280> keep<00:04:28.550> that<00:04:28.790> from<00:04:29.060> sliding

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
in there just keep that from sliding

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:37.450 
in there just keep that from sliding
back<00:04:29.540> further<00:04:35.950> all<00:04:36.950> right<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.430> just

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
back further all right I think you just

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.820 
back further all right I think you just
need<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.820> shorter<00:04:38.150> screw<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.940> not<00:04:44.060> work<00:04:44.830> and

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
need a shorter screw it's not work and

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.850 
need a shorter screw it's not work and
get<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.190> hooked<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:46.970> I<00:04:47.500> think<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.590> need<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
get it hooked in there I think I need to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.670 
get it hooked in there I think I need to
bend<00:04:49.070> this<00:04:49.280> down<00:04:49.810> more<00:04:50.810> like<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:56.560> there<00:04:57.560> we

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
bend this down more like that there we

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.800 
bend this down more like that there we
go<00:04:57.850> all<00:04:58.850> right<00:04:58.910> well<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.240> was<00:04:59.450> thinking<00:04:59.780> about

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
go all right well I was thinking about

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.050 
go all right well I was thinking about
putting<00:05:00.260> this<00:05:00.350> in<00:05:00.590> there<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.669> able<00:05:01.700> to<00:05:01.880> pull

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
putting this in there to be able to pull

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.400 
putting this in there to be able to pull
it<00:05:02.210> out<00:05:02.300> but<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.539> think<00:05:02.750> once<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.080> get<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.229> few

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
it out but I think once I get a few

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.960 
it out but I think once I get a few
switches<00:05:03.889> installed<00:05:04.280> in<00:05:04.490> there<00:05:04.669> I'll<00:05:04.789> be<00:05:04.910> able

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
switches installed in there I'll be able

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.540 
switches installed in there I'll be able
to<00:05:05.120> use<00:05:05.240> the<00:05:05.450> switches<00:05:05.860> pull<00:05:06.860> it<00:05:07.010> out<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:07.460> I'm

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
to use the switches pull it out so I'm

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.230 
to use the switches pull it out so I'm
just<00:05:07.700> going<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:07.910> work<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:09.050> holes<00:05:09.320> here<00:05:10.240> for

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
just going to work the holes here for

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:23.200 
just going to work the holes here for
the<00:05:11.330> screws<00:05:15.099> then<00:05:16.099> I'll<00:05:16.340> drill<00:05:16.639> them<00:05:16.789> out

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.040 

all<00:05:24.210> right<00:05:24.950> now<00:05:25.950> I<00:05:25.980> can<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.310> ahead<00:05:26.780> mark<00:05:27.780> these

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
all right now I can go ahead mark these

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.220 
all right now I can go ahead mark these
and<00:05:28.320> cut<00:05:28.560> them<00:05:29.180> so<00:05:30.180> that<00:05:30.390> these<00:05:30.570> tabs<00:05:30.930> aren't

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
and cut them so that these tabs aren't

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:43.040 
and cut them so that these tabs aren't
sticking<00:05:31.560> out<00:05:31.740> anymore<00:05:41.480> all<00:05:42.480> right<00:05:42.510> well<00:05:42.900> I've

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
sticking out anymore all right well I've

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.630 
sticking out anymore all right well I've
got<00:05:43.200> it<00:05:43.350> out<00:05:43.470> I<00:05:43.500> think<00:05:43.650> I'll<00:05:44.010> put<00:05:44.220> some<00:05:44.430> holes

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
got it out I think I'll put some holes

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.510 
got it out I think I'll put some holes
in<00:05:44.850> it<00:05:44.940> for<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.960> switches<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:47.160> when<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:47.310> want<00:05:47.490> to

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
in it for the switches so when I want to

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.730 
in it for the switches so when I want to
go<00:05:47.670> put<00:05:47.880> this<00:05:48.060> down<00:05:48.300> to<00:05:48.570> drill<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.960> I<00:05:49.110> noticed

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
go put this down to drill it I noticed

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.060 
go put this down to drill it I noticed
that<00:05:50.040> it's<00:05:50.460> exactly<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.180> same<00:05:51.420> width<00:05:51.660> as<00:05:51.870> a

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
that it's exactly the same width as a

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.410 
that it's exactly the same width as a
2x4<00:05:53.070> so<00:05:53.280> if<00:05:53.370> you're<00:05:53.490> doing<00:05:53.580> this<00:05:53.790> at<00:05:53.970> home<00:05:54.000> you

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
2x4 so if you're doing this at home you

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.360 
2x4 so if you're doing this at home you
might<00:05:55.260> as<00:05:55.350> well<00:05:55.410> just<00:05:55.650> start<00:05:55.890> bending<00:05:56.160> this

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
might as well just start bending this

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.670 
might as well just start bending this
around<00:05:56.700> a<00:05:56.850> 2x4<00:05:57.450> instead<00:05:58.020> of<00:05:58.110> taking<00:05:58.410> all<00:05:58.530> those

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
around a 2x4 instead of taking all those

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.620 
around a 2x4 instead of taking all those
measurements<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.640> it<00:06:00.120> looks<00:06:00.240> like<00:06:00.300> that's

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
measurements and it looks like that's

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.430 
measurements and it looks like that's
going<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.870> be<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.830> perfect<00:06:02.040> width<00:06:02.550> for<00:06:02.910> you

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
going to be the perfect width for you

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.860 
going to be the perfect width for you
all<00:06:04.440> right<00:06:04.500> so<00:06:05.190> I'm<00:06:06.090> ready<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.450> drill<00:06:06.690> some

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
all right so I'm ready to drill some

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.420 
all right so I'm ready to drill some
holes<00:06:06.900> for<00:06:07.230> the<00:06:07.440> switches<00:06:07.950> but<00:06:08.130> you<00:06:08.220> want<00:06:08.370> to

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
holes for the switches but you want to

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.820 
holes for the switches but you want to
keep<00:06:08.520> in<00:06:08.730> mind<00:06:09.000> that<00:06:09.810> sometimes<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.410> switches

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
keep in mind that sometimes the switches

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.680 
keep in mind that sometimes the switches
are<00:06:10.950> pretty<00:06:11.190> big<00:06:11.430> on<00:06:11.640> the<00:06:11.730> backside<00:06:12.210> this<00:06:12.480> one

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
are pretty big on the backside this one

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.580 
are pretty big on the backside this one
is<00:06:12.980> one<00:06:13.980> of<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.130> ones<00:06:14.310> I'm<00:06:14.520> installing<00:06:15.590> the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
is one of the ones I'm installing the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.200 
is one of the ones I'm installing the
hole<00:06:16.740> is<00:06:16.890> going<00:06:16.980> to<00:06:17.070> need<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.280> be<00:06:17.490> half-inch<00:06:17.970> on

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
hole is going to need to be half-inch on

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.780 
hole is going to need to be half-inch on
most<00:06:18.450> switches<00:06:19.230> but<00:06:20.040> you<00:06:20.430> want<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.670> make<00:06:20.760> sure

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
most switches but you want to make sure

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:26.110 
most switches but you want to make sure
that<00:06:21.120> you<00:06:21.210> have<00:06:21.360> enough<00:06:21.540> room<00:06:21.810> on<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.080> back<00:06:23.810> so

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
that you have enough room on the back so

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.900 
that you have enough room on the back so
use<00:06:27.120> my<00:06:27.300> tape<00:06:27.570> measure<00:06:27.600> here<00:06:28.200> I<00:06:28.730> don't<00:06:29.730> know

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
use my tape measure here I don't know

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.450 
use my tape measure here I don't know
how<00:06:30.000> many<00:06:30.090> switches<00:06:30.450> I'm<00:06:30.690> going<00:06:30.840> to<00:06:30.900> have

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
how many switches I'm going to have

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.140 
how many switches I'm going to have
total<00:06:32.460> but<00:06:32.670> I<00:06:33.530> could<00:06:34.530> put<00:06:34.860> them<00:06:34.920> up<00:06:35.130> high<00:06:35.760> low

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
total but I could put them up high low

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.960 
total but I could put them up high low
high<00:06:36.480> low<00:06:36.510> or<00:06:37.110> just<00:06:37.980> all<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.310> way<00:06:38.400> across<00:06:38.730> in

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
high low or just all the way across in

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.480 
high low or just all the way across in
the<00:06:39.060> middle<00:06:39.530> let's<00:06:40.530> see<00:06:40.830> how<00:06:41.070> I<00:06:41.100> want<00:06:41.310> to<00:06:41.400> do

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
the middle let's see how I want to do

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.520 
the middle let's see how I want to do
this<00:06:41.700> all<00:06:42.540> right<00:06:42.600> so<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:42.870> think<00:06:42.960> I'll<00:06:43.200> just<00:06:43.320> do<00:06:43.500> a

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
this all right so I think I'll just do a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.010 
this all right so I think I'll just do a
straight<00:06:43.890> line<00:06:44.130> of<00:06:44.370> us<00:06:44.640> which<00:06:44.910> is<00:06:45.120> one<00:06:45.870> inch

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
straight line of us which is one inch

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.690 
straight line of us which is one inch
apart<00:06:47.030> straight<00:06:48.030> across<00:06:48.270> so<00:06:49.520> that'll<00:06:50.520> give<00:06:50.670> me

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
apart straight across so that'll give me

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.380 
apart straight across so that'll give me
enough<00:06:51.030> room<00:06:51.270> for<00:06:52.490> one<00:06:53.490> I<00:06:53.520> think<00:06:53.820> eleven

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:54.390 
enough room for one I think eleven

00:06:54.390 --> 00:07:16.640 
enough room for one I think eleven
switches

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.760 

all<00:07:17.650> right<00:07:17.860> so<00:07:18.190> there<00:07:18.400> it<00:07:18.520> is

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
all right so there it is

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.980 
all right so there it is
now<00:07:20.770> I<00:07:21.099> don't<00:07:21.250> have<00:07:21.520> eleven<00:07:22.300> switches<00:07:22.720> at<00:07:22.870> the

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
now I don't have eleven switches at the

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.990 
now I don't have eleven switches at the
moment<00:07:23.379> but<00:07:23.620> I<00:07:23.680> could<00:07:23.919> buy<00:07:24.129> covers<00:07:24.610> for<00:07:24.879> these

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
moment but I could buy covers for these

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.360 
moment but I could buy covers for these
but<00:07:25.270> I<00:07:25.300> think<00:07:25.509> a<00:07:25.569> better<00:07:25.750> idea<00:07:25.870> would<00:07:26.229> be<00:07:27.190> to

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370 
but I think a better idea would be to

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.339 
but I think a better idea would be to
buy<00:07:27.729> eleven<00:07:28.270> switches<00:07:28.659> and<00:07:28.810> just<00:07:29.020> stick<00:07:29.229> them

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
buy eleven switches and just stick them

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:32.909 
buy eleven switches and just stick them
in<00:07:29.500> here<00:07:29.710> as<00:07:30.310> covers<00:07:31.620> doesn't<00:07:32.620> matter<00:07:32.740> if

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
in here as covers doesn't matter if

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.089 
in here as covers doesn't matter if
they're<00:07:33.099> not<00:07:33.220> used<00:07:33.520> or<00:07:33.789> not<00:07:33.909> I<00:07:34.590> can<00:07:35.590> also<00:07:35.710> label

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.099 
they're not used or not I can also label

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:40.999 
they're not used or not I can also label
one<00:07:36.490> ejector-seat

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.649
