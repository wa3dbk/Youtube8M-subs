00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
twigs put in front the reason why I put

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760 
twigs put in front the reason why I put
those<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.579> front<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.770> camera

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
netting it's because a lot of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.490 
netting it's because a lot of
strawberries<00:00:48.300> change<00:00:48.780> around<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.140> trees

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
strawberries change around here trees

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.530 
strawberries change around here trees
being<00:00:49.680> cut<00:00:49.739> down<00:00:49.890> lots<00:00:50.790> of<00:00:50.910> stuffs<00:00:51.149> being<00:00:51.360> cut

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
being cut down lots of stuffs being cut

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.940 
being cut down lots of stuffs being cut
back<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.500> exposed

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
back so it's a little bit more exposed

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.860 
back so it's a little bit more exposed
so<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> distance<00:00:54.210> there's<00:00:54.390> lots<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.660> dead

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so from a distance there's lots of dead

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.470 
so from a distance there's lots of dead
wood<00:00:55.020> standing<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.950> see<00:00:56.190> around<00:00:56.340> here

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.840 

so<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.570> you're<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:00.960> looking<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.680> me

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
so if you're not actually looking for me

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
is a bit more clearer I've got a new

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.480 
is a bit more clearer I've got a new
tarp<00:01:30.350> which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:33.049> your<00:01:34.049> obligatory<00:01:34.710> rip<00:01:35.220> stop

tarp which is your obligatory rip stop
nylon<00:01:35.520> camouflage<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:37.320> got<00:01:37.500> some<00:01:37.740> sort<00:01:38.159> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
nylon camouflage it's got some sort of

nylon camouflage it's got some sort of
writing<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.880> when<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> can<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> close

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
writing on it when you can see it close

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
writing on it when you can see it close
up<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> reason<00:01:41.400> why<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> chose<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.079> is

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
up but the reason why I chose it is

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.350 
up but the reason why I chose it is
because<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> drab<00:01:44.100> colors<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
because I like the drab colors the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.880 
because I like the drab colors the
camouflage<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.619> drab

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
camouflage but it's actually a drab

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
camouflage but it's actually a drab
color<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.460> sharp<00:01:47.759> they're<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.150> bright

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
color it's not sharp they're not bright

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
color it's not sharp they're not bright
and<00:01:49.020> they<00:01:49.140> really<00:01:49.409> blend<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.250> sort<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and they really blend into this sort of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
and they really blend into this sort of
environment<00:01:50.880> an<00:01:51.240> area<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.750> normally

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
environment an area that I normally

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.710 
environment an area that I normally
would<00:01:52.439> Wilde<00:01:52.979> camp<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.030> it's<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> job

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
would Wilde camp in so it's just the job

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.139 
would Wilde camp in so it's just the job
so<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:55.920> tone<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> color<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
so it's a really good tone of color but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.670 
so it's a really good tone of color but
you'll<00:01:57.299> notice<00:01:57.630> I've<00:01:57.780> got<00:01:57.899> eight<00:01:58.049> fixing

there's<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:01.860> in<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.040> middle<00:02:02.100> one<00:02:03.090> side<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> fix

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
there's one in the middle one side a fix

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.940 
there's one in the middle one side a fix
to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> branch<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.549> across<00:02:06.950> on

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to the branch and then going across on

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.910 
to the branch and then going across on
the<00:02:08.220> other<00:02:08.340> side<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.850> fixed<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.920> another

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
the other side it's fixed to another

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680 
the other side it's fixed to another
small<00:02:11.100> bit<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> branch<00:02:11.700> that's<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.150> twined<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
small bit of branch that's in twined on

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.810 
small bit of branch that's in twined on
that<00:02:12.870> big<00:02:13.079> tree<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.560> I'm<00:02:13.650> next<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.370> then

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
that big tree that I'm next to and then

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.430 
that big tree that I'm next to and then
of<00:02:14.910> course<00:02:14.940> I've<00:02:15.299> got<00:02:15.329> the<00:02:15.480> two<00:02:15.780> extendable

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
of course I've got the two extendable

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.600 
of course I've got the two extendable
poles<00:02:17.599> either<00:02:18.599> end<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.340> initially<00:02:20.340> because

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
poles either end so initially because

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.250 
poles either end so initially because
I've<00:02:20.790> been<00:02:20.910> here<00:02:21.150> before<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.900> some<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.200> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
I've been here before and so some of you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.059 
I've been here before and so some of you
might<00:02:22.410> recognize<00:02:22.560> this

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
might recognize this

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.160 
might recognize this
I<00:02:24.099> know<00:02:24.459> it's<00:02:24.640> gonna<00:02:24.790> do<00:02:24.939> an<00:02:25.060> a-frame<00:02:25.299> shape<00:02:25.900> so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I know it's gonna do an a-frame shape so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.830 
I know it's gonna do an a-frame shape so
that's<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.500> pole<00:02:26.739> either<00:02:26.980> end<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:28.689> ace

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
that's a pole either end and the ace

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
that's a pole either end and the ace
shape<00:02:29.140> going<00:02:29.500> either<00:02:29.650> side<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:31.120> side

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
shape going either side one side

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.440 
shape going either side one side
connects<00:02:31.689> it<00:02:31.750> up<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> four<00:02:32.140> corners<00:02:32.620> just

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
connects it up the four corners just

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.910 
connects it up the four corners just
there<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.079> obviously<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.500> one<00:02:35.620> at<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.769> back

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
there and obviously the one at the back

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.610 
there and obviously the one at the back
which<00:02:36.129> is<00:02:36.250> connected<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.909> tree<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.620> then

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
which is connected to the tree and then

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.809 
which is connected to the tree and then
the<00:02:38.799> other<00:02:38.920> one<00:02:39.069> just<00:02:39.099> behind<00:02:39.459> my<00:02:39.609> rucksack

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
the other one just behind my rucksack

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.550 
the other one just behind my rucksack
which<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.659> connected<00:02:41.079> to<00:02:41.109> a<00:02:41.230> little<00:02:41.379> bit<00:02:41.500> of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
which is connected to a little bit of

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.110 
which is connected to a little bit of
foliage<00:02:41.769> that's<00:02:42.099> quite<00:02:42.370> strong<00:02:42.730> next<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.030> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
foliage that's quite strong next to the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
foliage that's quite strong next to the
tree<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.720> then<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.290> course<00:02:44.319> this<00:02:44.709> corner<00:02:45.099> one

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
tree and then of course this corner one

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.059 
tree and then of course this corner one
just<00:02:45.670> down<00:02:45.819> there<00:02:45.939> on<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.120> bungee<00:02:46.769> by<00:02:47.769> having

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
just down there on the bungee by having

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.119 
just down there on the bungee by having
the<00:02:48.159> two<00:02:48.370> other<00:02:48.549> side<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:50.260> elevates<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.829> type

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
the two other side it elevates the type

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.530 
the two other side it elevates the type
a<00:02:51.250> bit<00:02:51.400> higher<00:02:51.609> which<00:02:51.879> means<00:02:52.150> you've<00:02:52.299> got<00:02:52.420> more

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
a bit higher which means you've got more

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.990 
a bit higher which means you've got more
floor<00:02:52.780> space<00:02:52.810> underneath<00:02:53.469> so<00:02:53.889> of<00:02:53.980> course<00:02:54.250> it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
floor space underneath so of course it's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.520 
floor space underneath so of course it's
more<00:02:55.180> comfortable<00:02:55.950> we<00:02:56.950> show<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.189> inside

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
more comfortable we show you inside

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.599 
more comfortable we show you inside

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
that that was good a little bit softer

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.580 
that that was good a little bit softer
whereas<00:03:04.269> before<00:03:04.389> I've<00:03:04.659> used<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:04.930> five<00:03:05.109> season

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
whereas before I've used a five season

having really a really thin sleeping bag
pair<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.959> trousers<00:03:35.139> so<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.590> speak<00:03:35.889> but<00:03:36.760> back<00:03:37.000> to

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
pair of trousers so to speak but back to

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.520 
pair of trousers so to speak but back to
the<00:03:37.329> configuration

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.930 

as<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.250> can<00:03:41.370> see<00:03:41.640> underneath<00:03:43.400> it<00:03:44.400> elevates<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
as you can see underneath it elevates it

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.160 
as you can see underneath it elevates it
slightly<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.660> means<00:03:45.840> you've<00:03:45.990> got<00:03:46.140> more

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
slightly so it means you've got more

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.150 
slightly so it means you've got more
floor<00:03:46.590> space<00:03:48.470> whereas<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.740> was<00:03:49.890> coming

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
floor space whereas if this was coming

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.970 
floor space whereas if this was coming
down<00:03:50.310> more<00:03:50.490> an<00:03:50.640> angle<00:03:51.000> here<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:52.500> would<00:03:52.680> bring

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
down more an angle here it would bring

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.770 
down more an angle here it would bring
the<00:03:53.460> edge<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.760> floor<00:03:53.970> space<00:03:54.180> narrower

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
the edge of the floor space narrower

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.560 
the edge of the floor space narrower
plus<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.380> well<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.460> can<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.880> can<00:03:57.150> sit<00:03:57.420> up

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
plus as well as you can see I can sit up

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.810 
plus as well as you can see I can sit up
and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:58.980> middle<00:03:59.220> but<00:03:59.550> I'm<00:03:59.670> not

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
and I can be in the middle but I'm not

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.820 
and I can be in the middle but I'm not
limited<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.510> actually<00:04:00.840> staying<00:04:01.140> right<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
limited to actually staying right in the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:02.990 
limited to actually staying right in the
center<00:04:02.160> if<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.430> was<00:04:02.550> actually<00:04:02.670> under<00:04:02.880> an

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
center if I was actually under an

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.910 
center if I was actually under an
a-frame<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.080> rook<00:04:04.290> works<00:04:04.560> out<00:04:04.740> really

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
a-frame so this rook works out really

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.220 
a-frame so this rook works out really
well<00:04:05.160> past<00:04:05.970> as<00:04:06.300> well<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> didn't

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
well past as well because I didn't

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.830 
well past as well because I didn't
expect<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.890> terrain<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:09.060> foliage<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.690> be

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
expect the terrain and the foliage to be

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.500 
expect the terrain and the foliage to be
as<00:04:09.930> cleared<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.680> less<00:04:10.950> covered<00:04:11.459> as<00:04:12.270> what<00:04:12.480> I

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
as cleared and less covered as what I

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.900 
as cleared and less covered as what I
was<00:04:12.690> expecting<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.320> as<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.530> was<00:04:13.820> when<00:04:14.820> I've

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
was expecting and as it was when I've

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.270 
was expecting and as it was when I've
come<00:04:15.090> here<00:04:15.209> before<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:16.350> means<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.130> know

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
come here before it means that you know

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.370 
come here before it means that you know
I<00:04:17.310> could<00:04:17.519> be<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.669> little<00:04:17.820> bit<00:04:17.910> more<00:04:18.030> exposed<00:04:18.450> as

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
I could be a little bit more exposed as

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.680 
I could be a little bit more exposed as
far<00:04:19.680> as<00:04:19.799> being<00:04:20.070> seen<00:04:20.820> here<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> bivvy

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
far as being seen here in the bivvy

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.250 
far as being seen here in the bivvy
space<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.550> by<00:04:23.550> having<00:04:23.730> these<00:04:23.970> two<00:04:24.210> points<00:04:24.690> here

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
space so by having these two points here

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.570 
space so by having these two points here
and<00:04:28.260> just<00:04:29.190> there<00:04:29.960> being<00:04:30.960> higher<00:04:31.340> not<00:04:32.340> only<00:04:32.520> is

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
and just there being higher not only is

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.159 
and just there being higher not only is
it<00:04:32.610> more<00:04:32.760> practical<00:04:32.970> space<00:04:33.480> as<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.810> can<00:04:33.930> see<00:04:34.140> I

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
it more practical space as you can see I

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.600 
it more practical space as you can see I
mean<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.440> only<00:04:34.620> got<00:04:34.770> enough<00:04:34.950> room<00:04:35.100> to<00:04:35.160> swing<00:04:35.370> a

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
mean I only got enough room to swing a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.080 
mean I only got enough room to swing a
cat<00:04:35.790> in<00:04:35.970> here<00:04:36.150> really<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:38.669> see<00:04:38.880> what's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
cat in here really but I can see what's

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.950 
cat in here really but I can see what's
around<00:04:39.330> me<00:04:39.919> easier<00:04:40.919> as<00:04:41.070> well<00:04:41.780> whereas<00:04:42.780> if<00:04:42.870> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
around me easier as well whereas if the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.750 
around me easier as well whereas if the
top<00:04:43.200> came<00:04:43.470> down<00:04:43.710> here<00:04:44.160> as<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.310> can<00:04:44.400> see<00:04:44.520> well

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
top came down here as you can see well

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.650 
top came down here as you can see well
my<00:04:44.850> hands<00:04:45.030> coming<00:04:45.270> down

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
my hands coming down

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.480 
my hands coming down
I'd<00:04:45.870> have<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.200> scoop<00:04:46.440> underneath<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.220> actually

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
I'd have to scoop underneath to actually

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.520 
I'd have to scoop underneath to actually
see<00:04:47.729> if<00:04:48.120> there's<00:04:48.600> anything<00:04:48.810> or<00:04:49.080> anyone<00:04:49.290> around

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
see if there's anything or anyone around

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.190 
see if there's anything or anyone around
so<00:04:50.030> here<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.479> can<00:04:51.750> see<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:51.960> panning<00:04:52.500> around

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
so here you can see just panning around

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.270 
so here you can see just panning around
pretty<00:04:55.200> good<00:04:55.290> space<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:58.770> there<00:04:58.979> was<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.130> little

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
pretty good space and there was a little

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.170 
pretty good space and there was a little
bit<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.520> rain<00:04:59.640> last<00:04:59.820> night

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
bit of rain last night

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.730 
bit of rain last night
very<00:05:00.990> very<00:05:01.200> light<00:05:02.060> so<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.180> course<00:05:03.450> with<00:05:04.290> having

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
very very light so of course with having

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.000 
very very light so of course with having
these<00:05:04.979> two<00:05:05.430> just<00:05:05.700> two<00:05:05.910> final<00:05:06.360> notes<00:05:06.570> on<00:05:06.810> this

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
these two just two final notes on this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.120 
these two just two final notes on this
by<00:05:08.010> having<00:05:08.340> these<00:05:08.490> two<00:05:08.850> midpoints<00:05:09.540> higher<00:05:10.229> it

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
by having these two midpoints higher it

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.219 
by having these two midpoints higher it
means<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.550> water<00:05:11.760> is<00:05:12.180> more<00:05:12.540> likely<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.840> flow

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
means the water is more likely to flow

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.610 
means the water is more likely to flow
that<00:05:13.470> way<00:05:13.740> down<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.880> corners<00:05:15.390> rather<00:05:16.229> than<00:05:16.500> it

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
that way down the corners rather than it

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.159 
that way down the corners rather than it
dripping<00:05:17.130> all<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.820> way<00:05:17.940> along<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.330> side<00:05:18.360> so

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
dripping all the way along the side so

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.450 
dripping all the way along the side so
where<00:05:19.410> it's<00:05:19.530> going<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.710> go<00:05:19.890> actually<00:05:20.160> on<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
where it's going to go actually on the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.850 
where it's going to go actually on the
fall<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.729> the<00:05:21.000> tarp<00:05:21.240> itself<00:05:21.690> so<00:05:22.440> really<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
fall of the tarp itself so really the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.030 
fall of the tarp itself so really the
four<00:05:23.160> points<00:05:24.060> but<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.660> corners<00:05:25.080> are<00:05:25.830> really

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
four points but the corners are really

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.350 
four points but the corners are really
going<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.190> be<00:05:26.280> the<00:05:26.400> main<00:05:26.610> drainage<00:05:26.910> areas

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
going to be the main drainage areas

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.520 
going to be the main drainage areas
where<00:05:27.600> they<00:05:27.690> won't<00:05:27.810> really<00:05:28.020> be<00:05:28.169> that<00:05:28.350> much

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
where they won't really be that much

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.980 
where they won't really be that much
rain<00:05:28.800> dropping<00:05:29.220> at<00:05:29.580> the<00:05:29.729> side<00:05:30.000> so<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.840> course

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
rain dropping at the side so of course

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.050 
rain dropping at the side so of course
it<00:05:31.110> makes<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.350> more<00:05:31.440> practical<00:05:31.880> anyway<00:05:32.880> that's

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
it makes it more practical anyway that's

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.740 
it makes it more practical anyway that's
it<00:05:33.150> in<00:05:33.270> a<00:05:33.330> nutshell

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
it in a nutshell

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.900 
it in a nutshell
and<00:05:33.900> I'll<00:05:34.740> feature<00:05:35.010> some<00:05:35.340> more<00:05:35.490> of<00:05:35.550> my<00:05:35.669> kit

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
and I'll feature some more of my kit

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.030 
and I'll feature some more of my kit
when<00:05:36.540> I<00:05:36.570> do<00:05:36.660> other<00:05:36.870> another<00:05:37.140> configuration<00:05:37.440> or

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
when I do other another configuration or

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.580 
when I do other another configuration or
on<00:05:38.160> another<00:05:38.250> canoeing<00:05:39.210> maverick<00:05:39.960> expedition

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
on another canoeing maverick expedition
