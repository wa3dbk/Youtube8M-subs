 a dozen seasons a fashion without 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.870
 flavor at first but that holds 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.930
 progressively in suspense as and when 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.370
 as the years go by for

 john mcenroe's workouts go 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.250
 allow everyone to progress 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.320
 quickly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 it is then possible to strengthen the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.729
 power the speed or even the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.390
 accuracy of his foal was going to have to 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.979
 raise the level there it is also necessary 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.079
 keep an eye on the points of 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.719
 career that are indispensable for 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:29.429
 the respect of his big opponents 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.380
 chelem tennis 2 also offers 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.499
 the opportunity to replay matches that have 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 marked the history of tennis but also 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:39.359
 to oppose legends pass to the stars 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.039
 current discipline the goal is 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.079
 accumulate a certain number of points 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.819
 to unlock new matches and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.819
 access to different times 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.010
 the other strong point of grand slam 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.260
 tennis 2 is to gather in one 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.780
 disc of prestigious players such as 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.910
 rodger federer rafael nadal novak 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.160
 djokovic beyond borg 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.400
 martina navratilova or even 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.720
 justine henin brief enough to please 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.710
 fans of the little yellow ball 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.360
 unfortunately the gameplay of big 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.820
 chelem tennis 2 is not up to par 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.260
 of its content and the developers have 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.610
 probably a little bit too much 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.380
 of ambition indeed the control of the 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.090
 racket goes through the right stick he 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.190
 must tilt in one direction or in 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.220
 the other to give effect to the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.220
 ball 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.370
 a difficult concept to apply during 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.020
 matches and they are showing less 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.850
 intuitive than a classic grip 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.720
 with the buttons a lot more 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.720
 comfortable 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.380
 artificial intelligence also 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.670
 hard to convince and do not adapt 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 really to the play style of his 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.150
 opponent 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.680
 by systematically climbing the net 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.300
 to conclude a point the displacements 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.550
 players are not realistic of the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.130
 everything and he even shows himself capable of 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.730
 teleport when the ball is found 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.590
 at the other end of the course damage because 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.880
 despite the comments of guy forget 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.920
 that hurt your ears 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.959
 the animation of the players is rather 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.150
 successful and the presence of licenses 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.200
 Grand Slam 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.200
 to really believe it 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:23.200
 Yeah yeah
