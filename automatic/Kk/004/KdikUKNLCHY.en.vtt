effort to to look further into it here's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.249 
effort to to look further into it here's
the<00:01:25.180> beginning<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.750> process<00:01:26.910> this

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the beginning of the process this

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.190 
the beginning of the process this
conveyor<00:01:29.259> is<00:01:30.100> where<00:01:30.310> they<00:01:30.460> dump<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.200> material

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
conveyor is where they dump the material

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.820 
conveyor is where they dump the material
right<00:01:32.740> out<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> 5-gallon<00:01:33.580> buckets<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.830> it

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
right out of the 5-gallon buckets and it

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.609 
right out of the 5-gallon buckets and it
feeds<00:01:36.070> up<00:01:36.280> into<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.899> hopper<00:01:37.899> at<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.140> top<00:01:38.320> here

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
feeds up into the hopper at the top here

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.170 
feeds up into the hopper at the top here
of<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.680> hammer<00:01:41.860> mill<00:01:42.100> here's<00:01:42.880> what<00:01:43.060> it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
of the it's a hammer mill here's what it

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.650 
of the it's a hammer mill here's what it
is

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.160 
is
I<00:01:43.690> believe<00:01:44.320> it's<00:01:44.500> student<00:01:44.800> Roth<00:01:45.840> goes<00:01:46.840> through

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
I believe it's student Roth goes through

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.779 
I believe it's student Roth goes through
they've<00:01:47.320> got<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.560> little<00:01:47.860> extra<00:01:48.190> water<00:01:48.369> into

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
they've got a little extra water into

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.540 
they've got a little extra water into
the<00:01:48.880> hammer<00:01:49.060> mill<00:01:49.300> to<00:01:49.420> keep<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> dust<00:01:49.959> down

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
the hammer mill to keep the dust down

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.400 
the hammer mill to keep the dust down
the<00:01:51.550> crushed<00:01:52.539> material<00:01:52.959> comes<00:01:53.140> out<00:01:53.259> the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
the crushed material comes out the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.559 
the crushed material comes out the
bottom<00:01:53.709> into<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.270> bucket<00:01:55.800> with<00:01:57.569> the
