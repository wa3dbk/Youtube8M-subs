00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.270
 The Cities of Tomorrow begins slowly 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.380
 Good evening everyone is a rem ahead 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.820
 It is Marisa 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.360
 What is the mood today different from usual 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.720
 From now on SimCity expansion pack 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:43.120
 Wake of Cities of Tomorrow will be released 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:46.360
 I hope to convey the appeal of this expansion pack 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 Speaking Yeah yeah Sim City 2013 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 The map is small and hardly connected to the server 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.930
 I had to throw a spoon and get stuck 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 Pp The Lord was in a similar situation 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:09.409
 As this expansion pack added this time felt quite attractive 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:14.869
 I would like to play from a scum 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:18.590
 Though it seems that it is possible to create something like a future city from the name though 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:25.729
 It What kind of element has been added 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:29.560
 In this part, first of all, an overview of additional elements based on the information of the official trailer and the official blog 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.560
 I would like to explain 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.010
 What kind of thing is there 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.450
 The major changes are summarized in these four 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:50.580
 After all, the width of the gore still does not change 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:57.420
 It seems that there are still technical issues on the server side 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.070
 This expansion will allow you to develop the city upwards and see what happens 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.930
 I think 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.210
 Ask me eaa 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.830
 Now the first expansion element is on the screen 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.830
 Become an academy 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 The academy can study various future technologies 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:28.850
 Further development of the region by developing fusion generator linear motor car debris decomposition machines etc. 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:33.480
 The is reflected in the can will now screen be to clean and comfortable things 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:39.490
 It is a quantum wireless network called control net 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:46.330
 If this signal is weak, it seems that the building will be closed due to lack of war 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:48.540
 It's such same thing as the net to leave the Omaeraga Part When you are cut off 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.160
 It is such an image 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:00.240
 This seems to be a water facility that can be developed by the academy's research 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.240
 Collect the sewage will flow to the water supply canal was cleaned on the spot 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.350
 Then I would like to move on to Omega 's introduction 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.090
 omega 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:16.050
 I have no eyes but it will be a little suspicious 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:25.830
 There is something quite suspicious from the logo 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:28.550
 What the hell is this? Omega is a strange, cutting edge, super strong, superconductive, lightweight, fruity scent 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.069
 Overall great Bukkake and is 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:38.090
 And only explained 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:44.280
 It seems that the people of this world are crazy about getting Omega 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:50.340
 Omega shipped from the factory is initially distributed free to nearby buildings 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.690
 District a certain amount of the woman has been umbrella say becomes a franchise with a signboard is omega of 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.610
 To make a profit 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:05.060
 There is also a drone as another item for asking and asking 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:11.490
 People can do shopping without leaving the house by using a drone 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:15.980
 This reduces traffic congestion and brings huge benefits to the player. 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:20.120
 There are so many things that are so useful but scary 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:26.850
 It also looks like the city is being polluted 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 Omega pollution seems to be mitigated by the Academy's technology 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:36.680
 The next new element will be the mega tower 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.590
 This is a skyscraper that reaches the heaven as its name suggests 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:45.450
 Oh this each'm feeling future city is 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:48.169
 Mega Tower is constructed by combining the modules of one family 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:53.080
 Can be added 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:05:01.249
 The main module is the condominium mall office 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:06.160
 Furthermore, we can have facilities such as service facility or power generation facility education institution park 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:11.990
 There are two types of mega towers, one for general use and one for elite. 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:14.280
 It seems to be possible to live a population of less than 10,000 people in one tower 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.370
 me 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.139
 But what happens to traffic jams 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:30.190
 The measure becomes the fourth expansion element 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:33.960
 One of the new transportation systems will be linear motor cars that can be developed at the academy 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:39.710
 Run through the effect, but instead of the garage 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:43.360
 Each station seems to need a sufficient control net line 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.330
 Tsu Nante's role can not be run with the net there is no 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:52.860
 Like it's like a we 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:56.720
 I will omit another transportation drone as I explained earlier. 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:06:01.640
 And about the traffic of the mega tower 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:06.680
 I use an air corridor called skybridge like this 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:14.539
 Uo the What 's Koryaa build is connected by a passage 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:18.200
 Of merging allowing for mega towers by the construction of the aerial road network residents of neighboring may not get off the ground 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:22.400
 You will be able to move to the tower 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:26.100
 I don't really feel like a future city 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.100
 Ze I've been excited 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:34.490
 Was it 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:41.990
 Japan is not yet released because the main player is also unplayed 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:44.980
 I hope you will play from the release date to convey the appeal of this expansion pack 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:51.510
 I hope the result is as expected 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:54.880
 So I'm looking forward to seeing you in part 1 in the can as expected 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:58.050
 thank you for listening 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.050
 It's taste male
