 Hello everyone, today I am going to teach you 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.820
 prepare one of the recipes with which 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.820
 we can make russian steaks 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.070
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.800
 they are half a kilo of minced meat you can 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.800
 choose the veal or chicken we 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.070
 in this case we have chosen a mixture 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.360
 parsley white pepper an egg bread 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.360
 grated and salt 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.610
 The first thing we are going to do is take the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.610
 minced meat in a bowl 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.680
 and we crush well 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.089
 As you can see , we have already taken out the meat 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.420
 chopped and now we're going to add the 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.680
 egg 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.280
 and we will continue to impregnate 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280
 A) Yes 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.049
 that mix well with the meat 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.120
 we have already mixed the egg and the meat and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.520
 Now let's continue throwing the rest of 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.979
 ingredients this is going to be a bit 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.330
 Function function sheet of each one 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:50.080
 then we will throw the parsley 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.670
 and a little pepper 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.670
 and we stir well 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.750
 also 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.460
 we are going to also take a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.479
 little garlic 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.479
 very little 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.649
 that is, in very small pieces 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.910
 finally we are the salt 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 we remove and we can start 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.350
 make steaks 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.570
 to do this with our hands we take a little 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.570
 mix 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.500
 we make a ball and crush 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 and so with all the mass 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.500
 finally on a plate we put bread 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.680
 grated and we passed the steaks by the bread 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.680
 grated 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.709
 and then we will fry them 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.170
 and this is the final result here alone 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.640
 you can see a ration but more or less 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.800

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.319
