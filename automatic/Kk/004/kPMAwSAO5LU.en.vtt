00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
I'm just using the same technique making

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.530 
I'm just using the same technique making
sure<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.100> cover<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.940> entire<00:04:36.240> surface

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
sure that I cover the entire surface

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.920 
sure that I cover the entire surface
again<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:38.280> probably<00:04:38.580> allowed<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.660> first

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
again and I probably allowed the first

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.440 
again and I probably allowed the first
coat<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.260> dry<00:04:40.440> for<00:04:41.430> maybe<00:04:41.670> about<00:04:41.940> thirty

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
coat to dry for maybe about thirty

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.300 
coat to dry for maybe about thirty
minutes<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.080> you<00:04:43.320> will<00:04:43.530> tell<00:04:43.860> when<00:04:44.190> it

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
minutes and you will tell when it

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.540 
minutes and you will tell when it
strides<00:04:44.670> actually<00:04:45.210> quite<00:04:45.900> easy<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.560> tell<00:04:46.830> once

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
strides actually quite easy to tell once

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.640 
strides actually quite easy to tell once
the<00:04:47.730> surfaces<00:04:48.270> stripe<00:04:48.600> dries<00:04:48.960> very<00:04:48.990> very

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
the surfaces stripe dries very very

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.180 
the surfaces stripe dries very very
quickly

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
quickly

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.150 
quickly
I<00:04:53.750> completely<00:04:54.750> forgot<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.260> record<00:04:55.560> this<00:04:55.950> but<00:04:56.130> I

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
I completely forgot to record this but I

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.220 
I completely forgot to record this but I
did<00:04:56.460> apply<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.820> wax<00:04:57.090> after<00:04:57.660> all<00:04:57.810> my<00:04:57.990> pieces

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
did apply the wax after all my pieces

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.560 
did apply the wax after all my pieces
were<00:04:58.530> dry<00:04:58.830> the<00:04:59.460> wax<00:04:59.730> will<00:04:59.970> be<00:05:00.060> dried<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.450> the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
were dry the wax will be dried to the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.990 
were dry the wax will be dried to the
touch<00:05:00.780> very<00:05:01.110> quickly<00:05:01.500> however<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.640> will<00:05:02.760> take

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
touch very quickly however it will take

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.270 
touch very quickly however it will take
longer<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.570> harden<00:05:03.960> or<00:05:04.080> cure<00:05:04.380> I've<00:05:04.800> learned

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
longer to harden or cure I've learned

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.530 
longer to harden or cure I've learned
that<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.550> curing<00:05:05.880> process<00:05:05.940> can<00:05:06.510> take

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
that the curing process can take

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.260 
that the curing process can take
anywhere<00:05:07.170> between<00:05:07.230> 5<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:07.890> 21<00:05:08.580> days<00:05:08.730> depending

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
anywhere between 5 to 21 days depending

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.390 
anywhere between 5 to 21 days depending
on<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.480> temperature<00:05:10.020> where<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:10.380> live<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.860> I

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
on the temperature where you live and I

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.400 
on the temperature where you live and I
also<00:05:11.610> learned<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.210> less<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.810> more<00:05:13.260> when

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
also learned that less is more when

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.500 
also learned that less is more when
applying<00:05:13.800> wax<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.460> there's<00:05:14.640> no<00:05:14.850> need<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.090> apply

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
applying wax so there's no need to apply

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.480 
applying wax so there's no need to apply
too<00:05:15.570> much<00:05:15.840> just<00:05:16.560> make<00:05:16.740> sure<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.920> work<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.370> small

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
too much just make sure to work in small

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:24.170 
too much just make sure to work in small
areas<00:05:17.940> at<00:05:18.120> a<00:05:18.150> time<00:05:22.490> this<00:05:23.490> is<00:05:23.730> what<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.000> knife

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
areas at a time this is what the knife

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.750 
areas at a time this is what the knife
seems<00:05:24.480> to<00:05:24.660> look<00:05:24.780> like<00:05:25.050> now<00:05:25.320> we<00:05:26.100> just<00:05:26.340> use<00:05:26.580> the

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
seems to look like now we just use the

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.790 
seems to look like now we just use the
same<00:05:26.970> hardware<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.570> wanted<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.200> originally

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
same hardware I wanted to originally

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.470 
same hardware I wanted to originally
replace<00:05:29.310> the<00:05:29.490> hardware<00:05:29.880> but<00:05:30.030> my<00:05:30.150> husband

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
replace the hardware but my husband

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.720 
replace the hardware but my husband
really<00:05:30.660> liked<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.620> look<00:05:31.860> so<00:05:32.130> it's<00:05:32.370> all<00:05:32.490> about

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
really liked the look so it's all about

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.450 
really liked the look so it's all about
compromise<00:05:33.090> right<00:05:33.570> so<00:05:34.200> what<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.470> try<00:05:35.100> doing

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
compromise right so what I try doing

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.400 
compromise right so what I try doing
here<00:05:35.730> is<00:05:35.880> I<00:05:36.030> try<00:05:36.240> distressing<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.050> little

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
here is I try distressing it a little

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.560 
here is I try distressing it a little
bit<00:05:37.530> as<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.680> can<00:05:38.010> tell<00:05:38.280> and<00:05:38.580> it's<00:05:39.090> such<00:05:39.330> an

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
bit as you can tell and it's such an

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.890 
bit as you can tell and it's such an
easy<00:05:39.840> process<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:41.000> really<00:05:42.000> like<00:05:42.450> how<00:05:42.720> these

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
easy process I really like how these

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.080 
easy process I really like how these
look<00:05:43.230> now<00:05:43.500> so<00:05:44.130> much<00:05:44.340> better<00:05:44.640> in<00:05:44.820> my<00:05:44.850> opinion

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
look now so much better in my opinion

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.090 
look now so much better in my opinion
and<00:05:45.660> they<00:05:45.780> go<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.260> much<00:05:46.350> better<00:05:46.620> in<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:46.830> room

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
and they go so much better in the room

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.490 
and they go so much better in the room
as<00:05:47.250> well<00:05:47.520> this<00:05:48.330> is<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.660> second<00:05:48.990> nightstand

it's over on my husband's side and I use
the<00:05:51.960> same<00:05:52.140> process<00:05:52.560> with<00:05:52.710> this<00:05:52.830> one<00:05:53.040> as<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.220> did

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
the same process with this one as I did

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.730 
the same process with this one as I did
with<00:05:53.550> the<00:05:53.580> other<00:05:53.820> one<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:54.390> I<00:05:54.780> did<00:05:54.990> some<00:05:55.200> light

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
one but that's what I did and I just

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.210 
one but that's what I did and I just
used<00:06:03.420> a<00:06:03.540> clear<00:06:03.780> wax<00:06:04.110> over<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> areas<00:06:05.010> that<00:06:05.040> I

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
used a clear wax over the areas that I

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.000 
used a clear wax over the areas that I
distressed<00:06:05.790> just<00:06:06.420> to<00:06:06.570> seal<00:06:06.780> everything<00:06:07.410> but

found<00:06:20.970> this<00:06:21.150> spot<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.570> I<00:06:21.630> actually<00:06:21.900> like<00:06:22.290> it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
found this spot and I actually like it

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.020 
found this spot and I actually like it
better<00:06:22.500> because<00:06:22.889> Micah<00:06:23.310> is<00:06:23.550> beginning<00:06:24.000> to

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
better because Micah is beginning to

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.650 
better because Micah is beginning to
crawl<00:06:24.419> and<00:06:24.919> I<00:06:25.919> just<00:06:26.130> didn't<00:06:26.370> feel<00:06:26.460> comfortable

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
crawl and I just didn't feel comfortable

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.840 
crawl and I just didn't feel comfortable
having<00:06:27.660> this<00:06:27.960> large<00:06:28.650> mirror<00:06:29.160> just<00:06:29.250> leaning

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
having this large mirror just leaning

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.840 
having this large mirror just leaning
against<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.810> wall<00:06:31.110> so<00:06:31.680> I<00:06:31.710> feel<00:06:32.280> that<00:06:32.310> this<00:06:32.639> is

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
against the wall so I feel that this is

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.010 
against the wall so I feel that this is
a<00:06:33.060> better<00:06:34.520> location<00:06:35.520> insert<00:06:36.419> a<00:06:36.450> picture<00:06:36.690> of

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
a better location insert a picture of

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.500 
a better location insert a picture of
the<00:06:37.169> before<00:06:37.490> so<00:06:38.490> you'll<00:06:38.669> get<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:38.850> see<00:06:39.000> what<00:06:39.180> the

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
the before so you'll get to see what the

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.780 
the before so you'll get to see what the
mirror<00:06:39.750> looked<00:06:39.990> like<00:06:40.169> before<00:06:40.350> I<00:06:40.950> painted<00:06:41.580> it

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
mirror looked like before I painted it

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.360 
mirror looked like before I painted it
but<00:06:42.389> it<00:06:42.540> was<00:06:42.660> an<00:06:42.840> espresso<00:06:43.290> color<00:06:43.680> very<00:06:44.100> very

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
but it was an espresso color very very

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.420 
but it was an espresso color very very
dark

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.990 

I<00:06:48.930> did<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:49.960> little<00:06:50.169> bit<00:06:50.350> of<00:06:50.500> distressing<00:06:51.160> not

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
I did a little bit of distressing not

00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:00.529 
I did a little bit of distressing not
too<00:06:52.270> much<00:06:53.220> and<00:06:54.220> as<00:06:54.970> you<00:06:55.120> can<00:06:55.270> see<00:06:55.330> very<00:06:55.870> lightly

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.400

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
and this was such a neat experience

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.700 
and this was such a neat experience
especially<00:07:06.340> the<00:07:06.850> fact<00:07:07.060> that<00:07:07.150> it<00:07:07.330> was<00:07:07.449> so<00:07:07.660> easy

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:07.710
