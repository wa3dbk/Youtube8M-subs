00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.669 

so<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.549> house<00:01:44.820> lying<00:01:45.750> down<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.470> its

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
it so if i zoom in there you can see for

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.740 
it so if i zoom in there you can see for
example<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.220> pole<00:03:34.550> there<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.940> says<00:03:35.180> e<00:03:35.330> to

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
example that pole there it says e to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.340 
example that pole there it says e to
right<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> instructions<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:38.120> says

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
right and in the instructions it says

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.100 
right and in the instructions it says
put<00:03:39.350> b1<00:03:39.920> c1<00:03:40.310> and<00:03:40.730> a1<00:03:41.090> together<00:03:41.390> screw<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.960> in

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
put b1 c1 and a1 together screw it in

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.830 
put b1 c1 and a1 together screw it in
and<00:03:42.640> totally<00:03:43.640> recommend<00:03:44.330> getting<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.600> power

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
and totally recommend getting a power

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.630 
and totally recommend getting a power
drill<00:03:45.050> if<00:03:45.170> you're<00:03:45.290> going<00:03:45.380> to<00:03:45.470> do<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.710> so<00:03:46.190> it

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
drill if you're going to do this so it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.260 
drill if you're going to do this so it
costs<00:03:46.940> $300<00:03:47.750> or<00:03:47.990> $2.99<00:03:48.500> then<00:03:49.310> it<00:03:49.610> just<00:03:50.060> comes

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
costs $300 or $2.99 then it just comes

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.710 
costs $300 or $2.99 then it just comes
in<00:03:50.450> pieces<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.370> what's<00:03:52.370> good<00:03:52.700> is<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.390> it's

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
in pieces and what's good is that it's

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.350 
in pieces and what's good is that it's
got<00:03:53.900> holes<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.890> wood<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> can<00:03:55.940> slide

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
got holes in the wood that you can slide

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.479 
got holes in the wood that you can slide
the<00:03:56.600> pieces<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:57.140> but<00:03:57.620> what's<00:03:57.800> not<00:03:58.040> good<00:03:58.280> is<00:03:58.310> you

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
the pieces in but what's not good is you

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.460 
the pieces in but what's not good is you
have<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.820> try<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.270> line<00:03:59.540> them<00:03:59.870> up<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.200> it

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
have to try and line them up and it

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.150 
have to try and line them up and it
honestly<00:04:01.040> took<00:04:01.700> me<00:04:01.940> half<00:04:02.239> an<00:04:02.540> hour<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:03.140> line<00:04:03.890> up

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
honestly took me half an hour to line up

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.870 
honestly took me half an hour to line up
one<00:04:04.489> piece<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.239> I<00:04:05.390> was<00:04:05.600> just<00:04:05.900> so<00:04:06.290> mad<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.370> ty

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
one piece and I was just so mad but ty

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.930 
one piece and I was just so mad but ty
the<00:04:07.940> truth<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.570> hardest<00:04:09.140> part<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.709> this<00:04:10.459> thing

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
the truth the hardest part of this thing

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.640 
the truth the hardest part of this thing
would<00:04:11.630> be<00:04:11.870> on<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.910> base<00:04:14.090> the<00:04:14.720> base<00:04:14.930> okay

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
would be on the base the base okay

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.280 
would be on the base the base okay
so<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.489> had<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.880> destroy<00:04:17.060> this<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:17.750> redo<00:04:18.169> it

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
so I had to destroy this and redo it

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.039 
so I had to destroy this and redo it
four<00:04:18.620> times<00:04:18.859> I<00:04:19.220> think<00:04:19.400> four<00:04:20.359> times<00:04:20.390> I'm<00:04:20.989> not

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
four times I think four times I'm not

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.320 
four times I think four times I'm not
over<00:04:21.440> exaggerating<00:04:21.530> I<00:04:22.220> had<00:04:22.760> done<00:04:23.060> the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
over exaggerating I had done the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.230 
over exaggerating I had done the
skeleton<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.290> house<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.130> I'd<00:04:25.220> put<00:04:25.970> all

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
skeleton of this house and I'd put all

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.540 
skeleton of this house and I'd put all
the<00:04:26.600> floors<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.500> all<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.070> windows<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.400> I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
the floors in and all the windows and I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.900 
the floors in and all the windows and I
hadn't<00:04:28.820> done<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.210> roof<00:04:29.810> yet<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.290> then<00:04:30.910> the

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
hadn't done the roof yet and then the

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.530 
hadn't done the roof yet and then the
floor<00:04:32.630> wouldn't<00:04:33.169> match<00:04:33.470> up<00:04:33.860> with<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.180> other

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
floor wouldn't match up with the other

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.390 
floor wouldn't match up with the other
floor<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.470> floor<00:04:36.590> kept<00:04:36.890> falling<00:04:37.370> out<00:04:37.520> so

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
floor and the floor kept falling out so

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.770 
floor and the floor kept falling out so
so<00:04:38.610> um<00:04:39.229> screw<00:04:40.229> everything<00:04:41.100> because<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:42.270> think

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
so um screw everything because I think

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.430 
so um screw everything because I think
my<00:04:42.990> bottom<00:04:43.350> piece<00:04:43.620> was<00:04:44.070> faulty<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:45.720> don't

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
my bottom piece was faulty and I don't

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.560 
my bottom piece was faulty and I don't
know<00:04:46.680> maybe<00:04:47.190> maybe<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.759> was<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.150> doing<00:04:48.479> it

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
know maybe maybe I was just doing it

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.159 
know maybe maybe I was just doing it
wrong<00:04:48.780> because<00:04:49.199> I<00:04:49.620> am<00:04:49.979> NOT<00:04:50.479> some<00:04:51.479> builder<00:04:51.990> I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
wrong because I am NOT some builder I

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.710 
wrong because I am NOT some builder I
don't<00:04:52.680> know<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.949> wouldn't<00:04:53.340> fit<00:04:53.940> together<00:04:54.330> and

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
don't know it wouldn't fit together and

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.840 
don't know it wouldn't fit together and
none<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.350> pieces<00:04:55.530> would<00:04:55.830> go<00:04:56.039> in<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.639> was

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
none of the pieces would go in and I was

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.290 
none of the pieces would go in and I was
just<00:04:57.030> over<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:57.870> by<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.380> third<00:04:58.800> hour<00:04:59.130> see<00:04:59.729> light

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
just over it by the third hour see light

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.650 
just over it by the third hour see light
there<00:05:00.750> in<00:05:01.020> between<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.860> two<00:05:02.729> that's<00:05:03.150> because

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
there in between the two that's because

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.960 
there in between the two that's because
it's<00:05:03.870> not<00:05:04.020> screwed<00:05:04.410> in<00:05:04.530> properly<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:05.160> over

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
it's not screwed in properly and over

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.890 
it's not screwed in properly and over
