00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
jeans I'm shut it in the genome it's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.850 
jeans I'm shut it in the genome it's
basically<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.870> taking<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.320> body<00:02:42.500> shaper

basically like taking the body shaper
into<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> gene<00:02:43.850> that's<00:02:44.090> pretty<00:02:44.360> cool<00:02:44.480> it's

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
into the gene that's pretty cool it's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.140 
into the gene that's pretty cool it's
fantastic<00:02:45.380> okay<00:02:45.770> thank<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.250> should<00:02:46.430> tell<00:02:46.610> now
