 elza 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.449
 Hi, beautiful people today I'll tell you 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 about the sport that I practice and I love it 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.489
 and the pedal 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 seems complicated 'pedal instead of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.369
 people like that do not know if I can not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.289
 hold it but it's very simple to comment 

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:57.960
 if you have a bike at home even 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.409
 that is not professional start 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.510
 practice ' in sharing lives that some 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.450
 places in the house of a relative who is 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.210
 an organ a little further away and the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 from there you will gain resistance 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.000
 and enjoy the places you go 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 to pass something very nice that the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 woman in the head is the benefit 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.090
 that the pedal brings to our body 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.060
 because it helps to tighten the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 girl and also the little butt that is the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.929
 dream of any woman 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.520
 and for that only told that we have to 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.799
 know the type of pedal we have 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.110
 what to practice because you have that pedaling 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.840
 lighter than the idle speed it 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.119
 will work more the aerobic condition at 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.660
 people will gain more conditioning 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.929
 aerobic 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.069
 but if you take it heavier there with 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.170
 heavier gear you will is 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:55.619
 making the coxinhas and a bronze 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.599
 another cool tip is you get the 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.229
 pedal group find out in the 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.759
 society where you can join 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.039
 a galley to pedal 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.590
 I've known several places that I 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.810
 I knew it existed very close to mine. 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.629
 city ​​then pedaling the contact 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 with nature is very cool but for 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.670
 security issue is very important. 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.280
 which itself gives there you use gloves 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.690
 because if it will not hurt the hand it hurts 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.730
 even that footprint there the helmet and a 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.090
 lighter clothing I wear the forehead 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 shorts that is kind of funny that all 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 world, it's been kind of strange, but 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.470
 the butt ends the year even then 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.150
 mattress on the butt he is very 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.970
 also cool to invest 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.130
 Thank you, but I do not have a bicycle. 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.730
 have a brother to borrow what it is that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.830
 I do 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.260
 if you want to count on the benefits of 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.689
 pedal practice a class of 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.569
 in a gym or a bike class 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.220
 indoor is a good choice also another 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.370
 very nice option that we already 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.530
 can do is rent a bike before 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.390
 you make an investment you can 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.040
 test the sport so it's a good tip 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.040
 Let's get it, then come with me. 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.490
 is 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.709
 No, beautiful people, I hope you have 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.030
 This video has been tanned and who knows 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.030
 is on the pedal
