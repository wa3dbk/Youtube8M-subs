 between the home page we have a certain 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.910
 number of apps here i do not know 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.319

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.910
 maybe the last outings I did 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.079

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.280

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:04.459
 most popular apps by 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:08.640

 you can type the app that you 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.690
 want to download 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.700

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.730
 installed applications and in the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.900
 settings 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.680
 you have a number of settings 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.230
 to perform 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.769
 I checked they are all unchecked 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.849
 by default I checked only 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.540
 installers in blindfold who wants 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:44.829
 tell the app will settle by it 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.829
 even once the download is complete 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.379
 so here is the overall presentation 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.810
 of this tweak seems to me that I have you 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.959

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.090
 once downloaded or checked 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.849
 by default here in the settings 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.829

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.110
 also habsi nk adthink means 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.979
 apply synchronization with a style 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.720
 which was installed by default absolute that 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.090
