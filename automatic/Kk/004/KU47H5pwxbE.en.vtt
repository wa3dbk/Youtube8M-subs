will probably have the shortcut in the

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.900 
will probably have the shortcut in the
top<00:00:12.630> directory<00:00:13.230> right<00:00:13.440> here<00:00:13.710> as<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:14.670> first

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
will be in the bin section and then

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.150 
will be in the bin section and then
debug<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.789> then<00:00:21.300> you'll<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.720> exe<00:00:22.560> now

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160

the<00:00:31.320> application<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.279> open<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.550> up

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the application so you can open that up

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.760 
the application so you can open that up
now<00:00:33.300> once<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> open<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.989> you're<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> see

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
now once you open it you're going to see

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.889 
now once you open it you're going to see
nothing<00:00:35.340> open<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.300> say<00:00:36.510> well

this<00:00:37.020> thing's<00:00:37.230> broken<00:00:37.410> what<00:00:37.920> happened<00:00:38.250> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
this thing's broken what happened it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.110 
this thing's broken what happened it
does<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.660> open<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:41.100> program<00:00:41.489> directly

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
does not open with the program directly

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.970 
does not open with the program directly
on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> top<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.870> actually<00:00:43.230> goes<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.440> minimize

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
on the top it actually goes to minimize

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
on the top it actually goes to minimize
mode<00:00:44.219> directly<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.170> it's

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
mode directly so it's right here it's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.060 
mode directly so it's right here it's
this<00:00:46.620> little<00:00:46.770> black<00:00:47.010> counter<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
this little black counter right here so

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.020 
this little black counter right here so
what<00:00:50.070> you'll<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.430> you'll<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.730> ahead<00:00:50.940> and

what you'll do is you'll go ahead and
open<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.460> that's<00:00:53.460> what<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.789> looks<00:00:54.000> like

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
two thousand and then it'll shut off

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.760 
two thousand and then it'll shut off
when<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> hits<00:01:13.680> twenty<00:01:14.010> thousand<00:01:14.490> total<00:01:15.770> for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
different fields and in the last one you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.429 
different fields and in the last one you
see<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> colon<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:02.450> 3128<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
see the colon right here 3128 that's the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.620 
see the colon right here 3128 that's the
port<00:02:04.710> number<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.030> way<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.180> want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> do<00:02:06.540> it

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
port number so the way you want to do it

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.910 
port number so the way you want to do it
is<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> IP<00:02:06.990> number<00:02:07.500> colon<00:02:07.770> port<00:02:08.220> number<00:02:08.700> okay

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
is the IP number colon port number okay

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.589 
is the IP number colon port number okay
so<00:02:10.920> let's<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.220> into<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> debug<00:02:11.760> file<00:02:12.000> where

or<00:04:14.650> something<00:04:14.860> like<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.819> won't<00:04:15.970> be

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
or something like that and you won't be

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.640 
or something like that and you won't be
able<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.209> use<00:04:16.239> them<00:04:16.419> as<00:04:16.540> proxies<00:04:16.989> anymore<00:04:17.440> I

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
able to use them as proxies anymore I

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.140 
able to use them as proxies anymore I
will<00:04:18.070> be<00:04:18.190> putting<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.549> function<00:04:18.880> in<00:04:18.970> there<00:04:19.060> that

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
will be putting a function in there that

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.479 
will be putting a function in there that
actually<00:04:19.269> removes<00:04:19.900> proxies<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.440> don't<00:04:21.370> go

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
actually removes proxies that don't go

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.060 
actually removes proxies that don't go
through<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.820> certain<00:04:22.120> amount<00:04:22.300> of<00:04:22.419> times<00:04:23.070> it's

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
through a certain amount of times it's

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.760 
through a certain amount of times it's
just<00:04:24.190> as<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:25.000> have<00:04:25.180> ideas<00:04:25.660> I'm<00:04:26.110> implementing

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
just as I have ideas I'm implementing

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.940 
just as I have ideas I'm implementing
them<00:04:27.010> so<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.850> know<00:04:28.350> I'll<00:04:29.350> be<00:04:29.560> sitting<00:04:29.800> there

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
them so you know I'll be sitting there

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.990 
them so you know I'll be sitting there
and<00:04:30.010> wake<00:04:30.130> up<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.460> middle<00:04:30.580> of<00:04:30.729> the<00:04:30.820> night

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
and wake up in the middle of the night

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.430 
and wake up in the middle of the night
and<00:04:31.030> have<00:04:31.270> an<00:04:31.360> idea<00:04:31.450> and<00:04:31.810> then<00:04:32.080> I'll<00:04:32.200> have<00:04:32.320> to

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
and have an idea and then I'll have to

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.290 
and have an idea and then I'll have to
call<00:04:32.919> my<00:04:33.100> software<00:04:33.490> guy<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.910> say<00:04:34.030> hey<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.210> want

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
call my software guy and say hey I want

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.820 
call my software guy and say hey I want
you<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.600> add<00:04:34.660> this<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:35.229> you<00:04:35.470> know<00:04:35.590> he

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.219 
adds it to it what up so as well save
this<00:04:38.110> file<00:04:38.380> now<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:39.479> you'll<00:04:40.479> have<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.750> reopen

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
this file now and you'll have to reopen

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.909 
this file now and you'll have to reopen
the<00:04:41.889> tool<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:43.120> order<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.479> get<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.919> update

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
the tool in order to get it to update

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.469 
the tool in order to get it to update
for<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.280> time<00:04:45.490> being<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.970> think<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:46.270> had<00:04:46.450> a

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
for the time being I think I had a

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.050 
for the time being I think I had a
reload<00:04:46.870> function<00:04:47.320> in<00:04:47.410> there<00:04:47.700> forgive<00:04:48.700> me<00:04:48.820> if<00:04:48.910> I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
reload function in there forgive me if I

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.820 
reload function in there forgive me if I
did<00:04:51.600> see<00:04:52.600> now<00:04:52.810> I've<00:04:52.960> got<00:04:53.080> two<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.410> them<00:04:53.500> open

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
did see now I've got two of them open

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.290 
did see now I've got two of them open
remember<00:04:54.340> if<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.460> close<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.850> window<00:04:55.090> doesn't

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
remember if you close the window doesn't

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.850 
remember if you close the window doesn't
necessarily<00:04:55.840> close<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.380> you<00:04:56.470> have<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.680> close

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
necessarily close it you have to close

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.490 
necessarily close it you have to close
it<00:04:57.010> from<00:04:57.160> here<00:04:57.539> so<00:04:58.539> let's<00:04:58.810> see<00:04:59.050> if<00:04:59.169> we<00:04:59.320> had<00:04:59.470> a

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
it from here so let's see if we had a

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.190 
it from here so let's see if we had a
reload<00:04:59.950> function<00:05:00.520> okay<00:05:01.270> now<00:05:01.419> I've<00:05:01.630> got<00:05:01.840> okay

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
reload function okay now I've got okay

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.510 
reload function okay now I've got okay
so<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.440> does<00:05:02.560> have<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.740> real<00:05:02.890> of<00:05:03.010> function<00:05:03.370> i<00:05:03.460> do

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
so it does have a real of function i do

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.700 
so it does have a real of function i do
not<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.000> close<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.390> open<00:05:04.450> it<00:05:04.660> like<00:05:05.560> I

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
not have to close it and open it like I

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.320 
not have to close it and open it like I
see<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:05.890> already<00:05:06.220> implement<00:05:06.640> that<00:05:06.760> so<00:05:07.210> now

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
see it already implement that so now

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.630 
see it already implement that so now
I've<00:05:07.450> got<00:05:07.630> 4,000<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.470> there<00:05:08.590> instead<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.890> 7<00:05:09.190> 45

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
I've got 4,000 in there instead of 7 45

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.270 
I've got 4,000 in there instead of 7 45
so<00:05:10.479> now<00:05:10.630> I'm<00:05:10.750> going<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.960> hit<00:05:11.080> let's<00:05:11.950> just<00:05:12.190> say

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
so now I'm going to hit let's just say

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.070 
so now I'm going to hit let's just say
5,000<00:05:13.030> an<00:05:13.150> hour<00:05:13.270> just<00:05:13.419> you<00:05:13.600> can<00:05:13.720> see<00:05:13.870> how<00:05:13.990> it

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
5,000 an hour just you can see how it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.390 
5,000 an hour just you can see how it
goes<00:05:14.229> well<00:05:15.010> hit<00:05:15.130> start<00:05:16.380> so<00:05:17.380> as<00:05:17.650> you<00:05:18.100> see<00:05:18.250> it's

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.240 
hits 31 33 34 35 36 37 39 now after i
had<00:05:32.260> the<00:05:32.380> feature<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:35.010> taking<00:05:36.010> out<00:05:36.130> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
proxies that don't work anymore this

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.040 
proxies that don't work anymore this
would<00:05:38.200> be<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.380> much<00:05:38.950> better<00:05:39.010> quicker<00:05:39.760> tool<00:05:40.060> just

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
would be a much better quicker tool just

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.570 
would be a much better quicker tool just
because<00:05:41.350> everything<00:05:42.130> would<00:05:42.280> be<00:05:42.370> much<00:05:42.550> better

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
because everything would be much better

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.090 
because everything would be much better
success<00:05:43.360> rate<00:05:43.630> it<00:05:44.590> has<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.830> pretty<00:05:45.010> good

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
success rate it has a pretty good

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.219 
success rate it has a pretty good
success<00:05:45.340> rate<00:05:45.640> as<00:05:45.880> it<00:05:46.060> is<00:05:46.180> but<00:05:46.479> it'd<00:05:46.900> be<00:05:47.050> much

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
success rate as it is but it'd be much

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.469 
success rate as it is but it'd be much
better<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:48.370> way<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.850> then<00:05:49.210> you<00:05:49.360> could

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
better that way and then you could

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.510 
better that way and then you could
calculate<00:05:49.720> per<00:05:50.229> hours<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.590> little<00:05:50.889> bit<00:05:50.979> easier

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
calculate per hours a little bit easier

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.279 
calculate per hours a little bit easier
and<00:05:51.760> actually<00:05:52.360> be<00:05:52.479> more<00:05:52.690> right<00:05:52.840> on<00:05:53.020> right<00:05:53.229> now

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
and actually be more right on right now

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.740 
and actually be more right on right now
what<00:05:53.650> we're<00:05:53.800> doing<00:05:53.830> is<00:05:54.070> just<00:05:54.510> thrown<00:05:55.510> as<00:05:55.660> many

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
what we're doing is just thrown as many

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.440 
what we're doing is just thrown as many
as<00:05:55.990> we<00:05:56.080> can<00:05:56.550> at<00:05:57.550> this<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.060> we'll<00:05:58.180> see<00:05:58.330> how<00:05:58.419> it

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
as we can at this and we'll see how it

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.870 
as we can at this and we'll see how it
goes<00:05:58.539> so<00:05:59.080> we<00:05:59.200> got<00:05:59.320> 4439<00:06:00.280> i<00:06:00.400> could<00:06:00.640> just<00:06:00.729> say

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
goes so we got 4439 i could just say

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.640 
goes so we got 4439 i could just say
4439<00:06:01.630> and<00:06:01.930> see<00:06:02.020> how<00:06:02.140> many<00:06:02.200> and

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
4439 and see how many and

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.180 
4439 and see how many and
hits<00:06:03.070> and<00:06:03.400> then<00:06:03.910> estimate<00:06:04.360> but<00:06:04.660> anyways<00:06:05.530> as

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
hits and then estimate but anyways as

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.890 
hits and then estimate but anyways as
you<00:06:06.310> see<00:06:06.460> right<00:06:06.490> now<00:06:06.610> we've<00:06:06.880> got<00:06:06.910> 70<00:06:07.479> hits<00:06:07.660> now

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
you see right now we've got 70 hits now

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.580 
you see right now we've got 70 hits now
on<00:06:08.139> site<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:09.580> Counting<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:11.110> that's<00:06:11.410> all

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
on site and Counting and that's all

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.560 
on site and Counting and that's all
since<00:06:11.800> hi<00:06:11.949> I<00:06:12.160> just<00:06:12.400> hit<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.639> button<00:06:12.699> so

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
since hi I just hit that button so

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.980 
since hi I just hit that button so
that's<00:06:13.750> how<00:06:13.930> that<00:06:13.990> works<00:06:14.169> very<00:06:15.009> very<00:06:15.130> impt

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
that's how that works very very impt

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.159 
that's how that works very very impt
simple<00:06:16.990> easy<00:06:17.259> quick<00:06:18.120> very<00:06:19.120> easy<00:06:19.270> for<00:06:19.870> you<00:06:19.960> to
