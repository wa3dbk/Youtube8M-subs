and you know with the band playing all

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.590 
and you know with the band playing all
the<00:02:34.280> songs<00:02:34.490> live<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.880> really<00:02:35.120> get<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.390> vibe

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the songs live you really get the vibe

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.480 
the songs live you really get the vibe
off<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.930> each<00:02:36.170> other<00:02:36.410> there<00:02:36.680> may<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.860> mistakes

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
off of each other there may be mistakes

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.270 
off of each other there may be mistakes
but<00:02:38.390> that<00:02:38.930> sort<00:02:39.380> of<00:02:39.470> makes<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.770> human<00:02:39.980> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
but that sort of makes it human and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.580 
but that sort of makes it human and
makes<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.730> songs<00:02:41.030> more<00:02:41.810> appealing<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.410> me

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
makes the songs more appealing to me

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.370 
makes the songs more appealing to me
rather<00:02:43.370> than<00:02:43.520> having<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.300> perfect<00:02:44.810> you<00:02:45.110> just

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the drums don't have much reverb on it

the drums don't have much reverb on it

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
if at all on that very dry dead sound

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.390 
if at all on that very dry dead sound
that<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.810> hear<00:03:42.110> in<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.320> lot<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.590> early<00:03:42.799> 70s

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
that you hear in a lot of early 70s

that you hear in a lot of early 70s
recordings<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:45.590> was<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.430> throwback<00:03:47.269> to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
recordings it was just a throwback to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.620 
recordings it was just a throwback to
that<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:48.920> era<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.519> towards<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.150> middle

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
that to that era and towards the middle

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.930 
that to that era and towards the middle
of<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.930> song<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.470> sort<00:03:51.709> of<00:03:51.799> fades<00:03:52.100> out<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.610> as

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
of the song it sort of fades out and as

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.910 
of the song it sort of fades out and as
its<00:03:53.150> fading<00:03:53.510> out<00:03:53.630> this<00:03:53.989> other<00:03:54.200> thing<00:03:54.560> kind<00:03:54.830> of

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
its fading out this other thing kind of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.650 
its fading out this other thing kind of
fades<00:03:55.130> in<00:03:55.370> it's<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.060> sort<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.420> little

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
fades in it's this sort of little

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.470 
fades in it's this sort of little
psychedelic<00:03:57.760> interlude<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.150> hear<00:03:59.450> and

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
psychedelic interlude that you hear and

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.180 
psychedelic interlude that you hear and
it<00:03:59.750> plays<00:04:00.230> out<00:04:00.410> through<00:04:00.709> the<00:04:00.830> rest<00:04:01.010> of<00:04:01.100> the

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
it plays out through the rest of the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.130 
it plays out through the rest of the
song<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.299> kind<00:04:02.540> of<00:04:02.600> different<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.049> I

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
song it's a kind of different and I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.840 
song it's a kind of different and I
certainly<00:04:03.680> wasn't<00:04:04.010> expecting<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.580> the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
certainly wasn't expecting that the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.050 
certainly wasn't expecting that the
first<00:04:05.060> time<00:04:05.239> I<00:04:05.299> heard<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.690> song<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.860> I<00:04:07.130> think

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
first time I heard the song but I think

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.289 
first time I heard the song but I think
it's<00:04:08.209> pretty<00:04:08.360> cool<00:04:08.600> that<00:04:08.660> he's<00:04:09.230> trying<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:10.299> do

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
it's pretty cool that he's trying to do

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.940 
it's pretty cool that he's trying to do
not<00:04:11.450> have<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.870> same<00:04:12.049> structure<00:04:12.530> in<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.739> song

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
not have the same structure in a song

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.860 
not have the same structure in a song
and<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.000> know<00:04:14.030> sort<00:04:14.299> of<00:04:14.420> do<00:04:14.540> something

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and to you know sort of do something

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.479 
and to you know sort of do something
different<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.500> do<00:04:15.739> something<00:04:16.100> that<00:04:16.220> people

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
different and do something that people

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.640 
different and do something that people
aren't<00:04:16.640> expecting<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:18.019> first<00:04:18.229> time<00:04:18.410> as<00:04:18.530> they

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
aren't expecting the first time as they

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.979 
aren't expecting the first time as they
hear<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.479> that<00:04:20.479> was<00:04:20.570> really<00:04:20.720> well<00:04:20.959> done

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.440 
is a song about the end of something but
one<00:04:45.900> thing<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.230> really<00:04:46.530> like<00:04:46.830> is<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:48.330> don't

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
one thing I really like is you don't

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.120 
one thing I really like is you don't
really<00:04:48.600> know<00:04:48.900> exactly<00:04:48.930> what<00:04:49.620> he's<00:04:49.710> talking

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
really know exactly what he's talking

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.010 
really know exactly what he's talking
about<00:04:50.220> so<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.790> sort<00:04:50.970> of<00:04:51.030> leaves<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.390> up<00:04:51.510> open<00:04:51.900> to

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
about so it sort of leaves it up open to

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.720 
about so it sort of leaves it up open to
interpretation<00:04:52.320> for<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.190> listener<00:04:53.580> and

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
interpretation for the listener and

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.920 
interpretation for the listener and
that's<00:04:53.940> what<00:04:54.090> I<00:04:54.120> really<00:04:54.390> respect<00:04:54.810> about

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
that's what I really respect about

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.420 
that's what I really respect about
songwriters<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:55.830> they're<00:04:56.010> not<00:04:56.160> always

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
songwriters is they're not always

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.550 
songwriters is they're not always
upfront<00:04:56.790> about<00:04:57.660> what<00:04:57.810> they're<00:04:58.110> writing<00:04:58.230> about

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
upfront about what they're writing about

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.260 
upfront about what they're writing about
so<00:04:58.890> you<00:04:58.950> can<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.700> know<00:04:59.850> they've<00:05:00.030> gone<00:05:00.210> through

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
so you can you know they've gone through

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.600 
so you can you know they've gone through
something<00:05:00.690> but<00:05:01.050> they're<00:05:01.530> not<00:05:01.680> revealing

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
something but they're not revealing

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.150 
something but they're not revealing
everything<00:05:02.880> about<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.840> you<00:05:04.590> can<00:05:04.770> leave<00:05:05.010> it

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
everything about it and you can leave it

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.460 
everything about it and you can leave it
up<00:05:05.280> to<00:05:05.520> interpretation<00:05:05.970> for<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.810> listener

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
up to interpretation for the listener

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.090 
up to interpretation for the listener
and<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:09.480> can<00:05:09.660> relate<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.110> it<00:05:10.320> more<00:05:10.830> easily

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
and you can relate to it more easily

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.160 
and you can relate to it more easily
that<00:05:11.490> way<00:05:11.550> there's<00:05:12.450> actually<00:05:12.810> a<00:05:12.870> really<00:05:13.050> good

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
that way there's actually a really good

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.590 
that way there's actually a really good
cover<00:05:13.590> on<00:05:13.920> this<00:05:14.160> album<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.730> called<00:05:15.030> station

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
cover on this album is called station

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.330 
cover on this album is called station
man<00:05:15.750> and<00:05:15.960> it's<00:05:16.230> actually<00:05:16.410> a<00:05:16.650> Fleetwood<00:05:17.160> Mac

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.890 
man and it's actually a Fleetwood Mac
cover<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:17.940> it's<00:05:18.420> probably<00:05:18.570> not<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400

Spencer and Christine McVie and this

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
song i think is perfect for his voice

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.080 
song i think is perfect for his voice
because<00:05:45.450> it<00:05:45.750> just<00:05:46.110> has<00:05:46.770> that<00:05:46.800> easy<00:05:47.250> quality<00:05:47.880> to

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
because it just has that easy quality to

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.690 
because it just has that easy quality to
it<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.919> you<00:05:49.919> know<00:05:50.010> he's<00:05:50.280> not<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.490> very

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
it that you know he's not a very

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.780 
it that you know he's not a very
forceful<00:05:51.030> singer<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.690> very<00:05:52.410> quite<00:05:53.190> opposite<00:05:53.640> to

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
forceful singer a very quite opposite to

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.700 
forceful singer a very quite opposite to

less<00:05:55.950> screams<00:05:56.700> in<00:05:57.060> his<00:05:57.180> singing<00:05:57.830> rich<00:05:58.830> is

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
less screams in his singing rich is

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.680 
less screams in his singing rich is
definitely<00:05:59.430> more<00:05:59.550> laid-back<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.450> little

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
definitely more laid-back and a little

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.180 
definitely more laid-back and a little
more<00:06:00.810> introspective<00:06:01.200> in<00:06:01.650> his<00:06:01.800> vocal

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
more introspective in his vocal

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.110 
away and a sort of bookends the album
and<00:06:10.100> it<00:06:11.100> really<00:06:11.340> ties<00:06:11.580> it<00:06:11.730> everything<00:06:12.000> up

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
and it really ties it everything up

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.390 
and it really ties it everything up
nicely<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.570> any<00:06:13.290> sort<00:06:13.680> of<00:06:13.740> loose<00:06:13.890> ends<00:06:14.130> are

nicely and any sort of loose ends are

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.550 
nicely and any sort of loose ends are
completed<00:06:15.330> with<00:06:15.510> the<00:06:15.660> song<00:06:15.870> you<00:06:16.050> really<00:06:16.260> makes

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
completed with the song you really makes

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.320 
completed with the song you really makes
the<00:06:16.680> record<00:06:17.010> complete<00:06:17.730> it's<00:06:17.940> a<00:06:17.970> great<00:06:18.150> way<00:06:18.270> to

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
the record complete it's a great way to

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.590 
the record complete it's a great way to
end<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.660> album<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.380> it<00:06:20.370> just<00:06:20.610> works<00:06:21.300> as<00:06:21.570> a

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
end the album and it just works as a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.780 
end the album and it just works as a
closer<00:06:21.900> so<00:06:22.500> production<00:06:22.950> wise<00:06:23.070> this<00:06:23.310> album<00:06:23.669> is

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
closer so production wise this album is

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.050 
closer so production wise this album is
pretty<00:06:23.880> well<00:06:24.210> done<00:06:24.450> it's<00:06:25.200> very<00:06:25.350> mixed<00:06:26.060> meaning

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
pretty well done it's very mixed meaning

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.720 
pretty well done it's very mixed meaning
not<00:06:27.810> all<00:06:28.050> the<00:06:28.169> songs<00:06:28.380> sound<00:06:28.680> the<00:06:28.740> same<00:06:28.980> which

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
not all the songs sound the same which

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.659 
not all the songs sound the same which
can<00:06:30.180> work<00:06:30.360> against<00:06:30.810> an<00:06:31.050> album<00:06:31.470> as<00:06:31.890> an<00:06:32.370> entity

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
can work against an album as an entity

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.760 
can work against an album as an entity
but<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.419> think<00:06:33.690> it's<00:06:33.840> okay<00:06:34.260> on<00:06:34.440> this<00:06:34.590> album

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
but I think it's okay on this album

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.239 
but I think it's okay on this album
because<00:06:34.979> all<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.520> songs<00:06:35.820> are

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.249 
because all the songs are

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.549 
because all the songs are
different<00:06:37.489> in<00:06:38.059> their<00:06:38.539> own<00:06:38.689> way<00:06:39.019> they're

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:39.559 
different in their own way they're

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.679 
different in their own way they're
similar<00:06:39.829> but<00:06:39.979> they're<00:06:40.399> different<00:06:40.849> and<00:06:40.939> so

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689 
similar but they're different and so

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.719 
similar but they're different and so
they're<00:06:41.899> mixing<00:06:42.289> to<00:06:42.679> each<00:06:42.859> song<00:06:43.219> rather<00:06:43.519> than

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
they're mixing to each song rather than

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:46.119 
they're mixing to each song rather than
to<00:06:44.029> make<00:06:44.209> it<00:06:44.359> all<00:06:44.539> all<00:06:44.869> the<00:06:45.109> songs<00:06:45.379> sound<00:06:46.039> the

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
to make it all all the songs sound the

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:47.799 
to make it all all the songs sound the
same<00:06:46.399> which<00:06:46.699> is<00:06:46.879> you<00:06:47.089> know<00:06:47.119> pretty<00:06:47.449> pretty

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:47.809 
same which is you know pretty pretty

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:51.069 
same which is you know pretty pretty
respectable<00:06:48.349> because<00:06:49.239> that's<00:06:50.239> the<00:06:50.509> way<00:06:50.539> that

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:51.079 
respectable because that's the way that

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.069 
respectable because that's the way that
album<00:06:51.439> should<00:06:51.649> be<00:06:51.709> um<00:06:52.579> yeah<00:06:53.509> I<00:06:53.569> really<00:06:53.839> like

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 
this album this is a really good solo

than<00:06:59.809> paper<00:07:00.049> i<00:07:00.199> think<00:07:00.529> paper<00:07:00.769> was<00:07:01.159> more<00:07:01.789> or

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:01.939 
than paper i think paper was more or

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.799 
than paper i think paper was more or
less<00:07:02.049> he<00:07:03.049> was<00:07:03.199> forced<00:07:03.559> into<00:07:03.709> it<00:07:03.859> um<00:07:04.809> basically

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:05.809 
less he was forced into it um basically

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:08.649 
less he was forced into it um basically
because<00:07:06.649> you<00:07:07.129> know<00:07:07.249> he<00:07:07.429> didn't<00:07:07.699> he<00:07:08.089> tried<00:07:08.419> to

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.149

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:16.239 
didn't work out so he's just sort of on
a<00:07:13.219> whim<00:07:13.339> made<00:07:13.969> these<00:07:14.229> min<00:07:15.229> the<00:07:15.379> solo<00:07:15.649> album<00:07:16.069> and

00:07:16.239 --> 00:07:16.249 
a whim made these min the solo album and

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:18.850 
a whim made these min the solo album and
this<00:07:17.239> time<00:07:17.419> around<00:07:17.569> i<00:07:17.779> think<00:07:17.989> he<00:07:18.229> really

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
this time around i think he really

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.619 
this time around i think he really
wanted<00:07:19.189> to<00:07:19.249> make<00:07:19.459> this<00:07:19.639> solo<00:07:19.909> album<00:07:20.360> for

00:07:20.619 --> 00:07:20.629 
wanted to make this solo album for

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.869 
wanted to make this solo album for
himself<00:07:20.799> rather<00:07:21.799> than<00:07:21.949> have<00:07:22.519> the<00:07:22.639> songs

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 
himself rather than have the songs

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.249 
himself rather than have the songs
written<00:07:23.059> for<00:07:23.329> another<00:07:23.569> singer<00:07:23.929> and<00:07:24.079> being

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259 
written for another singer and being

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.679 
written for another singer and being
forced<00:07:24.529> into<00:07:24.860> writing<00:07:25.189> into<00:07:26.119> completing<00:07:26.479> the

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:26.689 
forced into writing into completing the

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.989 
forced into writing into completing the
songs<00:07:26.929> so<00:07:27.649> I<00:07:27.679> think<00:07:27.829> this<00:07:28.279> album<00:07:28.639> works<00:07:28.879> a

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:28.999 
songs so I think this album works a

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:30.519 
songs so I think this album works a
little<00:07:29.119> bit<00:07:29.299> better<00:07:29.419> than<00:07:29.689> paper<00:07:29.959> on<00:07:30.289> that

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:30.529 
little bit better than paper on that

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.649 
little bit better than paper on that
level<00:07:30.919> so<00:07:31.489> I'm<00:07:31.819> going<00:07:31.969> to<00:07:31.999> give<00:07:32.149> it<00:07:32.179> a<00:07:32.299> nine<00:07:32.479> out

00:07:32.649 --> 00:07:32.659 
level so I'm going to give it a nine out

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.779 
level so I'm going to give it a nine out
of<00:07:32.689> ten<00:07:33.019> high<00:07:33.529> score<00:07:33.860> but<00:07:34.009> I<00:07:34.099> really<00:07:34.459> like<00:07:34.610> this

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:34.789 
of ten high score but I really like this

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:37.059 
of ten high score but I really like this
one<00:07:34.969> so<00:07:35.839> that's<00:07:36.259> what<00:07:36.409> I<00:07:36.439> thought<00:07:36.649> about<00:07:36.799> the

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:37.069 
one so that's what I thought about the

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:38.589 
one so that's what I thought about the
album<00:07:37.339> let<00:07:37.519> me<00:07:37.609> know<00:07:37.699> what<00:07:37.849> you<00:07:37.909> guys<00:07:38.089> think<00:07:38.359> in
