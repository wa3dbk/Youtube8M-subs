as I've been working with post workshop
pro<00:00:07.279> edition<00:00:07.700> I'm<00:00:08.570> realizing<00:00:09.380> that<00:00:09.410> what<00:00:10.070> it's

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
pro edition I'm realizing that what it's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.490 
pro edition I'm realizing that what it's
going<00:00:10.730> to<00:00:10.820> come<00:00:11.000> down<00:00:11.060> to<00:00:11.300> its<00:00:11.810> not<00:00:11.990> just<00:00:12.020> a<00:00:12.350> lot

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
going to come down to its not just a lot

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.860 
going to come down to its not just a lot
of<00:00:12.530> playing<00:00:12.890> with<00:00:13.100> it<00:00:13.340> but<00:00:13.970> building<00:00:14.660> your<00:00:14.840> own

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
of playing with it but building your own

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.609 
of playing with it but building your own
formulas<00:00:15.740> for<00:00:16.160> the<00:00:16.930> effect<00:00:17.930> that<00:00:18.170> you<00:00:18.320> would

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
formulas for the effect that you would

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.770 
formulas for the effect that you would
like<00:00:18.830> to<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:19.160> at<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.520> end<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.300> part<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.720> that

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
like to have at the end but part of that

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.990 
like to have at the end but part of that
involves<00:00:21.590> exploring<00:00:22.490> all<00:00:22.699> the<00:00:22.760> different

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
involves exploring all the different

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.359 
involves exploring all the different
styles<00:00:23.600> that<00:00:23.990> they<00:00:24.170> have<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.100> things

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
styles that they have and the things

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.359 
styles that they have and the things

favorite formulas to put together so the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.000 
favorite formulas to put together so the
style<00:02:10.999> is<00:02:11.209> building<00:02:11.659> blocks<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.349> then<00:02:12.709> I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
style is building blocks and then I

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.880 
style is building blocks and then I
chose<00:02:13.370> simple<00:02:14.299> styles

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
chose simple styles

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.010

sketch<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.560> which<00:02:21.830> has<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.340> big<00:02:22.550> black<00:02:22.910> lines

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
sketch to which has the big black lines

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.990 
sketch to which has the big black lines
on<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.020> as<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.040> showed<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.819> previous

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
on it and as I showed you in previous

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.690 
on it and as I showed you in previous
video<00:02:26.569> you<00:02:26.660> just<00:02:26.840> bring<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.380> over<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.920> if<00:02:28.520> you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
video you just bring it over and if you

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.900 
video you just bring it over and if you
just<00:02:29.060> go<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.540> far<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.200> will<00:02:30.800> just<00:02:30.830> go<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.610> top

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
just go that far it will just go on top

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.150 
just go that far it will just go on top
of<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:33.320> you<00:02:33.440> will<00:02:33.560> have<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.830> layer<00:02:34.130> of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
of it so that you will have a layer of

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.560 
of it so that you will have a layer of
it<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:36.200> did<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.830> then<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.610> went<00:02:38.120> over

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
it so I did that and then I went over

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.240 
it so I did that and then I went over
and<00:02:38.810> look<00:02:39.020> at<00:02:39.140> this<00:02:39.350> if<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> go<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.890> properties

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
and look at this if you go to properties

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.760 
and look at this if you go to properties
in<00:02:40.670> preview<00:02:41.150> now<00:02:41.660> I<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.989> some<00:02:42.200> other<00:02:42.320> choices

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
in preview now I have some other choices

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.970 
in preview now I have some other choices
here<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.970> up<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.239> line<00:02:44.690> with<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.620> watch

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
here I can up the line with and watch

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.960 
here I can up the line with and watch
what<00:02:46.190> happens<00:02:46.220> it'll<00:02:46.819> change<00:02:47.150> over<00:02:48.050> here<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
what happens it'll change over here and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.910 
what happens it'll change over here and
then<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.120> changes<00:02:50.570> here<00:02:50.959> on<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.530> painting

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
then it changes here on the painting

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.090 
then it changes here on the painting
itself<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:53.450> don't<00:02:53.840> know<00:02:53.930> cleaning<00:02:54.320> up<00:02:54.560> dust<00:02:54.830> so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
itself I don't know cleaning up dust so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.610 
itself I don't know cleaning up dust so
let's<00:02:55.280> help<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.670> real<00:02:55.910> high<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.480> let's<00:02:57.410> see

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
let's help it real high and let's see

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.860 
let's help it real high and let's see
what<00:02:57.800> cleanup<00:02:58.190> does<00:02:58.430> oh<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.150> took<00:02:59.300> away<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.600> lot

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
what cleanup does oh it took away a lot

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.229 
what cleanup does oh it took away a lot
of<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> little<00:03:01.820> bit<00:03:02.030> too

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
of that so that was a little bit too

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.729 
of that so that was a little bit too
much<00:03:02.390> we<00:03:02.690> didn't<00:03:02.930> want<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:03.260> rid<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.500> all

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
much we didn't want to get rid of all

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.699 
much we didn't want to get rid of all
those<00:03:03.860> lines<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:05.269> let's<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:06.019> if<00:03:06.110> we<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.500> go

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
those lines so let's see if we just go

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.570 
those lines so let's see if we just go
halfway<00:03:07.330> ok<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:08.900> threshold<00:03:09.530> level<00:03:09.950> let's

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
halfway ok we have threshold level let's

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.490 
halfway ok we have threshold level let's
take<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.090> down<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.870> always<00:03:12.080> say<00:03:12.320> if<00:03:12.350> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
take that down and I always say if you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.160 
take that down and I always say if you
don't<00:03:12.769> know<00:03:12.920> what<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.130> slider<00:03:13.459> does<00:03:13.820> then<00:03:14.330> just

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
don't know what a slider does then just

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.910 
don't know what a slider does then just
use<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.920> see<00:03:16.160> how<00:03:16.190> it<00:03:16.370> changes<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.920> oh

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
use it and see how it changes it and oh

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.530 
use it and see how it changes it and oh
that<00:03:19.430> made<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.940> bit<00:03:20.120> lighter<00:03:20.329> I

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
that made a little bit lighter I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.870 
that made a little bit lighter I
actually<00:03:20.810> sort<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:22.760> we

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
actually sort of like that and then we

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.620 
actually sort of like that and then we
have<00:03:23.030> simplified<00:03:23.299> so<00:03:24.079> other<00:03:25.040> layers<00:03:25.700> I'll<00:03:26.450> go

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
have simplified so other layers I'll go

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.810 
have simplified so other layers I'll go
back<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.140> styles<00:03:27.590> let's<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.579> go<00:03:28.730> ahead

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
back to the styles let's just go ahead

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.090 
back to the styles let's just go ahead
and<00:03:28.970> we'll<00:03:29.299> add<00:03:29.540> another<00:03:29.690> layer<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:30.620> and

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.970 

let's<00:03:34.100> add<00:03:34.930> let's<00:03:35.930> see<00:03:36.170> what<00:03:36.470> do<00:03:36.530> we<00:03:36.650> still

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
let's add let's see what do we still

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.539 
let's add let's see what do we still
have<00:03:37.040> here<00:03:38.200> let's<00:03:39.200> see<00:03:39.440> we<00:03:39.620> have<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:40.070> don't

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
have here let's see we have I don't

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.050 
have here let's see we have I don't
think<00:03:40.610> I'd<00:03:40.850> like<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.299> one<00:03:42.670> let's<00:03:43.670> go<00:03:43.850> back<00:03:44.030> to

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
think I'd like that one let's go back to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.080 
think I'd like that one let's go back to
the<00:03:44.329> painting<00:03:44.780> ones<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.850> let's<00:03:46.850> go<00:03:47.030> to

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the painting ones and let's go to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.850 
the painting ones and let's go to
Expressionism<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:48.970> let's<00:03:49.970> add<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:51.230> bit

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
Expressionism and let's add a little bit

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.340 
Expressionism and let's add a little bit
of<00:03:52.030> Expressionism<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.600> let's<00:03:53.810> see<00:03:54.019> what<00:03:54.230> this

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
of Expressionism so let's see what this

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.069 
of Expressionism so let's see what this
is<00:03:54.560> going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> look<00:03:54.920> like<00:03:55.570> oops<00:03:56.570> they<00:03:56.810> think<00:03:57.019> I

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
is going to look like oops they think I

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.259 
is going to look like oops they think I
let<00:03:57.260> go<00:03:57.290> of<00:03:57.530> it<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.829> soon<00:03:58.070> okay<00:03:58.790> once<00:03:58.970> i<00:03:59.090> see

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
let go of it you soon okay once i see

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.449 
let go of it you soon okay once i see
the<00:03:59.420> orange<00:03:59.660> line<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.140> i<00:04:00.260> can<00:04:00.470> let<00:04:00.620> go<00:04:00.799> of<00:04:00.950> it

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.300 

okay<00:04:04.459> so<00:04:04.820> we<00:04:05.450> sort<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.840> have<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.380> crosshatch

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
okay so we sort of have a crosshatch

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.150 
okay so we sort of have a crosshatch
kind<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.239> brush<00:04:08.540> stroke<00:04:08.930> here<00:04:09.320> and<00:04:09.530> what<00:04:10.130> I'm

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
kind of brush stroke here and what I'm

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.210 
kind of brush stroke here and what I'm
going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.430> do<00:04:10.640> is<00:04:10.820> go<00:04:11.000> to<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.180> layers<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:12.220> let

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
going to do is go to the layers and let

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.220 
going to do is go to the layers and let
me<00:04:13.370> change<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.940> overlays<00:04:14.600> always<00:04:14.989> my

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
me change this overlays always my

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.210 
me change this overlays always my
favorite<00:04:15.769> thing<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.250> do<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:18.070> there's<00:04:19.070> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
favorite thing to do and there's the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.120 
favorite thing to do and there's the
change<00:04:19.609> on<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.060> so<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:21.410> can<00:04:21.590> really<00:04:21.799> see

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
change on that so you can really see

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.440 
change on that so you can really see

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.470 
on the left side and you might have a
whole<00:06:07.100> list<00:06:07.280> of<00:06:07.490> objects<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.210> i'll<00:06:08.330> be

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
whole list of objects and i'll be

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.420 
whole list of objects and i'll be
exploring<00:06:08.900> that<00:06:09.290> and<00:06:09.590> then<00:06:09.980> on<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.220> right

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
exploring that and then on the right

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.370 
exploring that and then on the right
side<00:06:10.760> or<00:06:10.790> all<00:06:11.030> your<00:06:11.240> filters<00:06:11.750> and<00:06:11.990> I<00:06:12.020> sort<00:06:12.290> of

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
side or all your filters and I sort of

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.380 
side or all your filters and I sort of
like<00:06:12.590> this<00:06:12.860> mode<00:06:13.190> here<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:13.640> think<00:06:13.850> this<00:06:14.210> would

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
like this mode here I think this would

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.350 
like this mode here I think this would
work<00:06:14.570> real<00:06:14.870> well<00:06:14.900> for<00:06:15.290> everybody<00:06:15.730> so<00:06:16.730> that's

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
work real well for everybody so that's

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.470 
work real well for everybody so that's
