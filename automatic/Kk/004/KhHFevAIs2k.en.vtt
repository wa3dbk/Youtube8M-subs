00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.310
 so i will be on all exhibitors 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:12.210
 put up 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:15.269
 that means only 150 grams and two sweaters 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:26.490
 and we already look at finished representatives 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:31.769
 Oscar does not untangle us so 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.420
 We have the procedures 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.059
 Already the army designed the whole 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.059
 Direction parallel to the power line 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.060
 that had already been two hours here 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.990
 had a bite 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.860
 Five ships undulate and how they get to 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:03.870
 was home just advertises they are 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.610
 are now another 18 o'clock 18 30 but 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.160
 kick and done pretty crazy 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.040
 has been placed higher and the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.280
 short has nothing for us 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.810
 agreed 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 that is, so you can see which can route 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 probably and is absolutely immediate 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.360
 is not so please to the main now 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.590
 him almost nothing history now 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.590
 is still showing now 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.520
 comes over driven I am the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.520
 opinion of the tractor is accurate and is only 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:56.750
 about google showed looks like a tuas 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.710
 bigger ship comes then what with us 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:06.110
 based on a route she is wise as 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.560
 Bulls 140 150 grams significantly 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.560
 change 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.410
 the case 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.450
 why last 30 meters long 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.030
 eight meters wide the draft of three 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.030
 meters 55 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:58.660
 continue marl to the topic cord down so 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:08.370
 long to you so on this place 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:12.910
 So it was this time at 19h15 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.750
 just before half past seven what he might be in 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.040
 background belongs to this grumbling 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.330
 that's not a thunderstorm that's mine 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:27.220
 motto what showed me is here 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:31.810
 practically nothing except the line-up 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.200
 sinking is absolutely necessary when 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.510
 fishing on the drivers that the red 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.150
 is absolutely must be on the ipod 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.130
 So direction saturn 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.400
 So it works with this 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.810
 traditional art well, a bit has always 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.880
 had what it was 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.090
 and then I would say that was it 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.450
 our first try one under 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.630
 high voltage in 1 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.630
 See you 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:25.620
 taste as you can see mussels 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:29.699
 Snails love them now 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.620
 forcibly meditated age thinks that 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:42.870
 we strongly stop here 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:45.629
 Be careful not always google that 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.650
 human with frame over like when I 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.889
 liked something like that 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.130
 You can see the trees are pending 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.599
 nudibranch more expected kemper good 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:06.000
 was that interested next time 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:11.039
 try is a branch buy new new 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.039
 genus new species of the branch karl wimmer 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.190
 looks extremely long breast fins the 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:20.130
 tail fin somewhat stunted but 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:28.099
 otherwise a little later before that at the 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:28.099
 Verler therefore the montage two sweaters and 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.940
