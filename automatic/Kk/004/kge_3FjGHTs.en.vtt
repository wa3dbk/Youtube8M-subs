the developers actually intended this to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.969 
especially mario but unfortunately
because<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> game<00:01:40.259> mechanics<00:01:40.770> are<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
because some of the game mechanics are a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.310 
because some of the game mechanics are a
little<00:01:41.369> bit<00:01:41.790> or<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> little<00:01:42.869> bit<00:01:43.020> rough

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
little bit or or a little bit rough

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.020 
little bit or or a little bit rough
around<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.710> edges<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.579> game<00:01:44.790> actually

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
around the edges the game actually

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
around the edges the game actually
crosses<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> line<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> goes<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.680> bit

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
crosses the line and goes a little bit

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.700 
crosses the line and goes a little bit
from<00:01:47.040> homage<00:01:47.399> into<00:01:47.970> cheap<00:01:48.450> ripoff<00:01:48.960> that's

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
from homage into cheap ripoff that's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
from homage into cheap ripoff that's
only<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.369> places<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.240> collision

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
only in some places like the collision

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.770 
only in some places like the collision
detection<00:01:51.930> where

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
detection where

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.330 
detection where
it<00:01:52.900> really<00:01:53.170> doesn't<00:01:53.530> operate<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.040> way<00:01:54.159> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
it really doesn't operate the way that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.649 
it really doesn't operate the way that
you<00:01:54.430> think<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.850> would<00:01:55.030> or<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.360> jumping

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
you think it would or the jumping

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.359 
you think it would or the jumping
mechanics<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.170> are<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:56.409> little<00:01:56.680> bit<00:01:56.890> sloppier

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
mechanics that are a little bit sloppier

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.580 
mechanics that are a little bit sloppier
than<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.850> hope<00:01:58.030> they'd<00:01:58.240> be<00:01:58.590> those

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
than you would hope they'd be those

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.320 
than you would hope they'd be those
things<00:01:59.979> actually<00:02:00.369> bring<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.880> out<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.210> that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
things actually bring it out of that

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.260 
things actually bring it out of that
homage<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:02.140> real<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:03.100> reminds<00:02:03.610> me<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.909> my

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
homage that real this reminds me of my

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.090 
homage that real this reminds me of my
childhood<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.259> fun<00:02:05.500> platformer

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
childhood and this is a fun platformer

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.880 
childhood and this is a fun platformer
game<00:02:06.130> into<00:02:06.900> why<00:02:07.900> am<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.170> playing<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.590> game

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
game into why am I playing this game

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
game into why am I playing this game
does<00:02:09.459> not<00:02:09.489> like<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:09.850> in<00:02:10.119> all<00:02:10.270> places

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
does not like that in all places

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.690 
does not like that in all places
especially<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.530> graphics<00:02:11.950> because<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.220> really

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
especially the graphics because I really

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.460 
especially the graphics because I really
like<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> graphics<00:02:13.270> where<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:13.810> doing<00:02:14.110> kind

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
like the graphics where it's doing kind

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.780 
like the graphics where it's doing kind
of<00:02:14.590> this<00:02:14.830> polished<00:02:15.430> earthbound<00:02:16.180> or<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:18.280> don't

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
of this polished earthbound or I don't

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
of this polished earthbound or I don't
know<00:02:18.940> scribblenauts<00:02:19.750> type<00:02:20.110> of<00:02:20.319> art<00:02:20.890> design

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
know scribblenauts type of art design

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.740 
know scribblenauts type of art design
and<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.880> actually<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.330> fun<00:02:22.510> that's

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
and it is actually really fun that's

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.390 
and it is actually really fun that's
really<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.110> really<00:02:23.350> well<00:02:23.500> designed<00:02:23.709> but

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
really is really well designed but

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.740 
really is really well designed but
unfortunately<00:02:24.520> some<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.180> those<00:02:25.300> gameplay

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
unfortunately some of those gameplay

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.690 
unfortunately some of those gameplay
mechanics<00:02:26.230> they're<00:02:26.410> just<00:02:26.800> not<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.400> well

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
mechanics they're just not that well

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.310 
mechanics they're just not that well
polished<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.540> think<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> took<00:02:29.019> away<00:02:29.260> from

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
polished and I think it took away from

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.050 
polished and I think it took away from
the<00:02:29.560> overall<00:02:29.800> experience<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:30.790> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
the overall experience and I think it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.210 
the overall experience and I think it
kind<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.300> tarnished<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.930> as<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> no<00:02:32.290> March<00:02:32.590> or<00:02:32.860> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
kind of tarnished it as a no March or to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.740 
kind of tarnished it as a no March or to
platformers<00:02:33.790> which<00:02:34.300> i<00:02:34.390> think<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.690> was

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
platformers which i think it was

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.750 
platformers which i think it was
intending<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.410> be<00:02:35.560> one<00:02:36.130> thing<00:02:36.310> I<00:02:36.370> really<00:02:36.459> liked

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
intending to be one thing I really liked

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.000 
intending to be one thing I really liked
about<00:02:36.880> heavy<00:02:37.239> sword<00:02:37.510> was<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.989> soundtrack<00:02:38.500> now

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
about heavy sword was the soundtrack now

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.160 
about heavy sword was the soundtrack now
there<00:02:39.370> were<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> tracker<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.630> that<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.900> didn't

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
there were a tracker to that I didn't

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.660 
there were a tracker to that I didn't
like<00:02:41.319> that<00:02:41.500> much<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.920> overall<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.550> a<00:02:42.640> very

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
like that much but overall it's a very

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.090 
like that much but overall it's a very
nostalgic<00:02:43.330> set<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.900> tracks<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.890> really

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
nostalgic set of tracks and it really

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.890 
nostalgic set of tracks and it really
brings<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.459> back<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.880> kind<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.090> 8-bit<00:02:46.600> /

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
brings you back to that kind of 8-bit /

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.559 
brings you back to that kind of 8-bit /
16-bit<00:02:47.739> era<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.970> think<00:02:49.030> if<00:02:49.360> they<00:02:49.510> were

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
16-bit era and I think if they were

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.059 
16-bit era and I think if they were
building<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:49.989> Oh<00:02:50.019> Maj<00:02:50.319> as<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.650> said<00:02:50.860> earlier

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
building that Oh Maj as I said earlier

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.400 
building that Oh Maj as I said earlier
they're<00:02:51.880> really<00:02:51.970> hit<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:52.360> as<00:02:52.510> far<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.959> far<00:02:53.290> as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
they're really hit it as far as far as

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.410 
they're really hit it as far as far as
sound<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.800> concerned<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:54.910> within<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.239> game

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
sound is concerned now within the game

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.750 
sound is concerned now within the game
there<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.810> also<00:02:56.080> an<00:02:56.470> upgrade<00:02:57.130> system<00:02:57.610> where

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
there is also an upgrade system where

there is also an upgrade system where
you<00:02:57.850> can<00:02:57.880> use<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.360> coins<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.780> you're

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
quickly it is a little bit limited
