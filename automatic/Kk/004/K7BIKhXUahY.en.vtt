Make Up For Ever has always chosen to work with passionate people. You can feel it everywhere,

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.889
from the chemists, to salespeople in stores to our staff. 

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:31.000
Joining Make Up For Ever is almost like joining a sacred order! 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Make Up For Ever was born in 1984. For 30 years I’ve been going from stage to stage.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.689
I went to art school and I had no idea I’d become a makeup artist. 

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:41.970
I found myself in the world of theater and the performing arts 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.010
and I met makeup specialists with academic training 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.650
who wanted to learn body painting. 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.300
They said “Teach us everything you know!”

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700
So I decided to open a school.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.800
Then I realized that although we were pros at the school,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.000
we didn’t have a lot of products. I really wanted to work differently 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.960
and do new things, using products that simply didn’t exist.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.330
So I found myself making my own products. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.200
Makeup artists instantly loved them,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.000
but more importantly, these products satisfied a real need.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.020
Artists wanted products

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.000
that would improve their work, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
that would give them more freedom to be creative. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.330
What makes these products a bit magical

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.000
is that they have such unusual formulations. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.510
The Make Up For Ever Academy

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.790
is the Make Up For Ever school. 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.400
Students learn every type  

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.060
of makeup technique so that anyone 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.170
who’s interested in this métier 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.660
can then go out and work in cinema, in theater. 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.000
There are a lot of very different techniques and products.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
These two paths, education and products, really define the history of the brand. 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.240
We just celebrated Make Up For Ever’s 30th anniversary.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.610
There were a lot of very emotional moments during the special evening we organized. 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.000
It was a real show that featured the fashionable image of Make Up For Ever,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
something that’s never really been showcased.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
There were a lot of very dear friends, makeup artists 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.800
who’ve always been there and worked with me.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.000
It’s always moving… 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.500
And then there was something I love, 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
characters, women, kind of strange creatures 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.800
wandering around. It was quite outrageous, a little baroque.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.249
It was definitely an amazing party, 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.500
totally Make Up For Ever.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.000
Ultimately, I don’t really think much has changed. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.549
But when I say that people answer

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.879
“How can you say that after 30 years nothing has changed?” 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.429
And my response is: “Well, you’re here,

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:48.219
and you were here before. In fact you’re still the same!” 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:49.369
I’m proud. 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.000
I’m proud because I love to succeed, 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and I really love stories with a happy ending!
