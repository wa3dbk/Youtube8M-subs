heart health we could start there then

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.500 
heart health we could start there then
we<00:01:39.350> would<00:01:39.530> look<00:01:39.770> at<00:01:39.980> actually<00:01:40.490> lowering<00:01:41.240> the

lots of fruits and vegetables that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.460 
lots of fruits and vegetables that
happen<00:03:10.550> to<00:03:10.640> be<00:03:10.730> high<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.000> potassium<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.870> we

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
happen to be high in potassium so we

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110 
happen to be high in potassium so we
look<00:03:12.770> at<00:03:12.920> balancing<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.580> sodium<00:03:13.970> in<00:03:14.090> your

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
look at balancing the sodium in your

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.360 
look at balancing the sodium in your
diet<00:03:14.240> with<00:03:14.660> potassium<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.500> lot<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.010> your<00:03:16.130> fruits

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
diet with potassium a lot of your fruits

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.860 
diet with potassium a lot of your fruits
and<00:03:16.520> vegetables<00:03:17.060> are<00:03:17.270> going<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.450> be<00:03:17.570> high<00:03:17.720> in

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
and vegetables are going to be high in

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.230 
and vegetables are going to be high in
potassium<00:03:18.020> and<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.280> incorporate<00:03:19.910> more<00:03:20.120> of

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
potassium and so to incorporate more of

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.750 
potassium and so to incorporate more of
those<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.690> your<00:03:21.140> day<00:03:21.350> has<00:03:22.010> lots<00:03:22.430> of<00:03:22.580> health

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
those in your day has lots of health

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.090 
those in your day has lots of health
benefits<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> in<00:03:23.959> particular<00:03:24.080> lowering<00:03:25.010> your

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
benefits and in particular lowering your

blood<00:03:25.160> pressure<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:27.760> also<00:03:28.760> recommend<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.690> you

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
blood pressure I also recommend that you

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.600 
blood pressure I also recommend that you
play<00:03:30.080> around<00:03:30.410> with<00:03:30.860> different<00:03:30.890> kinds<00:03:31.550> of

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
play around with different kinds of

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.400 
play around with different kinds of
seasoning<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.330> spices<00:03:32.450> we<00:03:32.989> don't<00:03:33.140> want<00:03:33.290> you

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
seasoning and spices we don't want you

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.259 
seasoning and spices we don't want you
in<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.769> bland<00:03:34.010> old<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.430> you<00:03:34.489> won't<00:03:34.850> comply

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
in just a bland old I you won't comply

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.990 
in just a bland old I you won't comply
yeah<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.380> maybe<00:03:36.950> trade<00:03:37.430> out<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.610> salt<00:03:37.940> shaker

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
yeah so maybe trade out the salt shaker

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.030 
yeah so maybe trade out the salt shaker
