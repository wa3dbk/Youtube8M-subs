fishing on a small river there is a
great<00:00:13.170> chance<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> catch<00:00:13.860> big<00:00:14.129> fish<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.090> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
great chance to catch big fish and we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.350 
great chance to catch big fish and we
have<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.540> adapt<00:00:15.809> everything<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:17.360> very

we<00:01:12.410> have<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.710> try<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.010> get<00:01:13.310> our<00:01:13.490> flies<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:14.000> just

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
we have to try to get our flies to just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.680 
we have to try to get our flies to just
such<00:01:14.510> places<00:01:15.520> our<00:01:16.520> presentation<00:01:17.240> has<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.570> be

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
such places our presentation has to be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.670 
such places our presentation has to be
as<00:01:17.780> natural<00:01:18.200> as<00:01:18.320> possible

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.460 

and<00:01:24.160> here<00:01:24.430> is<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> first<00:01:24.820> fish<00:01:25.150> it<00:01:25.960> seems<00:01:26.290> to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
and here is the first fish it seems to

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.450 
and here is the first fish it seems to
be<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> very<00:01:26.860> nice<00:01:27.040> grayling

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
be a very nice grayling

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.220 
be a very nice grayling
it<00:01:30.460> struggles<00:01:31.060> strongly<00:01:31.510> in<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.660> fast<00:01:31.900> stream

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
it struggles strongly in the fast stream

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:52.810 
it struggles strongly in the fast stream
but<00:01:32.680> soon<00:01:32.980> gives<00:01:33.250> up

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:12.410 

you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.449 

you<00:02:12.930> will<00:02:13.110> remove<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> hook<00:02:13.709> carefully<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
you will remove the hook carefully and

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:26.580 
you will remove the hook carefully and
put<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> fish<00:02:14.970> back<00:02:15.000> where<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.569> belongs

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.010 

we<00:02:27.130> try<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.400> raid<00:02:27.730> through<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.420> little<00:02:28.810> as

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
we try to raid through that little as

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.020 
we try to raid through that little as
possible<00:02:29.260> especially<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.430> such<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> strong

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
possible especially in such a strong

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.839 
possible especially in such a strong
stream<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.590> better<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.950> extend<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.610> course

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
stream it is better to extend the course

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.150 
stream it is better to extend the course
of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.120> Flies<00:02:34.420> by<00:02:35.050> dipping<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.560> rod<00:02:35.739> tip<00:02:36.010> down

to the water surface for fishing the
farther<00:02:38.530> places<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.910> even<00:02:40.090> extend<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
farther places we can even extend the

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.740 
farther places we can even extend the
line<00:02:40.750> by<00:02:40.959> several<00:02:41.319> meters<00:02:41.650> at<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.849> end<00:02:43.000> that

the stream carry the Flies up from the
bottom<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.940> then<00:02:46.390> liven<00:02:46.810> them<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.080> by<00:02:47.260> moving

bottom and then liven them up by moving

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.160 
bottom and then liven them up by moving
the<00:02:47.709> tip<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> rod<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.450> jerk<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.989> rod

and there seems to be a nice fish on the
line<00:02:52.410> these<00:02:53.410> moments<00:02:53.709> will<00:02:54.069> appreciate<00:02:54.370> the
