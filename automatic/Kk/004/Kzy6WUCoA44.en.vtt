00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.590
 Nowadays there are few exponents of the 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.889
 survival hover who manage to have good 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.990
 results one of them is soul as a 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:17.320
 very interesting proposal that is worth the 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.150
 worth knowing a psychiatric asylum that 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.490
 had been closed for some time 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.710
 reopened and things have happened very 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.140
 strange in the place so the 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.240
 journalist mike software is available to 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.370
 unveil the mystery ignoring the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.789
 terrifying experience that is by 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.770
 live in the game we do not have weapons just 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.899
 we have a video camera for 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.969
 have evidence of what happens and about 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.640
 everything to use the night vision mode 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.440
 to be able to see where you're going since 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.170
 there are sections without light where you can not 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.569
 see anything so the idea is to find 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.999
 an exit avoid clashes and 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.039
 stay alive the fact of not 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.839
 having weapons largely helps 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.999
 generate an atmosphere of tension and 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.429
 pressing stress for the development of 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.469
 game we have to take care of the 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.720
 Battery life of the camera at 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.760
 activate night vision as it 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.850
 they run out quickly and you have to be 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.540
 looking for spare parts we must be all the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.820
 weather 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.130
 ar are around us stealth 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.130
 it's vital to get away unharmed from some 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600
 areas should be discovered should we 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.580
 run and get away from our 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.070
 persecutor to hide us in 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.340
 some locker or in the shadows praying 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.320
 so they do not find us 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.240
 the setting of the game is part 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.039
 fundamental of the experience the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.859
 visual section manages to create a scenario 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.049
 disturbing and explicit above all 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.149
 we highlight your lighting work and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.850
 the detail in characters that will leave you 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.189
 agitated to have little vision of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.289
 scenarios for the mentally ill and 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 not knowing if they will attack or simply 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:50.520
 will stand without doing anything to flee and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.009
 feel that you are being stepped on your heels 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.740
 and more than one scare when you least 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.750
 you wait all accompanied by a band 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.049
 sound that will keep you alert and you 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 will fill with tension all the time maybe 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.520
 its bad points are its short duration 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.519
 and that when regenerating health automatically 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.349
 It is difficult for some and classrooms is 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.629
 an experience that will make your hair 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.790
 and will make you shout more than 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.060
 once if you enjoy the games of 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.769
 terror and intense experiences 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.049
 You should definitely play it like that 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.470
 we rate this chilling title 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.600
