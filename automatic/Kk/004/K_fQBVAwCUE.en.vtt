with<00:02:10.940> some<00:02:11.299> black<00:02:11.569> patent<00:02:12.260> pumps<00:02:12.769> these<00:02:12.980> are

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
with some black patent pumps these are

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.890 
with some black patent pumps these are
pointed<00:02:13.579> ones<00:02:13.790> you've<00:02:14.060> seen<00:02:14.269> them<00:02:14.390> many<00:02:14.510> times

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.530 
pointed ones you've seen them many times
before<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:16.099> they're<00:02:16.610> just<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.849> classic<00:02:17.329> pair

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
before and they're just a classic pair

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.479 
before and they're just a classic pair
of<00:02:17.660> pumps<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.290> outfit<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.829> guess<00:02:18.980> is<00:02:19.190> really

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
of pumps this outfit I guess is really

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.460 
of pumps this outfit I guess is really
all<00:02:19.670> about<00:02:19.970> classic<00:02:20.329> pieces<00:02:20.810> none<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.410> the

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
all about classic pieces none of the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.080 
all about classic pieces none of the
pieces<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.860> I'm<00:02:22.069> wearing<00:02:22.310> are<00:02:22.519> too<00:02:22.760> trendy

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
pieces that I'm wearing are too trendy

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.539 
pieces that I'm wearing are too trendy
and<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:24.110> think<00:02:24.349> most<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.799> them<00:02:24.890> would<00:02:24.950> stand<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
and I think most of them would stand the

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.380 
and I think most of them would stand the
test<00:02:25.579> of<00:02:25.910> time

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
test of time

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.080 
test of time
so<00:02:27.079> these<00:02:27.470> patty<00:02:27.829> pumps<00:02:28.250> dress<00:02:28.489> up<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.849> jeans

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
so these patty pumps dress up the jeans

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.569 
so these patty pumps dress up the jeans
a<00:02:29.329> little<00:02:29.510> bit<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.140> add<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.530> little<00:02:30.680> height<00:02:31.130> and

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
a little bit and add a little height and

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.840 
a little bit and add a little height and
I<00:02:32.359> also<00:02:32.600> wore<00:02:33.139> this<00:02:33.590> really<00:02:33.980> nice<00:02:34.190> envelope

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.870 
I also wore this really nice envelope

clutch which features crocodile embossed

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.150 
clutch which features crocodile embossed
leather<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:38.959> not<00:02:39.139> crocodile<00:02:39.739> it's<00:02:39.980> just

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
leather so it's not crocodile it's just

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.099 
leather so it's not crocodile it's just
leather<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.819> crocodile<00:02:41.329> embossment

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
leather with the crocodile embossment

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.069

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.839 
and I really like that and this this
clutch<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.620> sort<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:45.889> dressy<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.609> night<00:02:46.819> out
