00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
guests to being behind the ball we're

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.970 
guests to being behind the ball we're
going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> be<00:00:44.430> shooting<00:00:44.580> it<00:00:44.880> weird<00:00:45.090> co2<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.980> i

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
going to be shooting it weird co2 and i

going to be shooting it weird co2 and i
believe<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.310> highest<00:00:47.700> recorded<00:00:48.210> velocity

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
believe the highest recorded velocity

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.490 
believe the highest recorded velocity
was<00:00:49.500> approximately<00:00:50.190> 420<00:00:51.170> 450<00:00:52.170> feet<00:00:52.350> per

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
was approximately 420 450 feet per

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.230 
was approximately 420 450 feet per
second<00:00:52.890> I'll<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.880> go<00:00:53.970> back<00:00:54.180> and

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
second I'll actually have to go back and

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.470 
second I'll actually have to go back and
consult<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.900> nose<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.670> verify<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.880> but<00:00:57.450> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
consult my nose to verify that but I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
consult my nose to verify that but I
thought<00:00:57.630> I'd<00:00:57.810> put<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> four<00:00:58.350> clips<00:00:58.950> up<00:00:59.130> so

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
thought I'd put the four clips up so

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.380 
thought I'd put the four clips up so
that<00:00:59.460> people<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> take<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> look<00:01:00.150> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
that people going to take a look and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.140 
that people going to take a look and
make<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.410> comments<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.860> them<00:01:02.040> they're<00:01:03.000> all

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
make some comments on them they're all

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.140 
make some comments on them they're all
different<00:01:03.979> firing<00:01:04.979> events<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.000> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
different firing events and I'm just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.929 
different firing events and I'm just
going<00:01:06.329> to<00:01:06.360> run<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:07.219> video<00:01:08.219> footage<00:01:08.429> after

okay hopefully you can actually see some
of<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.860> detail<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.580> can<00:01:51.700> see<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.060> co2<00:01:52.990> flakes

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
of the detail you can see the co2 flakes

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.100 
of the detail you can see the co2 flakes
moving<00:01:54.460> around<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.940> slow<00:01:55.150> motion<00:01:55.420> as<00:01:55.810> well<00:01:56.020> as

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
moving around in slow motion as well as

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.830 
moving around in slow motion as well as
actually<00:01:56.790> especially<00:01:57.790> in<00:01:58.090> video<00:01:58.360> three<00:01:58.630> you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
actually especially in video three you

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.530 
actually especially in video three you
can<00:01:58.870> actually<00:01:59.260> watch<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.980> o-ring<00:02:00.700> under

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
can actually watch the o-ring under

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.350 
can actually watch the o-ring under
pressure<00:02:01.780> creating<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.740> seal<00:02:03.120> it's<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.180> little

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
pressure creating the seal it's a little

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
pressure creating the seal it's a little
bit<00:02:04.480> disappointing<00:02:05.020> with<00:02:05.110> some<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.320> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
bit disappointing with some of the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.320 
bit disappointing with some of the
videos<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:05.830> put<00:02:06.040> up<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.250> YouTube<00:02:06.280> that<00:02:06.640> some<00:02:07.210> of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
videos I put up on YouTube that some of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.390 
videos I put up on YouTube that some of
the<00:02:07.420> detail<00:02:07.900> which<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.680> very<00:02:08.890> important<00:02:09.310> in

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
the detail which is very important in

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.380 
the detail which is very important in
these<00:02:09.490> cases<00:02:09.790> is<00:02:09.970> getting<00:02:10.600> lost<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:13.240> there's

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
these cases is getting lost but there's

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.300 
these cases is getting lost but there's
a<00:02:13.450> lot<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.660> really<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:15.010> some<00:02:15.280> of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
a lot you really can see in some of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.830 
a lot you really can see in some of
these<00:02:15.490> images<00:02:15.940> especially<00:02:16.210> when<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.720> go

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
these images especially when we go

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.600 
these images especially when we go
through<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.380> pick<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.070> individual

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
through and we pick out individual
