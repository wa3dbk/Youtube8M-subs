00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
replacement for Didier and it's kind of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.130 
replacement for Didier and it's kind of
weird<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.950> tourists<00:01:08.580> came<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.030> did<00:01:09.659> he<00:01:09.689> Eilat

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
leaves and adi da comes back replaces

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
leaves and adi da comes back replaces
torres<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> probably<00:01:14.159> doing<00:01:14.490> better<00:01:14.670> than

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
torres and probably doing better than

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.340 
torres and probably doing better than
him<00:01:15.000> he<00:01:15.150> took<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.140> good

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
him he took the it was a really good

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
finish from Didier and he's still got it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.910 
finish from Didier and he's still got it
and<00:01:18.360> obviously<00:01:18.720> lost<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> hell<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> lot<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and obviously lost the hell of a lot of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.010 
and obviously lost the hell of a lot of
pace<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.159> he's<00:01:20.520> ever<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.210> win<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
race or running behind a team but I

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120
