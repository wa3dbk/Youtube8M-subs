that<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.650> wouldn't<00:02:32.190> like<00:02:32.520> that<00:02:32.760> much<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:33.750> I

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that I wouldn't like that much so then I

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.420

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.670 
what I first started doing off was
painting<00:03:30.820> my<00:03:31.000> old<00:03:31.570> iPhone<00:03:31.780> case<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.410> color

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
painting my old iPhone case the color

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.670 
painting my old iPhone case the color
chose<00:03:32.950> white<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.820> make<00:03:34.780> sure<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.050> do<00:03:35.200> a<00:03:35.230> couple

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
chose white and make sure to do a couple

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.260 
chose white and make sure to do a couple
coats<00:03:35.980> especially<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.459> it's<00:03:36.640> a<00:03:36.730> darker<00:03:37.060> color

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
coats especially if it's a darker color

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.270 
coats especially if it's a darker color
underneath<00:03:37.630> because<00:03:37.959> if<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.770> choose<00:03:38.950> white

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
underneath because if you choose white

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.650 
underneath because if you choose white
it's<00:03:39.490> going<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.730> show<00:03:39.910> through<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.240> I<00:03:40.390> did

that<00:05:00.180> would<00:05:00.389> be<00:05:00.539> very<00:05:00.870> bad<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.440> then<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.159> is

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
that would be very bad and then this is

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.279 
that would be very bad and then this is
optional<00:05:02.880> but<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.330> can<00:05:03.449> take<00:05:03.569> Mod<00:05:03.810> Podge<00:05:04.020> and

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
optional but you can take Mod Podge and

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.070 
optional but you can take Mod Podge and
just<00:05:04.530> smooth<00:05:05.220> it<00:05:05.250> on<00:05:05.550> top<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:05.819> the<00:05:06.090> hole<00:05:06.419> inside

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
just smooth it on top of the hole inside

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.680 
just smooth it on top of the hole inside
the<00:05:07.259> case<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.710> then<00:05:07.830> put<00:05:08.009> the<00:05:08.190> bowl<00:05:08.789> on<00:05:08.940> top<00:05:09.000> so

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the case and then put the bowl on top so

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.089 
the case and then put the bowl on top so
that<00:05:09.810> it<00:05:09.960> would<00:05:10.080> be<00:05:10.199> permanent<00:05:10.590> but<00:05:10.650> I<00:05:10.740> decided

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
that it would be permanent but I decided

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.529 
that it would be permanent but I decided
not<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.340> because<00:05:11.580> I<00:05:11.880> wanted<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.240> to<00:05:12.419> be

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
not to because I wanted it to be

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:20.680 
not to because I wanted it to be
interchangeable<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.289> that's<00:05:13.500> it

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.480
