to<00:01:47.880> reutilization<00:01:51.079> he<00:01:52.079> sees<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.439> life<00:01:52.590> told

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to reutilization he sees your life told

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.080 
to reutilization he sees your life told
was<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.159> low<00:01:53.310> he's<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:54.060> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
was really low he's just going to go in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.719 
was really low he's just going to go in
and<00:01:54.450> move<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.350> logic<00:01:55.680> attack<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and move for the logic attack which is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
and move for the logic attack which is
good<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.060> us<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.630> puts<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> cool

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
good for us because it puts it on a cool

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
good for us because it puts it on a cool
down<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:59.369> he<00:01:59.520> can't<00:01:59.729> attack<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> whisk<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
down so he can't attack the whisk with

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
down so he can't attack the whisk with
it<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.560> wisp<00:02:01.799> lines<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.240> well

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
it the wisp lines up really really well

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.620 
it the wisp lines up really really well
here<00:02:03.750> between<00:02:04.049> instability<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> logic<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
here between instability and logic so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.700 
here between instability and logic so
the<00:02:06.750> first<00:02:06.960> thing<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.140> want<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.560> get

the first thing you want to do is get

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.080 
the first thing you want to do is get
your<00:02:07.829> soul<00:02:08.069> Ward<00:02:08.310> up<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> block

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
your soul Ward up that's going to block

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.660 
your soul Ward up that's going to block
the<00:02:09.239> attacks<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.619> second<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.580> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the attacks the second one you want to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
the attacks the second one you want to
do<00:02:11.819> is<00:02:12.090> flash<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.110> add<00:02:13.230> parts

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
do is flash that's going to add parts

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.949 
do is flash that's going to add parts
blinded<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.610> here's<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.000> where<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.780> comes

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
blinded now here's is where it all comes

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.710 
blinded now here's is where it all comes
together<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.530> instability<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.580> 0%<00:02:18.269> hit

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
together that instability is at a 0% hit

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.670 
together that instability is at a 0% hit
chance<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:21.209> light<00:02:21.450> up<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:21.989> blinding

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
chance with the light up and blinding

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.680 
chance with the light up and blinding
him<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.190> from<00:02:23.879> here<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.569> actually

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
him so from here you have to actually

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.899 
him so from here you have to actually
pass<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.110> next<00:02:25.500> round<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.700> one

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
pass the next round as there is one

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.220 
pass the next round as there is one
round<00:02:27.150> where<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.390> do<00:02:27.629> nothing<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
round where you can do nothing and it's

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.960 
round where you can do nothing and it's
just<00:02:28.379> really<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.890> matter<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.519> rinsing<00:02:29.909> and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
just really a matter of rinsing and
