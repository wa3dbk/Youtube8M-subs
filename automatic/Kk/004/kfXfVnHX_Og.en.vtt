00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.340
 Hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.980
 always nixi longhi heading droid design 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.610
 Today we have guest launcher under the order 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.230
 called he would knots cher me 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.019
 offered to make a video about him that is 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.519
 in the last issue in the comments there are mine 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.609
 so to say the audience asked 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.279
 Well, how can I refuse that 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.229
 let's go already mean here's the main one 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.630
 page of this launcher and immediately 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:35.530
 this icon strikes us that is 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.040
 bottom of this screen is a menu button 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.610
 phone handbook 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:46.030
 and internet internet browser principle 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.890
 not bad but we are already us android 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 official firmware such as kitkat 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.840
 lollipop that is unchanged taught us 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.320
 to the fact that the buttons are these icons they 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.210
 big but here they are small well it's like 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.579
 it says to someone as a principle not that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.829
 like but although I probably already to those 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.439
 used to because these somehow see me 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.979
 not really usually somehow the thoughts themselves 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.329
 You understand also the eyes are thrown by the buttons 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.609
 install a widget on the time and that's const 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.429
 to everyone it seems that its heat is already 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.049
 With ads, they type there set the type 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.210
 install some third-party 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.399
 apps but friends this launcher 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.929
 free a large number of it 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.799
 function which I will a little later 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.259
 I will tell therefore I think so small 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.829
 Minusik what they offer to install 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.319
 some kind of third-party application it may 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.389
 be a big plus 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.929
 as well as other launcher in general to with 

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:47.259
 paid for which you also need to pay 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:50.380
 so naturally the top is even higher line 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.069
 search principle is not changed on the left 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.189
 we are located the horde icon 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.000
 Now I will turn on the Internet icon 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.480
 located with us 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 I think on the official website as far as I am 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:09.920
 I remember it seems to be yes there it is on the official 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.900
 the page of this launcher, that is, it 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.790
 shows there all sorts of topics and so on 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 not really interesting so far and right 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.100
 we are the boot menu that is 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.400
 setting our launcher is not we will return 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.430
 a little bit later so let's click 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.320
 left-right look more precisely to the right 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.150
 we are also the same again 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.780
 ikonochka all principle in the same style 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.080
 here there is a widget that is, widgets already 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.330
 located in beads launcher such that there 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:51.250
 help and then there is help then go as they are 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.350
 called in Russian then this action 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.209
 I think you understand 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.470
 so like all let's see itself 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.090
 menu menu we look like this 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.190
 flip through left-right effects special 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.480
 no when 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.459
 svaypah is in my opinion a plus because 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.380
 what when do some 3d effect this 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.200
 Firstly , God is not interested in the second 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:16.250
 the phone can crash on it 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.370
 so such are the plus and by the way that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.680
 I liked that in this launcher 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.769
 in all the launcher trying to find them but me 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.080
 unfortunately something is impossible 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.040
 let's say standard launcher them there 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.440
 google star google start there folders you can 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.329
 create only on the desktop so 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.250
 then you can create folders on the menu is on 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.030
 my look is so very attractive 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.820
 plus to create a folder choose 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650
 settings new folder here we have 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.660
 all our applications are loaded we 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.580
 we choose which applications we need 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.050
 let's say 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:57.740
 I take the driver well, and let the flash player 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.730
 okay great new folder we created it 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:07.130
 we can rename as it is convenient for us here 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:10.090
 let's say missed a little so 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.490
 let's say it will be called a test 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.310
 care about is not a big imagination about 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.350
 folder name but the folder will go when 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310
 opening the departure here and so when you click 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.799
 on the plus sign 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.250
 we can add to k or app in 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.440
 I will not say this folder here 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.460
 awesome folder decoration but 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.950
 agree to look pretty good 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.200
 in my opinion it is very convenient so 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.550
 we have a menu widget 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.380
 For some reason, this principle is not called 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.170
 widgets a widget i don't know maybe 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.340
 there is a letter and and I somehow did not fit but 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.720
 I think the widgets were somehow 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.440
 decently saw by the way forgot to say 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.630
 that supply install this launcher to you 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.620
 some such tuturial will be shown 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.710
 and how to use gestures that is, if we 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.200
 as far as I remember two fingers with two 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.800
 fingers moving down on hiding dubu 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.390
 shift 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.110
 if we bottom up with one finger this 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.360
 opening the menu itself is so small 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.560
 gadgetry in this launcher will not say that 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.350
 this is some kind of new so here we have 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.230
 on the left is as I understand it thick 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.950
 content then there is some kind of extra 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.240
 content to this launcher theme so on 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.360
 so let's move on to ourselves 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.220
 settings in the end so change 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.340
 means add items 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.560
 well here I think everything is clear we add 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.790
 elements of the game application in general are not 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.150
 especially it is somehow incomprehensible I think for 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.180
 any people 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.550
 wallpaper friendly editing 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.740
 you can customize editing 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.530
 completely your home page 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.009
 she add tags here any effects 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.189
 as you can see 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.309
 that is, the place and the default so also 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:04.919
 The frame for the icons in this launcher is very 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.360
 a large number of all sorts of different there 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.849
 icons that can be downloaded 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:11.699
 Additionally, well, that's more accurate, they are this 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:15.569
 vodka as I understand 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:18.089
 like so wallpaper is also still there 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.180
 interesting so inner court in general 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.099
 then agree that for free 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.360
 launcher there is a very large number 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.149
 any settings 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.029
 this is a very real cool setting will 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:33.930
 what we have here so it is with us 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:36.990
 understandable homepage type so 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:41.069
 add delete and this is what i was looking for 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:43.469
 here it is interesting that is completely 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:46.150
 setting up the launcher and also give them 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.240
 home screen is clear on it 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.360
 groom gestures here are a large number 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.700
 the principle of gestures in my opinion of this 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:00.580
 quite enough here as I said 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:02.620
 gesture down and up here let's say gesture 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.470
 up position organizer meaning he 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.790
 opens our menu here you can connect 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.560
 turn on principle is convenient 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.420
 recover unread in general then 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.460
 there is a large number of settings, I think 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:19.270
 everyone can customize something 

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.670
 what else do we have here so much 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.490
 system is understandable organizer 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.620
 applications and menus mus years Well, sort of 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.550
 would i all tell me so much may 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:34.080
 be detailed but I never say so 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:37.030
 not really grasping any there 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.160
 Prikolchiki precisely concerning such 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.030
 launcher I just put some 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.190
 launcher and 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.100
 I use it throughout the day 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.020
 three or four maybe weeks and talking about 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.120
 my opinion that it seemed to me 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.370
 interesting that I generally got so 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.350
 that here and so on this all was with you 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.440
 nickname salon subscribe to the channel and all 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.440
 until
