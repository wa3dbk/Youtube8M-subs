I've<00:02:31.940> been<00:02:32.090> using<00:02:32.239> this<00:02:32.390> phone<00:02:32.569> as<00:02:32.690> my<00:02:32.810> primary

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
I've been using this phone as my primary

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.600 
I've been using this phone as my primary
device<00:02:33.379> for<00:02:33.620> about<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.830> week<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.250> about<00:02:34.340> two

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
device for about a week for about two

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.819 
device for about a week for about two
weeks<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.030> it's<00:02:35.599> a<00:02:35.660> very<00:02:35.930> good<00:02:36.200> battery<00:02:36.620> and

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
weeks and it's a very good battery and

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.770 
weeks and it's a very good battery and
then<00:02:37.640> right<00:02:37.849> here<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> have<00:02:38.269> your<00:02:38.420> SIM<00:02:38.750> tray

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
then right here you have your SIM tray

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.110 
then right here you have your SIM tray
that<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.230> can't<00:02:39.470> open<00:02:39.769> with<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.519> battery<00:02:40.819> in

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
that you can't open with the battery in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.729 
that you can't open with the battery in
so<00:02:41.690> that's<00:02:42.019> just<00:02:42.230> something<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.829> keep<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.670> mind

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
so that's just something to keep in mind

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.160 
so that's just something to keep in mind
so<00:02:45.739> this<00:02:45.950> device<00:02:46.280> runs<00:02:46.810> Symbian<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.930> course

it's pretty quickly it loads the semi
mobile<00:04:30.530> version<00:04:30.980> what's<00:04:31.550> cool<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.850> if<00:04:32.570> we<00:04:32.780> go

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
mobile version what's cool is if we go

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.080 
mobile version what's cool is if we go
over<00:04:32.990> here<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.770> a<00:04:33.800> particular<00:04:34.130> video<00:04:34.550> it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
over here to a particular video it

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.850 
over here to a particular video it
actually<00:04:35.150> supports<00:04:35.600> flash<00:04:36.170> and<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.590> plays

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
actually supports flash and it plays

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.700 
actually supports flash and it plays
pretty<00:04:37.100> nicely<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:39.110> we'll<00:04:39.320> just<00:04:39.410> give<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
pretty nicely so we'll just give that a

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:48.220 
pretty nicely so we'll just give that a
second<00:04:40.040> to<00:04:40.130> buffer<00:04:40.370> again<00:04:40.580> all<00:04:40.790> over<00:04:40.850> 3G<00:04:47.230> we

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
second to buffer again all over 3G we

00:04:48.230 --> 00:05:05.560 
second to buffer again all over 3G we
can<00:04:48.380> even<00:04:48.500> play<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:48.920> in<00:04:49.010> full<00:04:49.190> screen<00:05:04.390> and<00:05:05.390> if

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
can even play it in full screen and if

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.820 
can even play it in full screen and if
you<00:05:05.600> haven't<00:05:05.900> seen<00:05:06.050> that<00:05:06.080> video<00:05:06.320> that's<00:05:06.680> how

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
you haven't seen that video that's how

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.250 
you haven't seen that video that's how

video if I do say so myself and so the
browser<00:05:13.940> really<00:05:14.420> does<00:05:14.660> a<00:05:14.690> good<00:05:14.960> job<00:05:15.020> I<00:05:15.530> haven't

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
browser really does a good job I haven't

it's not a hundred percent cork free but
it<00:05:19.790> does<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:19.970> really<00:05:20.060> good<00:05:20.450> job<00:05:20.510> it's<00:05:21.320> hard<00:05:21.440> to

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
it does a really good job it's hard to

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.960 
it does a really good job it's hard to
tell<00:05:21.830> when<00:05:22.010> it's<00:05:22.130> gonna<00:05:22.250> load<00:05:22.400> a<00:05:22.430> mobile<00:05:22.790> page

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.190 
tell when it's gonna load a mobile page
sometimes<00:05:23.240> it'll<00:05:23.540> load<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.810> full<00:05:23.990> page

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
sometimes it'll load the full page

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.630 
sometimes it'll load the full page
sometimes<00:05:24.590> will<00:05:24.740> load<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.980> mobile<00:05:25.280> version

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
sometimes will load the mobile version

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.400 
sometimes will load the mobile version
but<00:05:26.060> since<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.330> does<00:05:26.480> support<00:05:26.750> Java<00:05:27.080> and

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
but since it does support Java and

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.960 
but since it does support Java and
flashing<00:05:27.920> it<00:05:27.980> does<00:05:28.100> a<00:05:28.130> really<00:05:28.220> good<00:05:28.580> job<00:05:28.790> with

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
flashing it does a really good job with

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.820 
flashing it does a really good job with
that<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.600> really<00:05:29.660> doesn't<00:05:30.110> matter<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.740> I'm

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
that it really doesn't matter and I'm

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.590 
that it really doesn't matter and I'm
just<00:05:31.040> again<00:05:31.370> really<00:05:31.610> impressed<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.090> see<00:05:32.120> flash

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
just again really impressed to see flash

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.150 
just again really impressed to see flash
on<00:05:32.900> a<00:05:32.960> mobile<00:05:33.260> platform<00:05:33.410> and<00:05:33.830> it<00:05:33.890> makes<00:05:34.040> me

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
on a mobile platform and it makes me

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.890 
on a mobile platform and it makes me
wonder<00:05:34.280> why<00:05:34.550> flash<00:05:34.820> isn't<00:05:35.090> on<00:05:35.300> other<00:05:35.510> devices

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
wonder why flash isn't on other devices

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.110 
wonder why flash isn't on other devices
that<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.770> know<00:05:36.890> are<00:05:37.250> equally<00:05:37.640> powerful<00:05:37.820> or

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
even more powerful so that's just

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.610 
even more powerful so that's just
something<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.550> keep<00:05:40.610> in<00:05:40.820> mind<00:05:41.260> so<00:05:42.260> there's<00:05:42.440> my
