horsepower<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.620> size<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.639> designed<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.150> be

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
horsepower this size is designed to be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.590 
horsepower this size is designed to be
used<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.910> one<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.180> one<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> half

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
used with the one and one and a half

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
used with the one and one and a half
horsepower<00:00:18.930> we<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> larger<00:00:20.250> one<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
horsepower we have a larger one if you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.519 
horsepower we have a larger one if you
go<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> two<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> check<00:00:22.500> valve

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
go to a two now this is the check valve

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980 
go to a two now this is the check valve
the<00:00:22.859> check<00:00:23.039> valve<00:00:23.269> keeps<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.480> from<00:00:24.660> being

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the check valve keeps you from being

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.650 
the check valve keeps you from being
required<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.740> prime<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> each<00:00:26.580> time<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.180> then

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
required to prime it each time and then

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.589 
required to prime it each time and then
on<00:00:27.960> top<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.099> become<00:00:29.820> standard

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
on top of that we have become standard

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
on top of that we have become standard
with<00:00:30.779> 33<00:00:31.320> feet<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.650> hose<00:00:31.859> with<00:00:32.219> quick<00:00:32.489> connects

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
with 33 feet of hose with quick connects

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.450 
with 33 feet of hose with quick connects
and<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> inch<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.219> point

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and this is all to inch up to this point

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
and this is all to inch up to this point
so<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.790> intake<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.930> inch<00:00:37.140> intake<00:00:37.620> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so the intake is a two inch intake and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
so the intake is a two inch intake and
as<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.760> setting<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:39.809> right<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.500> front<00:00:40.680> of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
as I'm setting this up right in front of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
as I'm setting this up right in front of
your<00:00:40.920> eyes<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:41.910> fast<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
your eyes this is really how fast you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.150 
your eyes this is really how fast you
can<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> together<00:00:43.070> everything<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
can put it together everything is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
can put it together everything is
color-coded<00:00:44.460> everything<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.420> can't<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
color-coded everything you can't put it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.110 
color-coded everything you can't put it
together<00:00:46.410> wrong<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.489> basically<00:00:47.850> no

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
together wrong there's just basically no

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
together wrong there's just basically no
way<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:49.170> from<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.100> connect

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
way and then from that you would connect

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.840 
way and then from that you would connect
it<00:00:50.520> into<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> pump<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.410> discharge<00:00:53.309> from

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it into the pump and then discharge from

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
it into the pump and then discharge from
this<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> inch<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.170> point

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
this is to inch up to this point

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.549 
this is to inch up to this point
discharge<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> half<00:00:57.149> inch<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.989> when

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
discharge one and a half inch now when

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
discharge one and a half inch now when
you<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.059> deciding<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.329> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you get to deciding on what kind of a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.680 
you get to deciding on what kind of a
pump<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.309> we<00:01:02.309> sell<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> corded<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> other

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
pump you need we sell it corded in other

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
pump you need we sell it corded in other
words<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> comes<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> cord<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.519> you

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
words it comes with the cord to you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.039 
words it comes with the cord to you
that's<00:01:06.090> different<00:01:06.330> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.720> went<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that's different if you went to a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.810 
that's different if you went to a
different<00:01:07.470> store<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.799> big-box<00:01:08.250> store<00:01:08.580> whatever

different store a big-box store whatever
you<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.689> probably<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> wire<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.860> we

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
you would probably have to wire it up we

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.899 
you would probably have to wire it up we
sell<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.030> both<00:01:12.210> 110<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.080> 220<00:01:13.520> power<00:01:14.520> cord

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
sell it as both 110 or 220 power cord

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.060 
sell it as both 110 or 220 power cord
the<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.350> half<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the one in the one and a half you can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
the one in the one and a half you can
you<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> option<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
you have the option when you get to the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.960 
you have the option when you get to the
two<00:01:18.840> horsepower<00:01:19.140> greater<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.369> sell<00:01:20.790> that

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
two horsepower greater we only sell that

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.100 
two horsepower greater we only sell that
and<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.659> only<00:01:21.840> cord<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:23.330> with<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> 220

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and we only cord that with a with a 220

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
and we only cord that with a with a 220
power<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> basically<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
power so this is basically the
