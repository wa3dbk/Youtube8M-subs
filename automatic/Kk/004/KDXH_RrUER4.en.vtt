00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
like to use it with a lip liner that's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
like to use it with a lip liner that's
just<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.560> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.950> more<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> pink<00:01:53.670> side

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
just a little bit more on the pink side

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.319 
just a little bit more on the pink side
so<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> makes<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:55.020> less<00:01:55.860> gray<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.939> next

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so that it makes it less gray the next

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.810 
so that it makes it less gray the next
one<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.840> shimmy<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.670> my

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
favorites also it's more pinkish than

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.010 
favorites also it's more pinkish than
either<00:02:03.909> one<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.479> ones<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.810> just

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
either one of the ones that I just

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.109 
either one of the ones that I just
showed<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.290> it's<00:02:05.560> actually<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.369> lot<00:02:06.579> more<00:02:06.640> pink

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
showed you it's actually a lot more pink

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.350 
showed you it's actually a lot more pink
and<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.619> probably<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.369> pinky<00:02:09.880> 'used<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.330> I

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
and it's probably the pinky 'used that I

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.260 
and it's probably the pinky 'used that I
would<00:02:10.750> go<00:02:10.959> just<00:02:10.989> because<00:02:11.500> I'm<00:02:12.040> not<00:02:12.250> too<00:02:12.760> big<00:02:13.030> on

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
would go just because I'm not too big on

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.670 
would go just because I'm not too big on
like<00:02:14.220> super<00:02:15.220> pink<00:02:15.700> lipsticks<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:17.170> next<00:02:17.440> shade

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
is so low and this is a little bit more

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.530 
is so low and this is a little bit more
unlike<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.290> reddish<00:02:23.769> pink<00:02:24.099> side<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.849> it's<00:02:25.450> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
unlike the reddish pink side and it's a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.500 
unlike the reddish pink side and it's a

definitely loving it this is probably

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.080

the<00:02:30.989> hot<00:02:31.989> pink<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.590> would<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.920> good<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.310> my

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the hot pink that would go good with my

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.809 
the hot pink that would go good with my
skin<00:02:34.450> tone<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:34.900> usually<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:36.160> neon<00:02:36.489> pink

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
skin tone because usually the neon pink

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.390 
skin tone because usually the neon pink
just<00:02:37.209> doesn't<00:02:37.630> look<00:02:37.810> good<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.230> me<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.130> i'm
