00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.119 
town that I really like this is the new
CB<00:00:30.740> 3<00:00:30.980> from<00:00:31.190> mic<00:00:31.340> tech<00:00:31.580> it's<00:00:32.920> probably<00:00:33.920> one<00:00:34.100> of

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
CB 3 from mic tech it's probably one of

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.299 
CB 3 from mic tech it's probably one of
the<00:00:34.280> best<00:00:34.550> new<00:00:35.120> microphones<00:00:35.780> I've<00:00:35.960> heard<00:00:36.320> I'm

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
the best new microphones I've heard I'm

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.340 
the best new microphones I've heard I'm
not<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.579> new<00:00:37.850> microphone<00:00:38.210> fan<00:00:38.660> matter<00:00:39.019> of<00:00:39.140> fact

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
not a new microphone fan matter of fact

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.479 
not a new microphone fan matter of fact
I<00:00:40.219> don't<00:00:40.760> even<00:00:41.120> own<00:00:41.539> any<00:00:42.019> new<00:00:42.260> microphones

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
I don't even own any new microphones

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.270 
I don't even own any new microphones
I<00:00:43.519> think<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.600> newest<00:00:45.409> microphone<00:00:45.949> I<00:00:45.980> might

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
I think the newest microphone I might

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.540 
I think the newest microphone I might
have<00:00:46.519> is<00:00:46.760> a<00:00:46.789> came<00:00:47.539> 84<00:00:48.109> and<00:00:48.530> it's<00:00:48.829> an<00:00:48.980> old<00:00:49.219> one

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
have is a came 84 and it's an old one

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.459 
have is a came 84 and it's an old one
that<00:00:49.940> has<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.269> crazy<00:00:50.569> too<00:00:50.839> short<00:00:51.079> connector

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
that has the crazy too short connector

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.389 
that has the crazy too short connector
so<00:00:51.710> it's<00:00:52.309> pretty<00:00:52.550> old<00:00:53.050> and<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.890> couple<00:00:55.100> of<00:00:55.249> new

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
so it's pretty old and a couple of new

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.090 
so it's pretty old and a couple of new
ribbons<00:00:55.789> that<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.390> fact<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.079> for<00:00:57.679> a<00:00:57.710> condenser

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
ribbons that is fact but for a condenser

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.610 
ribbons that is fact but for a condenser
mic<00:00:58.249> this<00:00:58.460> is<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.760> first<00:00:58.969> one<00:00:59.409> tube<00:01:00.409> condenser

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
mic this is the first one tube condenser

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.969 
mic this is the first one tube condenser
that<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:01.460> can<00:01:01.639> say<00:01:02.079> kind<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.139> stands<00:01:03.530> up<00:01:03.649> to<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
that I can say kind of stands up to the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.649 
that I can say kind of stands up to the
scrutiny<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:07.100> know<00:01:07.219> like<00:01:07.520> tone<00:01:08.240> and

and<00:02:26.980> tried<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.190> on<00:02:28.630> boosted<00:02:29.630> guitar<00:02:29.900> and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and tried it on boosted guitar and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.850 
and tried it on boosted guitar and
vocals<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.100> was<00:02:32.230> pleased<00:02:33.230> with<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.500> results

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
vocals and was pleased with the results

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.150 
vocals and was pleased with the results
to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.040> point<00:02:34.340> where<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:36.470> used<00:02:36.710> it<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.040> know

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
to the point where we used it you know

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.220 
to the point where we used it you know
we're<00:02:37.310> using<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.700> on<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.880> project<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
we're using it on the project and and I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.860 
we're using it on the project and and I
like<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.010> proximity<00:02:40.580> effect<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.240> think<00:02:41.780> it

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
like the proximity effect I think it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.490 
like the proximity effect I think it
sounds<00:02:42.020> natural<00:02:42.410> I<00:02:42.890> think<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.640> any<00:02:44.500> typical

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
sounds natural I think that any typical

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.520 
sounds natural I think that any typical

it's<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.430> excites<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.900> sound<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.350> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.160 
to talk about Mike tech microphones
today<00:04:22.140> I've<00:04:23.040> been<00:04:23.250> using<00:04:24.030> these<00:04:24.180> mics<00:04:24.510> for<00:04:24.870> a

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
today I've been using these mics for a

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.060 
today I've been using these mics for a
little<00:04:25.410> over<00:04:25.500> three<00:04:25.710> years<00:04:25.800> now<00:04:26.100> and<00:04:28.070> they

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
little over three years now and they

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.710 
little over three years now and they
just<00:04:29.310> come<00:04:29.430> out<00:04:29.580> with<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:29.760> new<00:04:29.940> cv3

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
just come out with a new cv3

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.780 
just come out with a new cv3
which<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.200> think<00:04:31.440> should<00:04:32.040> be<00:04:32.070> considered<00:04:32.370> their

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
which I think should be considered their

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.430 
which I think should be considered their
flagship<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.540> think<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:33.840> her<00:04:33.900> best<00:04:34.110> sounding

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
flagship I think it's her best sounding

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.400 
flagship I think it's her best sounding
mic<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.100> in<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> bunch

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
mic and in the bunch

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.780 
mic and in the bunch
like<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.860> said<00:04:37.920> I've<00:04:38.160> been<00:04:38.190> using<00:04:38.580> their

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
like I said I've been using their

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.640 
like I said I've been using their
microphones<00:04:39.270> for<00:04:39.480> three<00:04:39.780> almost<00:04:40.230> three<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.560> a

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
microphones for three almost three and a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.160 
microphones for three almost three and a
half<00:04:40.740> years<00:04:41.010> now<00:04:41.130> and<00:04:43.130> after<00:04:44.130> hearing<00:04:44.340> this

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
half years now and after hearing this

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.360 
half years now and after hearing this
right<00:04:46.170> right<00:04:46.440> before<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.830> name<00:04:46.980> show<00:04:47.190> they

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
right right before the name show they

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.720 
right right before the name show they
had<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.610> final<00:04:48.380> prototype<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.890> I<00:04:50.340> was<00:04:50.580> able

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
had the final prototype and I was able

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.330 
had the final prototype and I was able
to<00:04:50.880> really<00:04:51.780> hear<00:04:52.080> it<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.800> hear<00:04:53.040> it<00:04:53.130> on<00:04:53.220> my

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
to really hear it and and hear it on my

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.710 
to really hear it and and hear it on my
own<00:04:53.400> voice<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.000> played<00:04:54.180> some<00:04:54.330> acoustic

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
own voice and I played some acoustic

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.650 
own voice and I played some acoustic
guitar<00:04:55.020> and<00:04:55.610> was<00:04:56.610> able<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:56.970> listen<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.510> it

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
guitar and was able to listen to it

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.660 
guitar and was able to listen to it
through<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.960> whole<00:04:58.440> spectrum<00:04:58.770> of<00:04:59.100> their

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
through the whole spectrum of their

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.760 
through the whole spectrum of their
microphones<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.810> really<00:05:01.170> consider<00:05:01.530> this

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
microphones and I really consider this

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.040 
microphones and I really consider this
thing<00:05:02.010> there's<00:05:02.370> there<00:05:02.670> a<00:05:02.700> flagship<00:05:03.360> I<00:05:03.690> don't

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
thing there's there a flagship I don't

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.870 
thing there's there a flagship I don't
think<00:05:04.200> they're<00:05:04.320> charging<00:05:04.620> as<00:05:05.400> much<00:05:05.640> as<00:05:05.790> they

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
think they're charging as much as they

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.310 
think they're charging as much as they
should<00:05:05.940> for<00:05:06.120> these<00:05:06.390> microphones<00:05:06.930> they<00:05:07.200> are

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
should for these microphones they are

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.410 
should for these microphones they are
