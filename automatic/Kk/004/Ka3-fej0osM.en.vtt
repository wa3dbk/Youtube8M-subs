00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
 I joked last week said such a complete joke was okay this was 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.149
 Kidding is purely theoretical that 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.170
 When we talk about Neil I deGrasse Tyson 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.360
 6500 lightyears 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 Crab example nebula so no Tyson grass on Cosmo is a new series on the Fox channel 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:19.570
 . 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.320
 As you know we have proof of the kind of universe that is over 6,000 years old 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 My age 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.510
 Because the nebula of cancer is 6500 light years 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.630
 We will not be able to see anything further 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.130
 If the universe is less than 6,500 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.800
 I joked jokingly and said I knew I was probably conservative are religious 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.989
 Right I say 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.489
 How we really know the speed of light means we can be fooled by God 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.579
 Speed â€‹â€‹of light I joked he said 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.960
 This is what actually happened there is a group called Answers in their Genesis 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.629
 website 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.910
 Is the answers in Genesis.com and they are making this exact argument 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.530
 I say 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.359
 This is a quote of what Tyson's course does not address in the program 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.059
 However, young scientists of earth creation do not offer the Bible 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.280
 Consistent models to explain 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 How can we see distant things in space without tampering with laws 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.700
 physics 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 One of the model is that any TROP synchronization agreement 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 Which is based on the fact that Einstein is recognized reminiscent of Einstein 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.030
 It seems to give you credibility 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.560
 It is impossible to measure objectively in one direction of the speed of light 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 We are rather measuring the speed back and forth has been lied 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.720
 We simply agree that the speed of the road one must be happy over total 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.810
 Read more about how this explanation would answer the question about how light 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.970
 Of distant stars 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.420
 Can reach the earth within the time allowed in Biblical history 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.189
 In a distant light signal stars and for more technically minded readers any even 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.090
 Of the Gorni Agreement 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
 Solve the problem of distant star light 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.340
 So what is the problem with this theory in terms of the average person idea is fine 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.790
 We are assuming that the light is cut by the same speed in one direction 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.709
 It does the opposite direction but we do not really know that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.250
 We do not know it may be traveling in one direction faster 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.920
 Then we only divide by 2 in assuming it's the same in both 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.379
 Problem trends 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.840
 As with almost every one of these types of arguments 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.980
 the problem 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 Is that it depends on not falsifying ball made claims 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.629
 Mostly in this hypothetical kinda 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.790
 In the philosophical sense there is no actual 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.819
 The evidence indicating the light is cut at a different speed 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.349
 One-way then is the case in other possible hypothetical 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.860
 This is true but there is no evidence of that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.319
 The idea was first published in the journal Creation 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.849
 Research magazine answers were called in September 2010 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.280
 Says without violating any known laws of nature 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.200
 He added that we can have you own relative as if they are 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.590
 It is one-way limitless lite speed 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.610
 Yet I'm there at all 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.940
 There is no evidence of this in either case when we look at the argument made in 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.680
 Journal of Research Answers 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.700
 The argument made by the answers in Genesis created you 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.860
 Complicated accounts are more complicated if we think that both 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.879
 The simplest explanation is usually the correct one 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.280
 And that unusual claims need extraordinary evidence like Carl Sagan 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.989
 His character 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.330
 I suggest there perfectly 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.670
 Nature dedicated to this theory even 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.080
 I was completely joking when I said the next thing you know 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.989
 Creationists will well say we may be fooled we may not really know 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.330
 light's speed 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
 I think that is 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.689
 Absolutely stunning that this is being presented as being 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.569
 The actual beary and I do not take any credit at all 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.590
 To predict that this will happen I was completely flirting and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.230
 Turns out that
