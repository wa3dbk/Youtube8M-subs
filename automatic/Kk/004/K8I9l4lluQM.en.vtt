00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:18.080
 straight and the other way around 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.469
 the horses take breaks is their grasses 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:04.189

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.599
 lose time because the tide is coming 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.030
 but really everything else will be 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:29.750
 subsequently no longer have to travel 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.410

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.150

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.710
 to say on the island and with the 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.910
 the forces of nature are not to be trifled with 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.020
