what<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.179> more<00:00:12.360> difficult<00:00:12.599> than<00:00:13.080> designing<00:00:13.650> an

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
what is more difficult than designing an

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.070 
what is more difficult than designing an
entirely<00:00:14.519> new<00:00:14.849> bike<00:00:15.089> maybe<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.929> is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
entirely new bike maybe it is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.620 
entirely new bike maybe it is
redesigning<00:00:16.949> an<00:00:17.220> already<00:00:17.820> successful<00:00:18.060> bike

redesigning an already successful bike

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.410 
redesigning an already successful bike
like<00:00:19.199> for<00:00:19.410> example<00:00:19.920> on<00:00:20.070> new<00:00:20.310> er6n<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:27.180> frame

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
like for example on new er6n the frame

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.330 
like for example on new er6n the frame
is<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> main<00:00:28.320> characteristics<00:00:29.189> of

is one of the main characteristics of
this<00:00:29.550> bike<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.300> remains<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.810> however<00:00:31.740> it

this bike and it remains so however it
has<00:00:32.369> been<00:00:32.550> tweaked<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.290> entire<00:00:34.620> frame<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
has been tweaked so the entire frame the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
that the bike is easy handling we've

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.740 
that the bike is easy handling we've
improved<00:01:23.320> on<00:01:23.560> economy<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.190> this<00:01:24.340> case<00:01:24.640> we<00:01:25.630> have

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
improved on economy in this case we have

smoothly<00:02:00.400> revs<00:02:01.360> quicker<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.140> also<00:02:02.710> is<00:02:02.860> more

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
smoothly revs quicker and also is more

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.800 
smoothly revs quicker and also is more
