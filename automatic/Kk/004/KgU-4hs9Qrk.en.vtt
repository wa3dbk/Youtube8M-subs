here then we can switch the frequency so
now<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> plus<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> minus<00:01:51.000> button<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
now if the plus and minus button you can

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
now if the plus and minus button you can
adjust<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> frequency<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.340> anything<00:01:53.880> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
adjust the frequency to anything you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.389 
adjust the frequency to anything you
want<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:55.079> sure<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.799> take<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
want to but be sure not to take a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.819 
want to but be sure not to take a
frequency<00:01:57.060> where<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> big<00:01:57.630> broadcast<00:01:58.290> station

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
frequency where a big broadcast station

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.340 
frequency where a big broadcast station
is<00:01:59.009> transmitting<00:01:59.729> because<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.659> could<00:02:01.020> cause

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is transmitting because that could cause

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.920 
is transmitting because that could cause
interferences<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.549> yeah<00:02:03.119> basically<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
interferences and yeah basically that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
interferences and yeah basically that
was<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.200> FM<00:02:04.710> transmitter<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> outside

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
was the FM transmitter from the outside

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.300 
was the FM transmitter from the outside
and<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.780> let's<00:02:07.079> take<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.469> closer<00:02:07.740> look<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
and now let's take a closer look at the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
and now let's take a closer look at the
charger<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.970> also<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:09.989> comes<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
charger we also got so here comes the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.550 
charger we also got so here comes the
charger<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.480> fits<00:02:12.750> directly

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
charger and this just fits directly

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
charger and this just fits directly
into<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.890> power<00:02:14.130> socket<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.730> your<00:02:14.970> car<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
into the power socket of your car on the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.559 
into the power socket of your car on the
front<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.319> have<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.709> USB<00:02:17.160> port<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:18.180> charging

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
front you have a USB port and a charging

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.199 
front you have a USB port and a charging
led<00:02:19.080> which<00:02:19.410> should<00:02:19.650> light<00:02:19.920> up<00:02:19.950> Bret<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.150> I

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
led which should light up Bret but I

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.059 
led which should light up Bret but I
think<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.690> charger<00:02:22.050> is<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> quite<00:02:22.560> good<00:02:22.590> one

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
think this charger is a quite good one

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.520 
think this charger is a quite good one
because<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.790> connectors<00:02:24.630> look<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.140> solid

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
because the connectors look really solid

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.530 
because the connectors look really solid
in<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.130> past<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.610> had<00:02:26.760> some<00:02:26.970> bad<00:02:27.180> Chinese

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
in the past I had some bad Chinese

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.660 
in the past I had some bad Chinese
charges<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> quite<00:02:29.220> good<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.640> I

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
charges but this is a quite good one I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.059 
charges but this is a quite good one I
think<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.150> now<00:02:30.780> let's<00:02:31.080> take<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.349> look<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
think and now let's take a look at the

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.790 
think and now let's take a look at the
