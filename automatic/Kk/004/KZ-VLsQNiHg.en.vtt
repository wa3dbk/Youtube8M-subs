 cramp against the jerseys select 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.859

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.080
 bibiani is traveling fast and has 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.780
 a good shot and after direct x 1 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.790
 new panda no number three is at the start 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 I know I know was right 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 Bitter template actually but it matters 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.470

 and thus the fifth panda kot and also 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.140
 in the next scene there is one here 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.760
 significant participation of christian 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.140
 pander the ball is now coming to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 it fit from podolski and werner 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.290
 it is not necessary to drive in the right direction because 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.150
 He with his weak right foot to 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.400
 4 to 0 and thus to the sixth 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.110
 hiking map fourth in this episode 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.970
 all four gates involved christian 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.380
 pander with the wonderful conclusion 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 here for the 40th 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.069
 the fans I celebrate celebrate and 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.230
 opponent has absolutely nothing 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.670
 about it already for now already one 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.959
 quite a clap and then sometimes 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.790
 to come to the opposing goal 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.870
 that looked like kiel sets 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.420
 always somehow times when 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.940
 u19 and robben keeps these stories 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.590
 From the corner yes let's see if there's something else 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.600
 I can not say but get rid of it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.670
 anyway, that was the first one 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.370
 Show values ​​of the opponent's situation 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.560
 after 57 minutes the corner comes 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.030
 purely from kb there is the head at and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.830
 somehow it comes to the emi and then 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.850
 he is rocking again ida and kabul and 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.769
 somehow the ball comes 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.200
 in the end, yes, like the trial 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.850
 to flank and then is kongo or dog 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.140
 can clear the ball and so it was 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.269
 that with the single of the opponent and us 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.470
 are back at the train with the balloons panda 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.660
 and she thinks she thinks of the sixteen 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.209
 on it and make the thing purely two 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.489
 chemistry does not itch at all 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.560
 Panda is no number 7 and the fifth 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.000
 but the fifth goal is the lead 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.620
 Amanda participated and it went 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.360
 no daddy thinks at all 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.549
 I already said that when she said it 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.980
 focus to make gates there 60 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.579
 After 66 minutes with a owner I 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.560
 I do not really have him anymore 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.540
 attacked the 67 make mine too 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.040
 bude here for the 70th 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.000
 this time new cantor participation of 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.070
 pander but that is not so 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.709
 Bad because we are in the 73 minute 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.989
 and robbie keane robbie keane tries 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.760
 on the left foot and drobny is again like that 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.170
 brazen and holds the ball even so 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.940
 really not nice for our opponent 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.350
 here and I already said it went 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.030
 at panda that's what I'm back in 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.859
 prove situations through exercises 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.630
 get through here and what's left over there 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.130
 Resist now comes with the advanced 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.269
 rainbow okay that behaves a bit 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.049
 can get in now 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.519
 match each other 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.680
 no, he's too stubbornly trying 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.120
 alone and unfortunately before at panda 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.769
 would definitely be the better option 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.840
 but that's how it stays here for the time being 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.220
 first at the seven to zero and 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.690
 First there is the panda again 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.690
 participation in a red 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.370
 map of jonas jones yes times kabul on 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.940
 any case of cant the yellow red card 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.170
 after the foul on our goalgetter 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.490
 and accordingly only ten men 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.990
 on the place in front of the opponent that is more 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.520
 space for me and more opportunities 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.050
 pander could i have my good we have yes 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.760
 only seven or something and five in 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.990
 but this episode is still enough for me 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.090
 not here again on podolski 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.920
 podolski free from the tor fell at super 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.260
 is fouled and there is a free kick 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.030
 and the red card for your ratings 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.800
 So both stockbrokers from 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.080
 adversaries and that is 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.390
 of course not huge for me now 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.490
 important not really okay but right 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.600
 good position for a free kick for 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.460
 our man with the number 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.890
 that had a good meter number 5 and 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.960
 how then of course uses at 18 o'clock 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.250
 ninetieth minute this is the sixth 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.170
 then you get that partie and 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.220
 Accordingly, the eighth panda can 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.810
 which we have available 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.000
 you can not do wonderful freestoss 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.500
 complain to the wall over the gate 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.120
 would not be moved but not in there 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.010
 but so he is in and thus 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.930
 we win the game with 8 to 0 because 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.950
 They think the kickoff was direct 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.390
 The referee falls over 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.600
 the off and require us again one 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.890
 reward from rendel organize races 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.420
 in generate the conference generated 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.370
 is the right word abou diaby 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.780
 even happy with cahill the opponent 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.190
 is of course completely kinked and 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.690
 his players, of course, accordingly 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.400
 well I guess somebody did absolutely 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.870
 no fun this part me 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.370
 It was fun with it completely 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.230
 many gates collect viktor participation 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.550
 stock the series and that brings that 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.840
 Of course, the panda po 1 ahead 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.520
 which does not promise them that 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.450
 but many packs open are likely again 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.980
 First of all, it's about the reward 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.810
 for this episode, because she is like her 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.510
 use the wanderfreunde generated 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.000
 number between 1 and 5 and it will be the 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.000
 number number number 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.669
 and that means for me I am allowed in the 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:54.650
 next episode a river 10 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.999
 pharmacist matter of user from me I 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.439
 I think also in diesel has given you 

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:58.759
 if yes that positive or 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:02.439
 I would be friends again 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:02.439
 best monday still on 3 2
