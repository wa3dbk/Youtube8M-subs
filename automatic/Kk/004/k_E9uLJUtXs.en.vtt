and grapefruit it is quite Cascadian you
can<00:02:25.599> really<00:02:25.840> smell<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.620> screwed<00:02:26.860> with

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
can really smell and it screwed with

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.259 
can really smell and it screwed with
Kiske<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.790> hops<00:02:30.180> some<00:02:31.180> walls<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.660> well<00:02:32.190> lightly

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
Kiske it hops some walls as well lightly

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:40.350 
Kiske it hops some walls as well lightly
and<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:37.709> usually<00:02:38.709> say<00:02:39.129> caramel<00:02:39.730> malt<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.239> this

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and I usually say caramel malt but this

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.869 
and I usually say caramel malt but this
is<00:02:40.540> more<00:02:40.720> like<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.379> biscuity<00:02:41.980> crisp<00:02:42.370> malt<00:02:42.730> I

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
is more like the biscuity crisp malt I

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.600 
is more like the biscuity crisp malt I
think<00:02:43.120> there<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.420> some<00:02:43.599> caramel<00:02:44.049> as<00:02:44.140> well<00:02:44.379> but

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
think there is some caramel as well but

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.770 
think there is some caramel as well but
and<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.700> usually<00:02:45.879> get<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.209> slight<00:02:46.450> amount<00:02:46.690> of

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and you usually get a slight amount of

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.150 
and you usually get a slight amount of
caramel<00:02:47.110> in<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> room<00:02:47.590> but<00:02:47.739> it's<00:02:47.860> basically

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
caramel in the room but it's basically

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.250 
caramel in the room but it's basically
just<00:02:48.310> dominated<00:02:48.970> by<00:02:49.090> hops<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.720> immediately<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
just dominated by hops and immediately I

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.680 
just dominated by hops and immediately I
think<00:02:50.379> this<00:02:50.769> smells<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.280> an<00:02:51.730> IPA<00:02:52.060> actually

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
think this smells like an IPA actually

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.830 
think this smells like an IPA actually
I'd<00:02:52.840> buy<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.019> standard<00:02:53.739> IPA<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:57.840> actually

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
I'd buy a standard IPA that actually

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
I'd buy a standard IPA that actually
smells<00:02:58.900> really<00:02:59.230> really<00:02:59.560> nice<00:03:00.010> so<00:03:00.519> let's<00:03:00.700> just

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.790 
smells really really nice so let's just
get<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.780> tasting

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.580 

ah<00:03:09.110> that<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.140> good<00:03:11.210> stuff<00:03:12.270> um<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.340> almost

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
ah that is good stuff um that is almost

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.130 
ah that is good stuff um that is almost
like<00:03:16.590> an<00:03:16.860> IPA<00:03:17.720> uh<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.460> I<00:03:21.140> would

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
like an IPA uh it really is I would

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.280

imagine<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.920> beer<00:03:23.460> here<00:03:24.170> since<00:03:25.170> it's

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
imagine that this beer here since it's

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.050 
imagine that this beer here since it's
that<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.560> would<00:03:25.830> have<00:03:25.980> helped<00:03:26.370> developing<00:03:26.940> the

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
that it would have helped developing the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.950 
that it would have helped developing the
american-style<00:03:27.660> IPAs<00:03:28.970> because<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> lot

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
american-style IPAs because it is a lot

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.440 
american-style IPAs because it is a lot
like<00:03:31.290> an<00:03:31.590> American<00:03:32.040> IPA<00:03:32.190> with<00:03:32.700> flavors

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
like an American IPA with flavors

like making a really bitter and this is

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.940 
like making a really bitter and this is
quite<00:04:24.120> bitter<00:04:24.350> especially<00:04:25.350> for<00:04:25.530> an<00:04:25.620> American

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
quite bitter especially for an American
