thing we're going to take a look at so

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.270 
thing we're going to take a look at so
over<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.130> workbench<00:01:37.990> here<00:01:39.020> your<00:01:39.860> skills

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
over here the workbench here your skills

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.210 
over here the workbench here your skills
are<00:01:40.459> relied<00:01:40.789> on<00:01:40.990> science<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.590> we'll<00:01:43.039> take<00:01:43.160> a

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
are relied on science so we'll take a

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.350 
are relied on science so we'll take a
look<00:01:43.310> at<00:01:43.399> the<00:01:43.459> different<00:01:43.759> things<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:44.060> can<00:01:44.209> do

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
energy weapons below there are where you

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.669 
energy weapons below there are where you
can<00:01:55.099> change<00:01:55.550> regular<00:01:56.239> ones<00:01:56.450> whether<00:01:57.410> they<00:01:57.619> be

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
can change regular ones whether they be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.339 
can change regular ones whether they be
electron<00:01:58.310> charge<00:01:58.580> packs<00:01:58.910> or<00:01:59.149> whatever<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.720> to

electron charge packs or whatever and to

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.350 
electron charge packs or whatever and to
the<00:02:00.500> max<00:02:00.739> charge<00:02:01.190> variance<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.239> the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the max charge variance and the

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.240 
the max charge variance and the
overcharge<00:02:02.840> which<00:02:03.560> makes<00:02:03.800> them<00:02:04.009> do<00:02:04.220> more

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
overcharge which makes them do more

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.100 
overcharge which makes them do more
damage<00:02:04.729> for<00:02:05.390> more<00:02:05.539> information<00:02:05.929> about<00:02:06.020> that

damage for more information about that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.389 
damage for more information about that
check<00:02:06.679> out<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.979> energy<00:02:07.190> weapons<00:02:07.789> gun<00:02:09.399> down

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
check out the energy weapons gun down

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.220 
check out the energy weapons gun down
from<00:02:10.610> there<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.970> can<00:02:11.060> see<00:02:11.380> recycling

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
from there you can see recycling

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.380 
from there you can see recycling
basically<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.680> will<00:02:16.069> accept<00:02:16.520> then<00:02:17.239> you

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
basically it will accept then you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.160 
basically it will accept then you
recycle<00:02:17.959> them<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.230> then<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.010> get<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.280> back

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
recycle them and then you get it back

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.839 
recycle them and then you get it back
also<00:02:21.170> at<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.860> workbench<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.520> have<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
also at the workbench you have the

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
50mg match hand load the hand loads are

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.050 
50mg match hand load the hand loads are
a<00:04:11.900> special<00:04:12.799> unique<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.340> ammunition<00:04:13.670> that

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
a special unique and ammunition that

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.210 
a special unique and ammunition that
require<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.780> perk<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.170> get<00:04:15.530> called<00:04:15.859> the<00:04:15.980> hand

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
require a perk to get called the hand

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.680 
require a perk to get called the hand
loaded<00:04:16.579> perk<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.060> these<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.079> munitions<00:04:18.560> do

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
loaded perk and these a munitions do

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.529 
loaded perk and these a munitions do
improve<00:04:20.690> aspects<00:04:21.470> like<00:04:21.680> for<00:04:22.580> example<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
improve aspects like for example on the

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.480 
improve aspects like for example on the
anti-materiel<00:04:24.260> rifle<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.919> does<00:04:25.190> more<00:04:25.460> damage

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
anti-materiel rifle it does more damage

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.520 
anti-materiel rifle it does more damage
and<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.150> also<00:04:26.360> makes<00:04:26.660> the<00:04:26.840> gun<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> lot<00:04:27.350> more

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
and it also makes the gun a lot more

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.630 
and it also makes the gun a lot more
accurate<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.070> I'll<00:04:28.160> go<00:04:28.220> ahead<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.490> make<00:04:28.610> some

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
accurate so I'll go ahead and make some

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.700 
accurate so I'll go ahead and make some
of<00:04:28.910> those<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.900> boom<00:04:30.650> I<00:04:30.919> got<00:04:31.250> 80<00:04:32.169> shots<00:04:33.169> for<00:04:33.560> my

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
of those and boom I got 80 shots for my

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.230 
of those and boom I got 80 shots for my
anti-materiel<00:04:34.310> rifle<00:04:34.640> that<00:04:34.820> will<00:04:34.910> do<00:04:35.030> more

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
anti-materiel rifle that will do more

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.110 
anti-materiel rifle that will do more
damage<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.990> are<00:04:36.530> more<00:04:36.770> accurate<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.940> it's<00:04:38.060> a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
damage and are more accurate so it's a

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.860 
damage and are more accurate so it's a
good<00:04:38.270> skill<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.539> have<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.940> final<00:04:41.390> clicks<00:04:41.600> ring

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870
