00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
program but I think you need to do your

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.360 
program but I think you need to do your
research<00:03:49.180> before<00:03:49.900> you<00:03:50.409> think<00:03:50.920> about<00:03:51.069> applying

research before you think about applying

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.149

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
or going to university find out what

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.719 
or going to university find out what
they<00:03:54.310> do<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.730> why<00:03:54.939> you<00:03:55.000> want<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.359> go<00:03:55.480> there
