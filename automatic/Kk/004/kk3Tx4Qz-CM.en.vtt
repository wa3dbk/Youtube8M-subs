00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.580
Thanks for helping me to demolish this tower

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:21.960
No problem

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080
We must destroy those ZOMBIES!!

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.200
Yeah, of course. As you say

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120
It'll be just a little explosion

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.320
It was a nice try for someone like you

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.380
I would give you another chance

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
but I think you have no more PokÃ©mon

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680
What's supposed to be this?

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.120
Well, whatever is... SQUISH IT!

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.500
Maybe the strenght isn't enought

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.340
Use the Psycho-Beam

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.400
This can't be

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.240
use Mega-Punch

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.400
Finish him at all, with Psychic!

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.740
Little idiot kid!

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.860
Do you think you will be lucky forever?

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.660
You will never success if you keep this way

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.640
He isn't the best trainer in the world

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.460
But you two get along very well

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.380
Just hope someday you both find their true paths

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.060
You're such a shame

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.100
Look how you have disappointed us

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.500
Ah, what?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.640
Oh, that annoying kid again

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.900
Well, i think this meeting is really awkward

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
It would be better to go

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.360
Hope to see you another day

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.900
Meanwhile, I'll leave you some friends to get fun

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.300
Some old and powerful enemies have appeared

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.720
and another battle is about to begin

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.980
What is gonna do our hero to face this new challenge?

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.260
Don't miss the next episode

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.180
