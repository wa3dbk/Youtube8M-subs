00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
yeah but then his distance on his

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
yeah but then his distance on his
normals<00:02:13.380> are<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.100> far<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.610> he<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:14.970> hit<00:02:15.060> some

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
what I've seen it's not great for her

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.910 
what I've seen it's not great for her
like<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.670> he's<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.840> better<00:02:25.020> her<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.740> a

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
like it is he's just a better her in a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.320 
like it is he's just a better her in a
lot<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.220> ways<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> much<00:02:27.090> better

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
lot of ways it's just a much better

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.390 
lot of ways it's just a much better
Felicia<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.140> my<00:02:28.320> there's<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.160> three<00:02:29.370> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
Felicia and my there's a three of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.800 
Felicia and my there's a three of
gimmicks<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:29.940> he<00:02:30.090> doesn't<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.630> she

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
gimmicks that he doesn't have that she

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.360 
gimmicks that he doesn't have that she
does<00:02:30.960> like<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.470> he<00:02:31.620> has<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> good<00:02:32.130> guard

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
does like that he has a good guard

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.070 
does like that he has a good guard
canceled<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:32.970> maybe<00:02:33.630> we'll<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.050> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
canceled so maybe we'll see that a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480 
canceled so maybe we'll see that a
little<00:02:34.320> more<00:02:34.380> good<00:02:34.530> combo<00:02:34.860> by<00:02:34.980> Zach<00:02:35.190> getting<00:02:35.460> a
