00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.179
 five readers decided to change 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.950
 look 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.839
 she entrusts their beauty to 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.179
 hairdressers artists christophe nicolas 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.630
 diot and stephanie who opens the ball 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.139
 tribute to your to have a look more 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.360
 modern 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.470
 certainly when I wash my hair I 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.900
 am obliged to do all the time to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.400
 blow dry I would have liked something 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.660
 thing where I can easily comb 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.220
 but at the same time they're doing off 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 class too 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.640
 so let's see what the pro thinks 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.930
 me the idea is to redraw a little the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.680
 cut shorten way to give back a little 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 glare at eye level lighten 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.059
 especially this mass that is there okay 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 way to restore a natural blur by 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.899
 against in terms of colors I find 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.289
 that it's way too dark a lot 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 too hard and I will propose 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.140
 bursts so a painting that would give a 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.660
 side a little hot sand by 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 very light places and that would emphasize 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.260
 a little cut and it's gone the cut 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.260
 is done on dry hair 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.820
 or brought 1.6 in volume so seen their 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.040
 game to degraded enormously this part 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.720
 while keeping a certain length 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 to keep the meeting 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.570
 still a few scissors well 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.070
 studied and we move to color 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.750
 the idea is to create a painting with 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.970
 warm reflections to break a little 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.950
 this dark mass so it'll give him 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.750
 of his going to illuminate a little bit his 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.440
 look and especially it will create some 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.250
 contrasts 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.190
 so we deliberately took a reflection 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:51.910
 very hot which is a 57 57 7 mahogany 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.140
 of chestnuts the break is done with meticulousness 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.000
 and ends with twenty or so 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.259
 minutes under the heat of the climate are 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.259
 to fix the pigments 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.259
 make-up side unifies the complexion 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 put some sun powder on 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.640
 underline the look with black pencil 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.830
 and mascara and draws the re 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:25.090
 lip contour with gloss on 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:29.010
 dry in a cap it ends at their 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 families I wanted a modern haircut 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 class and really does what 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.690
 I was waiting I'm really very very 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.690
 happy
