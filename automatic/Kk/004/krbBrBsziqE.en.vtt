00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
know we let them off and I think it's a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
we're allowed to smile it I think that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.030 
we're allowed to smile it I think that
makes<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.200> even<00:01:16.320> better<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.710> us<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:16.920> we're

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
