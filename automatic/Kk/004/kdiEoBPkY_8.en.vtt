00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
filter while it meant that you were

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.390 
filter while it meant that you were
wasting<00:01:04.369> gas<00:01:04.879> because<00:01:05.479> it<00:01:05.930> choked<00:01:06.500> the<00:01:06.920> engine

well<00:01:08.060> today<00:01:08.509> that<00:01:08.960> doesn't<00:01:09.350> apply<00:01:09.740> even<00:01:10.670> if

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
well today that doesn't apply even if

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.820 
well today that doesn't apply even if
you<00:01:10.880> have<00:01:11.060> one<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:11.600> what<00:01:11.840> we<00:01:12.020> have<00:01:12.259> here<00:01:12.649> this

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
you have one like what we have here this

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.820 
you have one like what we have here this
one<00:01:13.009> has<00:01:13.220> some<00:01:13.640> rodent<00:01:14.630> debris<00:01:15.080> built<00:01:15.409> up<00:01:15.649> on

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
one has some rodent debris built up on

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.320 
one has some rodent debris built up on
the<00:01:15.979> underside<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:16.880> pretty<00:01:17.119> well

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the underside of it's pretty well

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.840 
the underside of it's pretty well
clogged<00:01:17.720> up<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.890> might<00:01:19.310> affect

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
clogged up and that might affect

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.510 
clogged up and that might affect
performance<00:01:20.290> but<00:01:21.290> it's<00:01:21.440> not<00:01:21.619> going<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.159> affect

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
performance but it's not going to affect

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.690 
performance but it's not going to affect
fuel<00:01:22.880> economy<00:01:23.410> reason<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.740> once<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.520> air

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
fuel economy reason is that once the air

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.999 
fuel economy reason is that once the air
passes<00:01:26.300> through<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.720> filter<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:27.619> goes<00:01:27.830> into

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
passes through the filter it goes into

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.180 
passes through the filter it goes into
this<00:01:28.250> unit<00:01:28.700> right<00:01:28.880> here<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:30.320> mass<00:01:30.800> airflow

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
this unit right here is a mass airflow

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.359 
this unit right here is a mass airflow
sensor<00:01:31.660> this<00:01:32.660> unit<00:01:33.050> has<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.229> piece<00:01:33.590> down<00:01:33.890> in<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
sensor this unit has a piece down in the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.870 
sensor this unit has a piece down in the
airflow<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:36.380> senses<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.100> amount<00:01:37.580> of<00:01:37.700> air

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
airflow and it senses the amount of air

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.859 
airflow and it senses the amount of air
moving<00:01:38.390> past<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:39.039> well<00:01:40.039> it<00:01:40.340> takes<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.149> signal

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
moving past it well it takes a signal

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.859 
moving past it well it takes a signal
from<00:01:42.289> that<00:01:42.590> amount<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:43.100> moving<00:01:43.610> air<00:01:43.850> sends<00:01:44.780> it

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
from that amount of moving air sends it

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.010 
from that amount of moving air sends it
to<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.050> computer<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.679> computer<00:01:45.830> in<00:01:46.490> turn

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
to the computer the computer in turn

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.510 
to the computer the computer in turn
matches<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.229> amount<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.710> fuel<00:01:49.130> being

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
matches the amount of fuel being

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.090 
matches the amount of fuel being
delivered<00:01:50.030> into<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.420> engine<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.800> amount

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
delivered into the engine to the amount

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.300 
delivered into the engine to the amount
of<00:01:52.220> air<00:01:52.399> going<00:01:52.670> into<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.300> so<00:01:53.899> as<00:01:54.290> air<00:01:54.649> flow<00:01:55.130> is

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
of air going into it so as air flow is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.810 
of air going into it so as air flow is
reduced<00:01:55.880> by<00:01:56.479> debris<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.380> air<00:01:57.409> filter<00:01:58.009> fuel

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
reduced by debris in the air filter fuel

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.010 
reduced by debris in the air filter fuel
is<00:01:59.270> reduced<00:01:59.899> by<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.680> mass<00:02:01.250> airflow<00:02:01.579> sensor<00:02:02.020> so

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
is reduced by the mass airflow sensor so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.039 
is reduced by the mass airflow sensor so
you<00:02:03.110> don't<00:02:03.439> waste<00:02:03.680> fuel<00:02:04.329> but<00:02:05.329> you<00:02:05.750> still

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you don't waste fuel but you still

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.630 
you don't waste fuel but you still
should<00:02:06.320> check<00:02:06.619> your<00:02:06.829> air<00:02:07.009> filter<00:02:07.460> on<00:02:07.610> a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
should check your air filter on a

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.819 
should check your air filter on a
regular<00:02:08.149> basis<00:02:08.630> some<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.869> them<00:02:09.079> get<00:02:09.259> really

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:09.829 
regular basis some of them get really

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.819 
regular basis some of them get really
bad<00:02:10.040> like<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.750> situation<00:02:12.410> like<00:02:12.440> what

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
bad like this in a situation like what

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.430 
bad like this in a situation like what
we<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.250> here<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.700> car<00:02:13.910> would<00:02:14.209> have

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
we have here the car would have

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.039 
we have here the car would have
performance<00:02:15.440> problems<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.250> yeah<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.269> might

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
performance problems and yeah it might

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.140 
performance problems and yeah it might
waste<00:02:18.290> some<00:02:18.590> fuel<00:02:18.829> it's<00:02:19.040> going<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.340> barely<00:02:19.670> run

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
waste some fuel it's going to barely run

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.539 
waste some fuel it's going to barely run
what<00:02:21.049> we<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:21.739> is<00:02:21.980> we<00:02:22.130> want<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> check

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
what we want to do is we want to check

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.090 
what we want to do is we want to check
