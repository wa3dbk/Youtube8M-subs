gonna be giving that one away but we'll

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.610 
gonna be giving that one away but we'll
see

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
see

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350

anyway<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.340> crack<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.030> starter

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
anyway let's crack into this starter

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.750 
anyway let's crack into this starter
deck

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.880 

so<00:00:46.760> opening<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.449> up<00:00:47.480> we<00:00:47.870> have<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.199> actual<00:00:48.590> deck

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
so opening it up we have the actual deck

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.560 
so opening it up we have the actual deck
itself<00:00:49.190> but<00:00:49.940> before<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.269> I'll<00:00:50.360> show<00:00:50.539> you

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
other side of this is the code so I'm

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.810 
other side of this is the code so I'm
not<00:01:05.990> gonna<00:01:06.200> give<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.590> away<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:07.520> here<00:01:07.700> is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.469 
the graveyard decks own and also the
support<00:01:57.590> zone<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.700> battlefield<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.270> split

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
support zone so the battlefield is split

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.880 
support zone so the battlefield is split
into<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.780> vanguard<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> rear<00:02:00.469> guard<00:02:00.649> or

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
into the vanguard in the rear guard or

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.560 
into the vanguard in the rear guard or
the<00:02:00.920> frontlines<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.460> them<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.090> rear

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
the frontlines in them and the rear

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.020 
the frontlines in them and the rear
lines<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:03.049> guess<00:02:03.130> these<00:02:04.130> are<00:02:04.280> your<00:02:04.520> bonds<00:02:04.759> your

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
lines I guess these are your bonds your

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020 
lines I guess these are your bonds your
orbs<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.780> stuff<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.320> that<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.159> will<00:02:07.579> make

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
orbs and stuff like that so I will make

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.789 
orbs and stuff like that so I will make
an<00:02:08.149> explanation<00:02:08.390> video<00:02:08.690> as<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.110> promised<00:02:09.470> but

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
an explanation video as I promised but

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.800 
an explanation video as I promised but
for<00:02:10.009> now<00:02:10.100> this<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.759> map<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.299> on<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
for now this is just a map and on the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.470 
for now this is just a map and on the
other<00:02:12.019> side<00:02:12.140> of<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:13.190> have<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:14.239> quick

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
other side of it you have just quick

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.120 
other side of it you have just quick
rules<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.870> believe<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.440> didn't<00:02:15.890> really<00:02:16.040> look

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
rules I believe I didn't really look

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.590 
rules I believe I didn't really look
into<00:02:16.340> this<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.640> much<00:02:16.820> but<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> believe

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
into this that much but I believe

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.539 
into this that much but I believe
they're<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:17.810> quick<00:02:18.140> rules<00:02:18.380> so<00:02:19.220> let's<00:02:19.250> zoom

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
they're just quick rules so let's zoom

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.509 
they're just quick rules so let's zoom
back<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.290> this<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.859> raw<00:02:22.100> block<00:02:22.310> and

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
back in so this is the raw block and

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.110 
back in so this is the raw block and
this<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.150> trial<00:02:23.570> deck<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:25.250> get<00:02:25.430> quite<00:02:26.060> a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
this is the trial deck so we get quite a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.970 
this is the trial deck so we get quite a
few<00:02:26.180> foils<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.109> which<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.680> class

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
few foils one of which is this class

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.420 
few foils one of which is this class
change<00:02:28.340> kromm<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.600> a<00:02:29.690> 4<00:02:30.170> or<00:02:30.650> 3<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.220> you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
change kromm so it's a 4 or 3 if you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.479 
change kromm so it's a 4 or 3 if you
class<00:02:31.790> change<00:02:32.060> him<00:02:32.239> 70<00:02:32.989> attack<00:02:33.230> 20<00:02:33.680> defense<00:02:34.220> I

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
class change him 70 attack 20 defense I

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.430 
class change him 70 attack 20 defense I
believe<00:02:35.150> there<00:02:35.329> still<00:02:35.630> is<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.780> one<00:02:36.019> another

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
believe there still is that one another

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.710 
believe there still is that one another
unit<00:02:36.920> class<00:02:37.280> changes<00:02:37.730> then<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.180> gives<00:02:38.329> them<00:02:38.570> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
unit class changes then it gives them a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.500 
unit class changes then it gives them a
plus<00:02:39.560> 20<00:02:39.890> attack<00:02:40.250> boost<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.880> there<00:02:41.390> was

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
plus 20 attack boost and there was

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.580 
plus 20 attack boost and there was
something<00:02:41.720> else<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.049> then<00:02:42.170> when<00:02:42.320> he<00:02:42.380> attacks

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
something else and then when he attacks

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.160 
something else and then when he attacks
a<00:02:42.769> dragon<00:02:43.160> attribute<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.209> he<00:02:44.690> gets<00:02:44.870> posted

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
a dragon attribute then he gets posted

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.680 
a dragon attribute then he gets posted
20,000<00:02:45.799> power<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.670> he's<00:02:46.790> quite<00:02:46.880> good<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.540> I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
20,000 power so he's quite good and I

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.170 
20,000 power so he's quite good and I
quite<00:02:47.840> like<00:02:48.019> him<00:02:48.170> as<00:02:48.440> well<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.459> that's<00:02:49.850> kromm

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
quite like him as well so that's kromm

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.460 
quite like him as well so that's kromm
we<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.660> more<00:02:50.810> than<00:02:50.870> one<00:02:51.079> of<00:02:51.140> them<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.410> one

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
we get more than one of them just one
