better range than commando but be it not
much<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.510> generally<00:02:21.870> if<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.260> get<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
much but generally if you can get the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.259

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
to win the gunfight especially somebody

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.680 
to win the gunfight especially somebody
like<00:02:28.110> Orlando<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.130> he<00:02:29.970> likes<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.360> what<00:02:30.599> he

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
like Orlando here he likes to what he

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120 
like Orlando here he likes to what he
likes<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.989> shoot<00:02:31.290> he<00:02:31.500> doesn't<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:31.950> knife

but I think he does knife me once or

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.500 
but I think he does knife me once or
twice<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.780> he<00:02:36.900> likes<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.620> shoot<00:02:38.510> versus

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510

a very good spot to sit at but there is
one<00:04:21.530> defense<00:04:22.010> against<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.870> especially<00:04:23.870> now

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
one defense against it especially now

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.440 
one defense against it especially now
since<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.530> lot<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.710> people<00:04:25.039> have<00:04:25.130> more<00:04:25.970> flocked
