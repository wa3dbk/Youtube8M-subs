00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
the choke lever on an rmk 700 this is a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.280 
the choke lever on an rmk 700 this is a
three<00:00:06.779> dollar<00:00:07.350> three<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.919> five<00:00:08.069> dollar<00:00:09.290> choke

three dollar three to five dollar choke

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.690 
three dollar three to five dollar choke
lever<00:00:10.530> kit<00:00:11.179> and<00:00:12.179> I'm<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.320> show<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.700> how

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
lever kit and I'm going to show you how

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.320 
lever kit and I'm going to show you how
you<00:00:14.759> rebuild<00:00:15.299> it<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> choke<00:00:16.560> lever

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
you rebuild it here on the choke lever

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.439 
you rebuild it here on the choke lever
cable<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.740> assembly<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:20.490> first<00:00:21.150> thing<00:00:21.330> you're

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
cable and assembly so first thing you're

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.230 
cable and assembly so first thing you're
going<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> take<00:00:22.340> this<00:00:23.340> nut<00:00:23.640> off<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
going to do is take this nut off the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.820 
going to do is take this nut off the
front<00:00:26.660> then<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.689> pull<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.109> back<00:00:28.230> there'll

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
front then you pull it back there'll

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.900 
front then you pull it back there'll
also<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:30.689> guard<00:00:30.960> there<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> here's<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
also be that guard there so here's the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
also be that guard there so here's the
assembly<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.750> what<00:00:33.960> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> threw

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
assembly and this is what kind of threw

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.660 
assembly and this is what kind of threw
me<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.770> loop<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> reading<00:00:35.399> through<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
me for a loop and reading through the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.130 
me for a loop and reading through the
forum's<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> how<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> guess<00:00:36.930> some

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
forum's on how to do it I guess some

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.930 
forum's on how to do it I guess some
people<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> screw<00:00:38.370> here<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
people say that there's a screw here and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
people say that there's a screw here and
I<00:00:39.390> didn't<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I didn't see that

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.340 
I didn't see that
anyway<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.780> razor<00:00:42.989> blade

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
anyway if you take a little razor blade

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.790 
anyway if you take a little razor blade
you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:45.090> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> press<00:00:45.809> into<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
you can just kind of press into this

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.639 
you can just kind of press into this
groove<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.219> along<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> back<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.620> after<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
groove here along the back and after a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
groove here along the back and after a
little<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.520> working<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
little bit of just working it and to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.619 
little bit of just working it and to
break<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> seal<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.270> gently

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
break up the seal if you just gently

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.590 
break up the seal if you just gently
pull<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> cable<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.250> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> pull<00:00:57.390> back

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
pull on the cable and kind of pull back

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.130 
pull on the cable and kind of pull back
and<00:00:57.809> forth<00:00:59.149> you'll<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.329> able<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.629> pop<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.870> open

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and forth you'll be able to pop it open

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.399 
and forth you'll be able to pop it open
like<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:02.120> I've<00:01:03.120> already<00:01:03.480> taken<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.840> open<00:01:04.260> and

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
like so I've already taken this open and

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.789 
like so I've already taken this open and
put<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.830> apart<00:01:05.100> but<00:01:05.339> um<00:01:05.750> anyway<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:07.020> broken

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
put it apart but um anyway your broken

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
put it apart but um anyway your broken
piece<00:01:08.430> will<00:01:08.729> likely<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.409> might

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
piece will likely be there and it might

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
piece will likely be there and it might
spring<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.760> little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.150> careful

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
spring out so be a little bit careful

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
spring out so be a little bit careful
with<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.470> I'll<00:01:13.560> take<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.400> set

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
with that so I'll take that just set

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
with that so I'll take that just set
that<00:01:14.700> aside<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.860> what<00:01:16.860> you're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> want

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that aside now what you're going to want

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.240 
that aside now what you're going to want
to<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:18.380> is<00:01:19.380> take<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:19.890> new<00:01:20.040> one<00:01:21.200> next<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
to do is take your new one next the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.730 
to do is take your new one next the
important<00:01:23.670> part<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.439> first<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
important part here is to first put that

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.600 
important part here is to first put that
on<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.159> cable<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.130> left<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> spring

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
on the cable like so I left the spring

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.450 
on the cable like so I left the spring
in<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:31.020> springs<00:01:31.409> fine

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
in there the springs fine

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.719 
in there the springs fine
the<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.890> my<00:01:35.100> new<00:01:35.280> spring<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the I actually have my new spring in

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
the I actually have my new spring in
there<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> should<00:01:37.020> probably<00:01:37.170> switch<00:01:37.500> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
there so you should probably switch it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.350 
there so you should probably switch it
out<00:01:37.799> with<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> new<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.880> notice<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
out with the new one if you notice the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.889 
out with the new one if you notice the
grooves<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.130> are<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.180> offset<00:01:42.360> so

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
grooves here are a little offset so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.069 
grooves here are a little offset so
there's<00:01:43.079> only<00:01:43.259> one<00:01:43.500> way<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.430> on

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
there's only one way that this can go on

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.149 
there's only one way that this can go on
so<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.950> ball<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
so I'm just going to put the ball in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.260 
so I'm just going to put the ball in
there<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.670> tricky<00:01:51.030> part

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
there like so and then the tricky part

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.770 
there like so and then the tricky part
is<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.869> getting<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:53.540> rectangular<00:01:54.540> shape

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
is just getting this rectangular shape

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
is just getting this rectangular shape
to<00:01:54.990> go<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.350> into<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> housing<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.670> I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
to go up into the housing here so I'm

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.139 
to go up into the housing here so I'm
just<00:01:56.969> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> push<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:58.610> alright<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.880> I've

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
just going to push in alright so I've

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.300 
just going to push in alright so I've
got<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.780> slightly<00:02:01.170> set<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:01.979> enough

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
got it just slightly set in there enough

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
got it just slightly set in there enough
to<00:02:02.460> where<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> ball<00:02:03.479> on<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.020> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
to where I can get that ball on and just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.119 
to where I can get that ball on and just
push<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.490> then<00:02:05.759> start<00:02:06.119> pushing<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> now<00:02:07.129> with

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
push and then start pushing it now with

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.080 
push and then start pushing it now with
it<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.849> should<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.270> slide<00:02:09.569> right

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
it and it should just slide right

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.619 
it and it should just slide right
been<00:02:10.209> in<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:12.940> may<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.450> put

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
been in like so now you may want to put

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.460 
been in like so now you may want to put
in<00:02:13.750> some<00:02:13.959> more

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
in some more

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.530 
in some more
I<00:02:14.500> believe<00:02:15.340> it's<00:02:15.489> lithium<00:02:15.910> grease<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.239> you

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
I believe it's lithium grease that you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
I believe it's lithium grease that you
can<00:02:16.720> put<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.050> there<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.349> keep<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.709> nice<00:02:18.010> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
can put in there to keep it nice and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.009 
can put in there to keep it nice and
lubed<00:02:18.459> up<00:02:19.050> once<00:02:20.050> you<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.379> it<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.860> stage

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
lubed up once you have it to that stage

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.680 
lubed up once you have it to that stage
now<00:02:23.019> you're<00:02:23.230> going<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.440> take<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:25.300> actual

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
now you're going to take your actual

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.990 
now you're going to take your actual
lever<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.680> pin<00:02:26.920> I'll<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.519> careful<00:02:27.730> not<00:02:27.940> to

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
lever and the pin I'll be careful not to

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.470 
lever and the pin I'll be careful not to
drop<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.450> pin<00:02:28.720> down<00:02:28.930> into<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.620> snowmobile

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
drop this pin down into the snowmobile

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.600 
drop this pin down into the snowmobile
chassis<00:02:31.739> I'm<00:02:32.739> going<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> kind<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.220> bring<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.430> up

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
chassis I'm going to kind of bring it up

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.820 
chassis I'm going to kind of bring it up
and<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:34.090> here<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:38.349> is<00:02:38.590> pretty

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and over here but this is pretty

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.449 
and over here but this is pretty
straightforward<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.900> take<00:02:40.900> your<00:02:41.110> choke

push<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.360> right<00:02:46.510> up<00:02:46.750> through<00:02:47.019> there<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.970> then

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
push it right up through there and then

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.720 
push it right up through there and then
you'll<00:02:49.750> redirect<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.680> up<00:02:50.860> through<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.430> put

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
you'll redirect it up through and put

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.250 
you'll redirect it up through and put
your<00:02:51.880> pieces<00:02:52.150> back<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.310> that's<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:55.260> all

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
right so here I'm holding it with just a

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.339 
right so here I'm holding it with just a
pair<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.030> needle<00:02:58.299> nose<00:02:58.480> pliers<00:02:58.510> all<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.260> way

pair of needle nose pliers all the way

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.589 
pair of needle nose pliers all the way
out<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.709> extended<00:03:00.220> I'm<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:01.239> slide

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
out and extended I'm just going to slide

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.009 
out and extended I'm just going to slide
that<00:03:01.629> on<00:03:02.079> there<00:03:02.379> and<00:03:02.980> then<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:04.510> work<00:03:04.690> this

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
that on there and then just work this

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:12.150 
that on there and then just work this
pin<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.930> where<00:03:10.440> again<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.829> where<00:03:12.040> it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
pin in to where again this is where it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.009 
pin in to where again this is where it
helps<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.579> have<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.790> second<00:03:13.269> set<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.480> hands<00:03:13.840> if

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
helps to have a second set of hands if

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.110 
helps to have a second set of hands if
you<00:03:14.109> can<00:03:14.290> get<00:03:14.470> somebody<00:03:17.489> okay<00:03:18.489> you<00:03:18.549> also<00:03:18.819> want

you can get somebody okay you also want

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.280 
you can get somebody okay you also want
to<00:03:19.180> make<00:03:19.359> sure<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.930> you<00:03:20.200> put<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.000> throttle

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to make sure that you put the throttle

to make sure that you put the throttle
or<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.680> choke<00:03:24.220> lever<00:03:24.359> down<00:03:25.359> towards<00:03:25.959> this

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
or the choke lever down towards this

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.319 
or the choke lever down towards this
flat<00:03:26.470> edge<00:03:26.739> that's<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.910> correct

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
flat edge that's in the correct

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.390 
flat edge that's in the correct
positioning<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.139> show<00:03:29.319> that<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.709> off<00:03:29.950> you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
positioning to show that it's off you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.670 
positioning to show that it's off you
don't<00:03:30.519> want<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.760> put<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.000> on<00:03:31.090> upside-down<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
don't want to put it on upside-down I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.670 
don't want to put it on upside-down I
almost<00:03:33.489> did<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:34.660> once<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.200> finally<00:03:35.560> get

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
almost did and then once you finally get

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.259 
almost did and then once you finally get
the<00:03:35.829> pin<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> one<00:03:36.639> side<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.239> can

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
the pin in on the one side you can

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.890 
the pin in on the one side you can
simply<00:03:38.190> press<00:03:39.190> it<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.519> there<00:03:39.730> all<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:39.970> way

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.559 

okay<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.260> that's<00:03:44.470> with<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.090> choke<00:03:46.090> lever<00:03:46.120> back

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
okay so that's with the choke lever back

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.330 
okay so that's with the choke lever back
on<00:03:47.639> make<00:03:48.639> sure<00:03:48.669> it<00:03:48.970> functions<00:03:49.269> nicely<00:03:50.340> now

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
on make sure it functions nicely now
