00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
or nine supply you're not going to get

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.720 
or nine supply you're not going to get
that<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.680> scouting<00:00:47.070> information<00:00:47.550> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that much scouting information you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.750 
that much scouting information you're
probably<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> makings<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
probably going to see the makings of a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
probably going to see the makings of a
standard<00:00:50.760> Terran<00:00:51.059> opener<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:52.230> kind

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
standard Terran opener and that's kind

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
standard Terran opener and that's kind
of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> premise<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.370> strategy<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of the premise of this strategy is that

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.510 
of the premise of this strategy is that
versus<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> standard<00:00:55.469> Terran<00:00:55.680> opener<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
versus a standard Terran opener this is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.349 
versus a standard Terran opener this is
fantastic<00:00:58.070> as<00:00:59.070> long<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.789> enemy<00:00:59.910> hasn't

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
fantastic as long as your enemy hasn't

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
fantastic as long as your enemy hasn't
scouted<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.760> if<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.930> red<00:01:04.170> Terran<00:01:04.650> had

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
scouted this so if the red Terran had

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
scouted this so if the red Terran had
maybe<00:01:05.100> scouted<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.240> might<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.659> been

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
maybe scouted this they might have been

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.620 
maybe scouted this they might have been
able<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.020> drop<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> bunker<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.490> or<00:01:08.970> maybe<00:01:09.299> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
able to drop a bunker or or maybe get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950 
able to drop a bunker or or maybe get
some<00:01:09.810> Marauders<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:11.330> they<00:01:12.330> don't<00:01:12.600> see<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
some Marauders out but they don't see it

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.840 
some Marauders out but they don't see it
coming<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.450> why<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.840> works<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
coming and that is why this works so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
coming and that is why this works so
we've<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> supply<00:01:19.140> people<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.799> as

production very early game so that that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.970 
production very early game so that that
kind<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.490> worked<00:02:31.670> out<00:02:31.880> good<00:02:32.150> for<00:02:32.210> us<00:02:32.980> three

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
kind of worked out good for us three

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.330 
kind of worked out good for us three
Marines<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:36.530> did<00:02:36.680> grab<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> command

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

shenanigans<00:02:39.530> didn't<00:02:39.860> work<00:02:41.380> we<00:02:42.380> could<00:02:42.650> have

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
shenanigans didn't work we could have

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.500 
shenanigans didn't work we could have
perhaps<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.490> try<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.730> turtle<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.270> there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
perhaps just try to turtle up there

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.660 
perhaps just try to turtle up there
maybe<00:02:44.780> check<00:02:45.110> up<00:02:45.430> so<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:47.210> being<00:02:47.450> said<00:02:48.430> we<00:02:49.430> do

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
maybe check up so that being said we do

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.910 
maybe check up so that being said we do
have<00:02:49.700> four<00:02:50.540> Marines<00:02:50.900> on<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.140> board<00:02:51.440> we're

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
have four Marines on the board we're

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.140 
have four Marines on the board we're
going<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.130> wait<00:02:52.250> for<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.520> fifth<00:02:52.820> one<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
going to wait for that fifth one and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.190 
going to wait for that fifth one and
then<00:02:53.480> we're<00:02:53.630> just<00:02:53.660> going<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:53.900> go<00:02:54.020> ahead<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
then we're just going to go ahead and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.410 
then we're just going to go ahead and
push<00:02:55.540> reactor<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:57.290> finishing<00:02:58.420> they're

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
push reactor just now finishing they're

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.240 
push reactor just now finishing they're
going<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.780> have<00:02:59.960> to<00:03:00.170> think<00:03:00.470> some<00:03:00.650> units<00:03:00.980> quick

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
going to have to think some units quick

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.900 
going to have to think some units quick
here<00:03:01.520> but<00:03:01.850> it's<00:03:02.300> no<00:03:02.990> matter<00:03:03.200> how<00:03:03.410> quick<00:03:03.770> is<00:03:04.040> not

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
here but it's no matter how quick is not

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.600 
here but it's no matter how quick is not
going<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.180> enough<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.920> that's<00:03:07.400> only

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
going to be enough and that's only

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.060 
going to be enough and that's only
because<00:03:08.090> we<00:03:08.330> absolutely<00:03:08.959> pushed<00:03:09.620> at<00:03:09.920> the

because we absolutely pushed at the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.550 
because we absolutely pushed at the
right<00:03:10.280> time<00:03:10.550> here's<00:03:11.120> five<00:03:11.390> Marines<00:03:11.690> we're

going on here they got two Marines
that's<00:03:16.040> about<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.489> finish<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:17.720> complete

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.740 

they<00:03:24.770> don't<00:03:25.070> decide<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.730> make<00:03:26.239> any<00:03:26.450> more

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
they don't decide to make any more

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.900 
they don't decide to make any more
Marines<00:03:27.650> at<00:03:27.830> that<00:03:27.950> point<00:03:28.250> figuring<00:03:28.640> two<00:03:28.850> is

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
Marines at that point figuring two is

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.720 
Marines at that point figuring two is
enough<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.420> fend<00:03:29.600> off<00:03:29.750> any<00:03:29.959> early<00:03:30.290> aggression

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
enough to fend off any early aggression

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.230 
enough to fend off any early aggression
however<00:03:31.730> they<00:03:32.030> didn't<00:03:32.300> know

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
however they didn't know

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.090 
however they didn't know
