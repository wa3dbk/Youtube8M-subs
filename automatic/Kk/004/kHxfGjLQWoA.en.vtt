00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
 the next product is the Rocket Kulow 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.930
 Stereo Gaming Headset a headset with just a hundred 78 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 I'll show you that this is closer to this good piece 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.710
 and around 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.140
 yes what else is there to say hounder we have 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.460
 attempted agitation to make what is under robust and solid is not the need 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.590
 Just what this headset really can handle and proof 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.290
 here it is probably yourselves you know each other out of the environment 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.750
 Problem that I quickly told Mirow Ben or Jews in the field quickly 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.580
 break then you have to exchange the current Denmark and 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.030
 give back that wobbles Kulow is ultra robust that's what I say now 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.320
 So you can really bend that thing completely because nothing happens 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.960
 you see it already why does not that happen because we're up here with half 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.260
 And have warned and percent of this metal ensures that this headset 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.030
 very high euro-bus is yes we have more pleasant upholstery it is a 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.400
 Goal on Euro or nurturing distorted that I say very briefly 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.880
 So it's kind of like 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 or is now on the ears and I have the microphone that I can 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 fold down that is robust 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.930
 and, of course, a bit flexible so I can tell that before mine 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.180
 Mouth and yes the function and percent or my favorite of CIR 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.960
 Function of the microphone is the automatic Mike now works if breaks 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.090
 Microphone folded up is Isis tempers it's worked it down 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.700
 and has the advantage that one does not talk or that one short time away from the PC 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.910
 gone and come back I have the problem that you talk for ten minutes 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.560
 and percent and how here on the Wii Mote account list suited me and you have one 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.660
 forget to turn it back on 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.100
 is one of my LivingsÂ® features we have relatively simple 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.450
 a simple system to make Dior shells off to clean them 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.049
 and in the easy you can start again 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.909
 the whole headset 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.909
 costs 59 99 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.739
 yes in march available 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.230
 As of April of May, there will never be Victory Point 1 around them once 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.369
 while giving up with an outside job going on by Kate 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.519
 and with almost USB to Klink adapter 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.750
 You may have already seen it, the whole Petzet comes as a Steher version 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:37.459
 Binder 3com a5 jack FÃ¼rth the sound and for the microphone we have 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.000
 relatively small remote control the Slim percent Nistelrooy murder control 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.450
 that has the advantage that is currently not too difficult 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.250
 and pulled down and the here also no things I say times without that 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.539
 you want to change that 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.469
