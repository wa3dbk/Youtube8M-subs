right arm and the overall look of the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.520 
right arm and the overall look of the
figure<00:01:55.989> just<00:01:56.020> isn't<00:01:57.009> really<00:01:57.579> that<00:01:57.610> good<00:01:58.530> it's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
figure just isn't really that good it's

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.149 
figure just isn't really that good it's
just<00:01:59.679> a<00:02:00.009> mess<00:02:00.399> it's<00:02:00.819> very<00:02:01.479> top-heavy

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
just a mess it's very top-heavy

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.709 
just a mess it's very top-heavy
thankfully<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.280> feet<00:02:03.520> are<00:02:03.729> nice<00:02:03.879> and<00:02:03.939> wide<00:02:04.209> so

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
thankfully the feet are nice and wide so

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.330 
thankfully the feet are nice and wide so
you<00:02:04.810> could<00:02:05.110> get<00:02:05.289> poses<00:02:05.770> out<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.039> it<00:02:06.129> but

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
you could get poses out of it but

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.059 
you could get poses out of it but
overall<00:02:07.149> it<00:02:07.509> just<00:02:07.810> isn't<00:02:08.049> good<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.890> isn't

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.460 
overall it just isn't good it isn't
worth<00:02:09.729> really<00:02:10.179> purchasing<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.079> isn't<00:02:11.319> worth

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
worth really purchasing it isn't worth

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.970 
worth really purchasing it isn't worth
really<00:02:12.190> looking<00:02:12.700> at<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.120> can<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.799> get

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
really looking at you can kind of get

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.580 
really looking at you can kind of get
these<00:02:15.190> shoulder<00:02:15.880> bits<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.480> certain<00:02:16.930> ways<00:02:17.170> so

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
these shoulder bits in certain ways so

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.569 
these shoulder bits in certain ways so
that<00:02:17.620> it's<00:02:17.920> less<00:02:18.359> kibble<00:02:19.359> tastic<00:02:19.930> but<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:21.340> gets

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
that it's less kibble tastic but it gets

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.379 
that it's less kibble tastic but it gets
in<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.850> way<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.810> arms<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:24.400> either<00:02:24.760> arms

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
in the way of the arms on either arms

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.539 
in the way of the arms on either arms
and<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.109> doesn't<00:02:26.560> look<00:02:26.680> good<00:02:26.859> I<00:02:27.099> can't

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
and it just it doesn't look good I can't

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.690 
and it just it doesn't look good I can't
recommend<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.269> figure<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:30.220> good

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
recommend this figure it's not good

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.849 
recommend this figure it's not good
looking<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.239> is<00:02:31.510> starting<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.019> flake<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> little

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
looking it is starting to flake a little

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.759 
looking it is starting to flake a little
bit<00:02:33.180> especially<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.420> saw<00:02:34.599> saw<00:02:35.260> blade<00:02:35.560> and

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
bit especially on the saw saw blade and

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.099 
bit especially on the saw saw blade and
the<00:02:36.400> transformation<00:02:37.090> as<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.359> saw<00:02:37.510> isn't<00:02:37.989> all

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
the transformation as you saw isn't all

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.800 
the transformation as you saw isn't all
that<00:02:38.139> fun<00:02:38.440> it's<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.709> very<00:02:38.859> cheetor<00:02:39.400> esque

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that fun it's a very cheetor esque

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.289 
that fun it's a very cheetor esque
transformation<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.130> if<00:02:42.430> you're<00:02:42.880> considering

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
transformation so if you're considering

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.720 
transformation so if you're considering
picking<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.900> one<00:02:43.959> up<00:02:44.139> I<00:02:44.440> wouldn't<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.250> would

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
picking this one up I wouldn't I would

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.339 
picking this one up I wouldn't I would
save<00:02:45.940> your<00:02:46.120> money<00:02:46.389> for<00:02:46.720> something<00:02:46.959> that's<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
save your money for something that's a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.839 
save your money for something that's a
little<00:02:47.530> bit<00:02:47.709> cooler<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.370> little<00:02:48.579> bit<00:02:48.700> more

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
little bit cooler and a little bit more

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.630 
little bit cooler and a little bit more
together

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640
