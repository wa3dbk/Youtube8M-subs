00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.560
 the desktop creates a text 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.190

 there will be a password itself means to do is given 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.750
 it's all 20 minutes 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.140
 mean since 20 minutes is enough 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.650
 a lot of time to wait we are not so long 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:31.300

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:34.470
 after work I will turn on like this 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.930
 it means time I think everyone remembered 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:46.270
 I click start will and and put on 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:53.800
 pause then finally these 20 minutes have passed 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:58.720
 and that means the program went out like me and 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:01.810

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:07.709

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.739
