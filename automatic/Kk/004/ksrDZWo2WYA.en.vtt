00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.960
 good friends welcome the first 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.210
 tutorial 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.210
 launched by konami today friends 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 tutorial number 1 control of the ball 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.490
 and then volution soccer 2014 and we're going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.490
 start looking from this moment 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.310
 as we can observe friends 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.730
 there are certain differences there are certain 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 differences of animations and others 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.020
 ability of movements of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.120
 players but but but 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 always a dog 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 I think it 's pretty much the same 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.030
 essence in mobility as far as 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.030
 player's mobility respects 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.870
 that the above surplus product can not 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.370
 change a lot in that aspect but this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.370
 is a short tutorial for the unemployed 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.550
 anxious waiting for this product alone 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.550
 with 1,014 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.050
 I think it's good to know more or less 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.360
 rumored that we will post a news 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.230
 on the channel page that said that the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.230
 theme of this game 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.820
 it comes out more or less 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.030
 after August 20 or so 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.159
 like 23 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.310
 and let's wait in theory I think 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.189
 yes 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.500
 but you have to see what and what is 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.049
 what good telling that comes out 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.640
 twenty-something you have to take into account that 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.640
 these images that we are seeing 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.550
 A while ago 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.060
 Besides, it is a product 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 before they will deliver us to 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.530
 us in the demo 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.540
 so good boys here is this 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.229
 first pro evolution soccer tutorial 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.229
 2014 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.220
 and good I leave you a question guys 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.660
 what do you think hector these 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.500
 tutorials that come out every year and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.110
 each one 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.430
 have to learn in each version almost 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.020
 one has to learn new things from 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.910
 this product in any but I 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.680
 I imagine that in this version that is coming 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 we are going to have to learn many more 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 things that from the 2012 to 2013 version 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.630
 imagined then the graphics engine are 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.910
 changed the graphic engine and the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.430
 mobilities of the ball and the player are 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.260
 changed 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.540
 so you want it seems you friends are 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.280
 they ask the question today 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.109
 what do you think they have to 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.510
 learn every time a version comes out 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.960
 production different learn again 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.540
 right from the start 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.980
