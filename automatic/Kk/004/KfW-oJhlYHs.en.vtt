all can get a little bit more foreplay

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.710 
all can get a little bit more foreplay
in<00:00:12.990> our<00:00:13.110> life<00:00:13.820> well<00:00:14.820> here's<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.269> its<00:00:15.510> really

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:15.720 
in our life well here's how its really

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.220 
in our life well here's how its really
simple

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
simple

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
simple
and<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.590> best<00:00:16.770> part<00:00:16.980> about<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.340> she

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and the best part about it is she

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.540 
and the best part about it is she
doesn't<00:00:17.789> talk<00:00:18.000> back<00:00:18.980> here's<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> foreplay

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
doesn't talk back here's the foreplay

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.519 
doesn't talk back here's the foreplay
and<00:00:20.730> you're<00:00:20.940> seeing<00:00:21.180> it<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.690> tripod<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and you're seeing it on the tripod that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.260 
and you're seeing it on the tripod that
comes<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> four<00:00:23.100> bar<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.940> got<00:00:24.090> two

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
comes with the four bar so you got two

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.420 
comes with the four bar so you got two
separate<00:00:24.630> SKUs<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.770> don't<00:00:25.980> mix<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.279> up

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
separate SKUs here so don't mix them up

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.359 
separate SKUs here so don't mix them up
but<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.720> popularity<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.350> the<00:00:28.529> four<00:00:28.710> bar<00:00:28.920> we

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
but the popularity of the four bar we

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.910 
but the popularity of the four bar we
wanted<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> incorporate<00:00:30.590> aerial<00:00:31.590> effects

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
wanted to incorporate aerial effects

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.950 
wanted to incorporate aerial effects
beam<00:00:32.130> effects<00:00:32.460> because<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.970> wash<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
beam effects because you have a wash and

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.530 
beam effects because you have a wash and
now<00:00:34.170> you've<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.530> beams<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> basically<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
now you've got beams so basically the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.060 
now you've got beams so basically the
foreplay<00:00:36.930> has<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> hole<00:00:37.470> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> center<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
foreplay has a hole in the center that

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.610 
foreplay has a hole in the center that
will<00:00:38.190> slide<00:00:38.430> onto<00:00:38.640> any<00:00:38.790> tripod<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.469> comes

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
will slide onto any tripod and it comes

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
will slide onto any tripod and it comes
with<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.800> carry<00:00:41.040> bag<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.940> walk<00:00:42.210> into

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
with a carry bag so you can walk into

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.090 
with a carry bag so you can walk into
your<00:00:42.540> gigs<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.200> carrying<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> bag<00:00:43.800> take
