00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.700
 way to the bicentennial we review our history and we find data with 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.189
 very little known facts 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:14.690
 few know that sarmiento run remarkable wilkie roque san martín had 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:15.640
 written 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.040
 a book called making or undoing marketing and had tried to cross the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.089
 andes the reverse 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:22.900
 although the agency told him 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.819
 that there was an hour and a half of delay 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.410
 and I know how you are 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.930
 tarno cease to provide valuable data in any case 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.110
 or the case 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.320
 of this artist 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.120
 that was ahead of its time 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.430
 an artist who was proposed to our national anthem before 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.820
 finally to end up making it seem that everyone accused of being a charlatan 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 and a pure square bla 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.790
 the true story of the Argentine national anthem 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.470
 for men 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.170
 we want to get to glory but only with the mayor's office 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.910
 the interior and 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.390
 street of the mercy ricardo romero 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020

 we have not gone to more 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.950
 I think that we can bring a triumph 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.540
 the result of so many years 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.440
 I needed studied music 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.430
 the constituent national assembly 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.370
 wants this new action to have its own book 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.030
 vicente lopez and plans 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 I wrote some flies 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 and they have entrusted me with Milanese 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.010
 already this morning some ideas 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.010
 the first Andean was very much 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.870
 as 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.690
 Moscow 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.690

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.460
 the last ones are sony and 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.330
 colon 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.330
 there was a very funny mess 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.220
 you do not like it 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.700
 das neves 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.759
 but that and they told me that when it comes to linux they need a catchy song 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.749
 almost everyone remembers 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.019
 yes they are looking for what the English sanchis 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.819
 luckily ghanuchi chris hondros comedy that all day long 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.339
 can stop singing 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:24.539
 after showing 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.079
 As minimum 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.079
 classic terra 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:37.690
 all in one 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.319
 1-1 min 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.099
 never 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.999

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.179
 Bogota 9 Oct 1 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:52.179
 we beg you not to tie Andalusia 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.569
 no no 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.929
 speaking to equality his last days each of us 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 min 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:07.029
 they did not like it either 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.329
 this is the life of those who believe 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.269
 remember that last year something similar had happened to me when I 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.269
 they presented great humiliation 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.809
 or without going further with the presence of several leaders and the rocks found or 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:20.490
 manipulated 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.409
 the injured with the number of notebooks 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.409
 but the challenge is ivm music 

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.269
 that melody that I composed for 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.679
 think you 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.329

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:56.899
 transport 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:58.819
 this number is worth trying 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.049
 my friend the musician blas parera told me that very well that in Spain 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:03.959
 I keep going on 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.419
 Maybe all those losses that the singer suffers someday may come from 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.579
 another way to the public 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.289

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:14.289
