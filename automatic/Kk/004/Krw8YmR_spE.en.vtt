00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 what we are going to learn to do today is like swimming protest 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.130
 santander the pair the program that we are in hama total palmer and it helps us a lot 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.099
 pique you can also see what are the hidden archives of the sea 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.619
 Frechoso hidden for example are these 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.689
 paradise then let's see the total panda that program that we 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:23.720
 what do we need 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.279
 there we were going to give the knot to bind two ways pp of hair torices 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.640
 but in reality 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.550
 well not because we are but cereal 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.700
 in all we are going to do is this for example here and there of the dissents 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 two years 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.020
 components the appearance of the bread herman in the camí by this one 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.040
 It looks like it's a small reverse folder 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.710
 percent the good and we will be able to browse tabs to do it 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.580
 simply chili we have to click on who has to be always he follow what 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.540
 the rest 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.220
 we are going to give you here is a bridge they can experience 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.800
 we can expect from the benefit of the master or we can do it in the best way 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.110
 prepare by drinking mate 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.440
 and this 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.870
 We were going to get to 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.210
 and we are going to see a new window in the same way this this program besides that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.320
 the total palmer has more options or we can open from here from hand 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.340
 we can open that the preferences are at war 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.800
 percent can not be or not a module from here to here 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.730
 the good in several options 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.910
 for example the first one that appears to us served the viewer nothing more than a 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.430
 General aspect 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.300
 percent 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.690
 what is the fánder 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.690
 so that the time in all 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 I want it to be the star spaces 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.810
 1 the four this panta deactivated 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.850
 this 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.130
 well, the viewer simply zone 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.390
 so to speak general view 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 be done before let's say the most practical 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.890
 by the way to rub because for example if we have 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.349
 this 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.039
 what it helps you do 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.199
 p disable the folders that are basket point 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.309
 but others thanks to the proposals point of the sixth 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.540
 saints that appear by a single occult fact 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.099
 from the point of view 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.379
 this 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.760
 this achievement the only thing that saves is the information of how expenses folders 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.079
 before stopping the mac 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.099
 for example if dozens of folders and the master turned off the referral by 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.479
 in this way 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.899
 percent to a lot of people I have made it very tedious to be 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.929
 going back to review the things that can be helped here 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.930
 so do not simply save yourself like I do not have right now when what 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.749
 you and will always stay for more than pledge father municipality of tame colo 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.549
 what I want 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.989
 is going to stay that way that folder 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.229
 in the most important the cost 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.269
 for example percent their compleblanos to make them more active hidden 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 of these pochettino do not appear to you because 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 this other panel secretary to open them 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.420
 we can not select in which if we want to see them or not 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.569
 For example, I tell you this because, as you can see this proposal after 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.469
 and that's where all the files are and sometimes the 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.469
 a lot of work to eliminate them 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.290
 the first foreman is simply a hierarchy of the folders 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.510
 the maximum to do 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.359
 always maximize 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.529
 This is a way to sell this but it shows how to do it 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:38.349
 United 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.259
 for example I will have the bar icon with the menu bar - 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:43.880
 extemporaneous age 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.640
 b I'm not active with you can see it is already deleted I leave it because it is 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.449
 easier to enter that way 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.259
 he knows everything fills the pine forest 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.549
 This is the total finder liquid but if we want to return to the property 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.130
 normal rural we will give 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.130
 let's stay here as you can see and arrested the original appearance 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:10.269
 ethical percent does not have a new life for example eyelash or chairs in 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.439
 the search 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.419
 because he knows it why not to blink 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.069
 but this one in case they want faithful what they are making the hoops for 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.670
 windows because they simply activate it 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.499
 sensitive topics 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:24.860
 percent 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.879
 is proven and cut the context menu 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.809
 well simply 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.809
 then this way appears for example if he wanted 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.669
 the East 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.909
 copy is in that the name what this is to eliminate possibly stopped it 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.099
 cut the tail copy 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.580
 in any way is the most interesting because for example two cards 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.440
 different what one does in order to give them massu command simply the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.820
 led to join is to join the lashes 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.809
 the goalkeeper roberto so you can see it differently as they are 

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:08.339
 so that in that way efe that as now it seems that it is simply more 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.990
 easy because it drags the files that you have from a folder other 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.370
 and it is easier to work for 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.370
 panels go to a lot of people makes it easier 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.439
 i is not good what and what to do to 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.889
 I'll leave you the 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.159
 the file of Indian birds in the description is a painful subject 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.599
 was named once I bought them more 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:33.710
 in sirte 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.710
 percent why this folder that total palmer 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.769
 percent is fine in the two versions that the oldest the 1 point 1 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.379
 3 the fertilizer point 1 11 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.120
 but he could not appreciate that the tennis player 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.930
 for example, we are going to give it double g and it seems to be an act in what we are 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.490
 positives 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.030
 how to install them, you will simply give them here in case you want 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.289
 what he is 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.270
 the installation wizard 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.729
 for being here 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.969
 directly since the icon is in total palmer 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:10.639
 already once the chelis such as here in st 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.819
 you have to do is execute the file appears that he 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.099
 and then maybe you'll have to try to start the 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.879
 the tambourine 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:23.879
 and the other version 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.490
 the other version is the 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.809
 the 1 point 

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.659
 from similar simply urges the 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.909
 and then find out what he is 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.490
 the cereal of which the option 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.229
 and all you have to do is look for 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.229
 the program is also endowed for tracy arn 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.869
 and at the same time it raised up here and here 

00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:52.869
 already rises from wolves that 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.760
 and you're going to give liliana tells me panchana simply give up the two versions 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:00.339
 so that tourists 

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.339
 another thing is that you want signals that 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:06.860
 externally 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.940
 well spend some resources what is the total yahoo fan 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.199
 at the moment of decision 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:16.180
 d 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.830
 for example the clown is consuming what are 118 mexico otherwise 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.860
 things 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.039
 to be able to consume more measures I want you to know about standards 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.989
 it consumes you because they are about 30 30 megabytes but if you do not have 

00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:35.219
 ram memory problems then forward 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:39.679
 and well, I hope you liked the way to navigate 

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:42.699
 forteza years in the film percent 

00:07:42.699 --> 00:07:43.800
 good thank you
