00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
hardware cloth you know he's got the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.979 
hardware cloth you know he's got the
door<00:00:36.450> right<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.219> mean<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.989> like

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.190 
door right here I mean and for like
predator<00:00:40.530> proof<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.070> he<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.200> round

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
predator proof and he put this round

predator proof and he put this round
what's<00:00:43.440> pretty<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:43.829> idea

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
what's pretty good idea

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.690 
what's pretty good idea
you<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.710> put<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.150 

so<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.030> holds<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.010> then

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so and that holds it up you know so then

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.310 
so and that holds it up you know so then
you<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.270> way<00:00:54.420> around<00:00:54.570> both

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
you do that all the way around both

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.410 
you do that all the way around both
sides<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.949> thing<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
sides of this thing and you know that's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080 
sides of this thing and you know that's
that's<00:00:58.410> pretty<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:59.340> good<00:00:59.520> for<00:00:59.789> predator

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that's pretty pretty good for predator

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.280 
that's pretty pretty good for predator
proof<00:01:00.329> weasels<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.140> stuff<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> guess<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.489> um<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
proof weasels and stuff I guess but um a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.390 
proof weasels and stuff I guess but um a
really<00:01:04.290> neat<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.830> about<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:07.220> like<00:01:08.220> right

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
really neat thing about this like right

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.890 
really neat thing about this like right
here<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.270> side<00:01:09.450> thing<00:01:09.479> right

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
here see this little side thing right

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
here see this little side thing right
here<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.680> where<00:01:10.860> speed<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:14.240> fancy<00:01:15.240> doesn't

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
here is where speed is fancy doesn't

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.370 
here is where speed is fancy doesn't
wanna<00:01:16.520> time<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> bucket
