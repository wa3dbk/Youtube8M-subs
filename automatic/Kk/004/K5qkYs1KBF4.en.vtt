buying and selling websites so if you

buying and selling websites so if you
guys<00:00:36.270> want<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> take<00:00:37.020> advantage<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.710> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
guys want to take advantage of this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
guys want to take advantage of this
opportunity<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.449> starts<00:00:40.109> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
opportunity you know how this starts so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.829 
opportunity you know how this starts so
maybe<00:00:41.219> if<00:00:41.339> we<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.489> dive<00:00:41.820> straight<00:00:42.329> into<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
maybe if we just dive straight into a

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.509 
maybe if we just dive straight into a
short<00:00:43.289> let's<00:00:43.530> go<00:00:43.649> straight<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.339> meat

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
short let's go straight into the meat

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.329 
short let's go straight into the meat
and<00:00:44.839> perhaps<00:00:45.839> I<00:00:46.260> suppose<00:00:46.620> there's<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.010> sides

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
and perhaps I suppose there's two sides

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.459 
and perhaps I suppose there's two sides
to<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.640> coin<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.390> dying<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.109> then<00:00:49.230> there's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
to this coin is dying and then there's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.310 
to this coin is dying and then there's
selling<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.309> domain<00:00:50.730> names<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.749> yeah

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
selling of domain names so yeah

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
selling of domain names so yeah

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
you've got or example yeah we're not

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.220 
you've got or example yeah we're not
supposed<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.820> doing<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.270> and<00:03:50.510> due<00:03:51.080> diligence

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
supposed to doing this and due diligence

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.720 
supposed to doing this and due diligence
the<00:03:51.650> main<00:03:51.770> thing<00:03:51.950> obviously<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.459> don't<00:03:52.580> want

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
the main thing obviously you don't want

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.670 
the main thing obviously you don't want
to<00:03:52.940> get<00:03:53.150> duped<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.080> think<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.410> was<00:03:54.500> one<00:03:54.650> of

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
to get duped and I think that was one of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.170 
to get duped and I think that was one of
the<00:03:54.800> good<00:03:54.920> things<00:03:55.130> about<00:03:55.220> flipper<00:03:55.820> with

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
the good things about flipper with

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.730 
the good things about flipper with
especially<00:03:56.660> with<00:03:56.810> building<00:03:57.440> up<00:03:57.530> these

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
especially with building up these

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.820 
especially with building up these
profiles<00:03:58.520> and<00:03:59.030> having<00:03:59.690> trust<00:04:00.260> rank<00:04:00.560> and

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
profiles and having trust rank and

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.760 
profiles and having trust rank and
different<00:04:01.190> things<00:04:01.370> like<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:02.660> I<00:04:03.020> suppose

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
different things like that so I suppose

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.470 
different things like that so I suppose
there's<00:04:04.010> less<00:04:04.250> chance<00:04:04.280> of<00:04:04.790> getting<00:04:04.850> duped<00:04:05.270> if

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
there's less chance of getting duped if

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.850 
there's less chance of getting duped if
you<00:04:05.570> go<00:04:05.720> for<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.990> seller<00:04:06.230> who<00:04:06.350> has<00:04:06.590> proven

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
you go for a seller who has proven

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.980 
you go for a seller who has proven
themselves<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.610> few<00:04:07.820> times<00:04:08.060> before<00:04:08.300> yeah

tough question how do you value a

tough question how do you value a
website<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.110> there's<00:06:12.229> a<00:06:12.260> lot<00:06:12.410> of<00:06:12.500> factors<00:06:12.880> if

website and there's a lot of factors if

a site has revenue and profit there's a

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.170 
a site has revenue and profit there's a
general<00:06:18.500> rule<00:06:18.620> of<00:06:18.680> thumb<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.310> it's<00:06:19.850> a<00:06:19.970> very

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
general rule of thumb and it's a very

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.080 
general rule of thumb and it's a very
very<00:06:20.390> loose<00:06:20.570> one<00:06:20.919> usually<00:06:21.919> looking<00:06:22.250> at<00:06:22.520> any

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
very loose one usually looking at any

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.050 
very loose one usually looking at any
index<00:06:23.390> of<00:06:23.510> ten<00:06:23.720> per<00:06:24.050> month<00:06:24.260> so<00:06:24.590> take<00:06:25.520> what<00:06:25.850> the

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
index of ten per month so take what the

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.140 
index of ten per month so take what the
site<00:06:26.270> is<00:06:26.630> using<00:06:27.220> per<00:06:28.220> months<00:06:28.520> multiply<00:06:28.970> that

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
site is using per months multiply that

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.440 
site is using per months multiply that
by<00:06:29.210> ten<00:06:29.740> and<00:06:30.740> it<00:06:31.310> will<00:06:31.400> give<00:06:31.550> you<00:06:31.669> a<00:06:31.880> very<00:06:32.180> very

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
by ten and it will give you a very very

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.659 
by ten and it will give you a very very
rough<00:06:32.780> indication

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
rough indication

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.450 
rough indication
the<00:06:33.939> value<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.240> the<00:06:34.360> side<00:06:34.830> there<00:06:35.830> we<00:06:35.979> plenty<00:06:36.370> of

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
the value of the side there we plenty of

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.429 
the value of the side there we plenty of
high<00:06:36.610> high-end<00:06:37.120> investors<00:06:37.840> out<00:06:37.990> there<00:06:38.020> that

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:38.439 
high high-end investors out there that

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.580 
high high-end investors out there that
that<00:06:39.249> wouldn't<00:06:40.240> agree<00:06:40.990> with<00:06:41.199> me

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
that wouldn't agree with me

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.350 
that wouldn't agree with me
and<00:06:41.979> that's<00:06:42.219> why<00:06:42.340> I<00:06:42.370> say<00:06:42.550> it's<00:06:42.669> a<00:06:42.699> very<00:06:42.729> loose

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 
and that's why I say it's a very loose

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.040 
and that's why I say it's a very loose
rule<00:06:43.749> of<00:06:43.870> thumb<00:06:44.080> um<00:06:45.090> but<00:06:46.090> certainly<00:06:46.419> this<00:06:46.749> the

through that sense then then focus on

sure you do YouTube diligence to make

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.200 
sure you do YouTube diligence to make
sure<00:07:17.469> it<00:07:17.770> is<00:07:18.219> actually<00:07:18.520> getting<00:07:18.669> the<00:07:18.819> traffic

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
sure it is actually getting the traffic

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.920 
sure it is actually getting the traffic
that<00:07:19.360> the<00:07:19.509> sales<00:07:19.719> is<00:07:20.129> because<00:07:21.129> you<00:07:21.219> know<00:07:21.340> their

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
that the sales is because you know their

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.350 
that the sales is because you know their

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 
traffic is is something that you can

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.170 
traffic is is something that you can
monetize<00:07:25.770> and<00:07:26.770> that's<00:07:27.339> where<00:07:27.550> I<00:07:27.580> guess<00:07:27.969> this

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180
